40|$|This paper empirically {{evaluates the}} impact of the US Advanced Technology Program-sponsored consortia on the ex-post {{research}} productivity of participating firms. We find that there is a positive association between the intensity of participation in research consortia and the overall research productivity of participants. We also find a positive impact of consortia on the research productivity of participants in the <b>technological</b> <b>areas</b> <b>targeted</b> by the consortia. This positive impact is higher when the average technological proximity of participants is high. There is evidence that large, R&D intensive firms tend to benefit more from participation in consortia. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} satisfy the {{requirement}} of optical system positioning in SG-III facility, the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> support system should provide a stable platform for optical elements. The <b>target</b> <b>area</b> support system includes a rectangular <b>target</b> <b>area</b> building, <b>target</b> chamber support structures and a switchyard steel frame. The vibrational stability of the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> support system will be achieved {{through a combination of}} structure design, large modal damping material, and friction dampers. Finite element analysis has been used to evaluate the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> support system. The rotation drifts of the transport mirrors, the translation drifts of the focal lenses, and the translation drift of the target are obtained. The orientation errors of each beam in <b>target</b> <b>area</b> system are less than 12. 9 µm based on the relation between the beam orientation error and optics elements drifts. And the safety factors are 1. 44 to 2. 3. The design of the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> support system has satisfied the stability requirements...|$|R
30|$|Initial {{location}} of the node generator determines if sensors start moving {{from the corner of}} the given <b>target</b> <b>area,</b> from the center, or from a random position. In addition, based on the initial position, mobile sensors determine the location for them to be deployed within the initial {{location of}} the <b>target</b> <b>area.</b> Node agent manages mobile sensors and ensures that sensors move, avoiding obstacles in the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> based on the coverage algorithm suggested in Section 3, maintaining the degree K and maximizing the coverage. If force, which was generated by sensor to find the results that the sensors in MSNS moved to cover a proper <b>target</b> <b>area,</b> is equal to or less than a critical value, the node agent stops MSNS from operating. Interaction interface refers to the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> in the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> manager and refers to obstacles in the map layer manager. The initial location of sensors in the node generator is set outside of obstacles and outside of polygon. When sensors in the node agent move, they avoid obstacles in the <b>target</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R

40|$|THE STORY IN BRIEF: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if prescribed cattle grazing could be used to improve pronghorn habitat without fencing. Seven of 87 cows were tracked with global positioning system (GPS) collars for 6 weeks in the summer of 2006. These cows were herded to 20 -ha (50 -acre) <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> that were at least 2. 2 km (1. 4 miles) from water and contained decadent vegetation. Cows were herded daily for half of the study and weekly the remainder of the study. Low-moisture block supplement was placed in <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> Twenty pronghorn were fitted with very-high frequency (VHF) radio collars and visually observed from May 2006 through December 2006. Cattle spent more time (P = 0. 002) within <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> (14. 9 ± 1. 8 %) than control areas (0. 3 ± 1. 8 %). Fecal abundance of cattle was greater (P = 0. 06) within the <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> than in the control indicating higher preference for the <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> Daily herding was more successful than herding once per week (P = 0. 05) in holding cattle within the <b>target</b> <b>areas.</b> Cattle readily stayed in or near <b>target</b> <b>areas</b> during the first 3 weeks when the study area faced severe drought conditions. During the second 3 weeks, the study site received above average rainfall, and cattle spent less time near <b>target</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

30|$|In this article, a new {{simulator}}, mobile {{sensor network}} simulator (MSNS), is designed and implemented. From a user, MSNS receives {{the information on}} the number of mobile sensor nodes, connectivity degree, sensor node's sensing range, communication range, and supersonic wave range. In the simulator, the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> is set when a user designates a random area where obstacles are set by using GML (Geography Markup Language). A number of sensors input by the user are randomly deployed in the <b>target</b> <b>area,</b> and they move to avoid obstacles while maximizing the coverage in the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> and maintaining the given connectivity. MSNS visualizes the location information of sensor nodes, connectivity degree, and sensing coverage, all of which change with simulation-time. It can be used to find out the coverage rate of the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> secured by the given mobile sensors. Thereby we can estimate how many nodes are required in a given <b>target</b> <b>area,</b> and also calculate coverage rate of the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> in advance to the real deployment of mobile sensors.|$|R

40|$|In {{the phantom}} {{illumination}} illusion, luminance ramps ranging from black to white induce a brightness enhancement on an otherwise homogeneous dark background. The {{strength of the}} illusion was tested {{with regard to the}} extension of the brightness inducing perimeter, surrounding the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> by manip-ulating the number of inducers (exp. 1) {{and the size of the}} inducers (exp. 2). Participants’ task was to rate the difference in brightness between the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> and the background. Results show that the illusion occurs only when the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> is not completely segregated from the background by luminance ramps; vice versa, when the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> is delimited by a continuous gradient, it appears darker than the back- ground. These findings suggest a major role of figure-ground organization in the appearance of the illu- sion. This hypothesis was tested in a rating task experiment with three types of <b>target</b> <b>area</b> shapes circumscribed by four types of edges: luminance contours, illusory contours, no contours, and ambiguous contours. Illusory contours, just as luminance contours, hinder the illusion and produce a darkening of the <b>target</b> <b>area.</b> A control experiment measured the brightness of the previous stimuli without luminance ramps: all configurations resulted in a darkening of the <b>target</b> <b>area.</b> Results from all experiments suggest that figure-ground segmentation plays a major role in the determination of both illumination and light- ness in stimuli with luminance gradients...|$|R

The <b>target</b> <b>area</b> is required to meet a challenging set of engineering system design requirements and user needs. The <b>target</b> <b>area</b> must provide the appropriate conditions before, during, and after each shot. The repeated introduction of large amounts of laser energy into the chamber and subsequent target emissions represent new design challenges for ICF facility design. Prior to each shot, the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> must provide the required target illumination, target chamber vacuum, diagnostics, and optically stable structures. During the shot, {{the impact of the}} target emissions on the target chamber, diagnostics, and optical elements is minimized and the workers and public are protected from excessive prompt radiation doses. After the shot, residual radioactivation is managed to allow the required accessibility. Diagnostic data is retrieved, operations and maintenance activities are conducted, and the facility is ready for the next shot. The <b>target</b> <b>area</b> subsystems include the target chamber, target positioner, structural systems, target diagnostics, environmental systems, and the final optics assembly. The engineering design of the major elements of the <b>target</b> <b>area</b> requires a unique combination of precision engineering, structural analysis, opto-mechanical design, random vibration suppression, thermal stability, materials engineering, robotics, and optical cleanliness.
