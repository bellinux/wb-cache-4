He had human characteristics, and {{although}} some say that {{he lives in the}} sky or in the clouds, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> that he comes to earth {{from time to time to}} inspect it, bestow blessings and mete out punishment. When he comes he rests on Mount Kenya and four other sacred mountains. Thunder is interpreted to be the movement of God, and lightning is God's weapon by means of which he clears the way when moving from one sacred place to another.|$|E

Hales {{says that if}} one's standards of certainty leads them to say [...] "there is never 'proof' of non-existence", then <b>they</b> must <b>also</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "there is never 'proof' of existence either".

25|$|There is a {{constant}} public debate about tracking students by ability into several types of secondary school (i.e. Gymnasium, Realschule and Hauptschule). Opponents of streaming by ability claim that streaming is unfair, that parents from higher socio-economic groups are more effective in sending children of similar aptitude to higher-level schools (Gymnasium). Proponents of streaming claim that it limits income segregation {{between rich and poor}} areas, as wealthier parents in poor neighborhoods may still send their gifted children to a fairly good public school due to streaming, giving them less motivation to move to a wealthier area. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> that potential access to a Selective school would allow gifted children of lower-class parents living in poor neighborhoods better educational opportunities than if they were confined to schools with the average pupil population of their neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|Opposition due to {{the safety}} of the vaccine has been {{addressed}} through studies, leaving opposition focused on the sexual implications of the vaccine to remain. Conservative groups in the U.S. have opposed the concept of making HPV vaccination mandatory for pre-adolescent girls, asserting that making the vaccine mandatory is a violation of parental rights. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> that it will lead to early sexual activity, giving a false sense of immunity to sexually transmitted disease. (See Peltzman effect) Both the Family Research Council and the group Focus on the Family support widespread (universal) availability of HPV vaccines but oppose mandatory HPV vaccinations for entry to public school. Parents also express confusion over recent mandates for entry to public school pointing out that HPV is transmitted through sexual contact, not through attending school with other children.|$|E
25|$|The unusual {{lifestyle}} and growth pattern of Kiryas Joel {{has led to}} litigation {{on a number of}} fronts. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet that the Kiryas Joel school district, which covered only the village, was designed in violation of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment, because the design accommodated one group on the basis of religious affiliation. Subsequently, the New York State Legislature established a similar school district in the village that has passed legal muster. Further litigation has resulted over what entity should pay for the education of children with disabilities in Kiryas Joel, and over whether the community's boys must ride buses driven by women. A case against the village is currently pending in federal district court; plaintiffs, who are asking for the village to be dissolved, say that Kiryas Joel is a theocracy whose existence violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, where local government leaders abuse the laws, such as those for tax-exempt status, zoning, and sanitation, to favor members of their own sect and persecute other Orthodox Jews. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> that the leaders commit vote fraud by intimidating dissident voters and busing in non-residents.|$|E

Her street-tough image is powerful—she and her dancers wore ripped jeans and leather vests, like a sleeked-up girl gang—but her delivery was unfocused, and she didn't seem to be enjoying herself.

25|$|The Central Tibetan Administration {{also says}} that {{millions}} of Chinese immigrants to the TAR are diluting the Tibetans both culturally and through intermarriage. Exile groups say that despite recent attempts to restore the appearance of original Tibetan culture to attract tourism, the traditional Tibetan {{way of life is}} now irrevocably changed. It is also reported that when Hu Yaobang, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, visited Lhasa in 1980 he was unhappy when he found out the region was behind neighbouring provinces. Reforms were instituted, and since then the central government's policy in Tibet has granted most religious freedoms. But monks and nuns are still sometimes imprisoned, and many Tibetans (mostly monks and nuns) continue to flee Tibet yearly. At the same time, many Tibetans believe projects that the PRC implement to benefit Tibet, such as the China Western Development economic plan or the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, are politically motivated actions to consolidate central control over Tibet by facilitating militarization and Han Chinese migration while benefiting few Tibetans; they also believe the money funneled into cultural restoration projects as being aimed at attracting foreign tourists. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> that there is still preferential treatment awarded to Han Chinese in the labor market as opposed to Tibetans.|$|E

500|$|The International Transport Workers' Federation goes further, {{stating that}} flags of {{convenience}} [...] "provide {{a means of}} avoiding labor regulation {{in the country of}} ownership, and become a vehicle for paying low wages and forcing long hours of work and unsafe working conditions. Since FOC ships have no real nationality, they are beyond the reach of any single national seafarers' trade union." [...] <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> that these ships have low safety standards and no construction requirements, that they [...] "do not enforce safety standards, minimum social standards or trade union rights for seafarers", that they frequently fail to pay their crews, have poor safety records, and engage in practices such as abandoning crewmen in distant ports.|$|E
500|$|Japanese {{films such}} as Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress {{influenced}} the original Star Wars film; scholars say that The Phantom Menace was likewise influenced by Korean and Japanese culture. Film historians Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska write, [...] "The costume and make-up designs...favour a mixture of the gothic and the oriental [...] over anything very futuristic. The gothic is most strongly apparent in Darth Maul's demonic horns and the red and black make-up mask that borrows from the facial designs found in depictions of Japanese demons". King and Krzywinska say that [...] "Qui-Gon's pony tail and Obi-Wan's position of apprentice further encourage a reading {{in terms of the}} Samurai tradition". <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Amidala, in keeping with her status and character, has a number of highly formal outfits...to go with hair sculpted into a curve that frames make-up of a Japanese cast".|$|E
