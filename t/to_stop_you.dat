500|$|Christianity – that is, the {{religion}} of the Bible – is the only scheme or form of belief which disavows any possessions on such a tenure. Here alone all is free. You may fly {{to the ends of the}} world and find no God but the Author of Salvation. You may search the Scriptures and not find a text <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> in your explorations. ...|$|E
2500|$|... 10 December 2013: Ingush {{opposition}} leader Magomed Khazbiev, {{who was a}} close friend of assassinated Magomed Yevloyev, attends Euromaidan in Ukraine and participates in anti-Russian campaign there after which his parents were threatened and harassed in Russia. On his website he writes: [...] "the fact that Putin's slaves harass my parents do not make any sense, if you [...] want me <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> have to kill me like Magomed Yevloyev and Makhsharip Aushev".|$|E
2500|$|During {{talks with}} Thatcher, China planned to invade and seize Hong Kong if the {{negotiations}} set off unrest in the colony. Thatcher later said that Deng told her bluntly that China could easily take Hong Kong by force, stating that [...] "I could {{walk in and}} take the whole lot this afternoon", to which she replied that [...] "there is nothing I could do <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you,</b> but {{the eyes of the}} world would now know what China is like".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} of the single, for the NME, Derek Johnson admired McCartney's {{performance}} and the lyrics' [...] "pseudo-religious" [...] qualities. Although he considered that the melody paled beside some of the band's previous singles, Johnson added: [...] "As ever with The Beatles, this is a record <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> dead in your tracks and compel you to listen attentively." [...] John Gabree of High Fidelity magazine found the lyrics [...] "dangerous politically", but viewed the song as possibly [...] "the best thing musically that McCartney has done".|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, the BBC {{soap opera}} EastEnders caused {{controversy}} when the character Minty Peterson (played by Cliff Parisi) made {{a reference to}} the disaster. During the episode car mechanic Minty said: [...] "Five years out of Europe because of Heysel, because they penned you lot in <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> fighting on the pitch and then what did we end up with? Hillsborough." [...] This prompted 380 complaints and the BBC apologised, saying that the character was simply reminding another character, former football hooligan Jase Dyer, that the actions of hooligans led to the fencing-in of football fans. Ofcom also received 177 complaints.|$|E
2500|$|A Cavalier {{that won}} a Best-in-Show was {{revealed}} by Carter {{to have the}} condition. (One {{and a half months}} after the programme aired, Carter was removed from the Cavalier Club Committee for this [...] "breach of confidentiality".) Despite veterinarian advice not to breed from the dog, the dog went on to sire 26 litters, adding to the 8 litters sired before the diagnosis. Dr. Claire Rusbridge expressed her incredulity: [...] "If you took a stick and you beat a dog to create this pain that you could get from Syringomyelia, you'd be prosecuted, but there's nothing <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> from breeding a dog that can be painful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I imagine it's {{lucky that}} you knew me," [...] Gordon remarked, rather dryly. [...] "Well, perhaps we ought <b>to</b> have <b>stopped</b> <b>you</b> {{at the other end}} of the wood." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{went to the}} shack, {{and while}} they were at dinner Festing asked: [...] "How did you persuade Jim Brown <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> until <b>you</b> fired the shot?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} you'll urge me <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> when <b>you</b> have heard my tale," [...] he said. [...] "However, is Mr. Austin or Mr. Jefferson at home?" ...|$|R
2500|$|This was {{the first}} song that Kelly had penned from a woman's point of view – he was {{initially}} hesitant to sing it himself fearing {{that it would not}} sound [...] "honest". Kelly had tried to persuade female singers to adopt it but his band encouraged him to keep it for themselves, [...] "'Don't give this [...] one away', said , 'we can do it.' 'Yeah,' chipped in [...] '...What's <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> cross-singing?'". Paul Kelly and the Messengers first performed it at a Leagues Club on the central New South Wales coast – after several gigs Kelly felt perfectly normal singing it. Kelly liked Barclay's backing vocals as they [...] "sounded sweet" [...] and Connolly [...] "had written a killer guitar riff to kick things off". Kelly enjoyed cross-singing and wrote both [...] "Everything's Turning to White" [...] and [...] "South of Germany" [...] from a woman's perspective – these tracks also appear on So Much Water So Close to Home.|$|E
6000|$|... “To be sure. I {{remember}} bounding up again. I—I didn’t care <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>you</b> see. I {{was anxious}} to—to—see if baby Jane was all right.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we will, of course, excuse you," [...] she said. [...] "You will, I hope, {{not think}} it very inconsiderate of me <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, Pan, <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> kiddin' <b>you,</b> now an' then a fellar sees a real hoss {{among them}} broomies. But shore them boys are the hard ones to ketch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I got struck myself,” said Dave. “But it didn’t {{amount to}} much. I told <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> If <b>you</b> had done so, we wouldn’t {{have gotten into}} this pickle.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Wolf looked thoughtful. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> until <b>you</b> {{know the}} country and the Spanish merchants, but I might help you by and by. We'll talk about it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My wonder," [...] said Jenny, indignantly, [...] "would be {{what right}} they had <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you.</b> This was private interference, {{not from the}} Vicar or the committee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Master Charles, I {{have some}} very bad news, and {{have been waiting for}} the last two hours here, so as <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> going to the house." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> {{are going}} <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> Bertie, <b>you</b> had better {{go back and}} fetch a blanket, it is chilly here; then if you like you can doze off again till your watch comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Horton with undiminished gravity. [...] "You're going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> where <b>you</b> are, like lawful citizens, {{because there}} are enough of us to make you if you don't want to." ...|$|R
6000|$|The bushman grinned sardonically, and Clavering's {{fears were}} confirmed. [...] "You're that pretty I wouldn't {{lose sight of}} you for a hundred," [...] he said. [...] "No, sir; you're going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> where <b>you</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{been done}} already," [...] {{observed}} the major calmly. [...] "Lynched for horse-stealing in '66. However, go on, and I'll promise not <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> {{until you have}} finished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, if I thought I {{had done}} {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> from offering {{that sort of}} helpfulness which makes you a blessing to everybody, I should never forgive myself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I'd make {{a pretty}} good {{district}} attorney,' he said, disarming possible resentment at this cross-examination. 'I guess you're wondering if I'm ever going <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> asking <b>you</b> questions. Well, {{what would you like}} to do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” the man said, “it {{was your}} own fault; we told <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> Anyhow, <b>you</b> had better keep still a bit. If you’re here {{when we come}} back, we’ll {{see what we can}} do.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} {{something}} {{would happen to}} you," [...] he growled, [...] "and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you.</b> I never saw a person climb in such an utterly absurd way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. You sprained it to-morrow after breakfast. It was bad luck. I {{wonder how}} {{you came to}} do it. You didn't sprain it much, but just enough <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you</b> playing billiards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you {{understand}} that I did not dare <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>you?</b> What you are doing is so mad {{that it may be}} quite true. Somehow one can never really manage to be an atheist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At last {{you have}} come back!" [...] he said; [...] "I was {{determined}} <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> till <b>you</b> did, if I stayed all day. Is anything the matter? Have you got into some worse difficulty than ever?" ...|$|R
