500|$|James Madigan, {{the visual}} effects supervisor, {{approached}} the series as a feature film, observing that [...] "every {{aspect of the}} production took meticulous care with every detail, the costumes, the set dressing, the acting, and the attention to historical fact. As you worked on it, you really got the feeling that Rome was {{going to look like}} something we had never seen on TV before, so our vfx approach very much wanted to respect that." [...] Madigan attempted to seamlessly mesh the visual effects with the physical sets and depend less on CGI. A friend told Madigan that after seeing the pilot, [...] "he didn’t see any vfx shots, even though there are dozens of shots throughout episode 1. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>we</b> did our job well." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{responded by}} saying: [...] "Everybody has {{the freedom to}} make a judgement. In the last 20 minutes of every game last season, we were never behind. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>we</b> had already done the job before." [...] He insisted the draws did not reflect on his team's {{negative}} tactics, but [...] "because of other teams coming back into the game". On the issue of Patrick Vieira's anticipated move to Real Madrid, Wenger told reporters the player would remain at Arsenal. Wenger acknowledged his team were short on experience {{as a result of}} selling players and missing Vieira, Sol Campbell and Thierry Henry, who all were injured. He considered this to be a disadvantage, but argued [...] "...the younger ones have to be given a chance. They all have to take some responsibility." ...|$|E
500|$|In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed {{his pledge}} {{to work toward}} diminished {{reliance}} on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because {{there was still a}} federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, [...] "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress." [...] Bush had said in June 2008, [...] "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>we</b> need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2016, Mappa Producer Masao Maruyama Said in an interview: [...] "For 4~5 years, I kept {{searching for}} a {{suitable}} director to complete Kon's work. Before his death, the storyboard and script, even part of the keyframe film was already completed. Then I thought, even if someone can mimic Kon's work, {{it would still be}} clear that it's only an imitation. For example, if Mamoru Hosoda took the director's position, the completed Dreaming Machine would still be a good piece of work. However, that would make it Hosoda's movie, not Kon's. Dreaming Machine should be Kon's movie, him and only him, not someone else's. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>we</b> cannot and should not [...] "compromise" [...] only to finish it. I spent years to finally reach this hard conclusion. Instead, we should take only Kon's [...] "original concept", and let somebody turn it into a feature film. By doing so, the completed piece could 100% be that person's work, and I'm OK with that. I also considered about doing a documentary of Kon." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a turn of events, a {{settlement}} was reached between Infinity and the FCC that dismissed all outstanding indecency cases on September 1, 1995. Infinity {{agreed to make}} two payments totaling $1.715 million to the United States Treasury as a [...] "voluntary contribution" [...] while its five indecency NALs were cleared from the FCC's record. An additional $9,000 was given to settle all pending complaints. Though Infinity admitted no wrongdoing in the agreement, Stern accused the FCC of extortion, and called the payout [...] "the biggest shakedown in history... the bullies have won. I lost. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>we</b> all lost." [...] Stern, however, praised his employer. [...] "They fought {{as long as they}} could. Honestly, I don't know what I would have done in their shoes... they got jerked around plenty." [...] With its clean record with the FCC, Infinity announced on September 22, 1995 the purchase of seven radio stations owned by Alliance Broadcasting for $275 million that expanded its number of outlets to 34. The Howard Stern Show was syndicated to 26 stations across the country by December 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the support}} for the Quantification Settlement Agreement has been {{associated}} with government agencies, on both the state and federal level. Numerous government agencies produced press releases that touted the benefits of the agreement. Many of these releases noted that this was the largest water transfer agreement in American history. Although residents of the Imperial Valley have been the main opponents of this measure, some observers have embraced the agreement, arguing that it is the most realistic and pragmatic solution to the water crisis in the area. Brad Jennings, a tentative supporter of the agreement, notes that [...] "There are things most agree on: The Salton Sea must be saved. No matter how you feel about water transfers you know that a dead Sea would be an environmental disaster for us. And our water rights and water allotment must be protected. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>we</b> may have to give some up, which is what the QSA was designed to do." [...] He also argued that the measure would likely prevent federal intervention, a concern of many residents of the Imperial Valley.|$|E
