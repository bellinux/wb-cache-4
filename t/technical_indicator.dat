40|$|Academic {{research}} relies {{extensively on}} macroeconomic variables to forecast the U.

Our paper fills this gap by comparing the predictive ability of <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> with that of macroeconomic variables. <b>Technical</b> <b>indicators</b> display statistically and economically significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power, matching or exceeding that of macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> and macroeconomic variables provide complementary information over the business cycle: <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> better detect the typical decline in the equity risk premium near business-cycle peaks, whereas macroeconomic variables more readily pick up the typical rise in the equity risk premium near cyclical troughs. Consistent with this behavior, we show that combining information from both <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> and macroeconomic variables significantly improves equity risk premium forecasts versus using either type of information alone. Overall, the substantial counter cyclical fluctuations in the equity risk premium appear well captured by the combined information in <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> and macroeconomic variables...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} five {{commonly used}} <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> and their performance on five stocks listed at the Stockholm Stock Exchange {{during the time}} period January 2010 – March 2016. The research aims {{to see if the}} <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> can predict return in the upcoming period and also compare the profitability of the indicators versus the buy and hold strategy. Simple OLS regressions are used to analyze whether the different <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> are statistically significant for return in the upcoming period. The predictive ability of the <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> is overall quite poor as few of the indicators prove to be statistically significant. When comparing return per week invested between the examined <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> versus the buy and hold strategy, results find that the buy and hold strategy outperforms the Moving Average and the Moving Average Cross-Over indicator while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence and the Combined indicator provides higher average return per invested week {{for the majority of the}} stocks. These slightly contradictory results make it hard to determine whether weak form efficiency holds on Stockholm Stock Exchange and are much in line with the mixed results from earlier research made on other stock markets...|$|R

This paper extends the work presented on previous works by including additional indicators and applying them to more complex problems. In this way the Moving Averages Convergence-Divergence (MACD) indicator and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) oscillator have been selected to obtain the buying/selling signals. The experimental results indicate that our EAs offer {{a solution to the problem}} obtaining results that improve those obtained through <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> with their standard parameters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a performance evaluation of stock picking by merging several <b>technical</b> <b>indicators.</b> Several fusion operators {{have been proposed}} either in the probabilistic or in the possibilistic framework. The latter fuzzy framework has been introduced to manage the uncertain information embedded in financial time series due to human biases as studied by behavioral finance. Performances of portfolio resulting from the proposed systems, are evaluated according to cumulative returns but also through a risk analysis point of view (Sharpe ratio). Two fusion mechanisms (one probabilistic, one possibilistic) aiming at discriminating common information from merged <b>technical</b> <b>indicators,</b> produce the higher portfolio performances. It also appears that selecting specific <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> affects the overall performances of the proposed stock picking systems. Indeed, studying the <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> selection through a shared/non shared information point of view, reveals possibilistic framework is more robust to redundant sources than probabilistic framework. Effects of some parameters used in the fusion algorithms (amount of assets, window length analysis,...) are also investigated. Results from all these tests clearly show the high potentiality of <b>technical</b> <b>indicators</b> fusion to improve portfolio performances. However, these first promising results have to be further inspected within wider contexts, as discussed {{at the end of}} the paper...|$|R

50|$|The true {{strength}} index (TSI) is a <b>technical</b> <b>indicator</b> used in {{the analysis}} of financial markets that attempts to show both trend direction and overbought/oversold conditions. It was first published William Blau in 1991.The indicator uses moving averages of the underlying momentum of a financial instrument. Momentum is considered a leading indicator of price movements, and a moving average characteristically lags behind price. The TSI combines these characteristics to create an indication of price and direction more in sync with market turns than either momentum or moving average. The TSI is provided as part of the standard collection of indicators offered by various trading platforms.|$|E
50|$|The advance-decline {{line is a}} {{stock market}} <b>technical</b> <b>indicator</b> used by investors to measure the number of {{individual}} stocks participating in a market rise or fall. As price changes of large stocks can have a disproportionate effect on capitalization weighted stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the NYSE Composite Index, and the NASDAQ Composite index, it can be useful to know how broadly this movement extends into the larger universe of smaller stocks. Since market indexes represent a group of stocks, they do not present the whole picture of the trading day {{and the performance of}} the market during this day. Though the market indices give an idea about what has happened during the trading day, advance/decline numbers give an idea about the individual performance of particular stocks.|$|E

The pattern {{is characterized by a}} contracting range in prices coupled with an upward trend in prices (known as a rising wedge) or a downward trend in prices (known as a falling wedge). [...] __FORCETOC__A wedge pattern {{is considered to be a}} pattern which is forming at the top or bottom of the trend. It is a type of formation in which trading activities are confined within converging straight lines which form a pattern. It should take about 3 to 4 weeks to complete the wedge. This pattern has a rising or falling slant pointing in the same direction. It differs from the triangle in the sense that both boundary lines either slope up or down. Price breaking out point creates another difference from the triangle. Falling and rising wedges are a small part of intermediate or major trend. As they are reserved for minor trends, they are not considered to be major patterns. Once that basic or primary trend resumes itself, the wedge pattern loses its effectiveness as a <b>technical</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{computing}} technology has significantly improved data processing power of technical analysis tools embedded in financial charting software, the effectiveness of those technical analysis tools as key analysis feature of charting software remains questionable.
