5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{the remains of}} Poe's wife, Virginia, were moved to <b>this</b> <b>spot</b> as well.

William Gill, an early Poe biographer, gathered her bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885, the 76th anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly 10 years after his present monument was erected. George W. Spence, the man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial as well as his exhumation and reburial, attended the rites that brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother, Maria Clemm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the acoustic processor of a Spanish Continuous Speech Recognition System based on HMM Demisyllable units. The acoustic processor produces a lattice of word hypotheses suitable to be parsed by a linguistic analyzer {{and it is}} based on a <b>spotting</b> algorithm. <b>This</b> <b>spotting</b> algorithm has three inputs : The unknown utterance, the HMM of the dernisyllables or references and the lexical knowledge in terms of a finite state network.

5|$|Continuing eastward, {{the drive}} descends down the {{mountain}} toward Copper Harbor. The roadway twists and turns as it alternately climbs and descends several smaller hills along the ridgeline. Along the drive, several viewpoints provide the opportunity to pull off and take in the surroundings. A few of them lie directly adjacent to {{the face of the}} bluff where the mountain quickly rises from the surrounding land. Near the eastern end, there are two sharp hairpin turns, the first of which has a scenic overlook and parking area. <b>This</b> <b>spot</b> overlooks Copper Harbor and the nearby Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway portion of US Highway 41 (US41) just to the east. From here, the road makes its steep descent down from the ridge, through the second turn and ends at M-26 on the western edge of town.|$|E
5|$|In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple.

According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. <b>This</b> <b>spot</b> was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E
