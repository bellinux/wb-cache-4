5|$|<b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> {{expressed}} an interest in the Iroquois engine for an enlarged version of the Dassault Mirage IV bomber, the Mirage IVB. This was one of several engines being considered, including the Olympus, with an order for 300 Iroquois being considered. Acting on media speculation that the Iroquois engine program was also in jeopardy of being cancelled, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> chose to end negotiations in October 1958 and opted for an upgraded version of the indigenous Snecma Atar, instead. There was never an explanation for this decision offered by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government,</b> even after Avro tried to offer the Iroquois as a private venture.|$|E
5|$|When {{municipal}} graveyards {{began to}} overfill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries. Ware {{began with an}} agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government.</b> Ware eventually concluded {{that it was not}} prudent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land, grant it in perpetuity, and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions, were accessible by public road, were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages. Similar negotiations began with the Belgian government.|$|E

5|$|By the 1970s, the Auxois {{had almost}} become extinct, and <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> began pushing the {{breeding}} of all native draft horses for meat production, {{as opposed to}} agricultural usage. However, the meat of the Auxois was not considered high quality, and this, combined with a lower-than-expected market for meat, led to a continued decline in French draft horse populations. In the 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> reversed its position on breeding for meat, and began promoting draft breeds for leisure pursuits. The Auxois continues to be rare, having the eighth-smallest population numbers of the nine native French draft breeds. An annual breed show is held in Semur-en-Auxois, and the Auxois is frequently seen at the Paris International Agricultural Show.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1970, funds to {{continue}} building were exhausted; work stopped on La Belle Creole and Philippe was forced to abandon his project. The resort eventually went into the receivership of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government,</b> who eagerly sought a buyer.|$|E
5|$|In June 1967, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> {{announced}} their {{withdrawal from the}} AFVG project ostensibly {{on the grounds of}} cost.

5|$|Most of Riefenstahl's {{unfinished}} {{projects were}} lost {{towards the end}} of the war. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> confiscated all of her editing equipment, along with the production reels of Tiefland.

She edited and dubbed the remaining material and Tiefland premiered on 11 February 1954 in Stuttgart. However, it was denied entry into the Cannes Film Festival. Although Riefenstahl lived for almost another half century, Tiefland was her last feature film.|$|E

5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>Government</b> first {{investigated}} {{the idea of}} overhauling their system of measurement, the concept of universality was put into practice in 1789: Maurice de Talleyrand, acting on Condorcet's advice, invited John Riggs Miller, a British parliamentarian and Thomas Jefferson, the American Secretary of State to George Washington, {{to work with the}} French in producing an international standard by promoting legislation in their respective legislative bodies.

5|$|At this time, Cantillon became {{involved}} with British mercantilist John Law through the Mississippi Company. Based on the monetary theory proposed by William Potter in his 1650 tract The Key of Wealth, John Law posited that increases in the money supply {{would lead to the}} employment of unused land and labour, leading to higher productivity. In 1716, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> granted him both permission to found the Banque Générale and virtual monopoly over the right to develop French territories in North America, named the Mississippi Company. In return, Law promised <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>government</b> to finance their debt at low rates of interest. Law began a financial speculative bubble by selling shares of the Mississippi Company, using the Banque Générales virtual monopoly on the issue of bank notes to finance his investors.|$|E
