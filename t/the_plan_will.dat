25|$|All Medicare Advantage {{plans are}} {{required}} to limit out-of-pocket (OOP) spending by a beneficiary for Parts A and B {{to no more than}} $6,700 (as of 2016) per year for in-network providers. The OOP limit may be higher for out of network providers in a PPO; out of network providers are typically not permitted in an HMO. The average OOP limit in 2016 is around $5000. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is often reported; it is instead a very valuable financial-protection benefit although is very rare that a Medicare Advantage beneficiary spends anywhere near the amount of his or her annual OOP limit. Original Medicare provides no similar OOP spending cap and the exposure of an Original Medicare beneficiary to a financial catastrophe is unlimited (but equally rare). Once the OOP maximum is reached for an individual, <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>will</b> pay 100% of medical services {{for the remainder of the}} calendar year, with no lifetime maximum.
