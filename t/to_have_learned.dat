5|$|Although {{pronounced}} differently, Wicca {{is related}} to the Old English word wicca, which referred to sorcerers in Anglo-Saxon England. In the early 1950s, English Wiccan Gerald Gardner, founder of the Gardnerian tradition, referred to the Pagan Witchcraft community as the Wica. He claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> the term during his initiation into the New Forest coven in 1939. By the late 1950s, Gardner's rival Charles Cardell, founder of his own tradition, had begun referring to the religion's followers as Wiccens, and possibly used Wicca in reference to the religion itself.|$|E
5|$|The missionaries {{introduced}} a musical form of chant into Britain, {{similar to that}} used in Rome during the mass. During the 7th and 8th centuries Canterbury was renowned for the excellence of its clergy's chanting, and sent singing masters to instruct others, including two to Wilfrid, who became Bishop of York. Putta, the first Bishop of Rochester, had a reputation for his skill at chanting, which he was said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> from the Gregorian missionaries. One of them, James the Deacon, taught chanting in Northumbria after Paulinus returned to Kent; Bede noted that James was accomplished in the singing of the chants.|$|E

5|$|Ernest {{believed}} he could communicate with both extraterrestrials and historical figures, channeling messages from them. In 1954, seeking to popularize his channeling, Ernest and Ruth formed an organization known as Unarius, operating {{from their home in}} California. After their marriage, Ruth served as Ernest's typist, later claiming <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> the skill while sleeping. She recorded the information he channeled, writing books about psychic healing and trips into the solar system. In the 1950s and 1960s, they attracted several followers, including two students whom they later taught to channel. One early trainee was Charles Spiegel, who later led the group. Many converts had previous involvement with New Age or mystic groups, making it easy for the Normans to convert them.|$|E
5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|Midshipmen were {{expected}} {{to work on the}} ship, but were also expected to learn navigation and seamanship. They {{were expected}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising gun batteries, commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain. Midshipmen {{were expected to}} keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.|$|E

30|$|The {{question}} schemas {{depended on}} the structure of the semantic network we used. As mentioned earlier, the semantic network was extracted from a knowledge base that was used for question-answering purpose, where the entire knowledge base was described in terms of class, entity, event, and relations among these concepts. Since generating questions about classes (e.g., Is photosynthesis an event?) makes no sense in our teaching domain, we focused on generating questions about entities, events, and their relations. Briefly put, we generated “what is” questions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> students <b>learn</b> compositional relations between an event and its subevents. We generated “input and output” questions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> students <b>learn</b> relationships between events belonging to the same parent event. We generated “where” questions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> students <b>learn</b> locational relations between events and entities. We generated “function” questions <b>to</b> <b>have</b> students <b>learn</b> how entities participate in events. This subsection discusses general design issues for the question schemas. Subsequent subsections discuss issues that are specific to the question types just mentioned.|$|R

25|$|The first battle {{occurred}} on 15 March 1646, off Mariveles Island, near Corregidor. The two Spanish ships defeated four Dutch ships, which, however, {{were able to}} escape in the night. None of the Spanish was killed, but the Spanish claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> later that many Dutch were killed, {{and two of the}} ships were rendered useless.|$|E
25|$|The {{outrage over}} this event caused another peak in strike {{activity}} in 1919 with 397 strikes involving over 300,000 workers in Buenos Aires alone. While the FORA IX claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> its {{lesson from the}} Tragic Week and the failed railworkers' strike in 1917, the FORA V experienced a short revival in strength during this year.|$|E

25|$|North American brown bears (Ursos arctos) make a paste of Osha roots (Ligusticum porteri) and saliva and rub {{it through}} their fur to repel insects or soothe bites. This plant, locally known as bear root, {{contains}} 105 active compounds, such as coumarins that may repel insects when topically applied. Navajo Indians are said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> {{to use this}} root medicinally from the bear for treating stomach aches and infections.|$|E
25|$|Francis Marion Brower {{was born}} on November 20, 1823, in Baltimore, Maryland. Brower began his career at age 13, first {{performing}} at Dick Meyer's Third and Chestnut Streets Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Brower claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> to dance from black people, and he took to doing song-and-dance blackface performances in circuses and theatres. For the 1840 season, Brower toured with the Cincinnati Circus Company, paired with a banjoist named Ferguson. The two became {{the stars of the}} show.|$|E

By working in areas known for criminal activity by young people, like the Jane and Finch area of Toronto, LEARNStyle is helping students gain confidence in their academic abilities so that they pursue education, rather than acting out.|$|R

25|$|Some Native Americans {{are thought}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> {{quilting}} through observation of white settlers; others learned it from missionaries who taught quilting to Native American women {{along with other}} homemaking skills. Native American women quickly developed their own unique style, the Lone Star design (also called the Star of Bethlehem), a variation on Morning Star designs that had been featured on Native American clothing and other items for centuries. These quilts often featured floral appliqué framing the star design. Pictorial quilts, created with appliqué, were also common.|$|E
25|$|With Allen Newell, Simon {{developed}} a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules. The {{study of human}} problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and, with Anders Ericsson, Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis. Simon {{was interested in the}} role of knowledge in expertise. He said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50,000 chunks of information. A chess expert was said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> about 50,000 chunks or chess position patterns.|$|E
25|$|Wood {{was born}} the second child to Maud Crawford Wood and William Barg Wood, who moved the family to St. Louis, where in 1918 her mother and younger brother succumbed to the {{influenza}} epidemic of 1918. Two months previous to their deaths, Wood enrolled at the St. Louis School of Fine Art at Washington University. There, she is presumed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> the technique of silverpoint drawing, for which she is best known. In 1920, Wood and a fellow art student, Myra Marglous, applied for passports and left for Paris to continue their study of art.|$|E
