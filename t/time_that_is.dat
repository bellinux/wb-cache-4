5|$|A {{branch of}} the Hejaz railway, known as the Jezreel Valley railway, was built between 1903 and 1905. This event {{accelerated}} the growth of Haifa, which became a township (nahiya) centre in Akka in the sanjak of Beyrut Eyalet {{before the end of}} Ottoman rule. The Technion Institute of Technology was established around this <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> in 1912.|$|E

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E

People also underestimate the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> lost when decreasing from a low speed and overestimate the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> lost when decreasing from a high speed.|$|R

5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E
5|$|France {{hosted the}} 2007 World Cup, {{and the two}} teams met in the tournament quarter-finals. Despite France's hosting of the tournament, the match {{was held at the}} Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The match was won by France 2018, and {{involved}} several controversial decisions by referee Wayne Barnes, who subsequently received death threats from some fans. France scored one try after the sin binning of All Blacks second five-eighth Luke McAlister, and another from a forward pass unseen by the referee. The All Blacks were strongly criticised for not attempting a drop goal in the game's final minutes. Their performance was analysed by Palmerston North based company Verusco who had analysed 1,500games since 2000. They discovered that the All Blacks made 57 tackles to France's 269, and they had 66 percent possession and 60 percent territory. The playing <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> time the ball is in play, was the longest of any game Verusco had ever recorded.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire. For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1fsw at a rate not exceeding 1fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4fsw for the <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.|$|E
