2500|$|A {{memorandum}} {{from the}} President's Special Assistant, Walt Rostow, to President Johnson said: [...] "What's on the Arab Ambassadors' minds {{boils down to}} one big question: Will we make good on our pledge to support the territorial integrity of all states in the Middle East? Our best answer is that we stand by that pledge, {{but the only way}} to make good on it is to have a genuine peace. The <b>tough</b> <b>question</b> is whether we'd force Israel back to 4 June borders if the Arabs accepted terms that amounted to an honest peace settlement. Secretary Rusk told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister: 'The US had no problem with frontiers as they existed before the outbreak of hostilities. If we are talking about national frontiers--in a state of peace--then we will work toward restoring them.' But we all know that could lead to a tangle with the Israelis." ...|$|E

A Crude Awakening asks the <b>tough</b> <b>question,</b> “What happens when we run out of cheap oil?” Through expert interviews and archival footage, the film spells out in startling detail the challenges we would face in dealing with the possibility of a world without cheap oil—a world in which it may ultimately take more energy to drill for oil than we can extract from the oil the wells produce.|$|E

5000|$|Gallen was {{selected}} for all three games of the 2011 State of Origin series, {{as well as for}} Australia. He scored his first try of the season in round 3, against the Panthers. The Sharks won that game 44-12. In State of Origin II Gallen was controversially selected to play prop and became the first prop to play 80 minutes in an Origin match since Steve Price (rugby league) in 2007. His performance earned him man of the match. Subsequently, there were claims that his performance was fueled by performance-enhancing substances, with journalist Andrew Webster linking these in an article; [...] "State of Origin 2016: The <b>tough</b> <b>question</b> NSW Blues captain Paul Gallen does not want to answer".|$|E
5000|$|The often <b>tough</b> <b>question</b> {{of what it}} is {{that makes}} {{material}} indecent or obscene was an important aspect of this case. The murky line between these two categories has been difficult to determine. In Butler v. Michigan (1957), when dealing with the sale of books containing adult material, the Court [...] "reversed a conviction under a statute which made it an offense to make available to the general public materials found to have a potentially harmful influence on minors". This case, however, did not deal with definitions. A case that did, {{which is one of the}} most crucial cases to this debate, was Miller v.

5000|$|In 1980, the Southam {{newspaper}} chain {{closed its}} paper in Winnipeg, {{the same day}} as the Thomson newspaper chain closed its newspaper in Ottawa. The closures gave Thomson newspapers a monopoly in Winnipeg and Southam newspapers a monopoly in Ottawa. Eventually, the two newspapers were prosecuted under the federal Combines Investigation Act offences governing mergers and monopolistic conduct. [...] Claude Thomson was retained to carry on the prosecution on behalf of the Crown. After a lengthy trial, the two newspaper chains were acquitted. Thomson later commented about the case: [...] "I presented every piece of evidence I could. I asked every <b>tough</b> <b>question</b> I could think of. The judge believed the defence.

5000|$|Hal Hinson, in {{his review}} for The Washington Post, wrote, [...] "James Brooks is {{excellent}} at taking us inside the world of television, but not terribly good at analyzing it. He has a facile, too-pat {{approach to dealing with}} issues; there's still too much of the sitcom mentality at work". In his review for Time, Richard Corliss praised William Hurt's performance: [...] "Hurt is neat too, never standing safely outside his character, always allowing Tom to find the humor in his too-rapid success, locating a dimness behind his eyes when Tom is asked a <b>tough</b> <b>question</b> -- and for Tom, poor soulless sensation-to-be, all questions are tough ones". The magazine also ranked Broadcast News {{as one of the best}} films of the year. The film garnered a 98% rating at Rotten Tomatoes and an 84/100 average score at Metacritic.|$|E
5000|$|Oftentimes, {{sideline}} {{reporters are}} faced with uncomfortable interviews {{that they have to}} conduct because the network demands it and they are asked to bring forth the <b>tough</b> <b>question.</b> If the sideline reporter is not prepared for an interview, it may make for an awkward moment on national television. As with the case with professional athletes and coaches, for instance, it may be very difficult and sometimes unavoidable, to stray away from uncomfortable interviews. An example of a notorious interviewee is San Antonio Spurs Head Basketball coach Gregg Popovich. Popovich is known for giving short, often bizarre answers, when interviewed by a court side reporter. All of his interactions with reporters have become must see television. ESPN reported that that [...] "bubbling sense of discomfort for NBA sideline reporters as a between-quarters date with Popovich draws near is almost universal." ...|$|E
