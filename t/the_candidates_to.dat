5|$|Although Du Bois {{generally}} endorsed socialist principles, {{his politics}} were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat Jimmy Walker {{for mayor of}} New York, rather than the socialist Norman Thomas, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by promises from <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>to</b> fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.|$|E

In 1062, he was one of <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>to</b> succeed Ealdred as bishop, when Ealdred was {{promoted}} to Archbishop of York, but Wulfstan was chosen instead. Æthelwig also served as a judge for King Edward the Confessor, at one point hearing a case at the royal court along with Wulfstan and Regenbald, the chancellor. The abbot also led military forces in battle, and served King Edward as an advisor.|$|E
50|$|Before {{getting to}} the car, the {{examiner}} will ask <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> read a car's number plate at a distance. The distance required is 20.5 metres for an old-style plate (A123 ABC) and 20 metres for a new style plate (AB51 ABC). If <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> needs glasses <b>to</b> do this, then they must be worn during the test. If <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> fails <b>to</b> read <b>the</b> first number plate correctly, then the examiner asks <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>to</b> read a second number plate. If <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> cannot correctly read the second number plate, then the examiner must use a tape measure to measure the correct distance between <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> and a third number plate. If <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> cannot read <b>the</b> third number plate, then <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> is deemed <b>to</b> have failed and the test will not continue.|$|R

5|$|Miller, the vice-captain, almost {{missed the}} trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. On arrival in India, Miller scored 46 in a draw against North Zone. Miller then captained the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay, top-scoring with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In a match against India, Miller took two wickets. At this point, {{with most of the}} team {{suffering}} from dysentery and the leadership not permitting the team to travel by air, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed from the captaincy, with Miller as one of <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>to</b> replace him. This would have increased his prospects of leading Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when a RAAF plane was acquired to transport the team.|$|E
5|$|Pope Gregory XIII {{appointed}} Báthory cardinal {{during his}} visit to Rome in 1584. A year later, he was installed as coadjutor bishop of Warmia. He was in Rome again when Stephen Báthory died in 1586. Andrew was one of <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>to</b> succeed him in Poland and Lithuania, but Jan Zamoyski, the Chancellor of Poland, convinced him to support another candidate, Sigismund Vasa, and to demonstrate the Báthorys' claim to the crown only through nominating his minor cousin, Sigismund Báthory, Prince of Transylvania. After Sigismund Vasa was elected king in 1587, Báthory convinced his cousin's advisors to send reinforcements to Poland to fight against Maximilian of Habsburg, who also claimed the throne. Báthory became Prince-Bishop of Warmia after the death of Bishop Marcin Kromer in 1589.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund {{adopted the}} title of Prince of Transylvania after Stephen Báthory died on 13 December 1586. He was still a minor, and Ghyczy {{continued}} to rule as regent. Sigismund was one of <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>to</b> the throne of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. His advisors {{knew that he had}} little chance to win, but they wanted to demonstrate that the Báthorys had a valid claim to rule the Commonwealth. Kovacsóczy officially announced Sigismund's application at the Sejm (or general assembly) on 14August 1587. Five days later, the assembly elected Sigismund III Vasa king. During the ensuing war of succession, Transylvanian troops supported SigismundIII against Maximilian of Habsburg, who had also laid claim to Poland and Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Miller, the vice-captain of the team, almost {{missed the}} trip to India after turning up late for the voyage. The {{servicemen}} arrived in Bombay and took a two-day train journey to Lahore to play North Zone. Miller scored 46 in a drawn match. The Australians headed to Delhi, but Miller missed the tour match due to food poisoning. He then led the Australians in a match against West Zone in Bombay with Hassett being rested. Miller top-scored with 106 in a high-scoring draw. In the first match against India at Bombay's Brabourne Stadium, regarded as unofficial Tests, Miller took two wickets: Rusi Modi in the first innings and Abdul Hafeez Kardar in the second. The match ended in a high-scoring draw with Miller unbeaten on 15 as Australia were 1/31 in pursuit of 112 for victory. At this point, {{with most of the}} team suffering from dysentery, some of the Australians became disenchanted with the long train journeys across the subcontinent, and tried to ask Hassett and manager Keith Johnson for air travel. When this was rejected, some of the RAAF personnel felt that Hassett should be removed, with Miller as one of <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>to</b> replace him. With Bradman likely to miss the upcoming tour of New Zealand, the Services captain {{would be one of the}} leading candidates to lead Australia. Miller refused to plot against Hassett and the dispute ended when Squadron Leader Stan Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane already in India to transport the team. On the first flight to Calcutta, the squad survived an electrical storm that caused the plane to drop altitude.|$|E
