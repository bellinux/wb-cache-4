5|$|The four lane road splits into {{a divided}} highway and descends below Evans Avenue. The highway weaves through a {{complicated}} interchange, providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway, and southbound access to The Queensway, QEW / Gardiner Expressway, and Evans Avenue. North of the interchange, the lanes from Brown's Line diverge and form <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> lanes of a collector-express system. Flyover ramps {{to and from}} the QEW / Gardiner pass over the southbound lanes and converge to form the express lanes. This collector-express system serves to divide local traffic from freeway-to-freeway traffic; the express lanes provide access between the QEW / Gardiner Expressway and Highway401, while <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> lanes provide local access between those interchanges.|$|E

5|$|While {{he was in}} Paris at the Jardin des Plantes, Gray saw {{an unnamed}} dried specimen, {{collected}} by André Michaux, and named it Shortia galacifolia. He spent considerable time and effort over the next 38 years looking for a specimen in the wild. The first such expedition was in late June to late July 1841 to an area near Jefferson, Ashe County, North Carolina. His further expeditions searching for this species were also unsuccessful, including one in 1876. In May 1877 a North Carolina herb collector found a specimen but {{did not know what}} it was. Eighteen months later <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> sent it to Joseph Whipple Congdon, who contacted Gray, telling Gray that he felt he had found Shortia. Gray was ecstatic to confirm this when he saw the specimen in October 1878.

Gray never saw the species in the wild in bloom, but made a final trip to this region in 1884.|$|E
