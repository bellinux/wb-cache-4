In particular, Task and Deliverable 8 are entitled “Develop/test potentially standardized method on material efficiency, to be applied to relevant product groups” and aim at developing feasibility studies on potentially standardized methods for assessing durability of products. The main objective of this report consists of outlining and testing a procedure for assessing durability of electric washing machines for household use. In particular the report will: •	investigate existing endurance tests, •	define whether such endurance tests can be suitable for a possible standardised testing procedure, •	develop and test a durability procedure on exemplary washing machines, and •	assess the durability procedure and provide guidelines for future development. Chapters 2 and 3 of the present report concern I) a literature review, with a focus {{on the state of the}} art of washing machine durability, the average usage in Europe, frequent failure modes and different existing theories behind durability tests; II) the study of existing international standards, currently dealing with safety of electronic devices and household appliances, endurance requirements for washing machine parts and guidelines to assess the performance during the washing cycle; III) comments and feedback from experts that were contacted during the study in order to gather information about tests, non-disclosed procedures, failure mode statistics and possible answers to the question of methods able to measure or to verify durability. Chapter 4 provides the scientific background about the dynamics of a horizontal axis washing machine, which can be seen physically as a vibrating system where the tub (including the drum) is fixed with springs on the top of the housing. Finally, a novel procedure for durability testing is proposed in chapter 5. The proposed method is a first attempt to find a framework in which several washing machine types can fit in and, eventually, a point of discussion for further improvements and diversification. The results of the proposed method are presented in chapter 6 and discussed in chapter 7. JRC. D. 3 -Land Resource...|$|E

40|$|Many {{problems}} with nitrate and pesticide contamination from agriculture exist in European drinking water catchments, and quite different management options are presently searched for. Among them, organic farming is considered {{as an important}} option to conciliate agricultural activities and water preservation. Based on different type of interviews, literature and documentation analysis, and participation in a steering committee, we compare the construction of agreements between city water utilities and farmers {{for the preservation of}} drinking water quatity in three drinking water catchment areas (Munich and Augsburg in Germany, Lons-le-Saunier in France). The main differences found are the delimitation of the city's field of action, compensation payments for farmers for certain practices, involvement of the city council in the acquisition of land, and importance granted to organic farming. Successful city-farmer coordination is based on the presence of a facilitator as an intermediary, <b>technical</b> <b>support,</b> dialogue, <b>contracts</b> that span sufficiently long periods, and participation of farmers in elaboration of contracts.

40|$|Information {{security}} {{processes and}} systems are relevant for any organization and involve medium-to-high investment; however, {{the current economic}} downturn is causing a dramatic reduction in spending on Information Technology (IT). Cloud computing (i. e., externalization {{of one or more}} IT services) might be a solution for organizations keen to maintain a good level of security. In this paper we discuss whether cloud computing is a valid alternative to in-house security processes and systems drawing on four mini-case studies of higher education institutions in New England, US. Our findings show that the organization’s IT spending capacity affects the choice to move to the cloud; however, the perceived security of the cloud and the perceived in-house capacity to provide high quality IT (and security) services moderate this relationship. Moreover, other variables such as (low) quality of <b>technical</b> <b>support,</b> relatively incomplete <b>contracts,</b> poor defined Service License Agreements (SLA), and ambiguities over data ownership affect the choice to outsource IT (and security) using the cloud. We suggest that, while cloud computing could be a useful means of IT outsourcing, {{there needs to be a}} number of changes and improvements to how the service is currently delivered...|$|R

Second, organization members will find their own PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> solutions if one is not provided through formal channels. This statement also relates to the organizational culture and the perceived effectiveness of the formal support entity. If this entity does not suit their needs, they will obtain their own "hired guns" and create different forms of PC-related support solutions. Finally, the College of Education needs to seriously assess its needs for PC-related <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> and provide adequate service levels to ensure effective applications of computing technology...|$|R
