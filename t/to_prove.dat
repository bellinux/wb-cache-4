After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> it, in vain. His inability <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E

5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> his results and simply thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E
5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the statement, it is actually easier <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E

The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E

5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the original statement, therefore, it suffices <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E

5|$|Cantor {{extended}} {{his work on}} the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an aleph. First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. He used this inconsistent multiplicity <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the aleph theorem. In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.|$|E
