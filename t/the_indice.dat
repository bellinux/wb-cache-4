It continued its steep rise through the beginning of 2006, reaching 19,272.63 points at end-March 2006. The stockmarket also posted a record low vacancy rate, according to the central bank. Local stockmarket capitalisation totalled US$236bn at end-2005, up from US$170 bn at end-2004. As of March 2006 there were 135 listed companies, down from 153 a year earlier.

40|$|The topological indices irr(G) {{related to}} the first Zagreb index, M_ 1 (G) and the second Zagreb index, M_ 2 (G) are the oldest {{irregularity}} measures researched. Alberton [3] introduced the irregularity of G as irr(G) = ∑_e ∈ E(G) imb(e), imb(e) = |d(v) - d(u) |_e=vu. In the paper of Fath-Tabar [7], Alberton's <b>indice</b> was named <b>the</b> third Zagreb <b>indice</b> to conform with the terminology of chemical graph theory. Recently Ado et. al. [1] introduced <b>the</b> topological <b>indice</b> called total irregularity.

50|$|In April 2007, 60 {{companies}} were {{listed on the}} BVC, with less than half being traded regularly.

Daily trading volume decreased from the equivalent of $25 to $30 million in 1997 to less than $1 million by 2000. The BVC survived during this period thanks to a growing trade of government debt securities. Stock prices, measured by <b>the</b> <b>Indice</b> Bursátil Caracas, were also depressed during the 1990s and have yet to recover to the highest ever leves experienced in 1991.
