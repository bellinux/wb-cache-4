40|$|AbstractWe {{approach}} {{the problem of}} classifying injective modules over an integral domain, by considering the class of semistar Noetherian domains. When working with such domains, one has to focus on semistar ideals: as a consequence for modules, we restrict our study to the class of injective hulls of co-semistar modules, those in which the annihilator ideal of each nonzero element is semistar. We obtain a complete classification of this class, by describing its elements as injective hulls of uniquely determined direct sums of indecomposable injective modules; if moreover, we consider stable semistar operations, then we can further improve this result, obtaining a natural generalization of the classical Noetherian case. Our approach provides a unified <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> on injective modules over various kinds of domains obtained by Matlis, Cailleau, Beck, Fuchs and Kim‚ÄìKim‚ÄìPark...|$|E
