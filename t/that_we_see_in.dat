25|$|Another {{important}} {{influence to}} jazz was the blues, {{an expression of}} the hardships experienced daily by slaves, in direct contrast to the work song, a celebration of work. Its musical inspiration came from where its players did, Africa. The rhythmic form of blues was a basis for many developments that would appear in jazz. Though its instrumentation was mostly limited to melodic instruments and a singer, feeling and rhythm were tremendously important. The two primary feels were a pulse on alternating beats <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> countless other forms of American music, and the shuffle, which is essentially the pattin' juba rhythm, a feel based on a division of three rather than two.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{women as}} a whole {{tend to be less}} {{assertive}} and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so. Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> adults in the workplace. Boys {{are more likely to be}} pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less likely to seek recognition for their work.|$|E

He argues that all <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> nature is framed {{so as to avoid}} and reject what is dangerous to the integrity of its constitution; that the human race would be an anomaly in the world had it not for end its conservation in its best estate; that benevolence of all to all is what in a rational view of the creation is alone accordant with its general plan; that various peculiarities of man's body indicate that he has been made to co-operate with his fellow men and to maintain society; and that certain faculties of his mind show the common good to be more essentially connected with his perfection than any pursuit of private advantage. The whole course of his reasoning proceeds on, and is pervaded by, the principle of final causes.|$|E

MGM expressed interest in a second film in 2006, set between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

2500|$|In The Real Odessa. How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina (2002), the Argentine journalist, Uki Goñi {{described}} how the Argentinean government dealt with war criminals that entered Argentina. However, during his research Goñi accidentally stumbled on {{documents of the}} British Foreign Office about the involvement of Vatican personnel in the smuggling of war criminals, the so-called post-war [...] "ratlines". Goñi {{found out that the}} British Envoy D'Arcy Osborne had intervened with Pope Pius XII {{to put an end to}} these illegal activities. Furthermore, he discovered [...] "that the Pope secretly pleaded with Washington and London on behalf of notorious criminals and Nazi collaborators". Suzanne Brown-Fleming's The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience. Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany (2006) underlines Goñi's findings. In her remarkable study, Brown-Fleming clearly demonstrated how Pius XII intervened on behalf of rather vicious German war criminals (e.g. Otto Ohlendorf). Brown-Fleming's main source was the archive of Pope Pius XII's representative in post-war Germany, Cardinal Aloisius Muench. Then, Phayer's Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War (2008) makes use of many documents that have recently come to light thanks to Bill Clinton's 1997 executive order declassifying wartime and postwar documents, many of which are currently at the US National Archives and Holocaust Memorial Museum. These documents include diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and even decryptions of German communications. Relevant documents have also been released by the Argentine government and the British Foreign Office and other information sources have become available, including the diary of Bishop Hurley. These documents reveal new information about Pius XII's actions regarding the Ustaše regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the ratlines for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe. According to Phayer, [...] "the face of Pope Pius <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions".|$|E
