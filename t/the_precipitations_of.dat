40|$|MasterDuplex {{stainless}} steels consisting of ferrite and austenite represent excellent mechanical properties and superior corrosion resistance, and accordingly they {{are widely used}} as the structural components for chemical and nuclear power industries. Recently, to meet the need for higher performance (enhanced life in more severe corrosive environment) of materials, hyper duplex {{stainless steels}} with PREN value of over 50 is being developed. However, hyper duplex stainless steels often reveal undesired microstructure after heat treatment at certain temperature range and holding time, resulting in the degradation of excellent properties. One {{of the main reasons}} is known to be due to <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> sigma phase. Therefore, it is important to control the amount of sigma phase during heating, holding and cooling. In this work, by the addition of various alloy elements, W, Ce, Cu, microstructure and mechanical properties of hyper duplex stainless steel were investigated with the special emphasis on the mechanical properties variation of in relation to <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> sigma phase and chi phase. Based on TTT diagram of secondary phases and the results of mechanical tests, optimum alloy compositions were suggested. Important results obtained in this study is summarized as follows. Toughness was drastically reduced by <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> secondary phases, sigma phase and chi phase. Increasing <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> sigma phase was significantly suppressed, slowing down the toughness reduction of the alloy. However with the increase of the chi phase, the toughness was not noticeably changed. The tensile properties were also changed by <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> secondary phases. <b>The</b> yield strength was increased and the total elongation was reduced with the increase in the amounts of secondary phases. It was observed that the sigma phase played more important role in influencing the tensile properties because cracks were formed to follow along the sigma phase rather than the chi phase. The ultimate tensile strength was similar between the before and after heat treatment due to the change of hardening rate. This study clarified the role of W, Ce and Cu in <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> secondary phases. <b>The</b> lowering of Mo and addition <b>of</b> W promoted <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chi phase and effectively retarded <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> sigma phase. <b>The</b> addition of Ce also retarded <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> sigma phase, but not <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> chi phase. <b>The</b> addition of both Ce and Cu effectively retarded <b>the</b> <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sigma phase, including the chi phase...|$|R

Flotation is an important mining industry process where the desired mineral is separated from the gangue. The aim of this process is to make the desired mineral hydrophobic in order for it to float to the surface. This is done by adding surface-active reactants, referred to as collectors. Although the flotation process has been used {{since the beginning of the}} last century there are still some uncertainties in the fundamental understanding of the reactions taking place at the surface of the mineral. In this thesis the surface properties of two dialkyldithiophosphate collectors, namely diethyldithiophosphate and dibutyldithiophosphate are studied. The amount of adsorption of dialkyldithiophosphate onto germanium and onto zinc sulphide are studied in-situ with Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) Infrared Spectroscopy. ATR is a surface sensitive method suitable when working with water as solvent. While the expected adsorption of dialkyldithiophosphates onto germanium was not detected, adsorption was identified for dibutyldithiophosphate on zinc sulphide (the adsorption rates for this are presented in a kinetic plot).

The application of surface modified latex particles, used as controlling agents, and the formation of hybrid crystals in which the latex is embedded in otherwise perfect crystals, are discussed. The for-mation of nano sized spheres of amorphous calcium carbonate, stabilized by surfactant-like polymers, is also dis-cussed. Another method for the preparation of nanosized inorganic functional particles is the controlled pyrolysis of metal salt complexes of poly(acrylic acid), as demonstrated by the syntheses of lithium cobalt oxide and zinc/mag-nesium oxide. Bulk polymerization of methyl methacrylate blends, with for example, nanosized zinc oxide, revealed that the mechanisms of free radical polymerization respond to the presence of these particles. The termination by radical-radical interaction and the gel effect are suppressed in favor of degenerative transfer, resulting in a polymer with enhanced thermal stability.

We statistically investigate the effects of the IMF orientation on PHI precipitations toward the ionosphere based on observations by Mars Express (MEX). We identified 59 PHI precipitation events between July 2007 and September 2009. To estimate the IMF orientation without magnetometer that MEX does not carry, we used the velocity distribution of exospheric-origin pickup protons.

The observed precipitating PHIs are accelerated only up to a few keV. This feature may reflect the short distance from the picked-up region. For one of these 10 events, we estimated the IMF polarity by comparing the velocity distribution of exospheric-origin pickup protons observed by MEX with those obtained from statistical trajectory tracing simulations under two cases of possible IMF polarity conditions. The estimated polarity indicates that the PHI precipitation in this event is observed in the downward electric field hemisphere in MSE, where Esw points to Mars in the pole region...|$|E

40|$|Pulsating auroras show {{quasi-periodic}} intensity modulations {{caused by}} the precipitation of energetic electrons {{of the order of}} tens of keV. It is expected theoretically that not only these electrons but also sub-relativistic/relativistic electrons precipitate simultaneously into the ionosphere owing to whistler-mode wave–particle interactions. The height-resolved electron density profile was observed with the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) Tromsø VHF radar on 17 November 2012. Electron density enhancements were clearly identified at altitudes > 68 km in association with the pulsating aurora, suggesting precipitation of electrons with a broadband energy range from ~ 10 keV up to at least 200 keV. The riometer and network of subionospheric radio wave observations also showed the energetic electron precipitations during this period. During this period, the footprint of the Van Allen Probe-A satellite was very close to Tromsø and the satellite observed rising tone emissions of the lower-band chorus (LBC) waves near the equatorial plane. Considering the observed LBC waves and electrons, we conducted a computer simulation of the wave–particle interactions. This showed simultaneous precipitation of electrons at both tens of keV and a few hundred keV, which is consistent with the energy spectrum estimated by the inversion method using the EISCAT observations. This result revealed that electrons with a wide energy range simultaneously precipitate into the ionosphere in association with the pulsating aurora, providing the evidence that pulsating auroras are caused by whistler chorus waves. We suggest that scattering by propagating whistler simultaneously causes both <b>the</b> <b>precipitations</b> <b>of</b> sub-relativistic electrons and the pulsating aurora...|$|E

Duplex stainless steels were obtained through powder metallurgy starting from austenitic 316 L or ferritic 410 L prealloyed base powders by controlled addition of alloying elements powder. Prepared mixes were compacted at 700 MPa and sintered in a vacuum furnace with argon backfilling at temperature of 1240 °C for 1 h. After sintering different cooling cycles were applied: rapid cooling (6 °C/s) using nitrogen under pressure and slow cooling (0. 1 °C/s) with furnace in argon atmosphere. Produced sintered duplex stainless steels were studied by scanning and optical microscopy and EDS chemical analysis of microstructure components as well as X-ray analysis. Mechanical properties were studied through tensile and three-point bending tests and Charpy impact test. It was demonstrated that austenitic-ferritic microstructures with regular arrangement of both phases and absence of precipitates can be obtained with properly designed powder mix composition as well as sintering cycle with rapid cooling rate. Produced sintered duplex steels show good mechanical properties which depend on austenite/ferrite ratio in the microstructure and elements partitioning (Cr/Ni) between phases.
