5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{influenced}} many works {{starting with}} those of Wallace's contemporaries. The novelist Joseph Conrad used it as source material for some of his novels, including Almayer's Folly, An Outcast of the Islands, and The Rescue. Commentators have suggested it had a particularly profound influence on Lord Jim, crediting it with among other things {{the inspiration for the}} character Stein the entomologist. Conrad's assistant Richard Curle wrote that The Malay Archipelago was Conrad's favourite bedside book; Conrad refers directly <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Alfred Wallace's famous book on the Malay Archipelago in The Secret Agent. In his short story, Neil MacAdam, W. Somerset Maugham has the title character read The Malay Archipelago while travelling to Borneo, and its influence can be felt in the story's description of that island.|$|E

According <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the Classical Model, rationality {{is seen as}} something like a train track: you get on at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules of rationality compel {{you all the way}} to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.|$|E

His definition of democide includes not only genocide, but also an excessive killing of civilians in war, to the extent this is against the agreed rules for warfare; he argues the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were war crimes, and thus democide.|$|E

25|$|Charles Taylor, in his 2007 book A Secular Age, {{showed the}} {{historical}} role of deism, leading <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> an exclusive humanism. This humanism invokes a moral order, whose ontic commitment is wholly intra-human, with {{no reference to}} transcendence. One of the special achievements of such deism-based humanism is that it discloses new, anthropocentric moral sources by which human beings are motivated and empowered to accomplish acts of mutual benefit. This is the province of a buffered, disengaged self, which is the locus of dignity, freedom and discipline, and is endowed {{with a sense of}} human capability. According to Taylor, by the early 19th century this deism-mediated exclusive humanism developed as an alternative to Christian faith in a personal God and an order of miracles and mystery.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} story, the staff wanted to {{incorporate}} Hibiki Ganaha and Takane Shijō, {{who had already}} been introduced in The Idolmaster SP, but because the two games were being developed simultaneously, Hibiki's and Takane's role in the main story of Dearly Stars was kept to a minimum. For the dance sequences during performances, Kujioka chose to employ talent star Fumi Sakura, as opposed to professional dancers who {{had been used in}} The Idolmaster games up to that point. Kujioka wanted the dance sequences to be closer <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> an [...] "idol's aura"—a certain emotional charm that is not a part of an idol's skill at dancing, according to him. Also, because of the idols in Dearly Stars are young and are just starting out, Kujioka told Sakura to purposefully mess up some dance portions to reflect this inexperience.|$|E

500|$|Oswald of Bernicia became king of Northumbria {{after his}} victory over Cadwallon at Heavenfield. [...] Penda's status and {{activities}} {{during the years of}} Oswald's reign are obscure, and various interpretations of Penda's position during this period have been suggested. It has been presumed that Penda acknowledged Oswald's authority in some sense after Heavenfield, although Penda was probably an obstacle to Northumbrian supremacy south of the Humber. Higham accepts that Penda acknowledged Oswald's supremacy, but points <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "the apparent failure of Bernician Christianity to penetrate the central Midlands" [...] as evidence against assuming a great deal of authority exercised by Oswald over the Mercians during this period. It has been suggested that Penda's strength during Oswald's reign could be exaggerated by the historical awareness of his later successes. Stancliffe also has a favourable impression of Brooks' interpretation of Penda's position at this time (pages 55–56); see note 29. Kirby says that, while Oswald was as powerful as Edwin had been, [...] "he faced a more entrenched challenge in midland and eastern England from Penda".|$|E
500|$|While critic Simon Reynolds {{says the}} style {{was tied to}} Southern California and its culture, Trainer says the style [...] "arguably" [...] emerged from {{numerous}} simultaneous scenes inhabited by artists working in a diverse form of [...] "post-noise neo-psychedelia". Reynolds identifies Pink, Clark, and Ferraro as the [...] "godparents of hypnagogic". He also singled out Pink as the central figure <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the [...] "Altered Zones Generation", an umbrella term he designed for lo-fi, retro-inspired indie artists who were commonly featured on Altered Zones, a sister site for Pitchfork. Pink gained recognition in the mid 2000s through a string of self-produced albums, pioneering a sound that Reynolds calls [...] "'70s radio-rock and '80s new wave as if heard through a defective transistor radio, glimmers of melody flickering {{in and out of}} the fog". Tiny Mix Tapes Jordan Redmond wrote that Pink's early collaborator John Maus was also placed [...] "at the nexus of a number of recent popular movements" [...] including hypnagogic pop, and that Maus was as [...] "much of a progenitor of this sound as Pink, even though Pink has tended to be the headline-grabber." ...|$|E
500|$|William Poole, in his 2009 {{edition of}} The Man in the Moone, {{provides}} additional {{evidence for a}} later dating. Godwin, he argues, most likely got {{his knowledge of the}} Jesuit mission in China (founded in 1601) from a 1625 edition of Samuel Purchass Purchas his Pilgrimage. This book contains a redaction from Nicolas Trigault's De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu (1615) ("Concerning the Christian expedition to China undertaken by the Society of Jesus"), itself the redaction of a manuscript by the Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci. Poole also sees the influence of Robert Burton, who in the second volume of The Anatomy of Melancholy had speculated on gaining astronomical knowledge through telescopic observation (citing Galileo) or from space travel (Lucian). Appearing {{for the first time in}} the 1628 edition of the Anatomy is a section on planetary periods, which gives a period for Mars of three years– had Godwin used William Gilbert's De Magnete (1600) for this detail he would have found a Martian period of two years. Finally, Poole points <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> a [...] "genetic debt": while details on for instance the Martian period could have come from a few other sources, Burton and Godwin are the only two writers of the time to combine an interest in alien life with the green children of Woolpit, from a 12th-century account of two mysterious green children found in Suffolk.|$|E

500|$|Jim Rickards, in his 2011 book [...] {{argues that}} the {{consequences}} of the Fed's attempts to prop up economic growth could be devastating for American national security. Though Rickard's book is largely concerned with currency war as competitive devaluation, it uses a broader definition of the term, classing policies that cause inflation as currency war. Such policies can be seen as metaphorical warfare against those who have monetary assets in favor of those who do not, but unless the effects of rising inflation on international trade are offset by a devaluation, inflationary policies tend to make a country's exports less competitive against foreign countries. In their review of the book, Publishers Weekly said: [...] "Rickards's first book is an outgrowth of his contributions and a later two-day war game simulation held at the Applied Physics Laboratory's Warfare Analysis Laboratory. He argues that a financial attack against the U.S. could destroy confidence in the dollar. In Rickards's view, the Fed's policy of quantitative easing by lessening confidence in the dollar, may lead to chaos in global financial markets." [...] Kirkus Reviews said: [...] "In Rickards' view, the world is currently going through a third currency war ("CWIII") based on competitive devaluations. CWII occurred in the 1960s and '70s and culminated in Nixon's decision to take the dollar off the gold standard. CWI followed World War I and included the 1923 German hyperinflation and Roosevelt's devaluation of the dollar against gold in 1933. Rickards demonstrates that competitive devaluations are a race to the bottom, and thus instruments of a sort of warfare. CWIII, he writes, is characterized by the Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing, which he ascribes <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "extensive theoretical work" [...] on depreciation, negative interest rates and stimulation achieved {{at the expense of other}} countries. He offers a view of how the continued depreciation and devaluation of the dollar will ultimately lead to a collapse, which he asserts will come about through a widespread abandonment of a worthless inflated instrument. Rickards also provides possible scenarios for the future, including collaboration among a variety of currencies, emergence of a world central bank and a forceful U.S. return to a gold standard through an emergency powers–based legal regime. The author emphasizes that these questions are matters of policy and choice, which can be different." ...|$|E
