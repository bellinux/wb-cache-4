They {{employed}} prominent playwrights: most of Thomas Heywood's tremendous output was staged there, as were John Webster's The White Devil and The Devil's Law-case, Thomas Dekker's If This Be Not A Good Play, <b>the</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>Is</b> <b>in</b> It, and John Cooke's well-known Greene's Tu Quoque. It also came into possession of some older plays, including Christopher Marlowe's Edward II, and as the period progressed, the Red Bull companies, along with those at the Fortune were associated with old-fashioned plays performed for noisy, ignorant audiences. The audience appears to have booed The White Devil in 1611, and in later years it was the cause of, or scene of, numerous brawls violent enough to result in court cases.|$|E

2500|$|William Blake, a Romantic {{poet and}} artist, thought that Wordsworth {{was at the}} same level as the poets Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton. In a diary entry for 27 December 1825, H. C. Robinson recounted a {{conversation}} between himself and William Blake shortly before Blake's death: [...] "I read to him Wordsworth's incomparable ode, which he heartily enjoyed. But he repeated, 'I fear Wordsworth loves nature, and nature is the work of the Devil. <b>The</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> us as 'far as we are nature.'... The parts of Wordsworth's ode which Blake most enjoyed were the most obscure—at all events, those which I least like and comprehend." [...] Following Blake, Chauncy Hare Townshend produced [...] "An Essay on the Theory and the Writings of Wordsworth"for Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in 1829. In the third part, he critiqued Wordsworth's use of pre-existence within the poem and asked [...] "unless our author means to say that, having existed from all eternity, we are of an eternal and indestructible essence; or, in other words, that being incarnate portion of the Deity... we are as Immortal as himself. But if the poet intends to affirm this, do you not perceive that he frustrates his own aim?" [...] He continued by explaining why he felt that Wordsworth's concept fell short of any useful purpose: [...] "For if we are of God's indivisible essence, and receive our separate consciousness from the wall of flesh which, at our birth, was raised between us and the Found of Being, we must, on the dissolution of the body... be again merged in the simple and uncompounded Godhead, lose our individual consciousness... in another sense, become as though we had never been." [...] He concluded his analysis with a critique of the poem as a whole: [...] "I should say that Wordsworth does not display in it any great clearness of thought, or felicity of language... the ode in question is not so much abstruse in idea as crabbed in expression. There appears to be a laborious toiling after originality, ending in a dismal want of harmony." ...|$|E

60|$|But to take Things as they are, {{and only}} talk {{by way of}} natural Consequence, for to argue from Nature is {{certainly}} the best Way {{to find out the}} Devil's Story; if there are good and evil Spirits attending us, that is to say, a good Angel and a Devil, then 'tis no unjust Reproach upon any Body to say, when they follow the Dictates of the latter, <b>the</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> them; or they are Devils; nay, I must carry it farther still, namely, that as the Generality and greatest Number of People do follow and obey the evil Spirit and not the good, and that the predominate Power is allowed to be the nominating Power; you must then allow, that in short, the greater Part of Mankind has the Devil in them, and so I come to my Text.|$|E
