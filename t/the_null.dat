40|$|Keck Interferometer is a NASA-funded {{project to}} combine the two 10 m Keck telescopes for high {{sensitivity}} nearinfrared fringe visibility measurements, nulling interferometry at 10 µm to measure the quantity of exozodiacal emission around nearby stars, and differential-phase measurements to detect &quot;hot-Jupiters &quot; by their direct emission. It is being developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the W. M. Keck Observatory, and the Michelson Science Center.

However, <b>the</b> <b>null</b> result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned.

5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>null</b> map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E
25|$|As such, {{the only}} {{hypothesis}} {{that needs to}} be specified in this test and which embodies the counter-claim is referred to as <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis (that is, the hypothesis to be nullified).

That is, as per the reductio ad absurdum reasoning, the statistically significant result should be highly improbable if <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis is assumed to be true. The rejection of <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis implies that the correct hypothesis lies in the logical complement of <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis.

25|$|Fallacy of the {{transposed}} conditional, aka prosecutor's fallacy: criticisms arise {{because the}} hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (<b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis) to be favored, since {{what is being}} evaluated is probability of the observed result given <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis and not probability of <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis given the observed result.

40|$|In this paper, an {{anti-jamming}} method, {{which turns}} the single objective optimization problem into a multi-objective optimization problem by utilizing 2 -norm, is proposed.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation and practical outdoor experiments with the GPS L 1 band C/A signals.

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. <b>The</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis is that no radioactive material is in the suitcase and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how {{likely it is that}} we would observe 10 counts per minute if <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis were true. If <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus we can say that the suitcase is compatible with <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with <b>the</b> <b>null</b> hypothesis, and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E

40|$|Differential phase {{observations}} with a near-IR interferometer offer a way {{to obtain}} spectra of extrasolar planets. The method makes use of the wavelength dependence of the interferometer phase of the planet/star system, which depends both on the interferometer geometry and on the brightness ratio between the planet and the star. The differential phase is strongly affected by instrumental and atmospheric dispersion effects. Difficulties in calibrating these effects might prevent {{the application of the}} differential phase method to systems with a very high contrast, such as extrasolar planets. A promising alternative is the use of spectrally resolved closure phases, which are immune to many of the systematic and random errors affecting the single-baseline phases. We have modeled the response of the AMBER instrument at the VLTI to realistic models of known extrasolar planetary systems, taking into account their theoretical spectra as well as the geometry of the VLTI. We present a strategy to determine the geometry of the planetary system and the spectrum of the extrasolar planet from closure phase observations in two steps. We show that there is a close relation between <b>the</b> <b>nulls</b> in <b>the</b> closure phase and <b>the</b> <b>nulls</b> in <b>the</b> corresponding single-baseline phases: every second null of a single-baseline phase is also a <b>null</b> in <b>the</b> closure phase. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>nulls</b> in <b>the</b> closure phase do not depend on the spectrum but only on the geometry. Therefore the geometry of the system can be determined by measuring <b>the</b> <b>nulls</b> in <b>the</b> closure phase, and braking the remaining ambiguity due to the unknown system orientation by means of observations at different hour angles. Based on the known geometry, the planet spectrum can then be directly synthesized from the closure phases.
