Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining.

5|$|Boeing {{issued a}} {{petition}} for bankruptcy 22 June 1971, which {{was carried out}} by Oslo District Court the following day. The two remaining Boeing aircraft were re-registered with Aer Lingus on 10 June. By late August the debt in the company had been assessed to NOK30 million, making it the largest bankruptcy <b>till</b> <b>then</b> in Norwegian history. The largest creditor was Boeing, which was owed NOK7 million. The creditors and shareholders lost all of their investments in the company because the airline's limited assets were used to pay outstanding wages. Tjøntveit stated on 8 September that he intended to sue Boeing for damages from the seizure of the aircraft, but by October no writ of summons had been received by the manufacturer.|$|E

Diganth had appeared in Bhat's Mungaru Male in a cameo and Krishnan had <b>till</b> <b>then</b> appeared in only one Kannada film as an actor. Bhat then announced of having cast Puneeth Rajkumar to play the other lead on 6 June. Opposite the three male leads, actresses Daisy Bopanna, Neethu and Chaya Singh were signed. However, the role of Puneeth later went to Ganesh, {{at a time when}} Mungaru Male, his film with Bhat was still performing strongly at theatres. His signing was confirmed on 16 June.

5|$|The Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401 {{confirmed}} {{the status of}} Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław's overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, {{the implications of the}} union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent defensive alliance between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's hand for a new war against the Teutonic Order in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had <b>till</b> <b>then</b> been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania.|$|E

Kamran Akmal could not play for the Royals in the match because of Sri Lanka's tour of Pakistan. It was also the last competitive game played by Warne at the Lord's Cricket Ground.|$|E
