30|$|If the risk-free rate is not zero, {{condition}} (18) has to hold to make {{prices in}} the no-tax and the <b>tax</b> <b>economy</b> equal. Kruschwitz and Löffler (2009) discover that for the CAPM with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), for every no-tax economy there is a <b>tax</b> <b>economy</b> with equal prices. They use arguments from a mean-variance utility approach. I use exponential utility, which is a CARA utility, and normal consumption, which lead to the CAPM (Cochrane 2005, pp. 154 – 155), and SDF arguments to derive the result that CARA utility together with multivariate normal payoffs works to obtain for every no-tax economy a <b>tax</b> <b>economy</b> with the same prices. I will keep the risk-free asset in zero net supply. With multivariate normal payoffs, I have to relax the assumption of a finite and discrete payoff space.|$|E

However, low <b>tax</b> <b>economies</b> and the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are also becoming more significant. Econometric analysis shows that factors such as openness to trade, GDP per capita, population, human capital and unit labour costs help to explain the level of these profits. ...|$|R

30|$|I {{continue}} {{to construct the}} portfolio rule so that consumption is equal in both economies and that markets clear.

This paper examines the potential discrepancy between this rate and the corresponding rate of consumer welfare change as measured by Allais distributable surplus.

An elementary simulation model of a <b>taxed</b> <b>economy</b> suggests that the rate of welfare change may differ from the rate of technical change by as much as 50 % under plausible circumstances.

3000|$|A {{special case}} is {{marginal}} utility linear in consumption of all agents, i.e., something like u_i'(c_i 1)=a_i + b_i c_i 1, and equal time discount factors β =β _i for all i. Then, all individual SDFs are equal and lie within the payoff space. With equal time discount factors, the SDF depends on aggregate consumption in t= 0 and t= 1 and some constants (see Appendix B). In equilibrium agents consume all {{what they have}} since it is optimal to do that. Aggregate consumption must be {{the same in the}} no-tax and the <b>tax</b> <b>economy,</b> because agents are given the same endowments, and pre-tax payoffs are the same. Thus, for linear marginal utility and equal time discount factors the SDF(s) are the same in the no-tax and the <b>tax</b> <b>economy.</b> Given zero risk-free rates, asset prices must be the same as well. An example of this case for quadratic utility is given in Sect. 4.2. 1. Furthermore, with equal SDFs in both economies, if the risk-free rate is not zero, there is no price equality, because Proposition 2 does not hold anymore. 8 [...]...|$|E
30|$|I {{extend the}} {{analysis}} of Kruschwitz and Löffler (2009) {{about the effects of}} capital gains taxes on asset pricing. Specifically, they analyze cases when taxes do not change prices in a mean-variance CAPM with consumption only at one future point in time. I extend the analysis to agents who maximize expected utility over consumption. I construct two economies that have equal endowments, utility functions of investors and payoffs. I look at economies with consumption at t= 0 and t= 1. I find that, with a risk-free rate of zero, taxes on returns have zero value. Using this result, I can show that for a no-tax economy there exists a <b>tax</b> <b>economy</b> with the same asset prices. This is the case when investors change their portfolios to consume the same in the <b>tax</b> <b>economy</b> in every state as in the no-tax economy. This implies the same portfolio rule as proposed in Kruschwitz and Löffler (2009). With a non-zero risk-free rate equilibria with equal prices and in which agents consume the same in the tax as in the no-tax economy do not generally exist. In the case of linear marginal utility, prices are always different in both economies for a non-zero risk-free rate.|$|E

The shape of the Laffer curve is shown to be closely associated with both the theoretical underpinnings of the crowding out hypothesis and {{the literature on the}} disincentive effects of taxation; i. e., a permanent reduction in average tax rate is strong enough (insufficient) to allow the government debt to be paid off in the long run without the need for subsequent tax increases mainly in highly <b>taxed</b> <b>economies</b> (economies with crowding out performance). ...|$|R
40|$|The Arab economies {{present a}} unique {{opportunity}} to test the tax model of capital structure. These economies may be dichotomized into taxable and non-taxable states. The results support a number of implications of the tax-based theories of capital structure. We document relatively higher leverage in economies that impose a corporate income tax. We also document that leverage is significantly positive in the proxy for corporate marginal tax rate. In addition, we find that non-debt tax shield is a positive and significant determinant of capital structure in non-taxed economies, but is insignificant in <b>taxed</b> <b>economies.</b> Additionally, we find that leverage is systematically related to size, collateral, and profitability. The overall results are suggestive of the portability of capital structure theory(ies) across diverse economies. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{endogeneity}} of the risk-free rate {{makes clear}} that {{a change in the}} risk-free rate is triggered by some fundamental change in the economy. Thus, it is not instructive to compare the pair of a no-tax and a <b>tax</b> <b>economy</b> at a zero risk-free rate with a pair of economies at a different risk-free rate. Furthermore, the same value for the risk-free rate can be obtained through different changes of fundamental parameters, leading to different prices and price differences in both economies. Therefore, I restrict the analysis to changes in the probabilities of states one and three.|$|E
30|$|Before I {{turn to the}} {{portfolio}} rule, I will make some remarks. With equal individual SDFs, i.e., with m_i^*=m_i for i= 1,...,I, and with a zero risk-free rate, which makes prices of taxes and transfers zero, asset prices in both economies must be the same and pre-tax prices are equal to after-tax prices: p=p^*τ=p^*. Asset prices in the <b>tax</b> <b>economy</b> are p^*τ=E[m^*_iX^τ]=E[m^*_i(X - T)]. Using this and noting that E[m_iT]= 0, it follows that p^*τ=E[m_i^* X^τ]=E[m^*_i(X - T)]=E[m_iX]=p. With equal initial portfolios equal prices imply that agents have the same financial wealth after initial consumption in both economies: W^F_i=W_i^*Fτ=W_i^*F.|$|E
