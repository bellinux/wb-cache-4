5|$|A {{prospectus}} {{was issued}} which contained a detailed {{breakdown of the}} likely costs, revenue and profits of such a scheme, and the promotors prepared to obtain an Act of Parliament. During this <b>time,</b> <b>someone</b> challenged the original survey and another local surveyor was asked to review it. John Beauchamp suggested that no locks would be required on the upper section, but that costs {{were likely to be}} £15,234. This was later raised to £18,000, and the Act of Parliament, which authorised the construction of a canal that followed Hammett's plans, was obtained on 28 May 1827. The proprietors were empowered to raise £18,000 by the issue of 360 shares of £50 each, with powers to raise another £5,000 by mortgage, or to borrow any part of the £18,000 from the Exchequer Bills Commissioners.|$|E

25|$|Crazy Horse {{lived in}} a Lakota camp in present-day Wyoming with his younger half-brother, Little Hawk, son of Iron Between Horns and Waglula. Little Hawk was the nephew of his {{maternal}} step-grandfather, Long Face, and a cousin, High Horse. In 1854, the camp was entered by Lieutenant John Lawrence Grattan and 29 other U.S. troopers, who intended to arrest a Miniconjou man for having stolen a cow. The cow had wandered into the camp, and after a short <b>time</b> <b>someone</b> butchered it and passed the meat out among the people. When the soldiers fatally shot Chief Conquering Bear, the Lakota returned fire, killing all 30 soldiers and a civilian interpreter in what was later called the Grattan massacre.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{not certain}} that the first <b>time</b> <b>someone</b> robs a bank they will be caught, if they {{continue}} to rob banks, they will most likely be caught. Few criminals are able to make a successful living out of bank robbery over the long run. Bank robberies are still fairly common and are indeed successful, although eventually many bank robbers are found and arrested. A report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation states that, among Category I serious crimes, the arrest rate for bank robbery in 2001 was second only to that of murder. Today most organized crime groups tend to make their money by other means, such as extortion, drug trafficking, gambling, prostitution, loan sharking, identity theft, or online scamming and phishing.|$|E
25|$|Around this <b>time</b> <b>someone</b> {{close to}} Sverre wrote a speech against the bishops, En tale mot biskopene. In this work, the unknown author {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} King and Church. By referring to well known theological works such as the Decretum Gratiani and the writings of Augustine of Hippo, the author attempted {{to prove that the}} excommunication of Sverre was unjust and thus not binding. The author also tried to defend the right of Sverre to appoint bishops. To support this view he had to interpret Norwegian law, since the Church had long considered this to be simony. By now Sverre had his hands full with the church-supported Bagler rising, and the direct struggle with the church became a sideshow, at least for him personally.|$|E

25|$|Plato first {{articulated}} the emission theory, {{the idea that}} visual perception is accomplished by rays emitted by the eyes. He also commented on the parity reversal of mirrors in Timaeus. Some hundred years later, Euclid wrote a treatise entitled Optics where he linked vision to geometry, creating geometrical optics. He based his work on Plato's emission theory wherein he described the mathematical rules of perspective and described the effects of refraction qualitatively, although he questioned that {{a beam of light}} from the eye could instantaneously light up the stars every <b>time</b> <b>someone</b> blinked. Ptolemy, in his treatise Optics, held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. He summarised much of Euclid and went on to describe a way to measure the angle of refraction, though he failed to notice the empirical relationship between it and the angle of incidence.|$|E
25|$|The action {{begins when}} a Yugoslav {{military}} attaché defects in Ottawa and is assassinated before the Canadians can interrogate him. In Trieste, {{at the same}} <b>time,</b> <b>someone</b> has begun eliminating NATO agents. Higgins, their case officer, is warned by Avadek {{that he has a}} traitor in his network. Suddenly, he's running for his life, framed for the murder of one of his contacts. Pursued by an unknown enemy, he falls in love with Fae, whose violent past figures in their search for answers. Meanwhile, Vitali Alferyev, KGB station chief in Belgrade, has been recalled to Moscow, where his superior orders him to withdraw all covert operatives from the sector between Rijeka and Ljubljana. Alferyev’s search for the reason leads him into a deadly conflict with a GRU agent operating in the area. The novel reaches its climax in the Yugoslav mountains, where Croatian terrorists, KGB spies, and NATO agents play out the final violent moves in a dangerous game to change the fate of Europe. Higgins and Avadek must sift through layers of deceit and treachery in their attempt to thwart an enemy whose tentacles stretch from the East to the West and from the past to the (novel’s) present.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{found in}} {{classical}} Athenian tragedy {{an art form}} that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in The Birth of Tragedy was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian Kunsttrieben ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the satyr. He is {{the horror of the}} annihilation of the principle of individuality and at the same <b>time</b> <b>someone</b> who delights in its destruction. Both of these principles are meant to represent cognitive states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{forensic}} entomology became {{well known}} through {{the trial of}} David Westerfield in 2002 for the abduction and murder of seven-year-old Danielle van Dam. In this San Diego case, the courtroom became a battle over conflicting reports from four forensic entomologists: David Faulkner, Neal Haskell, M. Lee Goff, and Robert D. Hall. A fifth scientist, William Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist, also testified on this issue. Danielle had vanished from her bedroom the night of February 1–2; her partially decomposed body was found February 27. Haskell, Hall, and Faulker argued that forensic entomology established that the body of was dumped in mid-February, during which time Westerfield was already under police surveillance (since February 5), while Goff said the victim's body was colonized by larvae earlier than the other three entomologists estimated (his dates were February 9 to 14). His dates were earlier as he used new data from Canada which gives a significantly slower development for that fly species. Richard Merritt, a forensic entomologist and professor at Michigan State University, stated that because each scientist has his own method, {{this can lead to}} disagreement, {{but a lot of the}} disagreements involve a variation of one or two days, not over a week and a half as in the Westerfield case: “If it's that big a <b>time,</b> <b>someone</b> screwed up”.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last <b>time</b> <b>someone</b> paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of the investigation.|$|E
