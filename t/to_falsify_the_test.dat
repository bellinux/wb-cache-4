50|$|It is hard {{to explain}} what it is for someone to have an innate concept since {{empirical}} evidence to support this theory {{is hard to}} find. In other words, {{there is no way}} <b>to</b> <b>falsify</b> <b>the</b> theory unless empirical evidence is found.|$|R

50|$|Such {{a theory}} {{would be true}} with higher probability, because it cannot be {{attacked}} so easily: <b>to</b> <b>falsify</b> <b>the</b> first one, it is sufficient {{to find that the}} sun has stopped rising; <b>to</b> <b>falsify</b> <b>the</b> second one, one additionally needs the assumption that the given day has not yet been reached. Popper held that it is the least likely, or most easily falsifiable, or simplest theory (attributes which he identified as all the same thing) that explains known facts that one should rationally prefer. His opposition to positivism, which held that it is the theory most likely to be true that one should prefer, here becomes very apparent. It is impossible, Popper argues, to ensure a theory to be true; it is more important that its falsity can be detected as easily as possible.|$|R

40|$|This short {{reaction}} {{piece to}} an article by Emily Kadens asks why a long-refuted story of an alleged uniform medieval lex mercatoria is still being maintained.

Attempts <b>to</b> <b>falsify</b> <b>the</b> myth with historical data are therefore futile: the myth derives its value not from its truth value but from its symbolic power...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether or}} not {{strategic}} philanthropy has {{a positive influence on}} human resources, and thereby gives a company a competitive advantage. This is being scrutinized through a case study of the Danish optician, Louis Nielsen, which is an affiliate of the international company Specsavers. The purpose of this thesis is <b>to</b> <b>falsify</b> <b>the</b> following hypothesis: Louis Nielsen’s philanthropic work generates an increased affective commitment experienced by the employees towards Louis Nielsen, thereby increasing the competitive advantage of the company. Statistical research has been executed, by collecting survey data from the employees at Louis Nielsen, in order to determine whether Louis Nielsen’s philanthropic initiatives have a positive causal correlation with affective commitment. The research has a particular focus on the philanthropic project, Giv Syn til Tanzania (Give Sight to Tanzania), where Louis Nielsen donates used glasses to less fortune people in Tanzania. Our conducted analysis finds a strong positive causal correlation between indicators of affective com-mitment and philanthropy. It also finds a strong positive causal correlation between affective commit-ment indicators and employee retention. Therefore, it is not possible <b>to</b> <b>falsify</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|A general {{framework}} {{is given to}} analyze the falsifiability of economic models based on a sample of their observable components. It is shown that, when the restrictions implied by the economic theory are insufficient to identify the unknown quantities of the structure, the duality of optimal transportation with zero–one cost function delivers interpretable and operational formulations of the hypothesis of specification correctness from which tests can be constructed <b>to</b> <b>falsify</b> <b>the</b> model...|$|R
5|$|We {{first learned}} about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002. It is also {{important}} to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts <b>to</b> <b>falsify</b> <b>the</b> facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} popularized {{as a result}} of a number of {{high-profile}} corporate accounting scandal defendants claiming that all wrongdoing was performed by others, without the defendant's knowledge or consent. Attorneys for these defendants claimed that their skill was in valuation and deal-making, and that they lacked the training to recognize fraudulent accounting practices they claimed that they would have needed. However, in many cases the defendants' subordinates testified that the defendants ordered them <b>to</b> <b>falsify</b> <b>the</b> accounts.|$|R
