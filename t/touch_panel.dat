In this paper, we propose a simple method of adding a tactile sensation of a ridge, using just a thin sheet. The sheet has ridges that are haptically imperceptible, but once a visual cue such as a line is presented, visuotactile cross-modal response induces a haptic ridge. We tested the effects of the visual cue and height of the ridge. The result showed that the visual cue definitely enhances feeling of a ridge...|$|R

30|$|<b>Touch</b> <b>panels</b> {{have a great}} {{market demand}} due to their {{brilliant}} operation performances [1 – 3]. As an electrode component for these <b>touch</b> <b>panels,</b> the double-sided transparent conductive film (TCF) with high transparency and conductivity {{on both sides of}} a substrate is demanded [4]. Currently, in the preparation process of double-sided transparent conductive films, two single-sided indium tin oxide (ITO) films were prepared firstly, and then the two single-sided ITO films were pasted on the two sides of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate as upper or under circuit [5, 6]. This process is very complicated and prolixity. In addition, due to the high cost and fragility of ITO, there is a demand to replace ITO with other conductive films and develop a new preparation method for double-sided transparent conductive films.|$|R
40|$|Recently large wall-sized {{displays}} {{are often}} seen in public environment. Such wall-sized displays only show informa-tion to users, but do not allow users to interact information on the wall. Some input devices, such as <b>touch</b> <b>panels,</b> could be used, {{but it is hard}} to develop larger <b>touch</b> <b>panels</b> and they are extremely expensive. On the different perspective, one of the main roles of such wall-sized displays is to deliver information. However, few displays allow users to obtain de-tailed information. This paper describes a wall-sized display system which allows users to manipulate displayed informa-tion by using their hand or fingers. Moreover, by using 2 -D barcode which can be recognized by recent mobile phones, the system allows users to receive displayed information to their mobile phones and to send information in the mobile phones to the display. 1...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{extensive}} {{progress has}} been made in the development of primary and applied aspects of fabrication of transparent conductive electrodes especially in flexible, stretchable, low-cost, and lightweight electrode materials for the enhancement of energy generation devices. Fabrication of high-performance transparent conductive flexible plastic is necessary for industrial-scale manufacturing with an extensive range of applications. Transparent electrodes (TE’s) are optically transparent to visible light and are electrically conductive. These qualities are important for many renewable energy conversion processes. As transparent electrodes, they are widely used in industry, especially in optoelectronic devices. TE’s are essential components for <b>touch</b> <b>panels,</b> organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Functionalized nanomaterials having the characteristic properties such as flexible, stretchable, and lightweight-based TE’s are promising substitutes for commonly used indium tin oxide (ITO) -based TE’s for future flexible optoelectronic devices. This chapter broadly summarizes recent developments in the fabrication, properties, modification, patterning, and integration of functionalized nanomaterials for the applications of optoelectronic devices. Their challenges and potential applications, such as in <b>touch</b> <b>panels,</b> optoelectronic devices, liquid crystal displays, and photovoltaic cells, are discussed in detail. Despite many challenges, nanomaterials such as carbon nanotube and graphene TE’s have exhibited various applications in optoelectronic devices and some commercially available products such as <b>touch</b> <b>panels</b> of smartphones.
