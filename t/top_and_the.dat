An oval eye opening is overlain by a sculpted eyebrow with grooves forming individual hairs, while grooves around the oval may represent eyelashes. The <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of the}} fragment each have three holes, presumably used to attach it to the helmet; the top three may have attached it to the helmet cap, the bottom three {{to some form of}} face protection such as a facemask or camail.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gettysburg was {{depicted}} in the 1993 film Gettysburg, based on Michael Shaara's 1974 novel The Killer Angels. The film and novel focused primarily on the actions of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, John Buford, Robert E. Lee, and James Longstreet during the battle. The first day focused on Buford's cavalry defense, the second day on Chamberlain's defense at Little Round <b>Top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> third day on Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|The local {{authorities}} run cycle hire centres at Ashbourne, Parsley Hay, Middleton <b>Top</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Upper Derwent Valley. Wheelchair access is possible at several {{places on the}} former railway trails, and cycle hire centres offer vehicles adapted to wheelchair users. There is a programme to make footpaths more accessible to less-agile walkers by replacing climbing stiles with walkers' gates.|$|E

5|$|The main armor belt was Krupp {{cemented}} and nineinches (230mm) thick, but {{narrowed to}} six and three inches (150 and 76mm) closer to {{each end of}} the ships. The barbettes were protected by nine-inch armor, while the turret had a twelve-inch (300mm) front, eight-inch (200mm) sides, and a two- to three-inch (51to76mm) <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> conning tower had twelve-inch armor. The deck armor had multiple decks of one-and-a-half to twoinches (38to51mm), oneinch (25mm), and oneinch.|$|E
5|$|Both Spykers {{and both}} Super Aguris were {{knocked out of}} the first phase of qualifying, along with Alexander Wurz's Williams and Vitantonio Liuzzi's Toro Rosso. For Super Aguri's Takuma Sato, it did not matter where he qualified, as he was docked ten places, due to {{overtaking}} Jenson Button under yellow flags at the last Grand Prix. Spykers Adrian Sutil was hoping for a wet race after an unspectacular qualifying. At {{the front end of the}} grid, the McLarens were first and fourth, with Hamilton on <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ferraris splitting them in third and fourth. Heikki Kovalainen rounded out the top five.|$|E
5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the neckline of her dress. The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|E

5|$|Considered one of {{the symbols}} of Tiruchirappalli, the Rockfort is a {{fortress}} which stands atop a 273-foot-high rock. It consists {{of a set of}} monolithic rocks accommodating many rock-cut cave temples. Originally built by the Pallavas, it was later reconstructed by the Madurai Nayaks and Vijayanagara rulers. The temple complex has three shrines, two of which are dedicated to Lord Ganesha, one at the foot and the Ucchi Pillayar Temple at the <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Thayumanavar Temple between them. The Thayumanavar temple, the largest of the three, houses a shrine for Pārvatī as well as the main deity. The Rockfort is visible from almost every part of the city's north. The Teppakulam {{at the foot of the}} Rockfort is surrounded by bazaars. It has a mandapa at its centre and has facilities for boat riding.|$|E
5|$|She was {{scheduled}} {{to play the role}} of Madame Liang in the film production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Flower Drum Song, but was unable to take the role due to failing health. On February 3, 1961, at the age of 56, Wong died of a heart attack as she slept at home in Santa Monica, two days after her final screen performance on the television show The Barbara Stanwyck Show. Her cremated remains were interred in her mother's grave at Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles. The headstone is marked with her mother's Anglicized name on <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Chinese names of Anna May (on the right) and her sister Mary (on the left) along the sides.|$|E
5|$|The pay of a praefectus of an {{auxiliary}} regiment {{in the early}} 2nd century has been estimated at over 50 times that of a miles (common soldier). (This compares to a full colonel in the British Army, who is currently paid about five times a private's salary). The reason for the huge gap between the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the pyramid is that Roman society was far more hierarchical than a modern one. A praefectus {{was not just a}} senior officer. He was also a Roman citizen (which most of his men were not) and, {{as a member of the}} equestrian order, an aristocrat. The social gulf between the praefectus and a peregrinus soldier was thus immense, and the pay differential reflected that fact.|$|E

5|$|Bunning's {{perfect game}} {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished at the <b>top</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, {{in his first season}} with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game. Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's Day, could not have come at a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} junior {{officer who had}} distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months, but his disrating {{was one of the}} primary triggers to the mutiny. About a week before the mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> captain noticed that a gasket, one of the ties that held the sail securely, had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. Casey was brought before the captain, and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it. The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees, a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman. Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way. Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused, the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes (more commonly a sailor's punishment than that of a junior officer), and he was disrated, which would effectively end his career as a naval officer. Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew and they felt that he was punished unfairly. The topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E
5|$|The Delhi Durbar Tiara {{was made}} by Garrard & Co. for Queen Mary, the wife of George V, to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. As British law {{prohibited}} {{the removal of the}} Crown Jewels from the country, George V wore a specially made crown (the Imperial Crown of India) to the Durbar, and his consort Queen Mary wore the tiara. It was part of a set of jewellery made for Queen Mary to use at the event which included a necklace, stomacher, brooch and earrings. Made of gold and platinum, the tiara is 8cm (3in) tall and has the form of a tall circlet of lyres and S-scrolls linked by festoons of diamonds. It was originally set with 10 of the Cambridge emeralds, acquired by Queen Mary in 1910 and first owned by her grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. In 1912, the tiara was altered to take {{one or both of the}} Cullinan III and IV diamonds; the pear-shaped diamond was held at the <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cushion-shaped stone hung in the oval aperture underneath. Mary lent the tiara to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) for the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, and it remained with her until she died in 2002, when it passed to Queen Elizabeth II. In 2005, the Queen lent the tiara to her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall.|$|E

As in B/D, the declaration of the top/bottom may be required, though sadomasochists may also play without any power exchange at all, with both partners equally in control of the play.|$|E
