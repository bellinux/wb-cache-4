5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes.

5|$|The present {{structure}} has many traces of great antiquity, being large and {{built in the}} form of a cross, with a door of early Gothic architecture. The building was probably erected some time after the Norman Conquest, as the plain pointed arch prevails throughout; exactly when we cannot be sure, though possibly after 1246. The earliest visible stonework is <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century,</b> in the tower and the arches supporting it. The external appearance of the church is large and ancient, being erected of rubble stone, with ashlar quoins and windows. The severe appearance and thick walls of the nave suggest Norman architecture, however the presence of pointed lancet windows indicate that it is early Gothic, perhaps from early <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Internally the church is {{in the form of}} an aisleless cruciform church with substantial transepts. It was rebuilt (or built afresh) in the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> after a fire, and the chancel extended in the fifteenth century, after which the structure was largely complete as it is seen today.|$|E
5|$|In the High Middle Ages, Scotland {{adopted the}} Romanesque {{in the late}} twelfth century and {{retained}} and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and did not survive the effect of time and of the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors such as the sacrament houses at Deskford and Kinkell and the carvings of the seven deadly sins at Rosslyn Chapel. From the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century,</b> there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies such as the elaborate Douglas tombs {{in the town of}} Douglas. Native craftsmanship can be seen in items such as the Bute mazer and the Savernake Horn, and more widely in the large number of high quality seals that survive from the mid <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> onwards.

5|$|The first {{historical}} {{mention of}} the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Before the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century,</b> and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, grains of paradise or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|E

5|$|A more {{elaborate}} style known as decorated Gothic, applying ornamentation to vaults and pillars, particularly using curved motifs, {{began to be}} adopted in the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> and was characteristic of Scottish church building in the fourteenth century. It was used at Dunblane Cathedral, built in the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century,</b> particularly to decorate the nave and East end. At Fortrose in the Highlands the elaborate decoration of this style is still visible in the south aisle. One of the finest examples is Sweetheart Abbey near Dumfries, a Cistercian monastery, named after the burial of John de Balliol's heart alongside the body of his wife. The period of the Wars of Independence (1296–1357) saw {{a large number of}} ecclesiastical buildings ruined, including Melrose and Jedburgh Abbeys. Church building was largely confined to the parish churches in the relatively secure areas like Fife, as at St. Monans, originally a church of the Dominican friars.|$|E

5|$|The first astrological book {{published}} in Europe was the Liber Planetis et Mundi Climatibus ("Book of the Planets and Regions of the World"), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, {{and may have}} been authored by Gerbert of Aurillac. Ptolemy's second century AD Tetrabiblos was translated into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas followed Aristotle in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect 'sublunary' body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul. The <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> mathematician Campanus of Novara is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the prime vertical into 'houses' of equal 30° arcs, though the system was used earlier in the East. The <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote a textbook, the Liber Astronomicus, a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned {{at the end of the}} fifteenth century.|$|E
