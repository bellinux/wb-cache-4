500|$|In a Japanese-style commercial, {{with both}} Japanese and English texts, {{she plays a}} Barbie-like doll with pink hair. Each scene ends with Lee crying. During the bridge, two girls in an {{elevator}} are seen laughing at the model's appearance, stating that she looks much older than they thought she was. Next scene, she is shown in a bathtub singing the song to herself. Another segment shows her breaking a mirror with her bare hand, which starts to bleed uncontrollably. In the final scene, she stands {{on the balcony of}} a building, crying and screaming at a billboard featuring one of her advertisements, saying that the model side of her isn't [...] "real and you can't save me", and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> oblivious to how she really lives.|$|E
2500|$|Incapacitation – Designed {{simply to}} keep criminals away from society so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> {{protected}} from their misconduct. This is often achieved through prison sentences today. [...] The death penalty or banishment have served the same purpose.|$|E

"Framing is {{a process}} whereby communicators, {{consciously}} or unconsciously, act to construct {{a point of view}} that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner," [...] wrote Kuypers.

50|$|By then, Charol was {{starting}} to develop tuberculosis. It was during this time that his popularity among Argentine boxing fans rose even more, because, despite <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> aware of his illness, he fought on, winning three more bouts.|$|R
2500|$|Two months later, Shelby {{said that}} he {{believed}} Taran and Cronin both knew more than they claimed about Ben's disappearance, as Kelly had before his death. In 2014 he wrote that he still had investigators working the case and knew more than {{he was able to}} say. [...] "There is much I could tell you <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> not privy to knowing! ... here is coming a point in time [...] I will reveal answers to most of the questions associated with our son's disappearance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{disposed}} {{of the arguments}} against allowing lawyer advertising, the Court ruled that Arizona's total ban on lawyer advertising violated the free speech guarantee of the First Amendment. [...] But that {{did not mean that}} states were powerless to regulate lawyer advertising at all. [...] The Court reiterated that states were still permitted to ban [...] "false, deceptive, or misleading" [...] advertising by lawyers; to regulate the manner in which lawyers may solicit business in person; to require warnings and disclaimers on lawyer advertising in order to assure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> not misled; and impose other reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of lawyer advertising.|$|E

25|$|On the {{day after}} Jowell's speech, an {{independent}} not-for-profit company, Digital UK, was established to co-ordinate the switchover process.

25|$|Social {{attitudes towards}} {{child sexual abuse}} are {{extremely}} negative, with some surveys ranking it as morally worse than murder. Early research showed {{that there was a}} great deal of misunderstanding and unrealistic perceptions in <b>the</b> general <b>public</b> about child sexual abuse and pedophiles. However, a 2004 study concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> well-informed on some aspects of these subjects.|$|R
60|$|SIR,--I {{can hardly}} imagine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> {{in the very}} {{smallest}} degree interested in the shrill shrieks of 'Plagiarism' that proceed {{from time to time}} out of the lips of silly vanity or incompetent mediocrity.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} {{contributor}} naturally feels <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> {{the test of}} his excellence, but he must not forget that the editor {{is the beginning of}} the public; and I believe he is a faithfuller and kinder critic than the writer will ever find again.|$|E

25|$|In the 1982–83 season, CBS {{significantly}} {{reduced the number}} of regular season broadcasts from 18 to four. <b>The</b> rationale was <b>that</b> cable television networks (namely, the USA Network and ESPN) were carrying a large number of regular season games (at least 40 each). In return, CBS executives believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> being oversaturated with NBA coverage.|$|R
50|$|A {{first test}} {{screening}} of the film was scheduled for November 22, 1963, {{the day of the}} John F. Kennedy assassination.

50|$|Finland {{participates in}} nearly all sub-areas of the Partnership for Peace programme, and has {{provided}} peacekeeping forces to both the Afghanistan and Kosovo missions. However, a 2005 poll indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> strongly against NATO membership.

60|$|Thank you {{for your}} words on spiritualism. I have not yet seen the last 'Cornhill.' It pleases me that Thackeray has {{had the courage to}} {{maintain}} the facts before the public; I think much the better of him for doing so. Owen's book I shall try to get. There is a weak reference to the subject in the 'Saturday Review' (against it), and I see an article advertised in 'Once a Week,' all proving <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> awaking to a consideration of the class of phenomena. Investigation is all I desire. The 'Spiritual Magazine' lingers so this month that I fear, and Robert hopes, something may have happened to it.|$|E
60|$|In England we are groaning {{under the}} brigandage of the butcher, {{which is being}} carried to that height that I think I foresee {{resistance}} {{on the part of}} the middle-class, and some combination in perspective for abolishing the middleman, whensoever he turns up (which is everywhere) between producer and consumer. The cattle plague is the butcher's stalking-horse, and it is unquestionably worse than it was; but seeing that the great majority of creatures lost or destroyed have been cows, and likewise that the rise in butchers' meat bears no reasonable proportion to the market prices of the beasts, one comes to the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> done. The commission has ended very weakly and ineffectually, as such things in England rather frequently do; and everybody writes to The Times, and nobody does anything else.|$|E
6000|$|Everything in Bivouac {{bears the}} impress {{of the sublime}} {{principle}} of the institutions. The houses of the private citizens, for instance, overtop the roofs of all the public edifices, to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> merely a servant of the citizen. Even the churches have this peculiarity, proving that the road to heaven is not independent of the popular will. The great Hall of Justice, an edifice of which the Bivouackers are exceedingly proud, is constructed in the same recumbent style, the architect, {{with a view to}} protect himself from the imputation of believing that the firmament was within reach of his hand, having taken the precaution to run up a wooden finger-board from the centre of the building, which points to the place where, according to the notions of all other people, the ridge of the roof itself should have been raised. So very apparent was this peculiarity, Noah observed, that it seemed to him as if the whole [...] "'arth" [...] had been rolled down by a great political rolling-pin, by way of giving the country its finishing touch.|$|E
25|$|Smith earned 40% {{favorable}} and 20% unfavorable {{ratings in}} a December 2007 poll. Smith's office characterized {{the relatively low}} numbers as a reflection on Congress in general; a spokesman for Steve Novick's campaign (Novick lost to Merkley in <b>the</b> primary) suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> frustrated with elected officials and looking to outsiders to effect change, and Merkley's campaign highlighted Smith's shifts in position {{on the war in}} Iraq.|$|R
40|$|William Fortune {{sent letters}} to New York, Chicago, Boston, {{and other cities}} that had {{elevated}} tracks, listing concerns and asking for opinions. Their responses showed no changes in freight charges due to the elevation of <b>the</b> tracks, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> much safer.

50|$|Carroll lost no time {{in attacking}} Macnamara and the Coalition. He claimed Macnamara had {{ceased to be a}} Liberal and stated his belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>were</b> disgusted with <b>the</b> Coalition’s lack of {{principle}} and policy. He said its record was lamentable and barren. The Coalition’s 1918 programme was, he declared, a deception. He came out in favour of a levy on capital wealth, Home Rule for Ireland within the Empire, cooperation in industry and temperance reform.|$|R
60|$|It {{is often}} said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> the real censor. That this is to some extent true is proved {{by the fact that}} plays which are {{licensed}} and produced in London have to be expurgated for the provinces. This {{does not mean that the}} provinces are more strait- laced, but simply that in many provincial towns there is only one theatre for all classes and all tastes, whereas in London there are separate theatres for separate sections of playgoers; so that, for example, Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree can conduct His Majesty's Theatre without the slightest regard to the tastes of the frequenters of the Gaiety Theatre; and Mr. George Edwardes can conduct the Gaiety Theatre without catering in any way for lovers of Shakespear. Thus the farcical comedy which has scandalized the critics in London by the libertinage of its jests is played to the respectable dress circle of Northampton with these same jests slurred over so as to be imperceptible by even the most prurient spectator. The public, in short, takes care that nobody shall outrage it.|$|E
60|$|I {{could prove}} by many {{practical}} instances that even my illustrations are not exaggerated, by many placid proposals I have heard for the vivisection of criminals, {{or by the}} filthy incident of Dr. Neisser. But I prefer here to stick to a strictly logical line of distinction, and insist that whereas in all previous persecutions the violence was used to end our indecision, the whole {{point here is that}} the violence is used to end the indecision of the persecutors. This is what the honest Eugenists really mean, so far as they mean anything. They mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> to be given up, not as a heathen land for conversion, but simply as a pabulum for experiment. That is the real, rude, barbaric sense behind this Eugenic legislation. The Eugenist doctors are not such fools as they look in the light of any logical inquiry about what they want. They do not know what they want, except that they want your soul and body and mine in order to find out. They are quite seriously, as they themselves might say, the first religion to be experimental instead of doctrinal. All other established Churches have been based on somebody having found the truth. This is the first Church that was ever based on not having found it.|$|E
60|$|The clever authoress of In the Golden Days {{has chosen}} for the scene of her story the England of two centuries ago, as a relief, she tells us in her preface, 'from {{perpetual}} nineteenth-centuryism.' Upon the other hand, she makes a pathetic appeal to her readers not to regard her book as an 'historical novel,' {{on the ground that}} such a title strikes terror into the public. This seems to us rather a curious position to take up. Esmond and Notre Dame are historical novels, both of them, and both of them popular successes. John Inglesant and Romola have gone through many editions, and even Salammbo has its enthusiasts. We think <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> very fond of historical novels, and as for perpetual 'nineteenth-centuryism'--a vile phrase, by the way--we only wish that more of our English novelists studied our age and its society than do so at present. However, In the Golden Days must not be judged by its foolish preface. It is really a very charming book, and though Dryden, Betterton, and Wills's Coffee-House are dragged in rather a propos de bottes, still the picture of the time is well painted. Joyce, the little Puritan maiden, is an exquisite creation, and Hugo Wharncliffe, her lover, makes a fine hero. The sketch of Algernon Sidney is rather colourless, but Charles II. is well drawn. It seems to be a novel with a high purpose and a noble meaning. Yet it is never dull.|$|E
2500|$|Talmadge's sister Constance {{sent her}} a {{telegram}} with this advice: [...] "Quit pressing your luck, baby. The critics can't knock those trust funds Mama set up for us". [...] As time passed, it became increasingly clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> no longer interested in its old favorites, and Talmadge {{was seen as an}} icon of the past. Talmadge had been increasingly bored with filmmaking before the talkie challenge came along, and this setback seems to have discouraged her from further attempts.|$|R
50|$|By 1985 the Library {{had grown}} out of its 5,000 square foot space, {{and the board of}} {{trustees}} investigated ideas for library expansion. In 1986, Sedona resident Ethel Low donated $326,000 to buy land. In 1988, the Jordan Road Street Fair began a fundraising campaign, and $9,000 was raised. The Fair's success convinced the Friends of the Library and the board of trustees <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> duly interested and capable of raising the necessary funds for a new Library building.|$|R
2500|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Public</b> and its Problems, Dewey {{presents}} a rebuttal to Walter Lippmann's treatise {{on the role}} of journalism in democracy. [...] Lippmann's model was a basic transmission model in which journalists took information given to them by experts and elites, repackaged that information in simple terms, and transmitted the information to <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> whose role <b>was</b> to react emotionally to the news. [...] In his model, Lippmann supposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>was</b> incapable of thought or action, and that all thought and action should be left to the experts and elites.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked again}} at Michael Angelo's Fates to-day; but cannot satisfactorily make out {{what he meant by}} them. One of them--she who holds the distaff--has her mouth open, as if uttering a cry, and might be fancied to look {{somewhat}} irate. The second, who holds the thread, has a pensive air, but is still, I think, pitiless at heart. The third sister looks closely and coldly into the eyes of the second, meanwhile cutting the thread with a pair of shears. Michael Angelo, if I may presume to say so, wished to vary the expression of these three sisters, and give each a different one, but did not see precisely how, inasmuch as all the fatal Three are united, heart and soul, in one purpose. It is a very impressive group. But, as regards the interpretation of this, or of any other profound picture, there are likely to be as many interpretations as there are spectators. It is very curious to read criticisms upon pictures, and upon the same face in a picture, and by men of taste and feeling, and to find what different conclusions they arrive at. Each man interprets the hieroglyphic in his own way; and the painter, perhaps, had a meaning which none of them have reached; or possibly he put forth a riddle, without himself knowing the solution. There is such a necessity, at all events, of helping the painter out with the spectator's own resources of feeling and imagination, that you can never be sure how much of the picture you have yourself made. There is no doubt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is,</b> to a certain extent, right and sure of its ground, when it declares, through a series of ages, that a certain picture is a great work. It is so; a great symbol, proceeding out of a great mind; but if it means one thing, it seems to mean a thousand, and, often, opposite things.|$|E
6000|$|However, let us leave what {{is really}} a very sordid side of the subject, {{and return to the}} {{question}} of popular control in the matter of Art, by which I mean Public Opinion dictating to the artist the form which he is to use, the mode in which he is to use it, and the materials with which he is to work. I have pointed out that the arts which have escaped best in England are the arts in which the public have not been interested. They are, however, interested in the drama, and as a certain advance has been made in the drama within the last ten or fifteen years, it is {{important to point out that}} this advance is entirely due to a few individual artists refusing to accept the popular want of taste as their standard, and refusing to regard Art as a mere matter of demand and supply. With his marvellous and vivid personality, with a style that has really a true colour-element in it, with his extraordinary power, not over mere mimicry but over imaginative and intellectual creation, Mr Irving, had his sole object been to give the public what they wanted, could have produced the commonest plays in the commonest manner, and made as much success and money as a man could possibly desire. But his object was not that. His object was to realise his own perfection as an artist, under certain conditions, and in certain forms of Art. At first he appealed to the few: now he has educated the many. He has created in the public both taste and temperament. The public appreciate his artistic success immensely. I often wonder, however, whether the public understand that that success is entirely due to the fact that he did not accept their standard, but realised his own. With their standard the Lyceum would have been a sort of second-rate booth, as some of the popular theatres in London are at present. Whether they understand it or not the fact however remains, that taste and temperament have, to a certain extent been created in the public, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> capable of developing these qualities. The problem then is, why do not the public become more civilised? They have the capacity. What stops them? ...|$|E
60|$|Now the {{character}} I have formed to myself {{of a great}} auctioneer is this. I fancy him a man of first-rate and irreproachable birth and fashion. I fancy his person so agreeable {{that it must be}} a pleasure for ladies to behold and tailors to dress it. As a private man he must move in the very best society, which will flock round his pulpit when he mounts it in his public calling. It will be a privilege for vulgar people to attend the hall where he lectures; and they will consider it an honor to be allowed to pay their money for articles the value of which is stamped by his high recommendation. Nor can such a person be a mere fribble; nor can any loose hanger-on of fashion imagine he may assume {{the character}}. The gentleman auctioneer must be an artist above all, adoring his profession; and adoring it, what must he not know? He must have a good knowledge of the history and language of all nations; not the knowledge of the mere critical scholar, but of the lively and elegant man of the world. He will not commit the gross blunders of pronunciation that untravelled Englishmen perpetrate; he will not degrade his subject by coarse eulogy or sicken his audience with vulgar banter. He will know where to apply praise and wit properly; he will have the tact only acquired in good society, and know where a joke is in place, and how far a compliment may go. He will not outrageously and indiscriminately laud all objects committed to his charge, for he knows the value of praise; that diamonds, could we have them by the bushel, would be used as coals; that above all, he has a character of sincerity to support; that he is not merely the advocate of the person who employs him, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>is</b> his client too, who honors him and confides in him. Ask him to sell a copy of Raffaelle for an original; a trumpery modern Brussels counterfeit for real old Mechlin; some common French forged crockery for the old delightful, delicate, Dresden china; and he will quit you with scorn, or order his servant to show you the door of his study.|$|E
40|$|Welfare {{policies}} {{are a common}} feature of many societies and often strongly favored by <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> Research abounds on welfare policy differences across nations yet scholars pay less attention to why and how <b>the</b> <b>public</b> formulate opinions on welfare policies. The following analysis shows evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>are</b> not merely self-interested in their policy preferences. I propose instead {{that they have a}} further goal in mind unrelated to material gains: the reduction of social inequality. I investigate this pos-sibility using survey data from large, representative national samples in Australia...|$|R

As a result of his involvement in the scandal, he declined to contest the next general election.|$|R
