50|$|Unless {{stressed}} by other environmental factors like moisture, the development rate from emergence to maturity for many plants {{depends upon the}} daily air temperature. Because many developmental events of plants and insects depend on the accumulation of specific quantities of heat, {{it is possible to}} predict when these events should occur during a growing season regardless of differences in temperatures from year to year. Growing degrees (GDs) is defined as the number of <b>temperature</b> <b>degrees</b> above a certain threshold base temperature, which varies among crop species. The base temperature is that temperature below which plant growth is zero. GDs are calculated each day as maximum temperature plus the minimum temperature divided by 2 (or the mean temperature), minus the base temperature. GDUs are accumulated by adding each day’s GDs contribution as the season progresses.|$|E
50|$|In operation, an {{electrical}} impulse from a transmitter is {{converted into a}} sound wave by an underwater transducer, called a hydrophone, and sent into the water. When the wave strikes something such as a fish, it is reflected back and displays size, composition, {{and shape of the}} object. The exact extent of what can be discerned depends on the frequency and power of the pulse transmitted. Knowing the speed of the wave in the water, the distance to the object that reflected the wave can be determined. The speed of sound through the water column depends on the temperature, salinity and pressure (depth). This is approximately c = 1404.85 + 4.618T - 0.0523T2 + 1.25S + 0.017D (where c = sound speed (m/s), T = <b>temperature</b> (<b>degrees</b> Celsius), S = salinity (per mille) and D = depth). Typical values used by commercial fish finders are 4921 ft/s (1500 m/s) in seawater and 4800 ft/s (1463 m/s) in freshwater.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Ifosfamide (IFO) is a {{cytotoxic}} alkylating drug {{used for}} the treatment of a variety of cancers, although it has been found to induce certain hematological, hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic side effects. This drug is widely used in developing country, especially Iraq, but without caring too much to the storing temperature due to low drug maintaining facilities. The present work was achieved to investigate the effect of different <b>temperature</b> <b>degrees</b> on the toxicity of IFO on liver and kidney of female rats. Approach: Ifosfamide (60 mg Kg - 1 b. wt) stored at different <b>temperature</b> <b>degrees</b> (4, 10 and 25 °C) was given to female rats to detect the effect of <b>temperature</b> <b>degrees</b> on hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of this chemotherapeutic drug. A modified technique was used for demonstration the dying kidney cells. Results: All IFO treated rats showed Fanconi syndrome such as increase of serum creatinine, phosphorus, ALT and AST and decrease of glucose as well as an increase in serum Malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Ifosfamide was still maintained its antimitotic action in all the treated groups as revealed by examining the bone marrow smears. The biochemical estimation of ALT, AST and MDA showed significant temperature dependent increase in the toxicity of liver and kidney by this drug. The histopathological alteration in these two organs were come supportive to the above biochemical results. The liver of the rats exposed to IFO stored at 25 °C showed higher liver steatosis, hemorrhage and more degeneration of hepatocytes. Similarly, more hemorrhage, degeneration of kidney tubule cells and lymphocytes infiltration in kidney were observed in the 25 °C group in comparison to the other groups. A successful modified technique for staining thick plastic sections was employed revealing a specific color for the dying kidney cells. Conclusion: Although it can maintain its antimitotic property, IFO caused more severe hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic side effects if it is stored at temperature degree higher than 4 °C...|$|E
