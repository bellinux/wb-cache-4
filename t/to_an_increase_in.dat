However, migrants are consistently less likely <b>to</b> want <b>a</b> decrease in the intake and consistently (slightly) more likely <b>to</b> want <b>an</b> <b>increase.</b> This is particularly true of those born in non-English-speaking-background (NESB) countries. Even so, in 2004, only 26 per cent of NESB-born Australians wanted <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> immigration.

5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} {{the logic of}} the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices and lead <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also lead <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> poaching.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 27. Initially, virgorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28. The wind field remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed.
