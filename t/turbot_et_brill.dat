Many important fishes such as dogfish sharks (Squalus acanthias Linnaeus 1758), Eptatretus stoutii (Lockington, 1878), Dasyatis sabina (Lesueur, 1824), cod, herring, salmon (especially Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus 1758)), sardines and <b>turbot</b> (Gruenwald <b>et</b> al., 2002; Stene et al., 2000; Adeodato, 1997), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (Walbaun, 1792; Salte et al., 1996) contribute substantially to the field of fisheries’ nutraceuticals.

50|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1990s saw Brill accorded the Archaeological Institute of America’s Pomerance Award for scientific contributions to archaeology; however the decade mostly reflects Brill’s continuing dedication to Asian glasses {{and the study of}} the Silk Road (Archaeological Institute of America 2009). In Scientific Research in Early Chinese Glass, Brill reflected that in comparison to the knowledge of glassmaking in the West, ‘little is known about Chinese glass and about the role it played in the overall unfolding of glass history on a worldwide basis’ (1991, vii). One {{reason for this is that}} glass was never produced in the East in such great quantities as it was in the West but also that archaeological Chinese glasses are often prone to problems (Brill 1991). The difficulties of analysing Chinese glasses were reflected later in the publication where, following the chemical investigation of 71 samples, Brill found that identifying the ‘basic formulation’, or ‘any of the primary batch materials’ of the glasses was still almost impossible (<b>Brill</b> <b>et</b> al. 1991). <b>Brill</b> had greater success in differentiating between Chinese glass samples when using lead isotope analysis, a method that has proven effective in the first instance of identifying Chinese glass as the leads used here are different from those anywhere else in the world (<b>Brill,</b> Barnes <b>et</b> al. 1991). <b>Brill</b> found his Chinese samples to fall into two distinct groups, possessing on one hand the highest, and on the other the lowest, lead isotope ratios he had ever encountered (<b>Brill,</b> Barnes <b>et</b> al. 1991). As such, he was able to show that despite the striking similarity in the glasses’ chemical composition and appearance, the ores from which their leads were sourced must have been from very geologically-different mines (<b>Brill,</b> Barnes <b>et</b> al. 1991).|$|R

30|$|Dowel {{bars are}} {{commonly}} used in jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP) as a load transfer device across joints, especially for pavements with heavy traffic. The primary advantage of dowel bars is to transfer load without restricting horizontal joint movements due to temperature and moisture expansion and contraction in the concrete slabs. Also, dowel bars play a role to maintain the vertical and horizontal alignment of slabs. The load transfer efficiency depends {{on a number of}} dowel-joint parameters, including modulus of dowel support, dowel bar diameter, dowel length, dowel bar spacing, dowel looseness, joint opening width, and subgrade strength (Channakeshava et al. 1993; Guo <b>et</b> al. 1993; <b>Brill</b> and Guo 2000; Kim and Hjelmstad 2003; Maitra et al. 2009).|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} of these techniques would prove to be Brill’s pioneering application of lead isotope analysis, hitherto used only in geology, to archaeological objects. Brill first presented this idea at the 1965 Seminar in Examination of Works of Art, held at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, but the first widely published account of the method seems to be Brill and Wampler’s 1967 article in the American Journal of Archaeology. Here, Brill and Wampler outlined how the technique could be used to provenance the lead contents of archaeological objects to lead ore sources around the world, based on the isotopic signature of various leads, which relates them to ‘ores occurring in different geographical areas’ (1967, 63). These different areas have different signatures because they are of varying geological age, something reflected by the individual lead isotopes which form only after the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium (<b>Brill</b> <b>et</b> al. 1965, <b>Brill</b> and Wampler 1967). While the lead isotope ratios used for provenancing are different, they are not unique: areas geologically similar will yield similar lead isotope signatures (Brill 1970). Furthermore, if leads were salvaged and mixed in ancient times, the isotope ratio will be compromised (Brill 1970). Aside from these two limitations, there is little else that could affect the lead isotope reading an object would yield. As such, Brill's method was greeted enthusiastically and he went on to develop the technique, as well as oxygen isotope analysis, in his 1970 publication. Here he demonstrated how the technique could be used both to classify early glasses and to a certain extent characterize the ingredients from which they were made (1970, 143).|$|R
30|$|To further {{understand}} the intestinal bacteria metabolism diversity, the intestinal bacteria metabolic function of golden pompano fed with woody forages and reference diet were analyzed and result indicated that biosynthesis of amino acids and carbon metabolism were the dominate intestinal bacteria metabolism pathways of golden pompano. Meanwhile, Ni et al. (2014) {{also found that}} the carbon metabolism were also the dominant metabolism pathways of the grass carp intestinal bacteria. ABC transporters in Broussonetia papyrifera group were significantly higher than those in the groups of reference and Folium mori and study showed that ABC transporters were benefit for the uptake of nutrition (Yan et al. 2016). Meanwhile, in the present study, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathways in Folium mori group were significantly higher than those in the groups of reference, Broussonetia papyrifera, Neolamarckia cadamba and Moringa oleifera Lam (P <  0.05). Meanwhile, amino acid metabolism were also found in the intestinal bacteria of <b>turbot</b> (Xing <b>et</b> al. 2013) and grass carp (Ni et al. 2014).

40|$|Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) {{has been}} {{considered}} as a potential species for aquaculture because of its fast growth and commercial value. As a consequence of successful spawning and seed production, {{there has been a}} significant demand for cage farming of cobia in India (Philipose et al. 2013). Not many reports are available on diseases of cage-farmed cobia. Globally, mortality due to pasteurellosis in cage-cultured cobia caused by Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida has been reported (Liu, Lin & Lee 2003). Vibriosis caused by Vibrio alginolyticus, V. harveyi, V. parahemolyticus and V. vulnificus has also been responsible for mortalities in cage-cultured cobia (Rajan et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2004). Photobacterium damselae subsp. damselae was originally isolated from the skin lesions of damsel fish, Chromis punctipinnis (Love et al. 1981). Subsequently, diseases caused by this pathogen have been reported in several cultivable fish species like seabream (Vera, Navas & Fouz 1991), eel (Ketterer & Eaves 1992), <b>turbot</b> (Fouz <b>et</b> al. 1992), ovate pompano (Zhao et al. 2009) and Asian seabass (Kanchanopas-Barnette et al. 2009).

30|$|Despite {{all of the}} above, {{few studies}} have {{assessed}} biological rhythms in remitted bipolar patients (<b>Brill</b> <b>et</b> al. 2011; Harvey et al. 2005). In addition, most of them investigated sleep function exclusively, failing {{to take into account}} the other sensible areas involved in biological rhythms (Gruber et al. 2009; Sylvia et al. 2012). For instance, one study compared bipolar I disorder patients (n= 19) with age- and gender-matched healthy controls, reporting that affected individuals presented higher sleep abnormalities in both objective (actigraphy) and subjective measures than healthy control participants (Millar et al. 2004). There is increasing evidence, however, that social rhythms, defined by attendance at work, engagement in social activities or recreation, and exercise, may affect circadian regularity as a greater variability of social activities has been consistently related to sleep disturbance (Carney et al. 2006; Morgan 2003). The Biological Rhythms Interview of Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (BRIAN) is a novel instrument which allows us to assess the main aspects involved in biological rhythm disturbance (e.g., sleep, social, activity, and eating patterns) in bipolar patients (see Additional file 1).|$|R

30|$|Mayer’s (2003) {{cognitive}} theory of multimedia learning {{is related to}} a constructivist epistemology of learning. According to constructivism, students actively develop their own understanding of the world, rather than having such understanding delivered to them (Thompson 1995; von Glasersfeld 1995). Such an outlook requires students to be active participants in the learning process, rather than merely absorbing the information presented to them in its entirety. Thompson (1995) suggests that students select and transform the information, construct hypotheses, and make decisions, based on an already existing cognitive structure. It {{is important to note}} that during cognitive processing of information, students tend to select information which is easiest to comprehend and manage mentally (Thompson 1995). Constructed information is then stored in the long term memory as mental schema. Students attempt to access these mental schema when stimulated to do so. This may include attempting to re-produce mental schema as external visual models (<b>Brill</b> <b>et</b> al. 2000). Communicating one’s thoughts through visual models can also include drawing on paper, generating visual models on a computer, manipulating visual models with software tool and manipulating a visual model externally.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} eighties Brill was to {{contribute}} various studies to the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, following the excavation {{of a number}} of exciting shipwrecks including the Serçe Liman, and the Ulu Burun (Barnes <b>et</b> al. 1986, <b>Brill</b> 1989). Here Brill’s own technique of lead isotope analysis was to provide a means for provenancing items aboard ship, and thus determine the ship’s origin and her ports-of-call. The excavators of the Serçe Liman wanted to know whether she was Byzantine or Islamic, a complicated question for lead isotope analysis as the lead ores of the Eastern Mediterranean share geographical characteristics and therefore overlap (Barnes et al. 1986). Using 900 lead net sinkers divided into six loose groupings, Brill found groups III, V and VI to be Byzantine, that is with ores found in modern-day Turkey (Barnes et al. 1986). Group I, however, was taken to be most indicative of the ship’s origin; this group contained net sinkers, but also two ceramic glazes and three glass vessels, all sharing virtually identical lead ores with only one isotopic match, ‘an ore from Anguran, northwest of Tehran’ according to Barnes et al. (1986, 7).|$|R
30|$|The tsunami {{deposits}} were {{documented by}} several research {{teams in the}} field {{within a few months}} after the IOT in parts of the Andaman Sea coastal zone of Thailand. The published results include works focused on the overall geological impacts of the tsunami (Szczuciński et al., 2006; Choowong et al., 2007; Kelletat et al., 2007; Umitsu et al., 2007), on the detailed analyses of sedimentary properties of sandy deposits (Hori et al., 2007; Choowong et al., 2008 a, b; Fujino et al., 2008, 2010; Goto et al., 2008; Matsumoto et al., 2008; Alam, 2010; Naruse et al., 2010) and on the boulder deposits (Goto et al., 2007; Yawsangratt et al., 2009). Also studied were specific aspects such as the micropaleontological features of the deposits (Hawkes et al., 2007; Kokociński et al., 2009; Sawai et al., 2009; Yawsangratt et al., 2012), their geochemistry (Szczuciński et al., 2005; Boszke et al., 2006; Kozak et al., 2008; Zioła-Frankowska et al., 2009), their physical properties (Bishop et al., 2005) and their mineralogy (Jagodziński et al., 2009). The IOT deposits were also presented in papers focused on paleotsunami deposits (Jankaew et al., 2008, 2011; Fujino <b>et</b> al., 2009; <b>Brill</b> <b>et</b> al., 2011; Yawsangratt et al., 2012). The aforementioned works revealed that the IOT deposits varied considerably regarding extent, thickness, grain size (mud to boulders), internal structures, composition and preservation potential. The deposits usually formed extensive sand sheets with a thickness ranging from a few cm to several tens of cm. They were commonly layered and normally graded, with evidence of both onshore and backwash flows, and some components suggested origins from marine, brackish and terrestrial environments. While many works were published, the detailed sedimentological data have not yet been reported from the present study areas, particularly the Patong Bay area and Kho Khao Island. Most of the previous studies are limited in the number of observations (usually one or two transects or trenches). Furthermore, the studies made no attempts to compare deposits left in areas of relatively similar topography and potential source sediments that experienced varied height of tsunami run up. Several studies were also conducted one or more years after a tsunami. However, they are not discussed here because they have not assessed the post-depositional changes that were found to be important in the case of the onshore tsunami deposits in Thailand (Szczuciński et al., 2006, 2007; Goto et al., 2008, 2012; Jankaew et al., 2008; Szczuciński, 2012), as well as in other parts of the Indian Ocean basin (Nichol and Kench, 2008).|$|R
30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that α 7 -S 250 {{is by far the}} most frequently detected proteasome phosphorylation site (found in > 900 spectra curated at PhosphoSitePlus). Treating cells with phosphatase inhibitors Calyculin A and okadaic acid did not further increase S 250 phosphorylation (Mason et al., 1998), indicating that it is probably constitutive as revealed by a recent MS study (Gersch et al., 2015). Interestingly, throughout evolution, the very C-terminal end of α 7 is rich in acidic residues. In S. cerevisiae it also contains three phosphorylation sites that are important for binding to the proteasome quality control factor, Ecm 29 (Wani et al., 2016). Whether this holds true for human α 7 is unknown. In addition, S 250 phosphorylation changes during stem cell differentiation, cell cycle and with exposure to anti-cancer drugs (<b>Brill</b> <b>et</b> al., 2009; Dulla et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2011; Imami et al., 2012). It is unclear how this happens since CK 2 is generally considered to be always active. In fact, there is even evidence against CK 2 since its inhibition actually increased α 7 -S 250 phosphorylation (Franchin et al., 2015). Therefore, the regulation and biological function of this heavily phosphorylated site remain to be rigorously examined (Table  1).|$|R

30|$|While {{hyperactivity}} {{was observed}} at baseline in the KO mice, it is notable that sleep deprivation also induced hyperactive behavior in the KO mice compared to WT littermates. Abnormalities of sleep are common and important in the pathophysiology of bipolar illness (<b>Brill</b> <b>et</b> al. 2011; Plante and Winkelman 2008), and sleep and circadian rhythm-related genes appear {{to be associated with}} bipolar disorder (Mansour et al. 2009; Sjoholm et al. 2010). Sleep deprivation can trigger mood episode switches in patients with bipolar disorder (Salvadore et al. 2010). Bipolar patients appear to be sensitive to cycle or rhythm disruption (Goodwin and Jamison 1990). Sleep deprivation is believed {{to play a role in}} the induction of mania (Plante and Winkelman 2008) but is used also as a treatment for bipolar depression (Wu et al. 2009). There are different types of sleep deprivation, and in bipolar disorder, REM sleep deprivation appears to be closely related to induction of mood elevation (Albert et al. 1970; Vogel et al. 1975; Salvadore et al. 2010). REM density is increased in euthymic bipolar subjects compared to normal controls (Talbot et al. 2009) suggesting a greater need in bipolar patients. It is notable that sleep deprivation by inverted flowerpot method, which prevents REM stage sleep (Kitka et al. 2009), was the only stressor that induced lithium-preventable hyperactivity in the KO mice (Figures  4 and 5).|$|R
