5|$|Phantom Blood {{was created}} using a ki-shō-ten-ketsu {{structure}} – introduction (ki), development (shō), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) – {{along with the}} rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time {{in relation to their}} starting point {{in the beginning of the}} story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to do such a <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shōnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist.|$|E
25|$|Their split LP with Void As well {{as their}} more catchy but still raging EP Subject to Change. Known for their inward-looking lyrics—a {{pioneering}} <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> scene more given to social and political themes—and the gruff allure of Alec MacKaye's vocals, The Faith was highly esteemed by local punk fans. They have probably made a deeper impact on the underground. They created the sound that went on to shape much of what came after, especially later period D.C. bands. The Faith shows why hardcore has lasting power, how even music recognised mainly for its brevity and brutality can convey something emotional and immediate, even several years on.|$|E
25|$|People began petitioning the King {{for relief}} against unfair judgments, {{and as the}} number of petitioners rapidly grew, so the King {{delegated}} the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor. As the early Chancellors lacked formal legal training and showed little regard for precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. In 1529, a lawyer, Sir Thomas More, was appointed as Chancellor, marking {{the beginning of a new}} era. After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers. Beginning around 1557, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept and several equitable doctrines developed. Criticisms continued, the most famous being 17th-century jurist John Selden's aphorism:Equity is a roguish thing: for law we have a measure, know what to trust to; equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot, a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain measure would this be? One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot: 'tis the same <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Chancellor's conscience.|$|E

500|$|The {{influential}} critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool [...] "the best {{of modern}} British operas", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by The Times as [...] "a brilliant puzzle"—put it outside the operatic mainstream. Only the ballet {{music from the}} opera, which The Times called [...] "the most brilliant <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> work glittering with brilliant moments", has been regularly performed since 1923.

500|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, cottage gardens mainly grew {{vegetables}} for household consumption. Typically half the garden {{would be used}} for cultivating potatoes and half for a mix of other vegetables. John Claudius Loudon wrote extensively on cottage gardens in his book An Encyclopædia of Gardening (1822) and in Gardener's Magazine from 1826. In 1838 he wrote [...] "I seldom observe any <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cottage garden but potatoes, cabbages, beans, and French beans; in a few instances onions and parsneps, and very seldom a few peas".

[...] There were originally many album-title ideas, but Lee said that as the project became more collaborative [...] "it just felt like this is who we are, it's a band. And to have that feeling in the music where the band is so pumped up, it was just the only title that felt right. It's about falling back in love with this <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> major way."

She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, my friends and I were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lot of ways. And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E
500|$|Contrectatio meant [...] "handling" [...] and was {{established}} as the prohibited action associated with furtum {{before the end}} of the republic. Furtum had in the early and mid-Republic required the carrying away of a thing. This was widened and there are several examples from the classical Rome and later where it is even hard to find physical contact in any sense. Contrectatio extended to dealing with the thing as if the owner, and [...] "physical interference" [...] can be considered a more accurate term than just touching. The idea of furtum, and conrectatio in particular, broadened during the republic to complement the narrowly defined Lex Aquilia. This did, for example, include using a borrowed <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way which went beyond that agreed with the lender (furtum usus), such as borrowing a horse and riding it for longer than agreed. During the Republic, no distinction was made in language between furtum usus and furtum in general. Contrectio included what might be thought of as fraud: knowingly accepting a wrongful payment, or embezzlement, for example. The case of wrongful payment is problematic, because a mistaken payment still transferred ownership; it seems contradictory that the receiver was granted ownership and still liable for theft. To accept a thing as a pledge knowing that it did not belong to the pledgor was also furtum [...] not merely acting as an accomplice. Plautus, a playwright, suggests that failing to report a theft after the fact was furtum, but this should not be assumed. The development of contrectio as the preferred prohibited act accompanied that of the criminal law, the actio doli (for fraud) and the Aquilian actions.|$|E

2500|$|I soon {{got used}} to this singing; for the sailors never touched a rope without it.

[...] And then some one of them would begin, and if every man's arms were as much relieved as mine by the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it. It is a great <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sailor to know how to sing well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates.

[...] Like many of her buildings, the whole form is only perceived when viewed from above. The facades are covered with zinc plates, and the roofline has a series of peaks and angles.

Mikel Reparaz from GamesRadar stated that [...] "if you're in the mood for something creepy and horrific that'll leave you feeling a little dirty, Manhunt 2s still-shocking murders and eerie, is-it-real-or-am-I-just-insane storyline won't disappoint." [...] Game Informer gave the Wii version of the game 7.75/10, saying [...] "Manhunt 2 is every bit as grim and brutal as the first [...] the writing, as is typical of Rockstar's games, is top-notch, and Daniel {{and the rest of the}} characters do come off the screen as very real and human [...] It's a testament to this quality that I was really driven to see the tale out to its end." [...] Similarly, Nintendo Power gave the Wii version 7.5/10, stating that while the game does deliver for the most part, they were disappointed by the way external influences led Rockstar to change the game, and that the story, while interesting, is [...] "highly predictable".

2500|$|During his 23 {{years at}} Harvard, Lake {{continuously}} taught one very popular course, the English Bible, familiarly known as [...] "English 35". [...] When he taught {{the course for}} the first time in 1914, the course had less than 40 students, whereas his final year there were over 250—a [...] "625 per cent increase," [...] as the Harvard Crimson touted when announcing his final lecture would be 16 December 1937. [...] His book An Introduction to the New Testament (1937) is a [...] "skeleton of the course." [...] However, [...] "it does not give the flesh put on that skeleton by the lecturer" [...] (p. ix). [...] It was of course that [...] "flesh" [...] which made the course so interesting, due to Lake's lively imagination and engaging wit. [...] As he himself explains: [...] "The most important <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> teacher's life is not to impart the knowledge of facts—which can be found much better in books—but to encourage another generation to look steadfastly at the vision which it sees, and to face its own problems in the light of that vision, controlled and guided by an understanding of what the past has done or not done" [...] (Paul, His Heritage and Legacy, 1934, p. xii). [...] He seems to have been effective, for James Luther Adams, one of his students during 1924–27, recalls: [...] "It was his characteristic interest to make historical figures come alive, so that we might see their significance today and not merely study them as so many items from a dead past." [...] "Something we all recognized in Kirsopp Lake," [...] writes Adams, [...] "was that he had the imagination of a Sherlock Holmes. [...] He took an almost childlike interest in digging out alternative answers to historical questions ... Students who thought themselves completely secularized and immune to any 'religious nonsense' attended his lectures and heard him publicly burrow down into the biblical concepts, taking as his point of departure something highly imaginative in one of the parables, and then rise up to fly with it.
