5|$|Spider-Man Unlimited is {{an endless}} runner {{game in which}} Spider-Man runs across New York rooftops, {{including}} that of the Oscorp building, as well as Sinister Six spaceships and a giant Doctor Octopus machine, as he dodges obstacles, defeats enemies, and collect power-ups and vials. Regular enemies are defeated by slide attacks and punches, while bosses requires the player <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> projectiles at them. Players earn combos by overthrowing enemies; almost hitting an obstacle or going through a ring also increases the player's combo count. Sections in which Spider-Man swings through streets, climbs the sides of buildings and free-falls from buildings are interspersed with the running portions of the game.|$|E
5|$|Velites {{were first}} used, and created, at {{the siege of}} Capua in 211 BC, and were made up of {{citizens}} who would normally be too poor to join the hastati but were called up due a shortage of manpower. They were trained to ride on horseback with the equites and jump down at a given signal <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> javelins at the enemy. After the siege, they were adopted into the legions as a force of irregular light infantry for ambushing and harassing the enemy with javelins before the battle began in earnest.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E

5|$|The game, which largely {{follows the}} action RPG and hack and slash {{gameplay}} of previous {{games in the}} series, sees players alternate between the roles of Sora and Riku. Alternating between characters is done via the 'Drop' system. During gameplay, a Drop Gauge gradually depletes over time, though it can be replenished with items. When the gauge completely empties, control will switch to the other character, though players may also opt to drop manually at any time. Drop Points, which are earned by defeating enemies and completing optional objectives, can be spent on bonuses {{that can be used}} until the next time the character drops, such as a slower Drop Gauge or increased attack or defense. The game reuses the Command Deck system from Birth by Sleep, in which players can customize a deck filled with various actions, spells, and items that can be quickly selected. There are also several new elements added to the gameplay. Flowmotion allows players to move quickly about by performing actions such as bouncing off walls, grinding on rails and spinning around poles. Reality Shift is a system the player can use on certain objects or weakened opponents involving a touch-screen activated minigame unique to each world. These include dragging the screen <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> a target like a catapult, touching hidden words to take control of enemies, and playing a small rhythm-based game to cause fireworks to appear.|$|E

I tricked the dancers by arranging a tango introduction, breaking abruptly into a low-down blues. My eyes swept the floor anxiously, then suddenly I saw lightning strike. The dancers seemed electrified. Something within them came suddenly to life. An instinct that wanted so much to live, <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> its arms to spread joy, took them by the heels.|$|E
500|$|Crawford {{was often}} {{irritable}} and some colleagues found him exasperating to work with. He {{was known for}} his lack of patience, and when angry or frustrated was known <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> his hat to the floor in a gesture of rage. His biographer Kitty Hauser noted that [...] "apparently trifling events left an indelible mark on him", for he would remember a perceived slight for decades. Bowden expressed the view that while Crawford [...] "had a quick temper, which he strove to control... he was essentially a friendly man", adding that he could be [...] "clubbable, hospitable and kind".|$|E

500|$|Velites (singular: [...] ) were a {{class of}} {{infantry}} in the Roman army of the mid-Republic from 211 to 107 BC. Velites were light infantry and skirmishers who were armed {{with a number of}} darts (...) , each with a 30 in wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c. 10 in (25 cm) narrow metal point, <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> at the enemy. They also carried short thrusting swords, or gladii, for use in melee. They rarely wore armour as they were the youngest and poorest soldiers in the legion and could not afford much equipment. They did carry small wooden shields called parma for protection though, and wore a headdress made from wolf skin so their brave deeds could be recognized. The velites were placed at the front partly for tactical reasons, and also so that they had the opportunity to secure glory for themselves in single combat.|$|E
500|$|Lorde {{performed}} [...] "Tennis Court" [...] at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards in May. The following month, {{she performed}} a Goth-influenced medley of [...] "Tennis Court" [...] and [...] "Team" [...] at the 2014 MuchMusic Video Awards. Lorde also performed the song during several music festivals. In April, Lorde performed [...] "Tennis Court" [...] at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Around 2014, she also performed the single live during the Laneway Festival in Sydney, and Lollapalooza Brazil in Sao Paulo. At the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park on 1 August 2014, she performed the track among other songs from Pure Heroine. The performance of Lorde was well received by media outlets, with Billboard picked {{it as the}} fifth best performance of the festival, while Rolling Stone deemed it {{the best part of}} Lollapalooza in Chicago, writing, [...] "She danced like she was trying <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> her arms off her body, but just as with her voice, the sense that she was in absolute possession of her abilities never waned. She nailed every stomp and every note — but it was clearly fueled by passion, not perfection." ...|$|E

2500|$|A [...] "" [...] {{describes}} any shot {{where the}} cue ball is intentionally {{driven into the}} air in a legal manner. It is not permissible in some games (e.g. Snooker) and may be frowned upon or even forbidden in some venues as attempts at it by unskilled players may cause damage to a table's cloth. A legal jump shot requires that the cue ball be hit above center, driving it down into the table, so that the ball will leave the table surface on a rebound. All authoritative rule sources deem it illegal to [...] "scoop" [...] under the cue ball {{with the tip of}} the cue <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> it into the air (technically because it is illegal to contact the cue ball with the ferrule of the cue, and because the cue ball is struck twice, both of which are classic fouls).|$|E
2500|$|Born in Kullavik, Sweden, Torsten Billman disliked school, {{with the}} drawing lessons {{as the only}} exception. During a drawing lesson with a {{substitute}} teacher Torsten had {{on a piece of}} blotting paper drawn a detailed composition, which was supposed to represent an Indian with his tent and utensils. [...] "After the teacher had inspected the pictures produced by the class, Torsten was called to his desk. He expected a sympathetic judgment from the teacher; yes, he also hoped that he might impress a certain girl in the class. So he stepped forward fearlessly. He had hardly reached the plattform when he received such a box on the ear that he fell to the floor. As he crestfallen rose to return to his own desk he was further rebuked by the teacher, who ordered him immediately <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> the drawing in the red-hot stove." [...] "It was my first vernissage", said Torsten Billman.|$|E
2500|$|The Vigili del Fuoco di Genova ("Genovese Fire Service") ashore fired a {{breeches}} buoy from the mole to the midships accommodation block. This was made fast on the ship, and the firemen hauled three Indian crewmen to safety. Captain Muir persuaded his wife Dorothy to go next, but the buoy jammed and flung Mrs Muir from the harness {{to her death}} on the rocks below. Some sources suggest that {{the breaking of the}} ship into two coincided with the fire service's attempt to winch Mrs Muir to safety, that this caused the {{breeches buoy}}'s [...] nylon rope to flex and this was what caused it first to jam and then <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> Mrs Muir onto the rocks. A fireman, Giuliano Macchi, tried several times to reach her but without success. Captain Muir leapt after his wife into the sea. He was later seen in the water with one leg seriously injured, and then was not seen again.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most obvious}} {{feature of the}} Acrobatic rock and roll dance are its kicks (into thin air) and its acrobatic {{elements}} like lifts, jumps, throws and flips. Today's rock and roll is focused on show and competition dance and - {{with the exception of}} its name - has nearly nothing in common with the former rock and roll movement. It is danced in pairs or in formation and can even be danced with one male and two females simultaneously which is called [...] "triples". Over the years rock and roll dancing has experienced several important changes: the former 6-basic step was converted into the modern tournament's 9-basic step with its typical kick ball change. Other characteristics are techniques such as the man's body wave movement, that he uses <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> his partner from a sitting position upwards, and the throwing basic movement, where she steps onto his hands and is catapulted upwards into neck breaking jumps. Because of its demanding technique, high speed, and acrobatics, Rock and Roll is a straining high-performance dance and is most often performed by young dancers.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1813 Musnier was {{recalled}} to France {{where he}} inspected fortresses. On 23 December {{he was given}} command of the Geneva reserve. In January 1814, he was attached to Marshal Pierre Augereau's command which was based at Lyon. On 14 January, Musnier had only 1,200 soldiers and 500 conscripts to defend the city of Lyon. His superior Marshal Pierre Augereau left Musnier {{to cope with the}} situation and rode to Valence to gather more troops. By 16 January, Austrian patrols were lurking outside the walls of Lyon. Believing his soldiers might run away, Musnier moved them to {{the west bank of the}} Saône River on 17 January, evacuating the city. Austrian commander Ferdinand, Graf Bubna von Littitz heard about this and sent an officer to demand Lyon's surrender. When the Austrian parliamentary arrived, a mob formed nearby and began threatening <b>to</b> <b>fling</b> him in the river. Keeping up the bluff, Musnier talked up his strength and exaggerated the fury of the city's residents. Completely fooled, the Austrian officer's report to his superior caused Bubna to pause in his plan to storm the city. Musnier reoccupied Lyon and held it through 18–19 January. Late on the 19th, 1,200 French troops arrived from Valence and drove the Austrians out of the suburbs. Musnier's actions averted the early capture of Lyon and allowed the French to pose a threat to the main Allied armies' supply lines.|$|E
