5|$|Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller: Ed's girlfriend {{before his}} {{relationship}} with Kathy. Dolores is embarrassed by Ed's <b>transvestism,</b> which leads to their breakup. Dolores later becomes a successful songwriter for Elvis Presley.|$|E
5|$|Wood meets Loretta King, whom {{he thinks}} has {{enough money to}} fund Bride of the Atom and ends up casting her as the lead instead of Fuller as planned. Filming begins, but is halted when it is {{revealed}} that King is actually poor, and Wood has no money to continue production. Wood convinces meat packing industry tycoon Don McCoy to take over funding the film, who agrees {{as long as the}} film stars his son Tony as the leading man and the film ends with an explosion. The filming finishes with the title being changed to Bride of the Monster, but Fuller breaks up with Wood after the wrap party because of his circle of friends, his work, and <b>transvestism.</b> Lugosi attempts to conduct a double suicide with Ed after the government cuts off his unemployment, but is talked out of it. Lugosi checks himself into rehab, and Wood meets Kathy O'Hara, who is visiting her father there. He takes her on a date and reveals to her his <b>transvestism,</b> which she accepts.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{shoots a}} film with Lugosi outside his home. When Wood and company attend the premiere for Bride of the Monster, an angry mob chases {{them out of}} the theater. Lugosi passes away, leaving Wood without a star. Wood convinces his landlord, a church leader named Reynolds, that funding Wood's script for Grave Robbers from Outer Space would result in a box office success, and {{generate}} enough money for Reynolds' dream project. Dr. Tom Mason, O'Hara's chiropractor, is chosen to be Lugosi's stand-in for resembling Lugosi. Wood and the Baptists have conflicts over the title and content of the script which they want to have changed to Plan 9 from Outer Space, along with Ed's B movie directing style, his casting decisions and his <b>transvestism.</b> Wood leaves the set to go to the nearest bar, where he encounters his idol, Orson Welles. Filming for Plan 9 finishes with Ed taking action against his producers. After attending the premiere of Plan 9, Wood and O'Hara go to Las Vegas to get married.|$|E

25|$|In Ancient Greece, Hippocrates and his {{followers}} are generally credited with the first classification system for mental illnesses, including mania, melancholia, paranoia, phobias and Scythian disease (<b>transvestism).</b> They held that they were due to different kinds of imbalance in four humors.|$|E
25|$|Early Church Fathers {{advocated}} against polygamy, abortion, infanticide, child abuse, homosexuality, <b>transvestism,</b> and incest.

After the Roman Empire adopted Christianity as the official religion, however, the link between Christian teachings and Roman family laws became more clear.|$|E
25|$|Though coined {{as late as}} the 1910s, the {{phenomenon}} is not new. It was referred to in the Hebrew Bible. The word has undergone several changes of meaning since it was first coined and is still used in a variety of senses. Today, the term transvestite is commonly considered outdated and derogatory, with the term cross-dresser used as a more appropriate replacement. This is because the term transvestite was historically used to diagnose medical disorders, including mental health disorders, and <b>transvestism</b> was viewed as a disorder, but the term cross-dresser was coined by the transgender community. In some cases, however, the term transvestite is seen as more appropriate for use by members of the transgender community instead of by those outside of the transgender community, and some have reclaimed the word.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{activity}} in Singapore has frequently been {{a focus of}} social conflict. A transgender identity was recognised among the indigenous Malays. Male homosexuality was outlawed under British rule (1819-1942), despite being acknowledged among immigrant Chinese. Following Japanese occupation during World War II and the later gaining of independence, homosexuality and <b>transvestism</b> were visible as a street scene, and from the 1970s were catered for in some nightclubs. In that decade also, Singapore became a centre of gender-reassignment surgery. Concern over HIV arose after cases were reported in the 1980s. During the 1990s police clamped down on manifestations of homosexuality, leading {{to the growth of}} a gay movement. A statement from Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 2003 seemed to open the way for greater tolerance, starting a controversy that involved anti-homosexual expressions by some Churches and others.|$|E

Their marriage lasts until Ed's death in 1978. She never remarried. Arquette met her real-life counterpart during filming. The actress found her to be [...] "very graceful and very nice".|$|E
500|$|Tripp {{discusses}} bisexuality, inversion, <b>transvestism,</b> and transsexualism {{in relation}} to homosexuality. Tripp maintains that homosexuality and inversion, though sometimes associated with each other, are distinct phenomena. He argues that there are several different kinds of bisexuality, and that while some bisexuals are simply unconcerned by the gender of their sexual partners, others [...] "rate and choose their male and female partners by applying quite separate sets of criteria", which could be formed by various different processes, including {{but not limited to}} early sexual experiences with persons of both sexes, or for a men a special form of machismo. [...] Tripp argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and of non-conformist behavior in general, arguing that such respect for diversity has many potential benefits to society.|$|E

2500|$|Images of glam rockers like Alice Cooper, David Bowie, and Lou Reed in {{the pages}} of Rolling Stone {{established}} the influence of another extreme aesthetic. [...] The glam style drew on <b>transvestism,</b> androgyny, decadence, and camp; its [...] "blasé sophistication" [...] stood in marked contrast to the innocence and sincerity of the 1960s.Glitter eye shadow and nail varnish were popular during this period.|$|E
2500|$|In some cultures, <b>transvestism</b> {{is practiced}} for religious, {{traditional}} or ceremonial reasons. For example, in India some male devotees of the Hindu god Krishna, especially in Mathura and Vrindavan, dress in female attire to pose as his consort, the goddess Radha, {{as an act}} of devotion. [...] In Italy, the Neapolitan femminielli (feminine males) wear wedding dresses, called the matrimonio dei femminielli (marriage of the femminielli), a procession takes place through the streets, a tradition that apparently has pagan origins.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1994, Springer {{and his new}} producer, Richard Dominick, revamped the show's format {{in order}} to garner higher ratings. The show became more {{successful}} as it became targeted toward tabloidish sensationalism. Guests were everyday people confronted on a television stage by a spouse or family member's adultery, homosexuality, prostitution, <b>transvestism,</b> hate group membership, or other controversial situations. [...] These confrontations were often promoted by scripted shouting or violence on stage. The show received substantial ratings and much attention. By 1998, it was beating The Oprah Winfrey Show in many cities, and was reaching more than 6.7 million viewers.|$|E
2500|$|A {{fragment}} {{from the}} playwright Accius (170–86BC) seems {{to refer to}} a father who secretly wore [...] "virgin's finery". An instance of <b>transvestism</b> is noted in a legal case, in which [...] "a certain senator accustomed to wear women's evening clothes" [...] was disposing of the garments in his will. In the [...] "mock trial" [...] exercise presented by the elder Seneca, the young man (adulescens) was gang-raped while wearing women's clothes in public, but his attire is explained as his acting on a dare by his friends, not as a choice based on gender identity or the pursuit of erotic pleasure.|$|E
2500|$|In Wood's 2006 {{biography}} Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr., Wood's wife Kathy {{recalls that}} Wood {{told her that}} his mother dressed him in girls' clothing as a child. Kathy stated that Wood's <b>transvestism</b> was not a sexual inclination, but rather a neomaternal comfort derived mainly from angora fabric (angora is featured in many of Wood's films, and [...] "Ann Gora" [...] also happened {{to be one of}} Wood's pen names). Even in his later years, Wood was not shy about going out in public dressed in drag as Shirley, his female alter ego (who also appeared in many of his screenplays and stories).|$|E
2500|$|Transsexualism {{appears in}} the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD, {{currently}} in its tenth edition). The ICD-10 incorporates transsexualism, dual role <b>transvestism,</b> and gender identity disorder of childhood into its gender identity disorder category. It defines transsexualism as [...] " [...] desire to live and be accepted {{as a member of}} the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriateness of, one's anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one's body as congruent as possible with one's preferred sex." [...] The World Health Organisation lists transsexualism as a mental and behavioural disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Schillaci {{was born}} in Oklahoma in 1971 and was given up for {{adoption}} as an infant. Most of his childhood, which {{has been described as}} [...] "turbulent", was spent in Texas. During his first prison term, Schillaci told officials he had been abused by a relative as a child. Prior to his arrest in 1989 he frequented the Neartown area of Houston. At the age of 17, Schillaci practiced <b>transvestism.</b> Schillaci has educational background in behavioral sciences, computer science, drafting, philosophy, religion and politics. He has also been described as computer savvy, an accomplished pianist, and an adequate guitarist. [...] He attended, but did not graduate from Clements High School in Sugar Land, Texas.|$|E
2500|$|Izzard {{started to}} freely {{talk about his}} <b>transvestism</b> in venues like Edinburgh Festival as early as 1992. His stance is that {{cross-dressing}} is neither part of his performance nor a sexual fetish. He remarks in his show Unrepeatable, [...] "Women wear {{what they want and}} so do I." [...] According to Izzard, [...] "Most transvestites fancy women." [...] Izzard identifies as [...] "a straight transvestite or a male lesbian". He has also described himself as [...] "a lesbian trapped in a man's body", transgender, and [...] "a complete boy plus half girl". He has expressed a belief that being transgender is caused by genetics and that someday this will be scientifically proven, having {{gone so far as to}} have his own genome sequenced.|$|E
2500|$|Drag queens are {{sometimes}} called transvestites, although that term also has many other connotations than the term [...] "drag queen" [...] {{and is not}} much favored by many drag queens themselves. This {{is because of the}} distinctions between drag queens and transvestic fetishists. [...] "Drag queen" [...] usually connotes cross-dressing for the purposes of entertainment and self-expression. It is not an accurate way to describe people who cross-dress for the fulfillment of transvestic fetishes alone, i.e., people whose cross-dressing is primarily part of a private sexual activity or identity. Those whose motivation for <b>transvestism</b> is not primarily sexual, and who may go about their daily lives cross-dressed, often do not adopt the over-the-top drag queen look, at least not for daily wear; these individuals may or may not self-identify as drag queens.|$|E
2500|$|Viola is {{not alone}} among Shakespeare's {{cross-dressing}} heroines; in Shakespeare's theatre, convention dictated that adolescent boys play the roles of female characters, creating humour in the multiplicity of disguise found in a female character who for a while pretended at masculinity. Her cross dressing enables Viola to fulfill usually male roles, such as acting as a messenger between Orsino and Olivia, {{as well as being}} Orsino's confidant. She does not, however, use her disguise to enable her to intervene directly in the plot (unlike other Shakespearean heroines such as Rosalind in As You Like It and Portia in The Merchant of Venice), remaining someone who allows [...] "Time" [...] to untangle the plot. Viola's persistence in <b>transvestism</b> through her betrothal in the final scene of the play often engenders a discussion of the possibly homoerotic relationship between Viola and Orsino.|$|E
2500|$|Homosexuality of the {{protective}} type involves a motive that Bergler describes {{as an attempt}} to show that [...] "father loves his little boy". Homosexuality of the seeking the older protector type is found in homosexual men who search for partners who resemble good fathers who can love them, but unconsciously want to be mistreated by a [...] "bad mother". Homosexuality combined with other types of perversions may involve sado-masochism, exhibitionism, <b>transvestism,</b> urolagnia, or scatology. Bergler maintains that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals, that bisexuality is a fraud perpetrated by homosexuals, and that efforts by homosexual men to have sex with women involve only [...] "lustless mechanical sex". Homosexuality of the criminal institution type shows, according to Bergler, the similar psychological bases of homosexuality and criminal behavior. Homosexuality in fantasy involves masturbation with homosexual fantasies rather than sexual behavior with another person. Bergler considers all of these types to be based on an attempt to cope with unconscious masochism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{clinical}} {{literature of}} Freund, Blanchard, and others has consistently divided male-to-female transsexuals into two distinct groups - [...] "homosexual transsexuals," [...] {{people who are}} sexually attracted to (ideally heterosexual) men and supposedly desire a normative female body to attract them, and [...] "heterosexual fetishistic transvestites" [...] in which the transsexual purportedly finds {{the idea of having}} a normative female body sexually arousing but desires a heterosexual female partner. [...] Kurt Freund first distinguished between these two proposed types in a 1982 research article, theorizing that the [...] "homosexual" [...] transsexuals were qualitatively different from the so-called [...] "heterosexual males" [...] with gender dysphoria. Sexologist Ray Blanchard coined the term [...] "autogynephilia" [...] to describe this latter category of people. [...] In a 2005 article on the concept by Ray Blanchard noted that Freund was probably the first author to distinguish between the erotic arousal due to dressing as a woman (<b>transvestism)</b> versus erotic arousal due to physically transforming into a more typically female form (autogynephilia).|$|E
2500|$|During the {{performance}} in Edinburgh, Madonna was urged {{to remove the}} use of (fake) firearms from the show due to the 2012 Aurora shooting. Although threatened, Scottish police did not interrupt the show. The singer's camp responded saying, [...] "Madonna would rather cancel her show than censor her art. Her entire career, she has fought against people telling her what she can and cannot do. She's not about to start listening to them now". The show in Paris at L'Olympia was met with overwhelmingly negative reviews from fans and critics, {{with most of the}} criticism centering {{on the fact that the}} concert lasted only 45 minutes, even though the tickets had been sold at the same price as for the other MDNA Tour shows and fans hadn't been alerted of the abbreviated format of the show. Responding to the criticism, Madonna's publicist declared that her past club shows [...] "were never more than 45 minutes", adding that the concert was [...] "planned as a heartfelt thank you to France which she expressed at the start of the show" [...] and also, the show cost Madonna nearly $1 million to produce and keeping the prices at $100 involved a [...] "tremendous effort". Madonna's concert in Warsaw was met with criticism from local religious conservatives who demanded her concert to be cancelled on the basis that the singer is against the church, desecrates religious iconography, promotes homosexuality, transsexuality and <b>transvestism</b> and generally displays abnormal and offensive behavior. Organizers ended up showing a brief film on the topic of the Uprising before the concert and only a handful of protesters were seen outside of the venue.|$|E
