5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. <b>The</b> <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E
5|$|If an {{individual}} feels Vairagya (detachment from the world), the Jabala Upanishad maintains that no preconditions apply, and <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> the spiritual right to renounce immediately. This principle in the Jabala Upanishad was cited by medieval-era {{scholars such as}} Adi Shankara, Vijñāneśvara, Sureśvara, and Nilakantha as the Vedic basis that makes renunciation {{an individual}} choice and right. This choice {{has been referred to}} as a Vikalpa by the later scholars, which the society and state must respect. The Jabala Upanishad concurred with some Dharmasastras on the right to renounce and lead a monastic life, but its views contradicted others such as those in Manusmriti verses 6.35–37. The text fed a debate on the right of the individual, and medieval Hindu scholars relied on and sided with the Jabala Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E

5|$|Those with {{epilepsy}} are {{at about}} twice {{the risk of being}} involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus {{in many areas of the}} world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>has</b> not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: To be {{stricken}} with a cardiac infarction is {{among other things}} linked to different risk factors.   Many {{studies show that the}} participants in cardiac rehabilitation programs learn to deal with the risk factors, increase their quality of life and lessen the risk for re-infarction. Objective: To describe the lifestyle and perceived quality of life of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> after <b>having</b> participated in cardiac rehabilitation program and to see if they had maintained their results up to a year after having a cardiac infarction. Method: <b>The</b> 19 <b>individuals</b> who <b>had</b> participated in cardiac rehabilitation in 2010 after having had a cardiac infarction were asked to participate in the study. Everyone agreed to participate. The study was made analyzing the surveys, one a locally made, that <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>had</b> filled out four and eight months after cardiac infarction, and the other the generic Quality of life questionnaire EQ- 5 D, that <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>had</b> filled out two and twelve months after cardiac infarction. Result: <b>The</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>have</b> not changed their lifestyle after having participated in cardiac rehabilitation which can be interpreted that they have followed existing recommendations. The mean weight increased with one kilogram, no depression is shown and they stress less. Only two comparisons over time showed any statistic significance: gain of weight and increase in intake of vegetables.   The individuals’ qualities of life changed marginally between baselines and follow up and correspond to results made on healthy individuals measured with EQ- 5 D. The results show no significant change over time in quality of life. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>have</b> more or less maintained their lifestyle between four and eight months and quality of life between two and twelve months after infarction.

This model was expanded into the demand-control-support model that suggests that the combination of high control and high social support at work buffers the effects of high demands.|$|E
