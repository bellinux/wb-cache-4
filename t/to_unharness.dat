25|$|The {{survival}} of the Romanovs was celebrated. When Alexander returned to Saint Petersburg {{and went to the}} Kazan Cathedral, university students wanted <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> his carriage and pull it by hand.|$|E
60|$|So Mr. George and Rollo dismounted, and the hostlers {{came out}} from the stable <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the horses.|$|E
60|$|He halted {{near the}} camp-fire, and, clambering down, began <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the team. Florence leaped out {{and turned to}} help Madeline.|$|E
60|$|The woman nodded, and Lon fell <b>to</b> <b>unharnessing</b> the dogs, while I unlashed {{the sled}} {{and carried the}} camp outfit into the cabin. The cabin was a large, one-room affair, and the woman was evidently alone in it. She pointed to the stove, where water was already boiling, and Lon set about the {{preparation}} of supper, while I opened the fish-bag and fed the dogs. I looked for Lon to introduce us, and was vexed that he did not, for they were evidently old friends.|$|R

I, lines 288, 289, [...] "When he [Sesostris] {{went into}} the temple or the city, his custom was to cause the horses <b>to</b> be <b>unharnessed</b> out of his chariot, and to yoke four kings and four princes to the chariot-pole."--Diodori Siculi Bibl. Hist., lib. i. p. 37, C, ed. 1604, p. 53.] ...|$|R
25|$|The 2nd Mass {{is joined}} by Dr. Michael Harris, the only doctor to have {{discovered}} how <b>to</b> safely <b>unharness</b> enslaved children. A failed attempt to reclaim Tom's son Ben leaves Hal and his girlfriend Karen {{at the mercy of}} the aliens. A Skitter later orders a Mech to kill the remaining kids in front of Hal, then releases Hal to deliver a message: take one, the rest die.|$|R
6000|$|From the /jacals/ came a cry of: [...] "El Amo! El Amo!" [...] Four Mexican youths raced <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the greys. The cowpunchers gave a yell of {{greeting}} and delight.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{cried the}} Englishman, seizing the reins {{near the mouth}} of the terrified animal and holding its head {{forcibly}} down, while Le Rue assisted the owner <b>to</b> <b>unharness.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was {{an awkward}} mix-up. The sled was upside down and jammed between a tree-trunk and a huge rock, and they were forced <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the dogs in order to {{straighten}} out the tangle. The two men were bent over the sled and trying to right it, when Henry observed One Ear sidling away.|$|E
50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1989 thanks to a joint venture, led by the Swiss and Pakistani governments, brought on due to the {{realization}} of the Pakistani government that it was lagging behind {{the rest of the world}} in the industrial sector, which had been experiencing growth at an astounding rate following the industrial revolution. Pakistan, mainly due <b>to</b> its <b>unharnessed</b> natural resources, has, for the better part of the last 63 years since its independence, been known as an agricultural civilization, but now IIEE is aiming to bring it on the globe as an industrialist nation as well.|$|R
60|$|RECIPE FOR GERMAN COFFEE Take {{a barrel}} of water {{and bring it to}} a boil; rub a chicory berry against a coffee berry, then convey the former into the water. Continue the boiling and {{evaporation}} until the intensity of the flavor and aroma of the coffee and chicory has been diminished to a proper degree; then set aside <b>to</b> cool. Now <b>unharness</b> the remains of a once cow from the plow, insert them in a hydraulic press, and when you shall have acquired a teaspoon of that pale-blue juice which a German superstition regards as milk, modify the malignity of its strength in a bucket of tepid water and ring up the breakfast. Mix the beverage in a cold cup, partake with moderation, and keep a wet rag around your head to guard against over-excitement.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the dismay}} of the moment one thought stood out from the {{confusion}} of Anne's mind and she grasped at it as at the proverbial straw. All Mrs. Morgan's heroines were noted for [...] "rising to the occasion." [...] No matter what their troubles were, they invariably rose to the occasion and showed their superiority over all ills of time, space, and quantity. Anne therefore felt it was HER duty {{to rise to the}} occasion and she did it, so perfectly that Priscilla afterward declared she never admired Anne Shirley more than at that moment. No matter what her outraged feelings were she did not show them. She greeted Priscilla and was introduced to her companions as calmly and composedly {{as if she had been}} arrayed in purple and fine linen. To be sure, it was somewhat of a shock to find that the lady she had instinctively felt to be Mrs. Morgan was not Mrs. Morgan at all, but an unknown Mrs. Pendexter, while the stout little gray-haired woman was Mrs. Morgan; but in the greater shock the lesser lost its power. Anne ushered her guests to the spare room and thence into the parlor, where she left them while she hastened out <b>to</b> help Priscilla <b>unharness</b> her horse.|$|R
60|$|Zeb {{walked down}} again <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> Jim, who, {{when he found}} himself free, rolled over {{a few times and}} then settled down to sleep, with Eureka {{nestling}} comfortably beside his big, boney body. Then the boy returned to one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glass bench was soon deep in slumberland.|$|E
6000|$|... "Once {{across the}} desert, mother," [...] he said, as the sorry-looking team was {{drawn up by}} the side of the pool, and he began <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the horses while his father went in search of game for supper, [...] "and then we shall be well on our way to the old home we had no {{business}} to leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's {{where we}} eat," [...] he announced. [...] "I thought it'd {{be better to}} have a lunch by {{ourselves}} than atop {{at one of these}} roadside dinner counters. An' now, just to make everything safe an' comfortable, I'm goin' <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the horses. We got lots of time. You can get the lunch basket out an' spread it on the lap-robe." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{spoke in}} low tones {{as they passed}} around the house under great oak trees {{and came to a}} stop before a small barn. They did not wait <b>to</b> <b>unharness.</b> Tying the horses, they started to explore. The pitch from the bench to the meadow was steep yet thickly wooded with oaks and manzanita. As they crashed through the {{underbrush}} they startled a score of quail into flight.|$|E
60|$|When we returned, Pomona saw us drive in,--she had {{not known}} of our ride,--and {{when she heard the}} news she was as wild with proud delight as anybody. She wanted <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> him, but this I could not allow. We did not wish to be selfish, but after she had seen and heard what we thought was enough for her, we were obliged to send her back to the kitchen {{for the sake of the}} dinner.|$|E
60|$|The first {{care of the}} two unspilt {{friends was}} to extricate their unfortunate companions from their bed of quickset--a process which gave them the unspeakable {{satisfaction}} of discovering that they had sustained no injury, beyond sundry rents in their garments, and various lacerations from the brambles. The next thing to be done was <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the horse. This complicated process having been effected, the party walked slowly forward, leading the horse among them, and abandoning the chaise to its fate.|$|E
6000|$|He {{drove into}} the yard, did not stop <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the team, but rushed {{into the house and}} began packing his trunk. His plan was formed, which was to drive to Cedarville and hire someone to bring the team back. He had no thought of {{anything}} but the shame, the insult she had put upon him. Her action on Monday took on the same levity it wore then, and excited him in the same way. He saw her laughing with Ed over his dismay. He sat down and wrote a letter to her at last-a letter that came from the ferocity of the medieval savage in him: ...|$|E

5000|$|An {{evening of}} one-act plays, Mere Mortals and Others,opened off-Broadway at Primary Stages in New York, May 13, 1997. The New York Times {{described}} it as “a collection of six fast and ferociously funny comedies … a madcap evening of one-acts”, and noted that Ives has the “gratifying ability <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the intoxicating power of language {{and at the same}} time entertain.” ...|$|E
5000|$|A further turnpike road to Hathersage {{and on into}} Derbyshire via Hope and Castleton {{ran through}} Lodge Moor over Stanage Edge where {{passengers}} had to disembark, assisting coachmen <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the team of horses and manhandle coaches over the precipitous gritstone escarpment. Stanage Pole, (...) a wooden stake some 20 ft, high erected at the brow of the hill, provides a way-mark to travellers in bad weather.|$|E
50|$|In Pisa in 1853, {{she sang}} Gilda in Rigoletto and in Turin in 1855 she sang Violetta in La Traviata, {{a role in}} which she became {{especially}} famous. The response in Turin was a spectacle not seen before {{in the world of}} entertainment. Throngs surrounded her hotel. Men tried <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> the horses from her carriage so that they might draw it through the streets themselves but she would not permit this.|$|E
5000|$|The balloon was {{inflated}} with lighting gas {{supplied by}} the local gas factory and it took off at 5 PM from a small elevation, a former bastion called Harjumägi in {{the centre of the}} town. Winds overpowered the balloon at once and quickly drove it towards the Tallinn Bay. Above the last houses of the town the balloonist dropped himself down from the suspended seat and began to descend under a properly inflated canopy. The winds, however, rocked the parachute violently and carried it farther out to sea. About a mile and quarter away from the coast the heavily oscillating parachute dropped into the sea. Leroux made no attempt <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> himself from the parachute and almost immediately disappeared under water. Some observers thought that they saw him once or twice to rise to the surface. No safety precautions had been taken, and the life-boats that reached the place of disaster ten minutes later found no trace of the balloonist. Two days passed before Leroux's body was recovered by local people. A medical commission came to conclusion that he had drowned.|$|E
40|$|With its {{capacity}} <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> {{the power of}} narrative to promote meaning-making of lived experience, narrative inquiry is developing as a credible approach to research in several areas {{in the field of}} language teaching (Johnson, 2006). This article tells the story of two narrative researchers working in language teacher education who engaged in a collaborative narrative inquiry as both participants and inquirers, in order to learn more about narrative inquiry. The ‘bounded ’ nature of their inquiry design provided a feasible way for them to explore their focus of research (i. e. their learning about narrative inquiry), and led them, through an iterative and reflexive process of analysing their narrative data, to formulate what they believe are essential ingredients of principled narrative inquiry work. Four narrative inquiry variables became the scaffolding which enabled them to answer their research questions, and are offered here as a heuristic for teaching practitioners, whether they be teachers, teacher educators or researchers, to guide them in narrative inquiries into their own work...|$|E
40|$|Women face many {{barriers}} in the journey toward equality. Participants at American Association of Law Schools 2 ̆ 7 (2 ̆ 2 AALS 2 ̆ 2) recent 2 ̆ 2 Workshop on Women Rethinking Equality 2 ̆ 2 addressed the structural, and perhaps sometimes intentional, barriers constructed by societal forces {{and by the}} law against women 2 ̆ 7 s struggles for various types of equality. At the workshop, many of us pointed {{to all of the}} things 2 ̆ 2 they, 2 ̆ 2 meaning others, should do to help dismantle these barriers and to help women forge equality. I agree many barriers remain that must be dismantled, and there is much 2 ̆ 2 they 2 ̆ 2 should do to rectify the generations of obstacles and limitations placed on women (even by the justice system itself). However, this essay suggests a different, or additional, approach. Rather than focusing on the many barriers to equality originating from others, this essay focuses on women 2 ̆ 7 s power to forge equality. Some of this power is cloaked, unharnessed, and underutilized. This essay is intended to challenge women to reconstitute the power of motherhood as a means of transforming not only families, but also law and society. This essay suggests the power of women to be mothering teachers and teaching mothers. Women have a choice, even an affirmative duty, <b>to</b> <b>unharness</b> their power to facilitate change and shape a status quo of equality...|$|E
