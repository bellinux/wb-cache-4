50|$|In 1986, the Renault 21, 2.0 appears, with a {{displacement}} of 1965 cm³, F2R type {{such as a}} <b>twin-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> and F3R type injection version. The F3R of 1965 cm³ also equip Renault Alliance GTA in North America.|$|E
5000|$|For 1957 {{there were}} four {{standard}} engine options, a [...] inline 6-cylinder producing , a [...] V8 [...] "Turbo-Fire" [...] producing , and two [...] V8s: a [...] "Turbo-Fire" [...] <b>twin-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> producing [...] and a [...] "Super [...] "Turbo-Fire" [...] four-barrel carburetor developing [...]|$|E
5000|$|In 1959, Chrysler {{started to}} {{advertise}} the car's new wedge-head [...] "B" [...] engines as [...] "Golden Lions" [...] and the cars as [...] "Lion Hearted". The RB 383 produces [...] with a <b>twin-barrel</b> <b>carburetor.</b> Lions {{were used in}} the advertising, and the cars had lion emblems on the front doors and on the cylinder heads. Air conditioning was a $510 option.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s Weber began {{producing}} <b>twin-barrel</b> <b>carburetors</b> for motor racing {{where two}} barrels {{of the same}} size were used. These were arranged so that each cylinder of the engine has its own carburetor barrel. These carburetors found use in Maserati and Alfa Romeo racing cars. Twin updraught Webers fed superchargers on the 1938 Alfa Romeo 8C competition vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The 1.5 L 1A was {{produced}} between 1978 and 1980. All variants were belt-driven 8-valve counter-flow SOHC engine with a single, <b>twin-barrel</b> downdraft <b>carburetor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Originally, the Lancer {{received}} an OHV 1.2-litre Neptune 4G42, an OHC 1.4-litre Saturn 4G33 or the larger 1.6-litre 4G32. Power outputs were , , and [...] respectively {{for what was}} called A71, A72 and A73 models. The 1600 GSR, introduced in September, used two Mikuni-made <b>twin-barrel</b> Solex <b>carburetors</b> for [...] at 6,700 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, the Special's {{body was}} restyled and minor changes {{made to the}} interior, {{particularly}} to the dash and instrument cluster. The 1963 Special was available as a 2-door pillared hardtop coupe, a four dour sedan, a convertible, and a station wagon. Engine choices were a standard 198 cid L V6 with a <b>twin-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> and an optional 215 cid L V8 with [...] (two-barrel) or more powerful four-barrel ( [...] in 1962, [...] in 1963). Transmission choices were a 'three on the tree' manual transmission, a floor shift Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed manual, or a two-speed Turbine Drive automatic. The two speed [...] "Dual Path Turbine Drive" [...] automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the better known Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission.|$|E
50|$|The D.III {{featured}} a rather prominent overhead cam operating the single {{intake and exhaust}} valves, powered by a shaft running up from the crankshaft {{at the rear of}} the engine. Ignition was provided by two sets of spark plugs, one located on either side of the cylinders, each powered by a separate magneto for redundancy. The ignition cables were protected in tubes running down either side of the cylinders. Fuel was fed into the cylinders via pipes on the port side of the engine, supplied from a <b>twin-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> located just above the crankcase. Both the fuel and oil reservoirs were pressurized by an air compressor run off the crank.The only obvious design change from the earlier D.II was to use separate cooling jackets for each cylinder, whereas the D.II used one jacket each for a trio of adjacent pairs of cylinders. Daimler also used the pistons of the D.III to produce the reduction geared, eight-cylinder 220 hp Mercedes D.IV during this period, but it did not see widespread use. The lengthened crankshaft of the D.IV proved prone to breaking.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, the Special was {{the first}} American car to use a V6 engine in volume production; it earned Motor Trends Car of the Year for 1962. This 198 cid Fireball was {{engineered}} down from the 215 and used {{many of the same}} design parameters, but was cast in iron. Output was 135 hp (gross) at 4600 rpm and 205 lbft Nm at 2400 rpm. In their test that year, Road & Track was impressed with Buick's [...] "practical" [...] new V6, saying it [...] "sounds and performs exactly like the aluminum V8 in most respects." [...] In 1963, the Special's body was restyled. Mechanically, however, the car was identical to the 1962 model. There was also some minor interior restyling, particularly to the dash and instrument cluster. The 1963 Special was available as a 2-door pillared hardtop coupe, a four dour sedan, a convertible, and a station wagon. Engine choices were a standard 198 cid L V6 with a <b>twin-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> and optional 215 cid L V8 with [...] (two-barrel) or more powerful four-barrel ( [...] in 1962, [...] in 1963). Transmission choices were a three speed column shift manual transmission, a floor shift Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed manual, or a two-speed Turbine Drive automatic. The two speed [...] "Dual Path Turbine Drive" [...] automatic was a Buick design and shared no common parts with the better known Chevrolet Power-Glide transmission.|$|E
5000|$|Based on the British Singer Gazelle VI, the Hillman Gazelle {{was offered}} {{only as a}} four-door sedan and was {{essentially}} an upmarket version of the Hillman Minx VI. It was powered by a [...] four-cylinder engine producing , [...] more than the Minx thanks to its alloy cylinder head and <b>twin-barreled</b> Solex <b>carburetor.</b> This alloy head engine was produced for the Sunbeam Rapier. Chrysler Australia replaced both the Minx and the Gazelle with the Hillman Arrow / Hunter range during 1967.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, the 4G32 was introduced, and it {{displaces}} 1.6 L (1,597 cc). It is an eight-valve SOHC {{design with}} an aluminium head and iron block. The engine has five main bearings, a cross flow {{head and a}} single down draught carburetor. Firing order is 1-3-4-2. The GSR versions used two <b>twin-barrel</b> Mikuni-built Solex <b>carburetors</b> {{for a total of}} 110 hp (SAE).|$|R
50|$|The 4-litre Lampredi V12 Tipo 163 with free-breathing {{cylinder}} heads, larger {{valves and}} six <b>twin-barrel</b> Weber 42DCN <b>carburetors</b> provided 390 horsepower, 50 bhp {{more than its}} predecessors and fed to a five-speed transmission modified with strengthened gears. The modified V12 was 4 in longer than the 250TR's 3-litre Colombo engines, necessitating the new frame to suit the engine and {{to comply with the}} new regulations. The frame was 6.3 cm longer to the 250TR's for better balance, strengthened to accommodate the increased power and torque and accommodated the TRI/61's independent coil-spring suspension system.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, the Cobra {{model was}} dropped {{in favor of}} the Mustang GT, which {{returned}} after 13 years. The new GT featured a re-engineered [...] 302 cuin L [...] "5 Liter" [...] engine with new valves, a more aggressive cam (from a 1973 351W Torino application), a larger <b>twin-barrel</b> <b>carburetor,</b> and a revised firing order, as well as a better breathing intake and exhaust system. The GT included the front air dam with fog lamps and the rear spoiler from the '79 Pace Car and the 1980 & 1981 Cobras. However, the full length hood scoop from those models did not carry over and the smaller 1979 Cobra hood scoop made its return on the GT. Only four colors were offered on the GT model and they consisted of Dark Red, Bright Red, Silver, and Black. As in many previous years, the 5.0 engine was not tied only to the performance flagship GT. It was available on lower trims, and also formed the basis for the [...] "SSP" [...] (Special Service Package) cars that were used by government and police law enforcement, and were almost exclusively ordered in the 2-door sedan bodystyle. The 4.2 Liter V8 was available for the last time on all Mustang models and only with an automatic transmission. Trim levels were also revised to now include the L (base), GL, and GLX under the GT model.|$|E
