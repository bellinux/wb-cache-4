5|$|When Árbenz {{was sworn}} in as defense {{minister}} under President Arévalo, he became the first to hold the portfolio since it had previously been known as the Ministry of War. In the fall of 1947, Árbenz, as defense minister, objected to the deportation of several workers after they had been accused of being communists. Well-known communist José Manuel Fortuny was intrigued by this action and decided to visit him, and found Árbenz <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the stereotypical Central American military officer. That first meeting was followed by others until Árbenz invited Fortuny to his house for discussions that usually extended for hours. Like Árbenz, Fortuny was inspired by a fierce nationalism and a burning desire to improve the conditions of the Guatemalan people, and, like Árbenz, he sought answers in Marxist theory. This relationship would strongly influence Árbenz in the future.|$|E

5|$|As per Tulsidas, Rama is the {{efficient}} and material cause (Nimitta and Upadana) of the world, which is real since Rama is real. In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas {{says that the}} animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean {{that the world is}} real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the Vishishtadvaita philosophy of Ramanuja. However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is Mithya (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the Vivartavada doctrine of Adi Shankara, while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the Satkhyativada doctrine of Ramananda. Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Rama due to Maya. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by Mithya.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro {{had come up with}} the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations, and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.|$|E

25|$|Controversy exists over {{so-called}} Ph-negative CML, or {{cases of}} suspected CML {{in which the}} Philadelphia chromosome cannot be detected. Many such patients in fact have complex chromosomal abnormalities that mask the (9;22) translocation, or have evidence of the translocation by FISH or RT-PCR in spite of normal routine karyotyping. The small subset of patients without detectable molecular evidence of bcr-abl fusion may be better classified as having an undifferentiated myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder, as their clinical course tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> patients with CML.|$|E

According to Thompson, there is significant weight, meaning and spirituality attached to cool in traditional African cultures, something which, Thompson argues, is absent from the idea in a Western context.|$|E
25|$|The Task Force labored to {{identify}} a program theme that would appeal to the young men in the targeted age group.

Some patients are also injected with a brown liquid, and alleged minor surgery was performed in about 20% of the cases observed. While Arigó performed his procedures using kitchen knives in improvised settings, Omura reports that the clamping of blood vessels and the closing of the surgical wounds are now performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses.|$|E

25|$|Husuni Ndogo ("Little Fort") {{is built}} from coral rubble and {{limestone}} mortar. The rectangular enclosure wall surrounds {{the complex and}} at each corner stands a tower. The foundations extend two meters below ground level. It {{appears to have been}} built as a fort, but the exact purposes and uses are somewhat unknown. There is some evidence that it, for at least a time, was used as a mosque. Architecturally, it appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> other buildings along the coast, resembling buildings constructed under the Caliphs of the Umayyad at around A.D. 661-750. However, whether or not the structure is related or even dates to the Arabic buildings remains uncertain, though it seems unlikely.|$|E
25|$|The first spectroscopic {{observations}} in 2004 {{showed that the}} visible spectrum of Orcus is flat (neutral in color) and featureless, whereas in the near-infrared there were moderately strong water absorption bands at 1.5 and 2.0μm. Thus Orcus appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> other trans-Neptunian objects like Ixion with red visible and often featureless infrared spectra. Further Infrared {{observations in}} 2004 by the European Southern Observatory and the Gemini telescope give results consistent with mixtures of water ice and carbonaceous compounds, such as tholins. The water and methane ices can cover no more than 50% and 30% of the surface, respectively. This means the proportion of ice on the surface is less than on Charon, but similar to that on Triton.|$|E
25|$|Some {{supporters}} of Taiwan independence, including former president Lee Teng-hui, {{have called for}} the abandonment of the flag, {{and there are a}} number of alternate designs for a specifically Taiwanese flag. However, the prospects for this are not high given that changing the flag requires a constitutional amendment; that the current flag has a huge amount of support among pan-Blue supporters and grudging acceptance among moderate independence supporters; and because changing the flag might cause political tension with the PRC. During the 2004 ROC legislative elections, it was briefly suggested that if the pan-green coalition won the elections that it would force the KMT to change the party emblem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the flag. This proposal generated a few days of controversy and was then quickly forgotten.|$|E

25|$|In December 2003 the Finnish-Swedish {{ice class}} of Botnica was {{unexpectedly}} downgraded from 1A Super to III, {{the lowest possible}} ice class which is mainly used for barges and other vessels unsuitable for navigation in ice. Since the icebreaker is built to DNV's ICE-10 ice class which far exceeds the requirements for the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class, this was not due to any technical or structural issue, but {{a problem with the}} ship's paperwork. Botnica operates at different draughts depending on her mission, and when returning to Finland from abroad her true main dimensions were found out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those stated in the ship's documentation. As a result, the maritime inspector of the Finnish Maritime Administration had no other choice but to downgrade the ship's ice classification to the lowest possible ice class. The missing documents were delivered and the correct ice class was restored shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} fallen angel is the archdevil Iblis (Arabic: إِبْلِيس) or Azazil (Arabic: عزازيل Azāzīl). Alternatively, he {{is considered}} to be a jinni who was either once ascended to heaven, but later banished from there or counts as the father of the jinn. As a fallen angel, the jinn existed already before the fall of Iblis and the Jinn, like humans, do not ascend to Heaven before death. Iblis is assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Jinn. While the Jinn are made out of smokeless fire, he is believed to be composed of another kind of fire (according to Ibn Abbas from the fire of samum). Unlike the Christian belief, Iblis is not generally in charge of non-angelic spirits, but over the satanic Jinn (demons). In parts of folklore, some other angels were convinced by Iblis to distrust the creation of human and have fallen with him, now roaming as demons on earth or in hell.|$|E
