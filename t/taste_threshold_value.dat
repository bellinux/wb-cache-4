40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop the taste-masked microspheres of intensely bitter drug ondansetron hydrochloride (OSH) by spray-drying technique. The bitter <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> of OSH was determined. Three different polymers viz. Chitosan, Methocel E 15 LV, and Eudragit E 100 were used for microsphere formation, and the effect of different polymers and drug–polymer ratios on the taste masking and release properties of microspheres was investigated. The microspheres were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Drug loading, in vitro bitter taste evaluation, and drug-release properties. The taste masking was absent in methocel microspheres at all the drug–polymer ratios. The Eudragit microspheres depicted taste masking at 1 : 2 drug–polymer ratio whereas with Chitosan microspheres the taste masking was achieved at 1 : 1 drug–polymer ratio.

40|$|The odor-active {{volatile}} compounds {{of yellow}} tamarillo fruit (S. betaceum Cav.) {{were identified and}} quantified by using a sensomics approach, combining a gentle volatile extraction (solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE)), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and sensory analyses (gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA)). The medium-term purpose of this work is to evaluate the change of odor-active volatiles during processing. Thus, (Z) - 3 -hexenal, hexanal, and ethyl butanoate were identified as key aroma compounds of yellow tamarillo. The C 6 -aliphatic compounds, aliphatic esters, and terpenols were characterized as the volatiles responsible for the herbal-green, fruity, and fresh-mint odor notes of this variety, respectively. Additionally, one non-volatile compound contributing to the residual bitter taste of this fruit was isolated by a bioguided (taste sensory analyses) fractionation. The freeze-dried fruit was sequentially liquid-liquid partitioned with solvents of different polarity, and then the ethyl acetate fraction was submitted to size exclusion chromatography. Then, its structure was elucidated as rosmarinic acid, by using common spectroscopic methods (mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)). The amount of rosmarinic acid was quantified as 46. 17 ± 1. 20 mg/ 100 g of dried fruit, by the external standard method.

40|$|Beer {{has been}} a popular {{beverage}} for thousands of years,and it {{is often described as}} the result of the oldest biotechnological process. The flavor of the beer comprises taste (not volatile compounds) and smell (volatile compounds). Beer constituents comprise more than 800 compounds and many of them contribute to its fl avor characteristics, such as bitterness, sweetness, acidity, hop character, carbonation, alcoholic and fruity or ester flavor. These flavor notes derive from volatile and not volatile chemical compound influence. Alcohols,esters, carbonylic compounds, phenols, terpenes, etc. are only some of chemical classes to which these compounds belong. These compounds influence beer fl avor when their level is higher than the <b>threshold</b> <b>value.</b> However, synergic effects of more compounds are able to take a determinate compound to underline a determinate fl avor (taste or odor) even without that the same is over its <b>threshold</b> <b>value.</b> Besides the compounds infl uencing positively the fl avor, there are others that,even though generally present in small concentrations, can give formation to off-flavor conditioning the general beer flavor.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The umami taste {{comes from}} {{glutamate}} and 5 ribonucleotides including inosinate and guanylate, which appear naturally in many foods. It {{can be identified}} by monosodium glutamate, being considered as a subtle taste, but blending well with other tastes, expands and enhances the flavor. OBJECTIVE: to identify umami <b>taste</b> <b>thresholds</b> in children with ALL or NHL and in healthy school children and to correlate taste sensitivity with nutritional status, age and gender. METHODS: The threshold sensitivity test was applied to determine umami taste using 6 solutions containing increasing concentrations of deionized water and monosodium glutamate. Subjects were weighed and measured, and BMI was calculated to determine nutritional status. For statistical analyses were used version 2. 6. 6 of the R Statistical software and Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests with descriptive levels (p = 0. 05). RESULTS: The sample consisted of 102 patients and 42 school children, and that subjects were male (53. 9 % and 54. 8 %), eutrophic (63. 7 % and 69. 0 %) and aged from 6 to 9 years (58. 8 % and 52. 4 %), respectively. Most patients (92. 0 %) and school children (97. 4 %) were sensitive to umami taste and had similar umami <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>values.</b> No statistically {{significant difference was found}} between umami <b>taste</b> <b>thresholds</b> of sensitive patients and school children, BMI, gender.

40|$|Umami {{is one of}} {{the basic}} taste {{produced}} by monosodium glutamate (MSG). Generally, commercial MSG products did not specify the amount of a certain dose to produce palatable food. This problem could lead to uncontrolled and excessive use of MSG by consumers. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the values for the detection and preference <b>threshold</b> of umami <b>taste</b> from commercial MSG products at different salt level. The detection threshold was determined using R-index method in salt solutions. The preference threshold was determined by using hedonic rating in food model. A food model selected in this case is spinach soup that is commonly consumed by Indonesian. The salt concentrations for detection and preference threshold experiment were 0. 42 and 0. 30 g/ 100 mL. Umami <b>taste</b> preference <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> using Fechner’s psychophysic equation for 0. 30 g/ 100 mL salt concentration is 0. 25 g MSG/ 100 mL, while for 0. 42 g/ 100 mL salt concentration, the umami <b>taste</b> preference <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> is 0. 06 g MSG/ 100 mL. Detection <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> using R-index method for 0. 30 g/ 100 mL salt concentration is 0. 05 g MSG/ 100 mL, while for 0. 42 g/ 100 mL salt concentration is 0. 02 g MSG/ 100 mL. Different salt concentrations leads to differences in the <b>values</b> of <b>threshold</b> preferences and detection threshold of the umami taste of MSG. Increasing salt concentration tends to decrease the detection and preference <b>threshold</b> of umami <b>taste</b> from MSG.

40|$|Taste aversion {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that rats conditioned to avoid monosodium glutamate (MSG) with amiloride added to reduce the intensity of the sodium component of MSG taste, generalize this aversion to aspartic acid and to L-AP 4, but not to ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists. That is, MSG, L-AP 4 and aspartate have similar tastes to rats. However, conditioned taste aversion methods are unable to show to what extent the tastes of two substances are different. If two substances activate the same afferent processes (e. g. taste receptors), they are likely to produce the same tastes, but if they activate different afferent processes, the subject may detect differences between the tastes of the substances. In this study, rats were tested to determine if they could discriminate between the tastes of these agonists and MSG. We also established the detection thresh-olds for NMDA, aspartic acid and L-AP 4, with and without amiloride (a sodium channel antagonist). <b>Taste</b> <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> were 1 – 4 mM for NMDA and aspartic acid and 0. 5 – 2. 5 µM for L-AP 4. None were affected by 30 µM amiloride. Rats could readily distinguish between the tastes of MSG and NMDA but they had difficulty discriminating between the tastes of aspartic acid and MSG. Rats could also easily distinguish between 10 – 100 mM MSG and 0. 01 – 5 mM L-AP 4. However, in two separate experiments error rates increased significantly when L-AP 4 concentrations were between 10 – 100 mM, indicating that the tastes of L-AP 4 and MSG were similar at these concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Ginseng {{has become}} a common {{ingredient}} used by makers of energy drinks who wish to infer that their product contains memory enhancing capabilities. As studies conducted on its main bioactive compounds (ginsenosides), have shown promise in producing not only medical advancements in memory, but also therapeutic benefits that current energy drink consumers expect. However, there is currently no published <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> for ginseng, which is necessary to make accurate estimates of how much ginseng {{can be added to}} a product before imparting its bitter taste into product formulations. There are two ginsenosides present in ginseng that elicit all benefits expected from an energy drink as well as memory enhancement, ginsenoside Rb 1 and Rg 1 (G-Rg 1 and G-Rb 1). The main goal {{of this study was to}} identify the <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> and flavor threshold of ginseng, to identify the <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> of G-Rb 1 and G-Rg 1, and to identify their contribution to the overall taste of ginseng. <b>Taste</b> <b>threshold</b> tests were conducted using the R-index by the rating method on three different commercially available ginseng samples, two of which were white ginseng, and the third, red ginseng. The results of this study showed that it could be possible to add enough ginseng white ginseng or red ginseng into a single serving size beverage which contained a full day???s worth of ginseng needed for therapeutic benefits. Flavor thresholds were, then, determined using the R-index by the rating method on single white ginseng sample as well as on G-Rb 1 and G-Rg 1. The flavor threshold of ginseng showed that it was not possible to add enough ginseng in adequate amounts into a single beverage to reach therapeutic benefits,which is contrary to what was seen using the <b>taste</b> <b>thresholds.</b> However, percent contribution of G-Rb 1 and G-Rg 1 to the taste activity value and flavor activity value of ginseng was found to be below 100 %. This infers that it could be possible for companies to use either G-Rb 1 or G-Rg 1 in place of ginseng. Finally, data from the <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> and flavor threshold studies were compared, and it was found that panelists were more sensitive to ginseng when identifying the flavor threshold. This could either be caused by panelists relying on the aromatic compounds in ginseng as a cue to identify changes in concentration or that the nose-clips used in the <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> made panelists more susceptible to distractions and mental fatigue...|$|R

None of the sensory properties assessed was associated with the <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> of MSG ± 0 · 25 % IMP- 5 in the overall study population.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to assess two markers of sodium intake, 24 -hour-urinary sodium and salt-taste threshold. We also determined the relationship between these two markers and blood pressure. METHODS: Salt <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> was measured by the ability of the subjects to discern the taste of salt in graded solutions of saline. Twenty-four urinary sodium was measured by flame photometry in a 24 -hour urine collection. Other plasma and urine electrolytes and creatinine were measured using standard automated chemistry methods. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher salt intake measured as 24 -hour urinary sodium/mmol of creatinine in the hypertensive group, (36. 6 ± 20 mmol/L/mmol creatinine) compared with the normotensive group (14. 8 ± 5. 8 mmol/L/mmol creatinine) p < 0. 001. Urinary potassium was also higher in the hypertensive subjects. When the subjects were grouped into low and high salt <b>taste</b> <b>threshold,</b> the high salt threshold group also had significantly higher 24 hour urinary sodium (30. 3 ± 5 mmol/L creatinine vs the low STT urinary sodium of (19. 5 ± 14 p <. 05).

Many patients with trigeminal nerve disorders had abnormal electrogustometric detection thresholds suggesting that there is possibly an accessory taste pathway through the trigeminal nerve, although in some individuals the site of lesion may be in the brain stem. Electrogustometry is a convenient method for clinically assessing taste...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a metabolic condition {{which affects}} multiple organs. Serious systemic complications of diabetes mellitus {{has led to}} multiple signs and symptoms which has affected dental care. Aim of the study: To assess therelationship between <b>taste</b> <b>thresholds</b> in type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics patients for four basic taste modalities. Patients and Methods: This single-blind case-control study was implemented on hundred diabetic patients who visited diabetes and endocrine center in Sulaimani; and hundred healthy individuals who visitedPeramerd dental clinic, for detection of taste sensitivity for four primary <b>tastes.</b> <b>Taste</b> <b>thresholds</b> were detected by the whole mouth taste method {{and the use of}} five concentrations for each taste. Thus, the data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U Test and Spearman’scorrelation coefficient. Results: Statistical analysis indicate <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> measured for each yielded normal range for all tastes in diabetic group(0. 032 molar for sucrose, 0. 032 for NaCl, 0. 001 molar for citric acid and 0. 00001 molar for quinine hydrochloride) but {{there was a significant difference}} in the perception of sweet and salt taste between the two groups(P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Decreased sweet taste sensitivity may result in an increased preference for glucose in diabetic patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{condition of}} adult blowflies (Phormia regina Meigen) affects their readiness {{to respond with}} proboscis extension when their tarsi contact food stimuli. Thresholds are high in sated flies (100 -lOOOmmolP 1 sucrose) and low in starved flies (l- lOmmolP 1 sucrose). Two feeding regimes employing aqueous sucrose were used to reveal factors regulating tarsal <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> in this insect: long-term feeding {ad libitum) and single meals administered to starved flies. A positive logarithmic relationship was found between crop weight and tarsal <b>taste</b> <b>threshold,</b> expressed as mean acceptance threshold, in flies fed aqueous sucrose ad libitum for 4 days. Threshold changes after a single meal were positively correlated to both concentration and volume of the sugar solution fed. Thresholds observed in flies fed a single meal were {{not as high as}} those in ad libitum-ied flies having the same crop volume. Nerve-transection experiments demonstrated that the median abdominal nerve plays no direct role in threshold regulation in either single-meal-fed or ad libitutn-ied flies. Transection of the recurrent nerve (RN), however, significantly attenuated the post-feeding rise in tarsal threshold in starved flies fed a single meal and markedly reduced threshold in sated flies fed ad libitum. Thresholds for RN-transected flies subjected to either feeding regime were still significantly higher than thresholds for starved flies. Haemocoel-injected D-glucose did not significantly elevate threshold in starved flies. These observations establish that the RN {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of tarsal <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> in blowflies. The effect of the RN on threshold depends largely on the prior feeding activity of the flies. It appears, however, that other factors, in addition to the recurrent nerve, affect <b>taste</b> <b>threshold</b> after feeding...|$|R
