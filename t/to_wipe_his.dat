5|$|On January 27, 2009, at {{a public}} sendoff in Phoenix for the Arizona Cardinals before they faced the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon {{produced}} a towel and called the Cardinals mascot, Big Red to the stage, where he used the towel <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> armpits. Gordon then blew his nose on the towel. The Cardinals then proceeded to lose the Super Bowl to the Steelers, 27-23.|$|E
5|$|In April 1948 he {{once again}} {{travelled}} with England to Hampden Park, helping his country to a 2–0 victory; however after the match {{he was the}} subject of an FA inquiry after he claimed tea and scones on his expenses (at the cost of sixpence). Regardless of this treatment by the FA, the next month he helped England record a 4–0 victory over Italy in Turin. Folklore told that he beat Alberto Eliani only to have the audacity to then pull a comb from his shorts pocket and comb his hair; the reality was that he simply used his hand <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> sweating brow in the beating Italian sun. However the legend would follow him around the world in later life, and spectators in the crowd were convinced that they had witnessed it. Later in the year he played in a goalless draw with Denmark, a 6–2 win over Northern Ireland, a 1–0 win over Wales, and a 6–0 triumph over Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|One {{version of}} his death states when found he still had his wiping cloth tucked through his {{buttonhole}} and under his safety harness; as it was his habit <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> goggles clean going into battle, it was deduced he had been caught unaware.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Springrove {{perceived}} her embarrassment, {{which was}} relieved when she saw his old-established figure coming across <b>to</b> her, <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> hands in his apron.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hallo, Paddy!" [...] he cried, {{checking}} himself, and endeavouring <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> from <b>his</b> {{face some}} of the clotted blood with {{which he had been}} deluged. [...] "You here? Are you alone?" ...|$|R
60|$|Hook was {{completely}} puzzled. 'You ask him some questions,' he said <b>to</b> the others, <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> damp brow.|$|R
25|$|Quesada {{was at the}} {{controls}} and flew the aircraft over the ocean for calmer air. Fearing that chemical burns from the gasoline might force him to parachute from the airplane to seek medical treatment, Spaatz ordered Eaker to continue the flight regardless. However, Spaatz shed all his clothing and was wiped off with oil-soaked rags. Although he directed at least one refueling without his clothing, replacements were soon delivered. Quesada was briefly overcome by the same accident but quickly revived. Spaatz experienced two other fuel spills without injury, using oil <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> skin and zinc oxide to protect his eyes.|$|E
25|$|Margaret attacks York's castle at Wakefield, and the Yorkists {{lose the}} ensuing battle. During the conflict, Clifford murders York's twelve-year-old son, Rutland. Margaret and Clifford then capture and taunt York himself; {{forcing him to}} stand on a molehill, they give him a {{handkerchief}} covered with Rutland's blood <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> brow, and place a paper crown on his head, before stabbing him to death. After the battle, as Edward and Richard lament York's death, Warwick brings news that his own army has been defeated by Margaret's at the Second Battle of St Albans, and the King has returned to London, where, under pressure from Margaret, he has revoked his agreement with York. However, George Plantagenet, Richard and Edward's brother, has vowed to join their cause, having been encouraged {{to do so by}} his sister, the Duchess of Burgundy. Additionally, Warwick has been joined in the conflict by his own younger brother, Montague.|$|E
500|$|In the {{controversial}} 2007 video game, Manhunt 2, the main protagonist, Daniel Lamb, has been brainwashed {{and had his}} mind toyed with by 'The Project'. The failsafe phrase <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> mind clean is taken from 'The Tempest' being [...] "What seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time?" [...] Fitting rather well into the story as Daniel Lamb spends the storyline struggling to remember his past which had been cleared by Dr. Pickman. If Pickman speaks this phrase in its entire length, Daniel Lamb's brain will be wiped, killing him, therefore failing the episode.|$|E
50|$|Boon: A {{young guy}} who is scared of his own shadow. He is crazy about {{collecting}} amulets. He {{is on a mission}} at the hospital <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out <b>his</b> gambling debts once and for all.|$|R
60|$|The old man turned, without manifesting surprise, {{for he had}} got the Indian habits in this particular, and, {{running his}} hand under the bottom of <b>his</b> nose, seemed <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> away <b>his</b> sorrow with the action.|$|R
50|$|Faria Jr., {{from then}} on, often {{wondered}} how a mere phrase {{from his father}} could alter {{his state of mind}} so radically as <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> off <b>his</b> stage fright in a second. The question would have far reaching consequences in his life.|$|R
500|$|Following this distraction, in January 942 Kourkouas {{launched}} a new campaign in the East, which lasted for three years. The first assault fell on the territory of Aleppo, which was thoroughly plundered: at {{the fall of the}} town of Hamus, near Aleppo, even Arab sources record the capture of 10–15,000 prisoners by the Byzantines. Despite a minor counter-raid by Thamal or one of his retainers (ghilman) from Tarsus in the summer, in autumn Kourkouas {{launched a}}nother major invasion. At the head of an exceptionally large army, some 80,000 men according to Arab sources, he crossed from allied Taron into northern Mesopotamia. Mayyafiriqin, Amida, Nisibis, Daraplaces where no Byzantine army had trod since the days of Heraclius 300years earlierwere stormed and ravaged. The real aim of these campaigns, however, was Edessa, the repository of the [...] "Holy Mandylion". This was a cloth believed to have been used by Christ <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> face, leaving an imprint of his features, and subsequently given to King Abgar V of Edessa. To the Byzantines, especially {{after the end of the}} Iconoclasm period and the restoration of image veneration, it was a relic of profound religious significance. As a result, its capture would provide the Lekapenos regime with an enormous boost in popularity and legitimacy.|$|E
2500|$|One of Ryang's classmates. He {{learned early}} that Fanta is a faerie. When Fanta tried <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> memory it was {{uncovered}} that Seho has a multiple-personality disorder {{consisting of two}} distinct personalities, which possibly resulted when his twin brother died at birth. [...] This condition prevents Fanta from wiping his memory or cutting his line of affinity. [...] His personalities consist of a [...] "geek" [...] Seho with glasses, closed eyes and a quieter disposition and a [...] "cool" [...] Seho with no glasses, open eyes and a wilder personality. In the eleventh book, the [...] "geek" [...] Seho called himself Jun when meeting with Sorim (his girlfriend).|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Me²" [...] (1988), Rimmer {{is shown}} {{moving in with}} his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also {{mentions}} taking a film course at night school, although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with Citizen Kane. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are [...] "gazpacho soup". Demonstrating intense, literal self-hatred, the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to [...] a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during he made a faux pas where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup {{is meant to be}} served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer {{for the rest of his}} life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that [...] "anybody could make a mistake like that." [...] His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his [...] "death" [...] was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the [...] "gazpacho soup" [...] remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.|$|E
60|$|Carl gave {{a little}} shudder. The {{graveyard}} was not so very far from the old Bailey garden. It would be a trying ordeal, but Carl was anxious <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out <b>his</b> disgrace and prove {{that he was not}} a coward after all.|$|R
60|$|ANXIOUS INQUIRER:--If {{you want}} to remove inkstains place the stain over steam and apply salt and lemon juice. If it was Dan who sent this {{question}} in I'd advise him <b>to</b> stop <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> pen on his shirt sleeves and then he wouldn't have so many stains.|$|R

50|$|The treasures {{that any}} {{individual}} Christian can lay up in heaven are nothing {{in comparison to}} those that Jesus himself has laid up, and {{it is for a}} portion of his merits that 4th-century Ephrem the Syrian appealed so as <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out <b>his</b> own indebtedness.|$|R
