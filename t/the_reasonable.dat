5|$|The {{combination}} {{of this system}} with the rigid meter, and the stress patterns this implies, provides enough information to reconstruct his pronunciation with some precision; making <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> assumption that Orm's pronunciation {{was in no way}} unusual, this permits scholars of history of English to develop an exceptionally precise snapshot of exactly how Middle English was pronounced in the Midlands {{in the second half of}} the twelfth century (Matthew 2004, p.936).|$|E
5|$|The {{crux of the}} High Court's holding {{rested on}} stage 3(b), as {{illustrated}} in the table below. In analysing {{the constitutionality of the}} provision with regards to this portion of <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> classification test, the Court first ascertained the object of section 37(1) of the PCA. It subsequently considered if differentiation on the basis of citizenship was a reasonable means of attaining the objective.|$|E

5|$|It {{is also an}} offence, {{inside or}} outside a {{security}} area, {{to be found in}} possession of supplies which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for, or to directly or indirectly provide supplies to another person, in circumstances which raise <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> presumption referred to above. The penalty for all these offences is life imprisonment. However, in the latter situation, a person will not be convicted if he or she voluntarily provides full information of the offence to a police officer before being accused of or charged with the offence.|$|E
5|$|The {{first serious}} {{allegation}} against Pleydell in the Star Chamber concerned the forced expulsion of an occupant of the manor house at East Grafton, Somerset in late 1553. He {{was accused of}} assisting John Berwick in the original infringement and composing an amenable jury in Marlborough to avoid conviction. Both were found innocent of breaching the peace and claimed to have acted at <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> request of their employer, Anne Seymour; undue interference with judicial proceedings was ruled out. Around the same time, Pleydell was sued for forcible entry and illegal seizure of property at Little Bedwyn (with similar offences at Collingbourne Ducis) but claimed to be acting on {{the failure of the}} plaintiff to punctually pay rent.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>reasonable</b> {{suspicion}} {{test has}} {{the intention of}} protecting public confidence, but Leo and Chen wonder how accurately this test actually reflects the public's view. The test as formulated in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin requires that <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> man be sitting in court and in the know of all the relevant facts. However, this is usually not the case. Most of the public only receives information in bits and pieces, and thus even if a case passes <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> suspicion test, the public may not be satisfied {{that there was no}} possibility of bias. Thus the concept that <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> suspicion test reflects the public's perspective is overstated. The practical reality is that when <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> man is imbued with all the relevant facts, he will essentially be in the same position as the court. Therefore, the suggested approach is that the court, in personifying <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> man, should take into account all relevant circumstances and determine if there is the suspicion or possibility of the appearance of bias whilst being mindful to exclude considerations stemming from the individual judge's personal preferences, special knowledge and legal sophistication.|$|E

25|$|Thus, in general, the {{commonly}} perceived {{differences between the}} two tests relate to the stringency and the perspective of the inquiry the court takes when applying each test. <b>The</b> <b>reasonable</b> suspicion test is usually considered to be of a less stringent standard as compared to the real likelihood of bias test. <b>The</b> <b>reasonable</b> suspicion test is also thought to be applied {{from the perspective of the}} public (or in the eyes of a reasonable man), while the real likelihood of bias test is applied from the court's perspective.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> {{suspicion}} test asks whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting {{in court and}} knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible. Although not currently adopted in the UK, this test has been endorsed by the Singapore courts.|$|E
25|$|All {{persons and}} goods {{entering}} Canada are subject to examination by CBSA officers.

The intensity of an examination depends on <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> grounds that the officer has to escalate the intensiveness of a search.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} in Shankar was examined {{in detail in}} an article by Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan. The authors question how accurately <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> suspicion test reflects the public's perspective, given that the test requires the court {{to look through the}} eyes of a reasonable observer in court who is familiar with the relevant facts, whereas most members of the public hear things from secondary sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{maintenance}} awarded, if any, {{is dependent on}} the discretion of the courts. Particular factors included in the decision process include the position or status of the parties, the number of persons entitled to maintenance, <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> wants of the claimants, if the claimant is living separately and if the claimant is justified in doing so, and the value of the claimant's estate and income. If any debts are owed by the deceased, then those are to be paid before the amount of maintenance is awarded or even considered.|$|E
25|$|Applying <b>the</b> <b>reasonable</b> {{suspicion}} test {{from the}} perspective of an ordinary member of the public can ensure that public confidence in the judiciary remains unshaken. Nonetheless, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has made an ex curiae (out-of-court) statement to the effect that where the allegation of apparent bias is made by a professional man (such as a lawyer) against a court or a tribunal, as in Singh Kalpanath, it may be argued that the better viewpoint should be from that of the legal profession or the professional class, and not that of the layman.|$|E
