40|$|Today it is {{possible}} to create veneers that are aesthetically and functionally satisfying, but there are some factors that may compromise the aesthetic results.  The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate influence of cement shades and ceramic thickness on the colour of ceramic veneers, but also to study how well <b>try-in</b> pastes match with their corresponding cements. PubMed was used to search for papers using MeSH-terms and keywords. 144 titles and abstracts were read, 29 full texts were read and 24 papers were used in the analysis. All of the studies were in vitro. In 20 studies, it was found that the cement shade influences the colour of the ceramic veneer. Two studies reported that the cement shade had no influence on the colour of ceramic veneers, and two did not draw any conclusions regarding the influence of cement shade. Twelve studies compared different thicknesses of the veneers; all of them found that the thicknesses had an influence on the colour of the veneers. Two out of four studies found no compatibility between <b>try-in</b> pastes and their corresponding cements, while two studies found compatibility for some <b>try-in</b> pastes.

Study Design: Questionnaires were delivered personally to 100 pediatric dentists selected randomly across India. Questionnaire was divided into three subsections. The first section assessed demographics to {{determine the}} sample population characteristics. The second section dealt with the pattern of SSCs use and reuse following size determination. The third section inquired into general cross infection control procedures including cleaning, sterilization, and training to assess the general level of compliance. Data analysis involved descriptive analysis using SPSS 16. 0 software. Results: The majority of respondents (98. 92 %) routinely reused the crowns after they had been tried in the patient. Only one respondent (1. 08 %) discarded the crowns after <b>try-in.</b> Autoclave (25 %) {{was the most common}} method employed for the decontamination of tried-in SSCs among the respondents.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the methods used by private practitioners and students to fabricate a posterior palatal seal in dentures and determine how many clinicians carry out this procedure themselves. Materials and methods: The laboratory slips, final impressions and final casts at jaw registration, <b>try-in</b> and finish stages of complete dentures of 50 student cases from the University of Pretoria and 10 cases from 5 private dental laboratories respectively were examined to determine the presence, position and dimensions of the post dam. Photographs and impressions were taken with polyvinyl siloxane impression material in cases where the post dam were marked and/or scribed. The impressions were sectioned with a scalpel and measurements were recorded with the aid of an Iwansson gauge and Carl Zeiss microscope. Depth and width was recorded at the midpalatal suture, right and left posterolateral, and right and left hamular notch areas of the scribed post dams. Results: In the private laboratory cases one of the 50 cases had the post dam marked at the secondary impression stage. In the student laboratory cases, 20 % were marked at the secondary impression stage, 14 % at the jaw registration and 12 % at the <b>try-in</b> stages.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} color of porcelain veneers with <b>try-in</b> paste in relation to porcelain veneers with permanent cement. Also, to {{evaluate and}} compare combinations of three different shades and thicknesses of porcelain veneers and three cement shades before and after final cementation. Additionally, to evaluate and compare the color of porcelain veneers with cured permanent cement before and after aging. Background: Porcelain veneers and ceramic restorations have {{become one of the}} most popular approaches in the anterior area due to their natural appearance and esthetics. However, more conservative approaches have led to thinner restorations with increased translucency. A potential drawback to these restorations is that any color change in the luting cement can become clinically visible, and possibly affect esthetic appearance. Methods: One hundred and eight specimens were cut from feldspathic porcelain blocs (Vitablocs Mark II for CEREC). Three different Vita 3 D- Master 1 M 1, 2 M 2, and 3 M 1 shades were assessed. All specimens were 12 x 14 mm, with three different thicknesses of 0. 3, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mm. Light-cured resin cement (Variolink Veneer, Ivoclar Vivadent) with three different shades was used. The specimen color alone, with the <b>try-in</b> paste, and with pre-cured and post-cured resin cement was measured using a spectrophotometer (Color Eye 7000 A), which measures CIE-L*a*b* values. Specimens were subjected to 30, 000 cycles of accelerated aging (Themo-cycling, Sarbi Dental Enterprises Inc.). Color measurement for all specimens was performed again and ∆E values between groups been calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way and three-way ANOVA, with level of significant set at α= 0. 05, to assess differences between groups. This was followed by post hoc Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s tests. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between <b>try-in</b> paste and corresponding cured resin cement. Pre-cured and post-cured resin cement values showed a significant difference between cement shades. Moreover, statistically significant differences were found between post-cured cement and after 30, 000 cycles of thermo-cycling. Conclusions: The final color of porcelain veneers was highly affected by the different shades of resin cement and by the thicknesses of the porcelain veneer. The use of higher ceramic thickness decreased the ∆E values when compared to thinner veneers. Also, color stability of ceramic veneer restorations luted with resin cement, was significantly influenced by the aging...|$|E

40|$|This {{case report}} {{describes}} a minimally invasive step-by-step approach {{to treat a}} patient with amelogenesis imperfecta. This is a genetic developmental disorder of the dental enamel, which clinically manifests as white and dark discolorations of the teeth. The clinical examination did not reveal the true depth of the staining. Therefore, a step-wise treatment approach was chosen. The first step consisted of a home bleaching procedure, {{which led to a}} slight improvement of the esthetic appearance, but the stains were still clearly visible. The next step was the application of a microabrasion technique. This led to further improvement, but not to a satisfactory result for this patient who had high esthetic expectations. Thus, the third step was undertaken: it was planned to restore the maxillary incisors and canines with ceramic veneers. The dental technician prepared a wax-up, which served as a basis for a clinical mock-up. After discussing the mock-up and the treatment plan with the patient, crown lengthening was performed on teeth 11 and 23 to improve the pink esthetics.

40|$|A hybrid denture is {{one that}} is {{fabricated}} over a metal framework and retained by screws threaded into the implant abutments. The anterior part of a mandibular hybrid denture is fixed on implants while the posterior part of the denture is extended and cantilevered from implants. This article presents the fabrication of a maxillary over-denture opposing mandibular implant retained hybrid prosthesis. A total of four implants were placed in the mandibular arch. Castable abutments were used to produce the optimal angulations. Framework was waxed, cast recovered, and the fit was refined until the framework seated passively on the master cast. The mandibular denture teeth were waxed to the hybrid framework, and a final wax <b>try-in</b> was performed to verify and correct maxillomandibular relations before processing. The prosthesis was inserted after verification of occlusion, retention, and stability. The rehabilitation of edentulous patients with hybrid dentures has been observed to achieve greater masticatory function and psychological satisfaction than with conventional over-dentures. Producing a passive-fitting substructure for a fixed removable screw retained hybrid prosthesis is arguably one of the most technically complex tasks in implant dentistry. The technique presented may not initially produce a perfectly passive framework, but use of disclosing media and adjusting the internal aspect of the casting can result in non-binding, fully seated prostheses...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{clinical}} fit of metal-frame partial removable dental prostheses (PRDPs) based on custom trays used with alginate or polyvinyl siloxane impression material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifth-year students of the Nijmegen Dental School made 25 correct impressions for 23 PRDPs for 21 patients using alginate, and 31 correct impressions for 30 PRDPs for 28 patients using polyvinyl siloxane. Clinical fit of the framework as a whole and of each retainer separately were evaluated by calibrated supervisors during framework <b>try-in</b> before (first evaluation) and after (second evaluation) possible adjustments (score 0 = poor fit, up to score 3 = good fit). Framework fit and fit of the denture base were evaluated at delivery (third evaluation). Finally, postinsertion sessions were evaluated and total number of sessions needed, sore spots, adjustments to the denture base, and reported food-impaction were recorded. RESULTS: No significant differences in clinical fit (of the framework as a whole, for the retainers, or for the denture base) were found between the groups in the three evaluation sessions. Differences were not found for postinsertion sessions with one exception: in the alginate group, four subjects reported food impaction, versus none in the polyvinyl siloxane group.

As {{part of an ongoing}} randomized controlled clinical trial, 32 three-unit FPDs (16 zirconia and 16 metal-ceramic) in 25 patients were randomly selected for adaptation measurements. During the bisque-stage ceramic <b>try-in,</b> an A-silicone impression material was placed between the abutment teeth and the framework. The internal gap, corresponding to the thickness of the replica, was measured under magnification at the following locations: cervical, axial, and occlusal (cusp-tips and central). The internal gaps of FPDs with zirconia frameworks were significantly larger in cervical, axial, and centro-occlusal regions (cervical: 189. 6 +/- 71. 8 mum vs. 118. 6 +/- 31. 5 mum; axial: 140. 5 +/- 38. 3 mum vs. 95. 7 +/- 18. 1 mum; and centro-occlusal: 192. 0 +/- 66. 5 mum vs. 153. 1 +/- 69. 8 mum).

40|$|The endodontically treated tooth {{has lost}} a signif-icant amount of coronal tooth {{structure}} because of previous decay, access preparation for the endodontic treatment, and previous restorations. Therefore, coro-noradicular reconstruction is required to provide retention and resistance form for the final restoration. 1 Cast post and cores {{may be used for}} this purpose. These restorations may be produced by the indirect or the direct technique. 2 A cast post and core should fit passively in the canal and allow sufficient space for the luting agent. If the post does not fit passively, binding with the radicular tooth structure may occur. Silicone disclosing medi-ums are clinically used during the post <b>try-in</b> to visualize areas of binding; these areas are relieved to passively fit the post. Several try-ins are necessary to completely and passively seat the post. In photoelastic studies, active post engagement have lead to high stresses, which may increase the risk of root fracture. 3 - 7 There-fore, it is necessary to fabricate slightly undersized cast posts to allow for passive fit and cement placement. 1 Investigators have developed techniques to enhance the seating of extracoronal cast restorations. Space for the luting agent is usually achieved by plac-ing die spacer on the die before fabricating the wax pattern; shrinkage of the alloy during solidification is compensated for by the setting and thermal expan-sion of the investment material. 8 For this purpose, the Effect of ring liner and casting ring temperature on the dimension of cast post...|$|E

Material and Method: A 37 -year old male patient came to our clinic searching for fast and economic solution for his unsatisfactory smile appearance. Thought clinical examination multiple diastemas were found (around 2 mm wide or less) between central incisors, central and lateral incisor, lateral incisor and canine in {{the left and right}} maxillary quadrant and poor tooth proportion. There was an old direct composite veneer on the tooth number 9, so we removed it. A wax- up was made for visualization and treatment plan.

40|$|Technical {{complications}} in implant prosthetic cases {{represent a}} major challenge in dentistry. This case report describes minimally invasive management to recover an implant with a fractured remnant of a zirconia abutment, including provisional rehabilitation during a sequential treatment protocol in the esthetic zone. A patient was treated with a screw-retained one-piece implant-supported reconstruction made of a customized zirconia abutment with direct ceramic veneering in the maxillary right central incisor position. During the prosthetic <b>try-in,</b> a fracture in the apical portion of the abutment was evident. The first rescue attempt led to fracture of the retrieval instrument. Immediately, an individualized wired construction was applied to bond the existing fractured reconstruction to the neighboring teeth to maintain the peri-implant mucosal architecture. Because the implant screw canal was blocked, a customized round bur had to be manufactured and {{was placed in the}} implant axis with a specific bracket tool from the service set to protect the interior implant threads. Then, the drills of the service set were guided by the newly created access to remove the fractured remnants. The implant screw was retapped and the area rinsed with chlorhexidine solution. All remnants were removed without the need for surgical intervention. Neither the implant connection nor the bone-to-implant interface was damaged.

40|$|In this work, the {{long-term}} bond strengths of adhesive resin cements to zirconia ceramic and human dentin were evaluated, and resin-ceramic and resin-dentin bonding mechanisms were investigated. In chapter 3, {{the influence of}} surface pre-treatment on the bonding durability of three resin cements (Super-Bond C&B resin cement : SB, Clearfil™ Esthetic cement: CEC, Chemiace II: CH) to zirconia ceramic was studied. Most importantly, the influence of chemical reactions of functional monomers in primer on the resin-ceramic bonding were investigated. Within the limitation of this study, priming pre-treatment with primers can increase the bonding durability of three resin cements to airborne-particle abraded ziconia ceramic. Only silane {{is important for the}} initial resin-ceramic bonding, but are not able to produce a strong durable resin-ceramic bonding. The pre-treatment with MDP or 4 -META-containing primers make SB and CEC to produce a durable bond to airborne-particle abraded zirconia ceramic. Due to the decomposition of CH resin cement, the bonding durability of CH without pre-treatment and with pre-treatment with Monobond S and Metal/Zirconia Primer are not testable due to the spontaneous debond during storage. Without surface priming pre-treatment, only SB showed acceptable long-term bond strength to airborne-particle abraded zirconia ceramic. These conclusions can be supported by the combination of XPS, TBS and SEM results. In clinical <b>try-in</b> procedures of zirconia ceramic restorations, to remove contaminations prior to bonding is very important to realize a long-term durable resin bond clinically. In chapter 4, XPS and TBS were combined together to investigate whether there are contaminations on the zirconia ceramic surface left after <b>try-in</b> simulation, and the influences of contamination and cleaning methods on zirconia ceramic bonding durability with MDP-containing resin cements. After saliva immersion and using a silicone disclosing agent, airborne-particle abraded ceramic specimens were cleaned with acetone, 36 % phosphoric acid, additional airborne-particle abrasion, or only water spray. Chemical analyses of specimen surfaces were done using XPS. Our results showed that contamination, existing after <b>try-in</b> simulation as confirmed by chemical analysis with XPS, significantly reduced resin -ceramic bonds. Airborne-particle abrasion was the most effective method to remove contaminants and to create a clean zirconia ceramic surface suitable for long-term durable resin bonding. The combination of chemical surface characterization with XPS and long-term TBS performance was very useful {{to determine the effects of}} the contamination and cleaning methods on ceramic bonding. Understanding the degradation mechanism of dentin bonding is of significant importance for improving {{the long-term}} dentin bonding of adhesive resin cements and the longevity of bonded zirconia ceramic restorations. In chapter 6, mTBS was used to evaluate the bonds of three resin cements (Super-Bond C&B resin cement: SB, Panavia F 2. 0 : PF, and RelyX Unicem: RU) to different regions of dentin, SEM and TEM were used to investigate the resin-dentin bonding interface and fractographic analysis after mTBS testing. ANOVA results showed that mTBS to superficial dentin was significantly higher than to deep or cervical dentin for all three resin cements. For groups SB and PF, with the highest mTBS to superficial dentin, failed primarily cohesively in resin cement. mTBS of SB to deep and cervical dentin were significantly higher than those of PF and RU. RU, with the lowest regional mTBS, failed mostly within demineralized dentin. SEM and TEM showed that adhesive failures in SB and PF occurred at the top of hybrid layer (HL), but no obvious hybrid layer was observed in RU. In chapter 7, the effect of structural changes of collagen fibrils on the bonding durability of a total etch resin cement (SB) and a self-etching resin cement (PF) to dentin was investigated. AFM was used to observe structural changes of intact dentin collagen fibrils after acidic conditionings of two bonding systems. After 90 d water storage and 15, 000 thermal cycles (TC) as artificial aging, μTBS was utilized to evaluate the bonding durability of the two bonding systems to dentin. μTBS after 1 d or 90 d water storage without TC were separately measured in control groups. A cross-banding periodicity of about 67 nm along collagen fibrils was seen on demineralized intertubular dentin surfaces in AFM images. For both resin cements, thermal cycling decreased (p < 0. 05) μTBS of 1 d and 90 d, compared to controls. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopic examinations revealed that the top and bottom of HL were weak links in the bonding interface over time. The results suggest that the top of HL contains disorganized collagen fibrils from the smear layer which degrade over time. AFM results indicate that the demineralized intact collagen fibrils beneath the smear layer were not denatured during acidic conditioning. However, these collagen fibrils may be structurally unstable due to poor-infiltration by resin or loss of resin protection within the HL over time, reducing the long-term μTBS. Artificial aging using water storage with thermal cycling accelerates the degradation of adhesive resin cement-dentin bonding and therefore serves as aging model. This study is very important to provide the evidence that the decomposition of dentin collagen fibrils in the resin-dentin bonding interface over time, although the short-term application of the acidic conditioners used in the two bonding systems do not denature the intact dentin collagen fibrils, is one main factor decreasing the dentin bonding...|$|E
40|$|Tese de mestrado, Medicina Dentária, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Medicina Dentária, 2016 Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the ability to promote adhesion of two luting materials to saliva contaminated zirconia, according to the following null hypothesis: 1) the adhesive system does not influence bond strength to zirconia; 2) the timing of saliva contamination does not influence the bond strength to zirconia. Materials and Methods: Sixty blocks of zirconia were randomly assigned to six experimental groups, according to the possible combinations between luting materials (OptiBond XTR + NX 3 Nexus / Futurabond M+ + Bifix QM) and saliva contamination conditions (no contamination / contamination after the adhesive application / contamination prior to the adhesive application) (n= 10). Previously polymerized composite disks were then seated onto the luting material and the set was light-cured, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Specimens were then stored in distilled water at 37 ºC for 48 hours. Shear bond strength (SBS) tests and failure mode analysis were performed. SBS data were analysed by two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey-HSD post-hoc tests, and failure mode by Krustal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests (α= 0. 05). Results: SBS mean values ranged from 12. 2 MPa to 22. 0 MPa. The groups subjected to no contamination or contamination prior to the adhesive system application yielded a significantly (p< 0. 05) higher SBS than the other contamination condition. The luting materials used did not statistically influence SBS (p= 0. 187). Failure mode was influenced by contamination conditions (p= 0. 007), but no difference was found between luting materials (p= 1. 000). Conclusions: Despite the luting materials did not influence bond strength to zirconia, the timing of saliva contamination did. To rinse saliva contaminated zirconia surfaces seems to be an effective method for saliva decontamination. However, the adhesive system used combined with cements should be applied before <b>try-in...</b>|$|E
40|$|Context: Yttria {{partially}} stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline restorations {{have gained}} widespread use {{because of its}} enhanced strength and esthetics. During the <b>try-in</b> process, zirconia {{is likely to be}} contaminated with saliva. This contamination leads to a clear weakening of the bond between restorative material and cement. For this reason, zirconia surface should be cleaned before cementation. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to compare the shear bond strength of zirconia restorations cleansed with various surface cleansing protocols bonded with two different resin cements. Materials and Methods: Eighty samples of zirconia discs were prepared in the dimensions 2. 5 mm diameter and 4. 5 mm thickness. They were divided into two groups of each forty samples based on luting cement used. Each group was further subdivided into four subgroups of each (n = 10) : Group 1 : uncontaminated zirconia blocks, Group 2 : saliva-contaminated zirconia blocks and cleaned only with distilled water, Group 3 : saliva-contaminated zirconia blocks treated with Ivoclean, and Group 4 : saliva-contaminated zirconia blocks were air abraded. Eighty human maxillary premolars were then sectioned to expose dentin and were mounted on an acrylic block. A jig was fabricated to bond zirconia with the tooth using two self-adhesive resin cements. The samples were subjected to shear bond strength testing. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's honest significance difference test with a level of significance set at p < 0. 05. Results: The mean shear bond strength values of Group 1 and 2 - subgroup B are 10. 3 ± 0. 4 and 9. 80 ± 0. 7 (saliva-contaminated zirconia, cleansed with distilled water only), respectively, were lowest among all test subgroups and were significantly less than mean values of subgroup C, Group 1 - 20. 45 ± 0. 6 and Group 2 - 20. 75 ± 0. 4 (Ivoclean group) and subgroup D, Group 1 - 20. 90 ± 0. 3 and Group 2 - 20. 60 ± 0. 5 (air abrasion group) (p < 0. 05) for both test groups. Conclusions: In a clinical practice, a simple application of Ivoclean can be an effective alternative to air abrasion in removing salivary contaminants and improve resin-zirconia bonding...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background and Rationale: As {{compared}} with glass-based ceramics, zirconia has gained considerable popularity in restorative dentistry {{due to its}} superior mechanical properties. Clinically, however, zirconia ceramics pose a significant challenge regarding the achievement of a reliable and durable bond to resin-based cements. Thus far, it has been established that zirconia bond to resin-based cements can be enhanced after different surface conditioning methods, such as airborne particle abrasion with aluminum oxide particles. Meanwhile, another major issue pertaining to bonding of ceramic restorations is related to its potential contamination before cementation. Briefly, after sandblasting and clinical <b>try-in</b> procedures, zirconia can be contaminated with saliva and/or blood. As with many metals, zirconium shows a strong affinity towards the phosphate group found in saliva and other fluids, which reacts with the zirconia surface and makes bonding very difficult. Recently, a new cleaning agent called Ivoclean® (Ivoclar-Vivadent), which is an alkaline suspension of zirconium oxide particles, has been introduced in the market to remove contamination from zirconia {{in an effort to}} improve bonding to resin cements. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of saliva contamination and the effect of several cleaning methods, including Ivoclean on resin bond strength to zirconia. Materials and Methods: Eighty square-shaped specimens (ϕ = 12 mm x 12 mm x 3 mm) of yttria-stabilized full-contour zirconia (Diazir®, Ivoclar-Vivadent, Amherst, NY) were sectioned from zirconia blocks using a water-cooled diamond blade. Then, these specimens were embedded in acrylic resin, and their surfaces gradually finished with silicon carbide papers (600 grit to 1200 grit). The prepared zirconia surfaces were sandblasted with 50 -μm aluminum oxide particles for 15 s, under 2. 5 bars and from distance of 10 mm. After sandblasting the specimens were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath containing distilled water for 5 min and air-dried for 10 s. All samples were equally divided into 4 groups (n = 20) according to the cleaning method. Airborne particle abraded specimens without contamination was served as the control group. Remaining groups were contaminated with saliva, and subjected to different cleaning protocols, namely: Ivoclean®, 70 % isopropanol, and no treatment. Two resin cement buttons (Multilink – Ivoclar-Vivadent, Amherst, NY) were built over each zirconia surface and light-cured following the manufacturer recommendations. The influence of contamination and surface cleaning methods on ceramic bond durability were examined after 24 h on half of the samples in each group (n = 10, n = 20), and the other half (n = 10, n = 20) specimens will undergo 6000 thermocycles (TC) before shear bond testing in the universal testing machine. Conclusion of Expected Outcomes: The shear bond strength of resin cement to zirconia led to a significant improvement after cleaning with Ivoclean both immediately and after thermal aging...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{management}} of unilateral complete cleft lip and palate patients (UCCLP) requires {{a combination of}} orthopedics and surgery. Depending to the forces involved, pre-surgical orthopedic appliances are classified into active or passive. An active approach employs controlled forces to move maxillary segments {{in the direction of}} where alveolar bone apposition is desired, while passive devices act as an obturator that covers the palate and maintains the distance between the two maxillary segments. Nowadays, increasing number of cleft centres uses 3 D model imaging and landmark digitization in order both to obtain repeated measurements of all casts (minimizing interoperator and intraoperator error) and improve accuracy of data analysis, sharing and storage for documentation and research purposes. Aim of the cast study is a three dimensional analysis of subsequent changes to maxillary arches following different orthopedic procedures in the treatment of patients with UCCLP. METHODS:Two male patients with congenital non-syndromic unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (III Veau class) on the left side are considered to enter the study. The inclusion criteria are the absence of syndromic or medically compromised conditions. The exclusion criteria is the presence of prior surgical or orthopedic treatments. The study reports the results achieved at the last month of the therapy. A putty-wash procedure was adopted: patients underwent an initial impression taken by a silicone putty-dough of heavy consistency with a light-cured acrylic custom-made impression tray and then a light-consistency polyvinyl elastomeric fast-setting material was placed exclusively in the tray above the heavy stage for the final impression. After an ADA Type III plaster cast was poured, an hard self-cured acrylic resin plate was realized. All the orthopedic devices were fabricated by the same laboratory technician. In patient A, the stone cast was duplicated and then discarded 1 mm in the midsagittal plane before plate realization {{in order to reduce the}} transversal discrepancy between maxillary segments prior to surgery. The cast replica was used to realize a custom tray. In patient B, after alveolar segments had achieved a proper alignment, clinicians decided to realize a final passive plate in order to avoid recurrence. The current study considers stone casts obtained 1 month before the <b>try-in</b> and delivery of the orthopedic appliance and 1 month later. The models were digitized using a 3 -axis scanner (Zenotec S 50, Wieland) that captures all data by means of laser triangulation. All measurements were carried out blindly to the patient group. The authors identified landmarks on all palates and superimposed the pre-treatment and post-treatment models using a three-dimensional (3 D) software (Geomagic Control, 3 D Systems Inc, Cary, NC), thus assessing the qualitative and quantitative changes of presurgical infant orthopedics...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Presurgical infant {{orthopedic}} {{therapy was}} introduced by McNeil in 1956 {{in order to facilitate}} patients’ feeding ando to provide stimulation and guidance of maxillary segments’ growth as well as to facilitate surgical management of cleft lip and palate patients. To quantify soft-tissue labial changes in patients treated different orthopedic appliances for the correction of unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (UCCLP) a new three-dimensional (3 D) software (3 dMD, Atlanta,Ge) was employed. Previous studies have used this new technology to investigate the growth rate and the effectiveness of orthopedic equipment in patients affected by UCCLP. The aim of the study is to evaluate three dimensional subsequent changes to nasolabial area following different orthopedic procedures in the treatment of patients with UCCLP. METHODS: Three male patients with congenital non-syndromic unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (III Veau class) on the left side are presented in this report. The study reports the results achieved at the last month of the therapy. As described in the putty-wash technique, maxillary impressions covering the critical areas of the alveolar ridge and palate cleft were taken in two stages using putty-dough and light-bodied fast setting polyvinyl siloxane (PVs) impression materials with a light-cured resin custom-made impression tray. ADA Type III plaster casts were poured. All the orthopedic devices were fabricated by the same laboratory technician. In patient A, the stone cast was duplicated and then discarded 1 mm in the midsagittal plane before plate realization {{in order to reduce the}} transversal discrepancy between maxillary segments prior to surgery. The cast replica was used to realize a custom tray. In patient B, after alveolar segments had achieved a proper alignment, clinicians decided to realize a final passive plate in order to avoid recurrence. According with the Cutting-Grayson technique, in patient C a nasal stent was applied with the aim of moulding nasal cartilage and improving the length of the columella, thus facilitating surgical intervention. Three-dimensional photographs were obtained using the 3 dMD system (3 dMD, Inc, Atlanta, GA) 1 month before the <b>try-in</b> and delivery of the orthopedic appliance and 1 month later. All measurements were carried out blindly to the patient group. The authors assessed the qualitative and quantitative changes in asymmetry using the 3 dMDtrio System and 3 dMD patient software. RESULTS: Individuals with active device showed a reduction in cleft and an improvement of symmetry, the subject with passive orthopedic appliance showed no changes in the analyzed parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The use of new 3 D technologies allows clinicians to study very accurately the growth and the effects of treatment in newborns with malformation problems. The analysis of these three cases of UCCLP confirms that the treatment with presurgical infant orthopedic therapy is effective in restoring the symmetry of the face. The difference between active and passive devices also suggests the need to evaluate their ability of improving nasoalveolar simmetry in long-term studies...|$|E
40|$|Statement of the problem: Currently, {{there are}} no studies that {{presented}} patient centered outcomes for a CAD/CAM 2 -visit digital denture. Purpose: To study: 1) if a 2 -visit CAD/CAM denture was satisfactory to patients who evaluated 12 specific clinical outcomes. 2) If there are any patient reported differences between various clinical outcomes, when evaluated at baseline (within 1 month of insertion) and at a 12 month follow-up since insertion. 3) If there are any adverse clinical and patient-satisfaction outcomes related to CAD-CAM complete denture prostheses. Materials and methods: A total of 20 subjects who presented with an existing set of maxillary and mandibular complete dentures were selected {{to take part in}} the study. Each set of complete dentures were duplicated in a clear acrylic resin. These duplicate dentures were then used as the custom tray, in which the patients went through border molding movements followed by a final impression. Jaw Relation Records was taken in centric relation at the appropriate occlusal vertical dimension and the correct incisal edge position. The mold and shade of the teeth were then selected. The duplicated dentures with occlusal rims and impression were then shipped to AvaDent. A digital preview was reviewed. If corrections were required, it was communicated with AvaDent through email or phone calls. Upon approval of the digital preview, the CAD-CAM monolithic dentures were milled. Standard denture protocols were followed for the insertion visit and subsequent post-insertion visits. The patients evaluated 12 clinical variables using the Visual Analogue Scale at 0 -months (baseline) and at 12 -months following insertion. The following variables were used: Retention (“Tightness”), Stability (“Absence of rockiness”), Support/Absence of food underneath the denture, Esthetics/Cosmetics, Finish/Appearance, Occlusion/Bite and chewing ability, Speech sounds/Ability to speak normally, Extensions/Bulkiness, Tissue health/Absence of discomfort or sore spots, Projection of the upper lip, Treatment time, and Overall evaluation/ “Overall prosthesis satisfaction” The collected data were then statistically analyzed. Results: Of the 20 subjects, 14 patients were evaluated at the 12 month follow up. Three subjects self-withdrew due to patient dissatisfaction. Another 3 patients were lost to follow up. All 14 patients rated the studied clinical outcomes as good to excellent at baseline and at 1 -year recall. Improvements in ratings were seen from baseline to 12 months in the following outcomes: extensions/bulkiness, occlusion/bite or chewing ability, Tissue health/Absence of discomfort or sore spots, finish/appearance, speech sounds, treatment time, and overall evaluation. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, the patient-centered outcomes for CAD-CAM dentures fabricated using a 2 -visit protocol in patients with existing complete dentures was evaluated as good to excellent by patients, using a visual analog scale. The patient evaluations showed minimal differences from baseline and at 1 -year evaluation. However, speech, absence of sore spots, and total treatment time showed a statistically significant improvement in VAS ratings. Finally, patients classified as philosophical by House Classification provided the most favorable ratings in patient satisfaction for CAD-CAM dentures. Though the 2 -visit complete denture is a viable treatment option, clinicians should recognize the need for careful patient selection, learning curve in the clinical steps as well as the laboratory aspect of designing the CAD-CAM denture. Furthermore, the additional time and effort, spent off-chairside by clinicians to analyze and approve digital previews, should be weighed against chair-side time spent on the esthetic <b>try-in</b> procedure, which requires an additional visit...|$|E
