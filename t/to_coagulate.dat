5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid. Noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites, blood serum albumin, fibrin, and wheat gluten.|$|E
5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{blending}} of three natural polymers, raw cotton, silk and wool, using ionic liquids as the dissolving media. We find that with increased content of wool and silk the thermal degradation temperature of the new bio films increases. This is due {{to an increase in}} the hydrogen bond network between the blended polymers. We also investigated the role of the coagulating solvent by coagulating the bio films using water, methanol or isopropanol. Again, we find the coagulating solvent impacts the final properties of the bio films with water shown <b>to</b> <b>coagulated</b> films with the best material properties...|$|R
25|$|Mohini was {{checked for}} Chédiak-Higashi {{syndrome}} in 1960, {{but the results}} were inconclusive. This condition is similar to albino mutations and causes bluish lightening of the fur color, crossed eyes, and prolonged bleeding after surgery. Also, {{in the event of}} an injury, the blood is slow <b>to</b> <b>coagulate.</b> This condition has been observed in domestic cats, but there has never been a case of a white tiger having Chédiak-Higashi syndrome. There has been a single case of a white tiger having central retinal degeneration, reported from the Milwaukee County Zoo, which could be related to reduced pigmentation in the eye. The white tiger in question was a male named Mota on loan from the Cincinnati Zoo.|$|E
25|$|Rennet is {{a mixture}} of enzymes used <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> milk into cheese. Originally it was {{available}} only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin, the key enzyme. The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation. Chymosin is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers has an amino acid sequence that is identical to bovine rennet. The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey. Trace quantities of chymosin may remain in cheese.|$|E
25|$|Camel milk {{cannot be}} made into butter by the {{traditional}} churning method. It can be made if it is soured first, churned, and a clarifying agent is then added. Until recently, camel milk could not {{be made into}} camel cheese because rennet was unable <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> the milk proteins to allow the collection of curds. Developing less wasteful uses of the milk, the FAO commissioned Professor J.P. Ramet of the École Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et des Industries Alimentaires, {{who was able to}} produce curdling by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet. The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant. The sale of camel cheese is limited owing to the small output of the few dairies producing camel cheese and the absence of camel cheese in local (West African) markets. Cheese imports from countries that traditionally breed camels are difficult to obtain due to restrictions on dairy imports from these regions.|$|E

30|$|Radiofrequency {{energy and}} {{sonography}} {{are familiar to}} most gynecologists. In the past, attempts to ablate fibroids with radiofrequency energy (“myolysis”) were limited {{by the lack of}} concurrent imaging that necessitated multiple transserosal passes via laparoscopy or laparotomy in an attempt <b>to</b> effectively <b>coagulate</b> the myoma.|$|R
25|$|Smallholders’ lump is {{produced}} by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees {{on their way to}} work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to get it to a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> the latex— a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.|$|E
500|$|The acidity of {{dromedary}} milk {{stored at}} [...] increases {{at a slower}} rate than that of cow milk. Though the preparation of butter from dromedary milk is difficult, it {{has been carried out}} successfully in 1959 in the USSR. The cream of the dromedary milk, containing 4.2% fat, yielded 25.8% butter. In 2001, the ability of dromedary milk to form curd was studied; coagulation did not show curd formation, and had a pH of 4.4. It was much different from curd produced from cow milk, and had a fragile, heterogeneous composition probably composed of casein flakes. Nevertheless, cheese and other dairy products can be made from camel milk. A study found bovine calf rennet could be used <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> dromedary milk. A special factory has been set up in Nouakchott to pasteurise and make cheese from camel milk. Mystical beliefs surround the use of camel milk in some places; for example, it may be used as an aphrodisiac in Ethiopia.|$|E
2500|$|For coagulation, {{the average}} power is {{typically}} reduced below {{the threshold of}} cutting. Typically, sine wave is turned on and off in a rapid succession. [...] The overall effect is a slower heating process, which causes tissue <b>to</b> <b>coagulate.</b> In simple coagulation/cutting mode machines, the lower duty cycle typical of coagulation mode is usually heard by the ear as a lower frequency and a rougher tone than the higher frequency tone typical of cutting mode with the same equipment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A thrombin-like serine protease, jararassin-I, was {{isolated}} from the venom of Bothrops jararaca. The protein was obtained in high yield and purity by a single chromatographic step using the affinity resin Benzamidine-Sepharose CL- 6 B. SDS-PAGE and dynamic light scattering analyses indicated that the molecular mass of the enzyme was about 30 kD. The enzyme possessed fibrinogenolytic and coagulant activities. The jararassin-I degraded the Bβ chain of fibrinogen while the Aα chain and γ chain were unchanged. Proteases inhibitors, PMSF and benzamidine inhibited the coagulant activity. These results showed jararassin-I is a serine protease similar <b>to</b> <b>coagulating</b> thrombin-like snake venom proteases, but it specifically cleaves Bβ chain of bovine fibrinogen. Single crystals of enzyme were obtained (0. 2 mm× 0. 2 mm× 0. 2 mm) and used for X-ray diffraction experiments.

2500|$|Currently, rubber is {{harvested}} {{mainly in}} the form of the latex from the rubber tree or others. The latex is a sticky, milky colloid drawn off by making incisions in the bark and collecting the fluid in vessels in a process called [...] "tapping". The latex then is refined into rubber ready for commercial processing. [...] In major areas, latex is allowed <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> in the collection cup. The coagulated lumps are collected and processed into dry forms for marketing.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} use for {{sulfuric acid}} {{is for the}} manufacture of aluminium sulfate, also known as paper maker's alum. This can react with small amounts of soap on paper pulp fibers to give gelatinous aluminium carboxylates, which help <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> the pulp fibers into a hard paper surface.

2500|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others. [...] Members of this class (called the [...] "albuminoids", Eiweisskörper, or matières albuminoides) {{were recognized}} by their ability <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> or flocculate under various treatments such as heat or acid; well-known examples {{at the start of the}} nineteenth century included albumen from egg whites, blood serum albumin, fibrin, and wheat gluten. The similarity between the cooking of egg whites and the curdling of milk was recognized even in ancient times; for example, the name albumen for the egg-white protein was coined by Pliny the Elder from the Latin albus ovi (egg white).|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the coagulating properties of slurry suspensions, type of packing liquids, and final performance of slurry-packed microcolumns for liquid chromatography (LC) was investigated. The colloidal stability of stationary-phase suspensions was examined by means of sedimentation and 6 -potential experiments. Expressions for the theoretical sedimentation rate of noncoagulated particle suspensions were derived for spherical particles with completely and incompletely filled pores and for imegularly shaped particles with incompletely filled pores. The performance ofthe slurry-packed microcolumns was predominantly determined by {{the selection of the}} packing liquid.

40|$|Natural wool/cellulose blends were {{prepared}} in an ionic liquid green solvent, 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) and the films were formed subsequently from the coagulated solutions.

60|$|In {{the fourth}} chapter {{it was shown}} that leaves placed {{for a short time}} in water at a {{temperature}} of 110o Fahr. (43o.3 Cent.) become somewhat inflected; they are thus also rendered more sensitive to the action [page 267] of meat than they were before. If exposed to a temperature of between 115o and 125o(46o.1-51o.6 Cent.), they are quickly inflected, and their protoplasm undergoes aggregation; when afterwards placed in cold water, they re-expand. Exposed to 130o (54o.4 Cent.), no inflection immediately occurs, but the leaves are only temporarily paralysed, for on being left in cold water, they often become inflected and afterwards re-expand. In one leaf thus treated, I distinctly saw the protoplasm in movement. In other leaves, treated in the same manner, and then immersed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia, strong aggregation ensued. Leaves placed in cold water, after an exposure to so high a temperature as 145o (62o.7 Cent.), sometimes become slightly, though slowly, inflected; and afterwards have the contents of their cells strongly aggregated by carbonate of ammonia. But the duration of the immersion is an important element, for if left in water at 145o (62o.7 Cent.), or only at 140o (60o Cent.), until it becomes cool, they are killed, and the contents of the glands are rendered white and opaque. This latter result seems to be due to the coagulation of the albumen, and was almost always caused by even a short exposure to 150o (65o.5 Cent.); but different leaves, and even the separate cells in the same tentacle, differ considerably in their power of resisting heat. Unless the heat has been sufficient <b>to</b> <b>coagulate</b> the albumen, carbonate of ammonia subsequently induces aggregation.|$|E
