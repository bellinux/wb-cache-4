500|$|Doe joined Conference Premier club Weymouth on 1 July 2007, {{along with}} Swindon Town youth {{teammate}} Jon Stewart, where {{he signed a}} one-year contract. His debut for Weymouth was in the 3–0 home win during a pre-season friendly against League Two side Bournemouth on 17 July. He made his competitive debut for his new club on 15 September in the 3–1 away win at Droylsden, replacing Conal Platt as a substitute in the 65th minute. Doe's first start for Weymouth was against Torquay United on 25 September, in their 3–2 away defeat. His first goal for the club was scored on 26 January 2008, away at Rushden & Diamonds, as Weymouth were defeated 3–2. Paolo Vernazza took a free kick in the 25th minute after Stuart Beavon was fouled just outside the penalty area by Curtis Osano. Doe scored with a header, which took a slight deflection as the ball crossed the goal line. During Weymouth's 2–1 away defeat on 1 March to Halifax Town, Doe was controversially sent off three minutes into stoppage time. He was sent off for a tackle on Andy Campbell, but manager John Hollins claimed [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} Scott got the ball". Weymouth finished the season in 18th position, defying relegation, with Doe ending the 2007–08 season having made 33 appearances in the Conference, scoring once. Doe won the [...] "Supporters Player of The Year" [...] award, describing it as [...] "the best thing in the World". He admitted he did not expect to play more than 15 games during the season, saying [...] "when I first came to the club I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> play 15 games throughout the whole season but I have ended up playing over twice that and it has just been fantastic" [...] stated Doe.|$|E
500|$|Laughton was {{so pleased}} with O'Hara's {{performance}} in Jamaica Inn {{that she was}} cast opposite him in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS Queen Mary with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O'Hara's agent Lew Wasserman arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making a fuss over me because of something I hadn't yet done, something they just <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles. Is that really you?". O'Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O'Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic thought that was the strength of the film, writing: [...] "The contrast between Laughton as the pathetic hunchback and O'Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired".|$|E
2500|$|However, Nixon was {{selected}} as wicket-keeper for the England Lions team facing the West Indies before the tourists' one-day series against England. Nixon, along {{with a number of}} other fringe players, saw the selection as an opportunity to push for a place in the senior squad. He said, [...] "After the World Cup I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not get another call-up to be honest, especially with the change of management, and Matt Prior has done so well since he came in." ...|$|E
60|$|HAKE I was {{not sure}} of your arrangements. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be wanted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tis what I {{was about}} to ask you--what you are seeking; for that you seek is plain. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> assist you." ...|$|R
60|$|Why this paltry thing, revenge? It {{entered into}} my <b>thoughts</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> end the matter now and let these others go.|$|R
2500|$|Wallace {{admitted}} {{she was nervous}} about reprising the role of Kat. Speaking to TVTimes, Wallace said she'd feared she forgot how to play Kat. She commented: [...] "I missed playing Kat," [...] she said. [...] "Now it feels like I've come home. I was nervous at first because I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have forgotten how to play her, {{but as soon as}} I stepped back onto the Square she came back to me. Even when I was out of the show, people called me Kat every day in the street. I was flattered and now I'm having a great time. The recent scripts have been brilliant." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind for coming, indeed, Sir Marmaduke;--very kind. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> explain {{something}} to you about my income." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Lady Tringle. As I {{have come}} back from abroad <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well come and call. I did see Sir Thomas in the City." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> it best. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{hear the}} truth--and so I have. I {{could not bear}} that Florence should be sacrificed while any thing {{remained}} undone that was possible." ...|$|R
60|$|After sitting so long at {{the open}} window, <b>thought</b> <b>I,</b> it <b>might</b> be well {{to take one of}} these capsules, and I {{swallowed}} one.|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Yes. I {{missed it}} when I {{got back to}} Claridge’s, and I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{possibly}} have dropped it here.|$|E
6000|$|... "I floated {{down the}} river to the mouth, beyond your lines, last night; and then worked round here. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> find you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, not to {{the same}} extent. You see, Lance knows {{everybody}} and everybody likes him. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be welcome for his sake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! no, no"--cried Emma, {{laughing}} as carelessly as she could--"Upon no {{account in the}} world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose <b>thoughts</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not be afraid of knowing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--well---- You see I jest {{come down}} to--to---- <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> perhaps, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> find something, but it's time I was gettin' {{back to the}} fair, 'cause the folks will be needin' me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, {{it is one}} I {{brought from}} England with me. I have been {{accustomed}} to its use, and {{as it is the}} regulation bore, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> carry it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No, thanks,” Jimmy {{answered}} quickly; and added, “I’m afraid it’s {{rather an}} intrusion, {{but as we}} go together, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> bring my friends.” ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. [Impassive.] You said {{something}} abaht makin' {{a picture of}} me. [With faint eagerness.] So I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> come, in case you'd forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> get one, {{but they}} are all gone now," [...] {{answered}} Wingate, and slouched off, whistling in that peculiar manner of his.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had asked}} her if she <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> venture to hope for a more {{favorable}} answer if I urged my suit to you again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Sir Wingrave {{is going}} away, and doesn't want me. I must go somewhere, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{go over and}} take rooms near you all. Would you care to have me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not since dinner time. I know I had it then. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{possibly}} <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{have dropped}} it here, and a dagger {{is not the}} sort of plaything one cares about giving to prisoners." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{meet you}} when I was out——" [...] another pause, another fixing, a pin {{to be taken}} from her lips—"but I didn't." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We are dead!" [...] exclaimed my Kaffir in a {{resigned}} voice. I {{shared his}} opinion, but <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well die standing as running away.|$|E
6000|$|... "They have plenty," [...] Gregory said. [...] "I brought {{enough for}} a week with me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be {{detained}} two or three days, here, and be obliged to make the journey by land to Abu Hamed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{will set}} the thipdars upon us," [...] he said, [...] "and then we shall be killed; but--" [...] he hesitated--"I would take the chance if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{possibly}} escape and return to my own people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Harry, blushing; [...] "as I was in town, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well meet her. But, as you said, Lady Ongar {{is able to}} {{do without}} much {{assistance}} of that kind. I only just saw her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, no. I {{remembered that}} I {{wanted to get}} back to London; and as I had seen my friends, I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> as well hurry away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} out," [...] she admitted. [...] "I do not think, Capitaine Rotherby, that I {{must tell you}} where I have been, but I went to the one place where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have news of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to do that, but then I changed my mind and put 'em in a couple of boxes. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> maybe <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have a chance to train 'em--just like those mice we once saw in a show." ...|$|R
