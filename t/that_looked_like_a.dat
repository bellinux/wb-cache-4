5|$|Grimm {{mounted a}} second {{expedition}} in June 1981 aboard the research vessel Gyre, with Spiess and Ryan again joining the expedition. To increase {{their chances of}} finding the wreck, the team employed a much more capable sonar device, the Scripps Deep Tow. The weather was again very poor, but all 14 of the targets were successfully covered and found to be natural features. On {{the last day of}} the expedition, an object <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> propeller was found. Grimm announced on his return to Boston that Titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.|$|E
25|$|G'Kar - While {{being held}} by Centauri forces, G'Kar lost his left eye after a Centauri guard cut it out. After being freed by Londo Mollari {{in the wake of}} the insane Emperor Cartagia's death, G'Kar was fitted with a {{replacement}} eye by Dr. Franklin. Initially, he had a human blue eye, this was later replaced with a red eye <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> natural Narn eye.|$|E
25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects. As the game got faster and faster, we needed {{to come up with}} a special characteristic to give our character some power over his enemies. I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E

25|$|An {{unstable}} water jet, {{similar to}} the one shown in the flow instability section above, was not disturbed deliberately, but was allowed to rise to a free water surface. On contact with the surface, a slight jet asymmetry caused an unsymmetrical raised surface that fed back to the jet origin and began a process <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> weak version of the flow instability figure. If the jet was not powered, but warmer than the surrounding fluid, it would rise and when encountering the surface would generate a similar feedback system.|$|E
25|$|A Simpsons fan, Rob Baur of Lake Oswego, Oregon, was {{inspired}} by the episode. Remembering the article in a textbook, Baur cultivated real tomacco in 2003. The plant produced offspring <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal tomato, but Baur suspected that it contained a lethal amount of nicotine and thus would be inedible. Testing later proved that the leaves of the plant contained some nicotine. Both plants are members of the same family, Solanaceae or nightshade. The tomacco plant bore tomaccoes until it died after 18 months, spending one winter indoors. Baur appeared on the episode's DVD commentary, discussing the plant and resulting fame.|$|E
25|$|In Wright's {{first public}} {{demonstration}} of Spore, {{he created a}} tripedal reptilian creature in the creature editor (this creature was dubbed the Willosaur by fans, after Wright, {{and became one of}} the mascots for the game, appearing prominently in the game's first trailer.). The game then determined how a lizard with three legs and a prehensile tail should walk. Other animations of the lizard including hunting, eating, swimming, dragging objects, mating, playing a drum and dancing, all of which were procedurally generated based on the model that the player created. Wright then revealed several pre-made creatures which moved realistically, despite their exotic design: large, insectile creatures with multiple heads and six legs, Tweety Bird the SUV: a walking bird whose massive head caused it to tilt while turning, and a dog-like creature with a set of unusually branching limbs. Wright also humorously demonstrated a creature <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Care Bear (claiming it would be a vicious carnivore), indicating that players could create animals similar to those found in nature or popular culture. This also applied to vehicles such as space ships, as demonstrated in the Gadgetoff video, in which Wright was seen piloting a UFO similar to the USS Enterprise.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom the 4–4–2 {{formation}} rose {{to prominence}} in the 1960s. The English also developed a tactical formation <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 4–4–2 (more accurately 4–1–3–2) but switched to 4–2–4 or 4–3–3 depending on how they attacked. The flat back four that had become so popular remained intact, but the midfield was a free-flowing unit with players given license to attack as the scenario saw fit. In defence, using the 1966 World Cup side as an example, Martin Peters, Bobby Charlton and Alan Ball would all stay back to counter the opposition attack. However, in attack they had two options: Peters and Ball could charge forward, creating problems for the opposition out wide with their pace and crossing ability, creating either a 4–2–4 formation or a 3–3–4 formation {{when one of the}} full-backs pushed forward; or Charlton could burst through the middle of the strike partnership of Roger Hunt and Geoff Hurst and overload the centre of the opposition defence in a 4–3–3, providing either an extra man in the box or an effective long-shot alternative. The unsung hero of Alf Ramsey's England side was Nobby Stiles, who was the midfield linchpin, whom the team relied on in defence when Charlton surged forward in support of the strikers.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{opening scene}} depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] were {{way out in the}} desert and we drove around this corner of these hills and I felt like we had entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect." [...] To add authenticity to the shoot, several of the extras used during this scene were former US military personnel.|$|E

Jackson would emerge from a giant black widow spider.

500|$|According to Sally Jenkins, in her Sports Illustrated {{article on}} Carlisle:To take {{advantage}} of the Indians' versatility Warner drew up a new offense... "the Carlisle formation," [...] but later it would be known as the single wing. It was predicated on one small move: Warner shifted a halfback out wide, to outflank the opposing tackle, forming something <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wing. It opened up a world of possibilities. The Indians could line up as if to punt – and then throw. No one would know whether they were going to run, pass or kick. For added measure Warner taught his quarterbacks to sprint out a few yards to their left or their right, buying more time to throw. The rest of the players flooded downfield and knocked down any opponent who might be able to intercept or bat away the pass.|$|E

500|$|The first live {{performance}} of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] {{was on the}} 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour.

Hundreds of burning candles surrounded her as she knelt {{down in front of}} the stage, the backup singers crying the words [...] "Oh my God" [...] several times. Madonna eventually removed a scarf from her head to display a huge crucifix hanging from her neck, and then rose and sang the full song, while her dancers gyrated around her. Two different performances were taped and released on video: the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. On his review of the latter release, Entertainment Weeklys Ty Burr praised the [...] "gymnastic dance productions in songs such as 'Where's the Party' and 'Like a Prayer'", calling them [...] "astonishing".|$|E
500|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Hills Capitol, the now [...] "homeless" [...] legislature moved to a nearby Methodist Church. There were soon demands that the capital be relocated to Pittsburgh or Philadelphia; the legislature quickly appropriated money to build a new capitol in Harrisburg. Governor Daniel H. Hastings opted for a pay-as-you-go policy to allow the construction costs to be spread over multiple annual budgets. Governor Hastings also figured that $550,000 was enough to build [...] "a small legislative building" [...] that could be added onto as needed over time. After building designs were submitted by various architects in another competition, Henry Ives Cobb was chosen in 1897 to design the new capitol. Construction of the Cobb Capitol began on May 2, 1898. The legislature met in the finished building, which they had deemed complete, even though it was an [...] "unadorned, unfinished, several-story brown brick structure <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> factory", on January 3, 1899. Cobb himself described the building simply as [...] "ugly" [...] but believed that {{he would be able to}} finish it eventually, when more funding became available.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to something <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E
