5|$|Déjà Vu was {{released}} on DVD and home video approximately five months after its release in American theaters, on April 24, 2007. In the two weeks succeeding {{the day of the}} DVD's release, the film was the second most purchased DVD in the United States. It was second only <b>to</b> <b>Night</b> at the Museum during this period in time.|$|E

5|$|Adaptations <b>to</b> <b>night</b> vision {{include the}} large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E

5|$|After {{recovering}} {{he took up}} staff duties for a year, until 16 September 1941, when he {{was made}} Staffelkapitän (Squadron leader) of a newly formed night-fighter training unit, 2./Nachtjagdschule 1 (coming out of 2./Zerstörerschule 1). Soon after, on 31 October, Hauptmann (Captain) Specht was promoted to Kommandeur of III./NJS 1. Located at Ingolstadt-Manching, Specht instructed pilots in conversion <b>to</b> <b>night</b> fighting. Paul Zorner, a future night fighter expert, {{was one of his}} students. Leading the Gruppe for exactly one year, this was the last time Specht flew a twin engine aircraft, whereupon he returned to combat duties.|$|E
5|$|All {{movement}} had been restricted <b>to</b> <b>night</b> time, {{culminating in a}} general move forwards {{on the eve of}} battle. On the night of 18/19 September, the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions moved forward behind the infantry, while the Australian Mounted Division moved up to Sarona. Here the three divisions concentrated, with their supplies carried in massed horse-drawn transport and on long camel trains, clogging the roads. The divisions carried one iron ration and two days' special emergency rations per man, and 21 pounds (9.5kg) of grain per horse, all carried on the horse, with an additional day's grain per horse carried on the first line transport limbered wagons.|$|E
5|$|Apart from American and Soviet {{strategic}} forces, however, camouflage {{continued to}} be applied tactically. For example in the Korean War, American B-29 bombers were switched <b>to</b> <b>night</b> flying with black undersides when Chinese fighters became a significant threat. In the Vietnam War, Vietcong MiG-21 fighters were painted by hand in green ground camouflage patterns, while the USAAF and US Navy both restarted experiments with painted camouflage. In the Soviet–Afghan War, Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters were camouflaged in a sand and spinach pattern.|$|E

5|$|Galland {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from Göring on 10 May 1941, requesting Galland to intercept a Messerschmitt Bf 110 flown by Rudolf Hess heading for Scotland. Galland was unable to launch a full fighter sweep. However, Hess' flight was far to the north and he reached Scotland crashing his aircraft. Galland sent out fighters to conduct some sweeps so he could honestly claim to have carried out his orders but it was nearly dark and Galland ordered his pilots unused <b>to</b> <b>night</b> flying to stand down.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1945, Norstad visited Hansell’s {{headquarters}} and abruptly relieved him of command, replacing him with LeMay. Hansell {{was offered the}} option of commanding XX Bomber Command while it transitioned to Guam, then becoming LeMay’s deputy. Although he and LeMay were friends, LeMay had been Hansell’s subordinate in England, and Hansell declined the offer. While all the command problems factored into his relief, the main reasons were Hansell’s persistence in daylight precision attacks, reluctance <b>to</b> <b>night</b> firebombing, Norstad's view that Hansell was an impediment to instituting incendiary attacks, and a perception by Arnold and Norstad that the public relations effort by XXI Bomber Command had been unsatisfactory in preparing the American public for such attacks.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{followed}} {{his first book}} with Delilah of Harlem, The Mask of Venus, Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and In the Shadow of the Pyramids. In addition to his fiction prose output, Savage published collections of his speeches and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style was fast and precise: he wrote from morning <b>to</b> <b>night</b> and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able {{to carry on a}} conversation while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894.|$|E
50|$|In March 1977, {{the show}} was renamed from NBC's Saturday <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Saturday <b>Night</b> Live.|$|R

50|$|The race dates {{were also}} changed from Friday <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> Thursday <b>nights</b> <b>to</b> try {{increasing}} car and fan turnout. This, however, didnt work out well and race nights were subsequently changed in 1999 to Saturday.|$|R
5|$|Similarly, {{shift workers}} have {{difficulty}} maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due <b>to</b> <b>night</b> or irregular work hours. Shift {{workers need to}} be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. XIV was {{theoretically}} less {{accurate than}} the contemporary Norden bombsight but was smaller, easier to use, faster-acting and better suited <b>to</b> <b>night</b> bombing. It equipped {{the majority of}} the RAF bomber fleet during the war; small numbers of Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sights and Low Level Bombsight, Mark IIIs were used in specialist roles. A post-war upgrade, the T-4, also known by its rainbow code Blue Devil, connected directly to the Navigation and Bombing System to automate the setting of windspeed and direction and further increase accuracy. These equipped the V Bomber force as well as other aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort <b>to</b> <b>night</b> movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals.|$|E
5000|$|Nights' {{relationship}} with Reala appears complicated. Nights still holds Reala as a friend, {{or at least}} a former one. Reala often plays on Nights' mercy, using it as an opportunity <b>to</b> imprison <b>Nights.</b> Reala sometimes refers <b>to</b> <b>Nights</b> as a [...] "sibling" [...] and, in almost every instance in the sequel, will try and talk Nights into surrendering before starting a fight.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>Nights</b> in the Gardens of Spain, Cubiles recorded numerous solo pieces, including {{works by}} Albéniz (the suite Iberia and other works) and Turina (Cinco danzas gitanas, Op. 55).|$|R

The theatrical trailer was scheduled to appear with the film Disturbia, on April 13, 2007, but errors occurred and Tim Story announced that it would be released with Spider-Man 3 on May 4, 2007. The theatrical trailer was finally released online on April 30, 2007 on Apple Trailer's website.|$|E
5|$|As planned, {{counterclockwise}} trains, to {{and from}} Jamaica and Howard Beach, would have run every 2 minutes during peak hours, for a frequency of 30 trains per hour (tph). Each branch would have been served by a train every four minutes, or 15 tph. The final environmental impact statement planned for even higher frequencies of 40 tph, or a train every 90 seconds in the central terminal area. However, , actual frequencies were much lower, with each branch being served by one train every 7 to 12 minutes during peak hours, or 5 to 8.5 tph. During middays, trains come every 10 to 15 minutes, with 4 to 6 tph on each branch. Late night service is less frequent: trains come every 15 to 20 minutes, with 3 to 4 tph on each branch. Weekend service is similar <b>to</b> <b>night</b> service, with trains coming every 16 minutes, or 4 tph on each branch. Trains make the journey between the terminals and either Jamaica or Howard Beach in about eight minutes.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns <b>to</b> <b>night,</b> they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E

5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day <b>to</b> <b>night.</b> These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E
5|$|His first {{squadron}} was No. 29 Squadron RAF, {{based at}} RAF West Malling, flying the two-seater Hawker Demon. In February 1939 No 29 Squadron re-equipped with the Bristol Blenheim. Braham was disappointed at not being {{trained on the}} Hawker Hurricane and his reaction to this news was request a transfer which was refused. The squadron spent three months converting onto the Blenheim. In August 1939 No. 29 did convert to the Hurricane but upon the outbreak of war the squadron was reverted to the Blenheim {{as part of its}} reorientation <b>to</b> <b>night</b> fighter rather than daylight fighter operations. Braham soon earned the nickname 'Bob', which stayed with him throughout his service career. He had chosen this Christian name as his radio call sign to distinguish himself from the multitude of other Johns in the unit.|$|E
5|$|Later, he {{attended}} the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and graduated in 1926 as the senior class Salutatorian. At Penn, he was initiated into Theta Delta Chi, and he also {{served as president of}} the Phi Deuteron Charge. Upon his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science his father gave him a cabin cruiser that slept eight. He was also Junior and Senior class president. O’Malley originally enrolled at Columbia University in New York City for law school, but after his family lost their money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, he switched from Columbia Law School <b>to</b> <b>night</b> school at Fordham University. Edwin O'Malley's dry goods business was failing and Walter had to help run the business.|$|E
