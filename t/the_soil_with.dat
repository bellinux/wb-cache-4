40|$|Clay-rich subsoils {{are added}} to sandy soils to improve crop yield and {{increase}} organic carbon (C) sequestration; however, {{little is known about}} the influence of clay subsoil properties on organic C sorption and desorption. Batch sorption experiments were conducted with nine clay subsoils with a range of properties. The clay subsoils were shaken for 16 h at 4 °C with water-extractable organic C (WEOC, 1224 g C L⁻¹) from mature wheat residue at a soil to extract ratio of 1 : 10. After removal of the supernatant, the residual pellet was shaken with deionised water to determine organic C desorption. The WEOC sorption was positively correlated with smectite and illite contents, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and total organic C, but negatively correlated with kaolinite content. Desorption of WEOC expressed as a percentage of WEOC sorbed was negatively correlated with smectite and illite contents, CEC, total and exchangeable calcium (Ca) concentrations and clay content, but positively correlated with kaolinite content. The relative importance of these properties varied among <b>soil</b> types. <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> <b>with</b> a high WEOC sorption capacity had medium CEC and their dominant clay minerals were smectite and illite. In contrast, kaolinite was the dominant clay mineral in <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>with</b> a low WEOC sorption capacity and low-to-medium CEC. However, most soils had properties which could increase WEOC sorption as well as those that could decrease WEOC sorption. The relative importance of properties increasing or decreasing WEOC sorption varied <b>with</b> <b>soils.</b> <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> <b>with</b> high desorption had a low total Ca concentration, low-to-medium CEC and low clay content, whereas <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> <b>with</b> low desorption were characterised by medium-to-high CEC and smectite and illite were the dominant clay minerals. We conclude that WEOC sorption and desorption depend not on a single property but rather a combination of several properties of the subsoils in this study. Trung Ta Nguyen and Petra Marschne...|$|R
5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig {{the same sort of}} pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it {{is on the verge of}} collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> <b>with</b> only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone.
