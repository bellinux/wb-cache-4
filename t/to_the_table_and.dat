25|$|The closest tools {{similar to}} a niddy-noddy are the swift, and the spinner's weasel. Some swifts need to be {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> even folding swifts {{tend to be a}} bit inconvenient to fold and carry and thus are not as portable as a niddy-noddy, and while the swift has other uses (mainly being to hold skeins for balling), it is not as convenient as the niddy-noddy for creating a skein, nor does it allow one to calculate the yardage as easily. A spinner's weasel is also not portable, however it does measure the yardage, and is faster and easier to use.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{during the}} long 1643–1715 reign of Louis XIV, billiard tables were narrowed, with wooden pins or {{skittles}} {{at one end of}} the table, and players would shoot balls with a stick or cue from the other end, in a game inspired as much by bowling as billiards. Pins took too long to reset when knocked down, so they were eventually fixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> holes in the bed of the table became the targets. Players could ricochet balls off the pins to achieve the harder scorable holes. A standardized version of the game eventually became known as bagatelle.|$|E

25|$|In September 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{pushed to}} revive the stalled peace process by getting the parties involved to agree to direct talks {{for the first time}} in about two years. While U.S. President Barack Obama was the orchestrator of the movement, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went through months of cajoling just to get the parties <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>and</b> helped convince the reluctant Palestinians by getting support for direct talks from Egypt and Jordan. The aim of the talks was to forge the framework of a final agreement within one year, although general expectations of a success were fairly low. The talks aimed to put the Israeli–Palestinian conflict to an official end by forming a two-state solution for the Jewish and Palestinian peoples, promoting the idea of everlasting peace and putting an official halt to any further land claims, as well as accepting the rejection of any forceful retribution if violence should reoccur. Hamas and Hezbollah, however threatened violence, especially if either side seemed likely to compromise in order to reach an agreement. As a result, the Israeli government publicly stated that peace couldn't exist even if both sides signed the agreement, due to the stance taken by Hamas and Hezbollah. The US was therefore compelled to re-focus on eliminating the threat posed by the stance of Hamas and Hezbollah as part of the direct talk progress. Israel for its part, was skeptical that a final agreement was reached that the situation would change, as Hamas and Hezbollah would still get support to fuel new violence. In addition, the Israeli government rejected any possible agreement with Palestine as long as it refuses to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.|$|E

[...] "There's a great beat to this, a brilliant vocal where Madonna answers herself with whispers and an unforgettable chorus," [...] Wade added. Matthew Rettenmund wrote in his Encyclopedia Madonnica that [...] "inspite of the chart performance", the song has become a modern [...] "self-empowerment anthem".|$|E

Despite Adams' {{impressive}} opening performance, by the third day of the match, Sexton was far in the lead. In Dewey-Defeats-Truman-style, many newspapers reported that Sexton won the tournament, as their reporters left the venue at a time when Sexton had a seemingly indomitable lead and before the match was over. The New York Times, for example, reported that Sexton won the match, though they leavened the result by reporting that despite the prize fund, it was a [...] "friendly match", geared toward exhibition, and that [...] "Adams could undoubtedly have run the game out on three occasions, but preferred to make 'display' shots in place of his usual [...] "nurse" [...] play, against which a cue player stands no chance whatever." [...] However, with Sexton needed only seven points to win the championship, Adams stepped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> ran out, making 1,181 points in a row to win the match.|$|E

500|$|In the Prose Edda, {{written in}} the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, valkyries are first {{mentioned}} in chapter 36 of the book Gylfaginning, where the enthroned figure of High informs Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) of {{the activities of the}} valkyries and mentions a few goddesses. High says [...] "there are still others whose duty it is to serve in Valhalla. They bring drink and see <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>and</b> the ale cups." [...] Following this, High gives a stanza from the poem Grímnismál that contains a list of valkyries. High says [...] "these women are called valkyries, and they are sent by Odin to every battle, where they choose which men are to die and they determine who has victory". High adds that Gunnr ("war"), Róta, and Skuld—the last of the three he refers to as [...] "the youngest norn"—"always ride to choose the slain and decide the outcome of battle". In chapter 49, High describes that when Odin and his wife Frigg arrived at the funeral of their slain son Baldr, with them came the valkyries and also Odin's ravens.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the summer}} of 2010, the stalled Israeli–Palestinian peace process was {{potentially}} revived when the various parties involved agreed to direct talks {{for the first time}} in a while.

[...] Her role in the ongoing talks would be to take over from U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George J. Mitchell when discussions threatened to break down. The talks were generally given little chance to succeed, and Clinton faced the history of many such past failures, including the near miss of her husband at the 2000 Camp David Summit. Nevertheless, her prominent role in them thrust her further into the international spotlight and had the potential to affect her legacy as secretary.|$|E
