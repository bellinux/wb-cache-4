25|$|While Juvenal's mode of satire {{has been}} noted from antiquity for its wrathful scorn <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> representatives of social deviance, some {{politically}} progressive scholars such as, W.

25|$|Wheatley mainly wrote {{adventure}} novels, {{with many}} books {{in a series}} of linked works. Background themes included the French Revolution (the Roger Brook series), Satanism (the Duke de Richleau series), World War II (the Gregory Sallust series) and espionage (the Julian Day novels). Over time, each of his major series would include at least one book pitting the hero against some manifestation of the supernatural - making them into Fantasy and specifically Contemporary Fantasy. He came to be considered an authority on Satanism, the practice of exorcism, and black magic, <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> of which he expressed hostility. During his study of the paranormal, though, he joined the Ghost Club.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} antiheroine, Ivy Slade is a sassy {{and intelligent}} girl {{introduced in the}} fifth novel. During the series' second arc (books 5–8), she reveals a firm hostility <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> things associated with Billings House. She {{is described as a}} match for the Billings Girls in terms of beauty and glamour. However, she is the only character known to have declined an invitation to join the dorm. Eventually, Ivy and Reed form a truce in the interests of a common goal, leading to a friendship between the two. She finally fulfills her destiny and becomes a Billings Girl later in the series, at Reed's request.|$|E
25|$|After arrival, Ronnie becomes miserable, defiant, and {{defensive}} <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> those around her, including handsome, popular Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) whose introduction involved crashing into her during a volleyball match, and accidentally spilling Ronnie's strawberry shake on her. She shrugs {{him off and}} meets Blaze, an outcast who lives with her boyfriend Marcus. While at a beach campfire, Marcus hits on Ronnie and Blaze mistakes this for Ronnie flirting with him. Angered by this, Blaze later frames Ronnie for shoplifting, causing her arrest. Later on, Ronnie discovers a Loggerhead Sea Turtle nest at the beach by her house and while protecting it, she meets Will again on his volunteer work for the aquarium. After a night of staying up to defend the turtle eggs from predators with Will, she discovers he is deeper than she expected, and begins to develop feelings for him.|$|E
25|$|The Bhopal medical {{community}} {{was faced with}} 1) the urgent health care needs of the affected community, 2) the non-availability of toxicological and accident-related information, 3) the extreme sensitivity of local and national government bodies <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> aspects of the disaster, 4) lack of expertise, and 5) the lack of funds available to independent researchers to conduct investigations. Faced with lawsuits {{and the prospect of}} bankruptcy, Union Carbide’s efforts to keep open channels of communication were highly inadequate to address these issues and were {{considered by many to be}} a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw a veil of secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis data were not made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the {{medical community}} to understand the linkage between exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, the lack of information about whether MIC could thermally decompose to hydrocyanic acid led to years of contentious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning and an unfortunate violation of patient confidentiality.|$|E

500|$|Reviewer Daisy Aldan of World Literature Today criticized Angelou for {{harboring}} [...] "a fanatic hostility expressed <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> white people", but writer Lyman B. Hagen disagreed, {{stating that}} like Angelou's friend and mentor Langston Hughes, Angelou explained and illuminated {{the condition of}} African Americans, but without alienating her readers. Angelou promoted the importance of hard work, a common theme in slave narratives, throughout all her autobiographies, in order to break the African-American stereotype of laziness. [...] Her description of the strong and cohesive Black community of Stamps demonstrated how African Americans have subverted repressive institutions to withstand racism. [...] Angelou evolved from wishing that she could become white in Caged Bird to later shedding her self-loathing and embracing a strong racial identity.|$|E
500|$|The {{chemistry}} between Pine and Quinto {{was well}} received by critics. Gleiberman felt {{that as the}} film progressed to the conclusion, Pine and Quinto emulated the same connection as Kirk and Spock. Tim Robey of The Telegraph echoed similar attitudes; [...] "The movie charts their relationship [...] in a nicely oblique way." [...] Robey resumed: [...] "It's the main event, dramatically speaking, but there's always something more thumpingly urgent to command their attention, whether it's a Vulcan distress signal or the continuing rampages of those pesky Romulans." [...] Burr opined that Abrams had an accurate {{understanding of the relationship}} between Kirk and Spock, and wrote, [...] "Pine makes a fine, brash boy Kirk, but Quinto's Spock is something special – an eerily calm figure freighted with a heavier sadness than Roddenberry's original. The two ground each other and point <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> the stories yet to come." [...] Similarly, The Guardian writer Peter Bradshaw expressed: [...] "The story of Kirk and Spock is brought thrillingly back to life by a new first generation: Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, who give inspired, utterly unselfconscious and lovable performances, with power, passion and some cracking comic timing." ...|$|E
500|$|The creators wanted Phineas, like Ferb, to be a {{character}} who would never [...] " [...] anything with any ," [...] or to agitate his sister or outsmart his mother purposely. Instead, the character {{was supposed to be}} motivated only by enjoyment and free from mean spiritedness. He is generous, kind, and optimistic, and several of his plots involve helping someone out. He tries to please his sister Candace, carving her face into Mount Rushmore for her birthday in one episode and helping her retrieve a tape detailing his summer adventures even though she intended on using the footage as evidence to [...] "bust" [...] him and Ferb. Another episode has him throwing an extravaganza for his mother's birthday, and yet another has him (along with Ferb and Candace) recreating their parent's most romantic moment for their wedding anniversary. He has also been shown helping his grandparents, reenacting his grandfather Reginald's daredevil stunt from his youth and setting up a roller derby for a rematch race with his grandmother Betty Jo's old rival. In the episodes [...] "One Good Scare Ought to Do It!" [...] and [...] "Hail Doofania!", Phineas goes to great lengths to help his friend Isabella. [...] Other episodes, like [...] "Unfair Science Fair," [...] "Oil on Candace," [...] "The Bully Code," [...] and [...] "Voyage To The Bottom of Buford," [...] further explore Phineas's generosity <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> of his friends. He even has plans at the beginning of [...] "The Bully Code" [...] for a jellybean currency system for emerging nations.|$|E

500|$|During the 2008 primaries, Gore {{remained}} neutral <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> of {{the candidates}} which led to speculation that he {{would come out of}} a brokered 2008 Democratic National Convention as a [...] "compromise candidate" [...] if the party decided it could not nominate one. Gore responded by stating that these events would not take place because a candidate would be nominated through the primary process. Senator Ted Kennedy had urged Gore to endorse Senator Barack Obama though Gore declined. When Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president on June 3, 2008, speculation began that Gore might be tapped for the vice presidency. On June 16, 2008, one week after Hillary Clinton had suspended her campaign, Gore endorsed Obama in a speech given in Detroit, Michigan which renewed speculation of an Obama-Gore ticket. Gore stated, however, that he was not interested in being Vice President again. On the timing and nature of Gore's endorsement, some argued that Gore waited because {{he did not want to}} repeat his calamitous early endorsement of Howard Dean during the 2004 Presidential Election. On the final night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, shortly before Obama delivered his acceptance address, Gore gave a speech offering his full support. Such support led to new speculation after Obama was elected President during the 2008 Presidential election that Gore would be named a member of the Obama administration. This speculation was enhanced by a meeting held between Obama, Gore, and Joe Biden in Chicago on December 9, 2008. However, Democratic officials and Gore's spokeswoman stated that during the meeting the only subject under discussion was the climate crisis, and Gore would not be joining the Obama administration. On December 19, 2008, Gore described Obama's environmental administrative choices of Carol Browner, Steven Chu, and Lisa Jackson as [...] "an exceptional team to lead the fight against the climate crisis." ...|$|E
500|$|Jinnah devoted much of {{his time}} to his law {{practice}} in the early 1900s, but remained politically involved. [...] Jinnah began political life by attending the Congress's twentieth annual meeting, in Bombay in December 1904. He {{was a member of the}} moderate group in the Congress, favouring Hindu–Muslim unity in achieving self-government, and following such leaders as Mehta, Naoroji, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. They were opposed by leaders such as Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai, who sought quick action towards independence. [...] In 1906, a delegation of Muslim leaders headed by the Aga Khan called on the new Viceroy of India, Lord Minto, to assure him of their loyalty and to ask for assurances that in any political reforms they would be protected from the [...] "unsympathetic [...] majority". [...] Dissatisfied with this, Jinnah wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper Gujarati, asking what right the members of the delegation had to speak for Indian Muslims, as they were unelected and self-appointed. [...] When many of the same leaders met in Dacca in December of that year to form the All-India Muslim League to advocate for their community's interests, Jinnah was again opposed. The Aga Khan later wrote that it was [...] "freakishly ironic" [...] that Jinnah, who would lead the League to independence, [...] "came out in bitter hostility <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> that I and my friends had done... He said that our principle of separate electorates was dividing the nation against itself." [...] In its earliest years, however, the League was not influential; Minto refused to consider it as the Muslim community's representative, and it was ineffective in preventing the 1911 repeal of the partition of Bengal, an action seen as a blow to Muslim interests.|$|E
500|$|Judaism arguably {{does not}} require uncompromising {{obedience}} to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout Jewish history rabbis have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment. Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see Zionism) many scholars (including Moses Mendelssohn) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the Talmudic tradition. The concept of inner light in the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers is associated with conscience. Freemasonry describes itself as providing an adjunct to religion and key symbols found in a Freemason Lodge are the square and compasses explained as providing lessons that Masons should [...] "square their actions by the square of conscience", learn to [...] "circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds <b>toward</b> <b>all</b> mankind." [...] The historian Manning Clark viewed conscience {{as one of the}} comforters that religion placed between man and death but also a crucial part of the quest for grace encouraged by the Book of Job and the Book of Ecclesiastes, leading us to be paradoxically closest to the truth when we suspect that what matters most in life ("being there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for") can never happen. Leo Tolstoy, after a decade studying the issue (1877–1887), held that the only power capable of resisting the evil associated with materialism and the drive for social power of religious institutions, was the capacity of humans to reach an individual spiritual truth through reason and conscience. Many prominent religious works about conscience also have a significant philosophical component: examples are the works of Al-Ghazali, Avicenna, Aquinas, Joseph Butler and Dietrich Bonhoeffer (all discussed in the philosophical views section).|$|E
