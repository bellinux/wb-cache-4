5|$|Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's sarcastic, foul-mouthed parrot assistant. Much like Robin Williams, Gottfried {{was given}} freedom <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> his lines. Iago's supervising {{animator}} Will Finn tried to incorporate {{some aspects of}} Gottfried's appearance into Iago's design, especially his semi-closed eyes and the always-appearing teeth.|$|E
5|$|The next day, on September 26, Larry Holden {{returned}} {{to shoot the}} sequence where Leonard attacks Jimmy. After filming was completed five days later, Pearce's voice-overs were recorded. For the black-and-white scenes, Pearce was given free rein <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> his narrative, allowing for a documentary feel.|$|E
5|$|Tom Noonan as Francis Dollarhyde. Noonan {{credits his}} ability <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> during rehearsals for his casting. He took up {{bodybuilding}} to prepare physically for the part. He began preparation {{for his role}} by studying other serial killers, but quickly rejected this approach. While shooting the film, Noonan remained in character at all times, keeping away from cast members playing his pursuers.|$|E
50|$|Silkheart Records is a Swedish {{record company}} and label {{dedicated}} <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> music and free jazz.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Lauren {{joined the}} main company of ComedySportz Los Angeles. In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>improvising,</b> she also currently directs the organization's Sunday Team.|$|R
50|$|On modern battlefields, {{introducing}} {{obstacles to}} slow an advance {{has risen to}} an art form: everything from anti-tank ditches to barbed wire to dragon's teeth <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> devices, have been employed, in addition to minefields.|$|R
5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and creative director Neil Druckmann {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The actors were given considerable license <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> the lines and influence character personality, simultaneously performing the motion capture work for their characters. Various characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision. The relationship of the characters received praise from several gaming publications, and the acting has resulted in multiple awards, including two BAFTAs and a DICE Award.|$|E
5|$|According to Gary Oldman, {{very little}} was written about Oswald in the script. Stone gave him several plane tickets, {{a list of}} contacts, {{and told him to}} do his own research. Oldman met with Oswald's wife, Marina, and her two daughters to prepare for the role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since the script {{contained}} few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> her scenes with Gary Oldman.|$|E
5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 {{years old or}} under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions. Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex syncopated rhythms, {{as well as social}} factors, such as the ability of the performers <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> and respond to their surroundings and to keep the audience excited and participating in the music.|$|E
25|$|U-2LNB: Soviet Air Force night attack version, {{built from}} 1942. Armed with one 7.62mm (0.30in) ShKAS, plus up to 250kg of bombs under the wings for land support. Earlier {{aircraft}} were converted <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> bombers from 1941.|$|R
5000|$|He is {{the author}} of several books {{including}} an instructional book titled [...] "You Will Never Be Funny: An Introduction <b>to</b> <b>Improvised</b> Comedy", a satirical self-help book [...] "GO GET HELP!", and a comedic novel [...] "A Test Case of Life".|$|R
5000|$|Lawson co-hosts a bass guitar forum with Michael Manring at talkbass.com and is {{a regular}} {{contributor}} to ScottsBassLessons.com and basschat.co.uk. He also teaches bass guitar in Birmingham. He is undertaking a Ph.D looking at how audiences relate <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> music ...|$|R
5|$|For example, {{the unusual}} {{placement}} of the cadenza before the recapitulation {{is reflected in the}} violin concertos of Tchaikovsky (where the cadenza is similarly placed) and Sibelius (where the cadenza serves to extend the development section). Moreover, following this concerto it was very rare for a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten for the soloist <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> as in the days of Mozart and Beethoven. The linking of the three movements also influenced other concertos, such as Liszt's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to entertainment and artistic merit, LARP events may be designed for educational or political purposes. For example, the Danish secondary school Østerskov Efterskole uses LARP to teach {{most of its}} classes. Language classes can be taught by immersing students in a role-playing scenario {{in which they are}} forced <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> speech or writing in the language they are learning. Politically themed LARP events may attempt to awaken or shape political thinking within a culture.|$|E
5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills {{in front of}} a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. He usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.|$|E
5000|$|U-2LNB: Soviet Air Force night attack version, {{built from}} 1942. Armed with one 7.62 mm (0.30 in) ShKAS, plus up to 250 kg of bombs under the wings for land support. Earlier {{aircraft}} were converted <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> bombers from 1941.|$|R
50|$|Because the Eland is {{regarded}} as a cheap alternative <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> technicals in areas where climate, terrain, and lack of support infrastructure or technical skill forestall the operation of large heavy armour forces, it has remained popular with sub-Saharan armies and insurgent groups.|$|R
50|$|By 2010, Ambiances Magnétiques had {{established}} {{itself as a}} contributor <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> music, with a philosophy of making music primarily identified as musique actuelle, a term that derives from the three genres with which it is associated: free improvisation, jazz, and avant-garde rock.|$|R
5|$|Progressive {{big band}} is {{a style of}} big band or swing music that was made for listening, with denser, more modernistic {{arrangements}} and more room <b>to</b> <b>improvise.</b> The online music guide AllMusic states that, along with Kenton, musicians like Gil Evans, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Cal Massey, Frank Foster, Carla Bley, George Gruntz, David Amram, Sun Ra, and Duke Ellington were major proponents of the style.|$|E
5|$|The {{performers}} {{were allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> provided that they maintained factual accuracy. Howick said that improvisation was actually often necessary {{due to the}} rapid-fire pace of filming, which left very little {{time to prepare for}} individual roles. On the other hand, both Rickard and Baynton suggest this enforced spontaneity may have ultimately worked to enhance the comedy, not least by preventing the jokes from becoming over-rehearsed.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow the}} Sa'iqa company to perform its landing, the Port Said Sector {{was to be}} {{supplied}} 24 assault dinghies. Only ten were received however, and on October 3, Second Army informed Khalid {{that there were no}} more dinghies available, and that he would have <b>to</b> <b>improvise.</b> Khalid resorted to renting two fishing boats. Consequently, the Sa'iqa company was tasked with simply isolating the fort; no attack from the east would be carried out.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "Lacy {{had not yet}} fully {{developed}} his more relaxed, scalar approach <b>to</b> <b>improvising,</b> but his playing is certainly quite distinctive and generally pretty lyrical during performances of five Lacy originals.".|$|R
50|$|The {{sessions}} for Duets {{were based on}} producer Eric Miller's idea for Pass and Pisano <b>to</b> spontaneously <b>improvise</b> <b>to</b> a video collage of National Geographic footage, cartoons, and movie clips.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} scales {{available}} <b>to</b> <b>improvising</b> musicians continues <b>to</b> expand. As modern techniques and musical constructions appear, jazz players find {{the ones they}} can put into compositions or use as material for melodic exploration. Prominent examples are the seven modes of the diatonic major scale and added-note scales.|$|R
5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and Amy Hennig {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The voice actors were given considerable license <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> the lines and influence character personality, and also performed the motion capture work for their characters. Many of the characters were meant to highlight different aspects of Drake's personality. Reception to {{the characters in the}} series have been fairly positive, with most commentators focusing on the believable nature of the characters and their interactions with each other. The inclusion of strong female characters has also received praise, though one commentator pointed out that the women still fall into cliché roles. The voice acting has also received acclaim, including two Interactive Achievement Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1894, Robey {{travelled}} to Manchester {{to participate in the}} pantomime Jack and Jill, where he was paid £25 a week for a three-month contract. He did not appear in Jack and Jill until the third act but pleased the holiday crowds nonetheless. During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly what he had eaten. The routine was such a hit that it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.|$|E
5|$|Davis led a septet at the concert; saxophonist Sonny Fortune, bassist Michael Henderson, and guitarist Pete Cosey {{were given}} space <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> against a dense {{backdrop}} of riffs, electronic effects, cross-beats, and funk grooves from the rhythm section—drummer Al Foster, guitarist Reggie Lucas, and percussionist James Mtume. Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures, phrases played on his wah-wah processed trumpet, and drones from an accompanying electronic organ. The evolving {{nature of the}} performance led to the widespread misunderstanding {{that it had no}} compositional basis, while its dark, angry, and somber musical qualities were seen as a reflection of the musician's emotional and spiritual state at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943 five Spitfire VIs (BS106, BS124, BS133, BS134 and BS149) were {{converted}} <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> PR Mk VIs by 680 Squadron in Egypt. These aircraft had been [...] "tropicalised" [...] {{using the same}} bulky Vokes filter and other equipment used by Spitfire VB Trops, {{as well as being}} painted in a [...] "desert" [...] camouflage scheme.|$|R
50|$|Fulcher {{was born}} in Massachusetts. He {{attended}} St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., and then studied as a lawyer (earning a degree in government from Dartmouth College) but after graduating pursued a career in comedy instead. He took <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> comedy at the ImprovOlympic in Chicago, where {{he was one of}} the early members of the Upright Citizens Brigade.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} did not progress {{much in the}} 1990s {{due to lack of}} funds, but following 2004 Israel-Gaza conflict, which {{exposed the}} vulnerability of the M113 armored personnel carrier <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> explosive devices and rocket-propelled grenades, the IDF re-opened the development. At that point the Stryker armored personnel carrier was offered and rejected by the IDF.|$|R
5|$|In his {{published}} score Monteverdi lists around 41 {{instruments to}} be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed {{at the point}} of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque, L'Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony. The work is not orchestrated as such; in the Renaissance tradition instrumentalists followed the composer's general instructions but were given considerable freedom <b>to</b> <b>improvise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{initially}} {{planned to}} retire in 1955 but came back for a final year in 1956, when the Browns posted a 5–7 record, the team's first-ever losing season. In his 11-year career, Lavelli caught 386 passes for 6,488 yards and 62 touchdowns. He was a confident receiver, former teammates said in later years. He could often be heard calling for Graham to throw him the ball while running routes. He was also known for his ability <b>to</b> <b>improvise</b> on the field. In a 1955 game against the Eagles in slippery conditions, he caught the winning touchdown {{with less than a}} minute left by swinging around the goalpost with his arm to get open.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn. I try <b>to</b> <b>improvise.</b> What comes out is what I feel.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{being used}} as troop {{carriers}} these vehicles also doubled as 'gun-trucks' or 'technicals', being fitted with heavy machine-guns, recoilless rifles and AA autocannons. Moreover, their lack of protection rendered them highly vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>improvised</b> explosive devices (IEDs) or small-arms fire, and many were lost together with their crews in 1979 due to intense street fighting and ambushes in rural areas.|$|R
