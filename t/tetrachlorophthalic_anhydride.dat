40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out of a {{population}} of workers exposed to <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> an acid anhydride epoxy resin curing agent known to cause asthma. Using a radioallergosorbent test with a <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> human serum albumin conjugate, specific IgE antibody was detected in serum from 24 out of 300 factory floor workers exposed to <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> Of these 24, 20 (83. 3 %) were current smokers compared with 133 (48. 2 %) of 276 without antibody (p less than 0. 01), {{and there was a}} weaker association with atopy, defined by skin tests with common allergens. Smoking and atopy interacted, the prevalence of antibody being 16. 1 % in atopic smokers, 11. 7 % in non-atopic smokers, 8. 3 % in atopic non-smokers, and nil in non-atopic non-smokers (p less than 0. 025). Smoking may predispose to, and interact with atopy in, the production of specific IgE antibody to this hapten protein conjugate...|$|E

40|$|Four {{patients}} with asthma caused by occupational exposure to <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TCPA) had dust-challenge tests that used eight {{different levels of}} TCPA exposure. Measurements of TCPA in the test-cubicle air ranged from 1. 3 to 961. 1 micrograms/m 3. The higher exposures provoked definite late or dual asthmatic responses. Smaller, but statistically significant, responses were observed at low exposures. The late asthmatic-response area had a linear relation to the logarithm of TCPA exposure, but the immediate asthmatic response was less closely related to exposure...|$|E
40|$|Metallophthalocyanine {{complexes}} {{are obtained}} {{quickly and efficiently}} by the reaction of phthalodinitrile with hydrated metallic salts without solvent and under microwave irradiation. The use of a modified commercial microwave oven to perform this type of reactions under dry conditions is described. Metallophthalocyanines and metallododecachlorophthalocyanines of some divalent metals can be also obtained from phthalic or <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydrides</b> with hydrated metallic salt and urea under microwave irradiation and without solvent...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} seven {{women with}} asthma induced by occupational exposure to an acid anhydride, <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TCPA), an epoxy resin hardening agent. Inhalation tests with TCPA at atmospheric concentrations {{of less than}} one tenth of a manufacturer's recommended exposure limit provoked asthmatic reactions in the four women tested. None had evidence of pretest bronchial hyperreactivity. Immediate skin prick test reactions were elicited in the seven subjects by a conjugate of TCPA with human serum albumin (TCPA-HSA) but not in others tested. Specific IgE antibody levels to TCPA-HSA, measured by radioallergosorbent test scores, were significantly elevated in the seven, but not in TCPA-exposed and unexposed comparison groups. These results imply that occupational asthma caused by TCPA is an allergic reaction mediated by specific IgE antibody. © 1983...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{patients}} with occupational asthma {{caused by a}} chemical, <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TCPA), left their work in 1980. They have subsequently avoided TCPA exposure and have been followed until 1985. One patient died in 1981. The six living patients reported continuing symptoms suggestive of asthma, and five who were studied in 1985 demonstrated mild bronchial hyperresponsiveness (histamine concentration provoking a 20 % fall in FEV 1 range 2. 7 to 12. 5 mg/ml). Specific IgE antibody to TCPA conjugated with human serum albumin was measured by a radioallergosorbent test and detected in all patients. After avoidance of exposure, specific IgE fell exponentially with a half-life of 1 year. Specific IgE was still detectable in 1985, and throughout the follow-up period, prick tests with the conjugate elicited immediate skin responses. In 1981 four patients had inhalation tests with TCPA, and specific IgE rose afterward and then fell again...|$|E
40|$|Hexachlorobenzene is {{classified}} as a carcinogen by authoritative sources. 1 - 4 HCB causes liver tumors in laboratory animals. HCB is listed as developmental toxicant {{by the state of}} California primarily based on altered neurobehavioral development in offspring of dosed rodents. 5, 6 HCB has been shown to induce structrual and functional changes in primate ovaries 6 and is listed as a Category 1 endocrine disruptor by the European Union. 4 Exposure Hexachlorobenzene is listed as a Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) chemical under Washington State’s PBT rule (WAC 173 - 333 - 320). 7 No current U. S. commercial uses of hexachlorobenzene were identified but HCB is formed as a by-product or impurity in the manufacture of other chlorinated chemicals. 2 The FDA, Cosmetics Office detected HCB in U. S. -certified color additives. Their analysis suggested that the contamination with HCB may be decreased by avoiding use of starting material (<b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride)</b> heavily contaminated with HCB. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} asthma caused by inhaled acid {{anhydrides}} {{as a model}} of hapten-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Inhalation tests with the relevant anhydride in sensitised individuals reproducibly provoked a significant increase in non-specific airway responsiveness identifiable 3 h after the test and prior {{to the development of the}} late asthmatic reaction. Seven cases of asthma caused by <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TCPA) had specific IgE in their serum to a TCPA-human serum albumin conjugate. RAST inhibition studies showed the anhydride to be involved in the antibody-combining site. Survey of the factory population where these 7 cases worked allowed investigation of the determinants of the specific IgE response: its presence was associated with intensity of exposure and current cigarette smoking; in addition smoking interacted with atopy to increase the prevalence of specific IgE. During a 5 -year period of avoidance of exposure to TCPA specific IgE declined exponentially with a half-life of one year, suggesting continuing IgE secretion. Five years after avoidance of exposure, airway hyperresponsiveness remained increased in several cases...|$|E
40|$|The Michaelis-Menten {{kinetics}} {{were observed}} between cationic substrate: (3 -acetoxy-N-trimethylanilinium) iodide (ANTI) and PAHI (polyacryloylhistidine), P [VIm(vinylimidazole) -AA(acrylicacid) ] and P [AHA(acryloylhistamine) -MAβA (methacryloyl-B-alanine) ]. For the solvolysis of neutral 2, 4 -dinitrophenylacetate (DNPA) catalyzed by PVIm, PAHA, PAHI and P[AHA-AAm(acrylamide) ], {{the relationships between}} k_ (the second-order catalytic rate constant) and α_ 0 (the neutral fraction of pendant imidazolyl group) were as same as those of P[VIm-AAm] and P[VIm-AA], indicating the similar profiles to the sequence distribution of [VIm-VIm] dyad against the VIm content in both copolymers. However, for the solvolysis of cationic [1 -(p-N-trimethylammonobenzoyl) benztriazole] iodide (TBTI) catalyzed by P[AHA-MAβA], the k_-α_ 0 proflle indicated a rapid increase in k_ at α_ 0 = 0, 5 - 0. 9, conversely it decreased straightly till negative value at α_ 0 > 0. 9 (pH> 8. 5) on the other hand, a copolymer compossed of VIm and vinylcarbazole (a strong electron donr) exhibited a large catalytic activity on the methanolysis of <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (an electron acceptor) ...|$|E
40|$|Tetrafunctional cardo {{epoxy resin}} (EBCF) was cured by using 10 wt% maleic {{anhydride}} (MA), pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), phthalic anhydride (PA), tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (THPA), tetrabromophthalic anhydride (TBPA), and <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TCPA) as hardeners at 120 °C for 40 – 105 min (gel time) and then postcured 1 h at 130 °C. Gel time {{is found to}} depend on the structure of the anhydrides used. Cured samples were found insoluble in common solvents. Cured and uncured EBCF were characterized by FTIR, DSC, and TGA techniques. Cured and uncured resins followed multistep degradation reactions. Kinetic parameters, namely, order of degradation, energy of activation, frequency factor, and entropy change, were determined according to the Anderson-Freeman method and interpreted in light of the nature of hardeners used for curing purpose. The resins followed integral or fractional order degradation kinetics. Complex degradation reactions are due to different types of linkages in cured resins. Both nature and structure of resin and hardeners affected the curing behavior and the resultant thermal properties of the cured resins...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{choice of}} {{inhibiting}} materials for double base and composite modified double base rocket propellants {{has always been}} a difficult problem {{because of the presence of}} nitroglycerine in these propellants and its subsequent migration from the propellant towards the inhibitor. The inhibition of double base rocket propellants with unsaturated polyesters has become popular in recent years, but they usually suffer from the drawback of high nitroglycerine absorption. This may be considerably lowered by exploiting the concept of introduction of electron acceptance sites in one of the components used for the synthesis of unsaturated polyesters. Chloropolyester- 1 (CP- 1) based on <b>tetrachlorophthalic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TCPAn), propylene glycol (PG) and maleic anhydride (MAn) and chloropolyester- 2 (CP- 2) based on TCPAn [...] Eolyethylene glycol mol. wt. 200 (PEG- 200) and MAn have been synthesised and characterised for ge ltime, exotherm peak temperature, tensile strength, y 0 elongation, bond strength, water absorption, nitroglycerine absorption, heat resistance and flame retardance. The blends of CP-I and CP- 2 designated as CPB- 2 (CP- 1 : CP- 2 : : 20 : 80), CPB- 4 CPB- 6 and CPB- 8 have also been formulated and characterised for these properties. Based on the data for various characteristics, CPB- 4 has been selected for inhibition and static evaluation of rocket propellants. The double base rocket propellant sustainers containing 2 -NDPA have been inhibited with CPB- 4 without the application of any barrier coat and statically fired at ambient, cold (- 40 °C) and hot (+ 5 O”C) temperatures after conditioning. The pressure-time profiles were found to be smooth and flat in all cases, inferring that the CPB- 4 inhibition system (without application of any barrier coat) is working satisfactorily. 1...|$|E
