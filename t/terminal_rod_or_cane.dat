40|$|All-solid microstructured {{optical fibers}} (MOF) allow the {{realization}} of very flexible optical waveguide designs. They are prepared by stacking of doped silica <b>rods</b> <b>or</b> <b>canes</b> in complex arrangements. Typical dopants in silica matrices are germanium and phosphorus to increase the refractive index (RI), or boron and fluorine to decrease the RI. However, the direct interface contact of stacking elements often causes interrelated chemical reactions or evaporation during thermal processing. The obtained fiber structures after the final drawing step thus tend to deviate from the targeted structure risking degrading their favored optical functionality. Dopant profiles and design parameters (e. g., the RI homogeneity of the cladding) are controlled by the combination of diffusion and equilibrium conditions of evaporation reactions. We show simulation results of diffusion and thermal dissociation in germanium and fluorine doped silica rod arrangements according to the monitored geometrical disturbances in stretched <b>canes</b> <b>or</b> drawn fibers. The paper indicates geometrical limits of dopant structures in sub-µm-level depending on the dopant concentration and the thermal conditions during the drawing process. The presented results thus enable an optimized planning of the preform parameters avoiding unwanted alterations in dopant concentration profiles or in design parameters encountered during the drawing process...|$|R
2500|$|The {{parts of}} a {{lightning}} protection system are air <b>terminals</b> (lightning <b>rods</b> <b>or</b> strike termination devices), bonding conductors, [...] ground terminals (ground or [...] "earthing" [...] <b>rods,</b> plates, <b>or</b> mesh), {{and all of the}} connectors and supports to complete the system. The air terminals are typically arranged at or along the upper points of a roof structure, and are electrically bonded together by bonding conductors (called [...] "down conductors" [...] or [...] "downleads"), which are connected by the most direct route to one or more grounding or earthing terminals. Connections to the earth electrodes must not only have low resistance, but must have low self-inductance.|$|R

Nevertheless, bamboo fly rods made from skilled makers continue to be 'state-of-the-art' in performance and are cherished and revered by their owners.|$|R

50|$|A {{fishing rod}} is an {{additional}} tool used with the hook, line and sinker. A length of fishing line {{is attached to a}} long, flexible <b>rod</b> <b>or</b> pole: one end terminates with the hook for catching the fish. Early fishing rods are depicted on inscriptions in ancient Egypt, China, Greece and Rome. In Medieval England they were called angles (hence the term angling). As they evolved they were made from materials such as split Tonkin bamboo, Calcutta reed, or ash wood, which were light, tough, and pliable. The butts were frequently made of maple. Handles and grips were made of cork, wood, <b>or</b> wrapped <b>cane.</b> Guides were simple wire loops.|$|R
