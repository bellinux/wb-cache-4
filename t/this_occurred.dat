5|$|At some point, {{possibly}} {{around this}} time, Montagu was killed; {{he was certainly}} dead before his brother. The Arrivall chronicler states <b>this</b> <b>occurred</b> 'in plain battle,' and {{in the thick of}} the fighting, rather than in the rout that later followed.|$|E
5|$|The most goals {{scored in}} a game at Goodison Park is 12, <b>this</b> <b>occurred</b> in two Everton games; versus Sheffield Wednesday (9–3) on 17 October 1931 and versus Plymouth Argyle (8–4) on 27 February 1954.|$|E
5|$|Another embassy from Daqin is {{recorded}} as bringing tributary {{gifts to the}} Chinese Jin Empire (265–420 AD). <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> in 284 AD {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wu of Jin (r. 266–290 AD), and was recorded in the Book of Jin, as well as the later Wenxian Tongkao. This embassy was presumably sent by the Emperor Carus (r. 282–283 AD), whose brief reign was preoccupied by war with Sasanian Persia.|$|E

5|$|Drogba {{started the}} 2005–06 season by scoring two {{goals in a}} Community Shield win over Arsenal. His {{reputation}} was marred amidst accusations of cheating during Chelsea's 2–0 win over Manchester City. Replays showed that he had used his hand to control the ball before scoring the second of his two goals. <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> just a week after a similar incident against Fulham where the goal was disallowed.|$|E
5|$|During the Iron Age, a Celtic {{language}} and culture emerged in Ireland. How and when the island of Ireland became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts {{being one of the}} more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. Today, {{there is more than one}} school of thought on how <b>this</b> <b>occurred</b> in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|If none of {{the contestants}} in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a {{positive}} score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead. <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.|$|E
50|$|Another tensile {{fracture}} {{mechanism is}} hydraulic fracturing. In a natural environment, <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> when {{a combination of}} rapid sediment compaction and thermal fluid expansion causes the pore fluid pressure to exceed {{the pressure of the}} least principal normal stress. When <b>this</b> <b>occurs,</b> a tensile fracture opens perpendicular to the plane of least stress.|$|R

50|$|Often {{molecules}} contain dipolar groups, {{but have}} no overall dipole moment. <b>This</b> <b>occurs</b> if there is symmetry within the molecule that causes the dipoles to cancel each other out. <b>This</b> <b>occurs</b> in molecules such as tetrachloromethane and carbon dioxide. The dipole-dipole interaction between two individual atoms is usually zero, since atoms rarely carry a permanent dipole.|$|R
5|$|On 5 October, three regencies {{were carved}} out of the {{province}} of South Sulawesi to form West Sulawesi as the 33rd province of Indonesia. Because <b>this</b> <b>occurred</b> after the elections, West Sulawesi was not represented in the Regional Representative Council until the 2009 legislative election.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1928 President Coolidge {{signed the}} bill authorizing the dam. The Boulder Canyon Project Act {{appropriated}} $165million for the Hoover Dam {{along with the}} downstream Imperial Dam and All-American Canal, a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border. It also permitted the compact {{to go into effect}} when at least six of the seven states approved it. <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> on March 6, 1929 with Utah's ratification; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 2012, Harper {{received}} the World Statesman of the Year award. This award was offered through a US group of various faith representatives. <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> at a black tie banquet in New York. Jean Chrétien {{was one of}} the previous recipients from Canada.|$|E

5|$|Polyaenus recounts that Philip {{attacked}} and sacked {{the cities of}} Abdera and Maroneia {{along the coast of}} Thrace. <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> during a single campaign, but does not say when. Diodorus does not mention this campaign, making its position within the overall chronology difficult to place.|$|E
5|$|Rat urine also {{contains}} homologous urinary proteins; {{although they were}} originally given a different name, α2u-globulins, they have since become known as rat Mups. Rats have 9 distinct Mup genes and a further 13 pseudogenes clustered together across 1.1 megabases of DNA on chromosome 5. Like in mice, the cluster formed by multiple duplications. However, <b>this</b> <b>occurred</b> independently of the duplications in mice, meaning that both rodent species expanded their Mup gene families separately, but in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the March 1605 {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the only ones that were seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. That conclave saw Spain veto Cesare Baronius after the first ballot. Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but <b>this</b> <b>occurred</b> after the election of Leo XI, and the cardinals did not view the veto as valid.|$|E

50|$|As {{available}} extreme hot air {{near the}} surface is channeled up the dust devil, eventually surrounding cooler air will be sucked in. Once <b>this</b> <b>occurs,</b> the effect is dramatic, and the dust devil dissipates in seconds. Usually <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> when the dust devil is not moving fast enough (depletion) or begins to enter a terrain where the surface temperatures are cooler, causing unbalance.|$|R
5|$|The Pirates {{have failed}} once in signing a draft pick. <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> in 2012, when the Pirates {{selected}} RHP Mark Appel from Stanford University, who sought a significant bonus which, {{according to new}} MLB rules, would have cost the Pirates a future draft pick. The Pirates will receive the 9th overall pick in the 2013 draft for their failure to sign Appel.|$|E
5|$|The current {{home of the}} National Museum {{was built}} on the former site of the Royal Canberra Hospital in 2001. <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> after the public were {{encouraged}} to watch the controlled demolition of the hospital in 1997, but a girl was killed by flying debris, leading to criticism of the ACT Government.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{spent most}} of its early career in the South African Navy {{training}} or making good-will visits to foreign countries. She was laid up in the late 1950s and was recommissioned in 1961 {{to serve as an}} interim training ship until the shore-based training establishment then under construction was completed. <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> in 1963 and Bloemfontein returned to briefly returned to reserve before she was deemed surplus to requirements. The ship was sunk as a target in 1967.|$|E

5|$|The tributaries Sugar Notch Run and Spring Run lose most {{of their}} {{discharge}} (75% {{in the case of}} Spring Run) when passing over subterranean mine pools. The discharge of the creek is 3.39 cubic feet per second. Between 1938 and 1989, the highest recorded discharge of the creek was 2450 cubic feet per second. <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> on August 18, 1955. The discharge was not higher than 1610 cubic feet per second on any other year during that time period.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pressure}} area {{developed into}} a weak tropical depression on September24 off the north coast of Honduras in the western Caribbean Sea. It was initially disorganized, without a well-developed circulation. On September25, while still a tropical depression, the system was named Debbie. Without intensifying further, the depression crossed the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula on September26. The next day, the depression turned toward the north in the central Gulf of Mexico before beginning a northeast motion. On September28, Debbie intensified into a tropical storm, attaining peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). <b>This</b> <b>occurred</b> after the storm developed two distinct spiral rainbands.|$|E
5|$|After Michael VIII's death, the Byzantines {{suffered}} from constant civil strife early on. The Ottomans suffered civil conflict as well, but <b>this</b> <b>occurred</b> much {{later on in}} the 15th century, by that time the Byzantines were too weak to reconquer much territory. This is in contrast to the civil strife of Byzantium, occurring at a time (1341–71) when the Ottomans were crossing into Europe through a devastated Gallipoli and surrounding the city, thus sealing its fate as a vassal. When attempts were made to break this vassalage, the Byzantines found themselves out-matched and at the mercy of Latin assistance, which despite two Crusades, ultimately amounted to nothing.|$|E
