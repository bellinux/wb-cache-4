2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the UK {{government}} indicated that warheads [...] "required {{to provide a}} necessary processing margin and for <b>technical</b> <b>surveillance</b> purposes" [...] {{were not included in}} the [...] "fewer than 200" [...] figure. As recently declassified archived documents on Chevaline make clear, the 15% excess (referred to by SIPRI as for spares) is normally intended to provide the 'necessary processing margin', and 'surveillance rounds do not contain any nuclear material, being completely inert. These surveillance rounds are used to monitor deterioration in the many non-nuclear components of the warhead, and are best compared with inert training rounds.' The SIPRI figures correspond accurately with the official announcements and are likely to be the most accurate. The Natural Resources Defense Council speculates that a figure of 200 is accurate to within a few tens. In 2008 the National Audit Office stated that the UK stockpile was of fewer than 160 operationally available nuclear warheads.|$|E

The NRC levied an additional $55,000 in fines in October 1997 when the plant failed <b>technical</b> specifications <b>surveillance</b> guidelines. Specifically, they violated rules that require the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) pump casing and discharge piping high points be vented once every 31 days.
