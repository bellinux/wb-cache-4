40|$|The {{rates of}} {{cholesterol}} biosynthesis in isolated rat hepatocytes {{were determined by}} using a method based on measurement of the rate of formation of desmosterol (cholesta- 5, 24 -dien- 3 β-ol), which accumulates during inhibition of cholesterogenesis by the drug triparanol. Incubation of cells from normal or 24 h-starved animals in a medium containing albumin, glucose, amino acids and acetate as the only organic constituents led to an accelerating rate of sterol formation during the earlier stages of a 6 h incubation period. The contribution of exogenously added acetate (initial concentration 3. 34 mm) to sterol synthesis in both types of cells reached an early maximum and then continually declined. Exogenously added pyruvate and lactate were more efficient sources of sterol carbon than was acetate. Exogenous glucose even at relatively high concentrations (11. 1 mm) was incapable of providing more than 6 % of the <b>total</b> <b>sterol</b> carbon. Although the proportion of <b>total</b> <b>sterol</b> carbon supplied from exogenous acetate increased with increasing concentrations of the extracellular substrate, the rates of <b>total</b> <b>sterol</b> synthesis in both types of cell remained unchanged. Similar observations were made when lactate or pyruvate was the cholesterogenic precursor in normal cells.

Transgenic plants displayed an increased <b>total</b> <b>sterol</b> level in both leaves and tubers, mainly due to increased levels of the 24 -ethyl sterols isofucosterol and sitosterol. The higher <b>total</b> <b>sterol</b> level was due to increases in both free and esterified sterols. However, the level of free cholesterol, a nonalkylated sterol, was decreased. Associated with this was a decreased glycoalkaloid level in leaves and tubers, down to 41 % and 63 % of wild-type levels, respectively. The results show that glycoalkaloid biosynthesis can be down-regulated in transgenic potato plants by reducing the content of free nonalkylated sterols, and they support the view of cholesterol as a precursor in glycoalkaloid biosynthesis...|$|R

There was considerable {{variation in the}} sterol contents among the 13 isolates, with <b>total</b> <b>sterol</b> contents ranging from 0. 31 to 5. 9 % of dry weight. The isolates from the five patients who had relapses had different <b>total</b> <b>sterol</b> contents and compositions in comparison {{with those of the}} pretreatment isolates, indicating either that the sterols had been changed by therapy or that the patients were infected with new isolates with different sterol compositions. Growth of the cryptococcal isolates in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of fluconazole (0. 25 x the MIC) significantly altered the sterol content and pattern. The <b>total</b> <b>sterol</b> content decreased in nine isolates and increased in four isolates in response to pretreatment with fluconazole. Fluconazole had no consistent effect on ergosterol levels. In contrast, fluconazole caused a decrease in obtusifoliol levels and an increase in 4, 14 -dimethylzymosterol levels in all isolates. These results indicate extensive diversity in sterol content, sterol composition, and sterol synthesis in response to subinhibitory concentrations of fluconazole in C. neoformans strains. We propose that fluconazole inhibits the sterol synthesis of C. neoformans by interfering with both 14 alpha-demethylase-dependent and -independent pathways.

The erg 3 mutants (CA 12, CA 488, CA 490, and CA 1008) were all resistant to fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and clotrimazole under standard CLSI assay conditions (MIC values, ≥ 256, 16, 16, 8, and 1 μg ml− 1, respectively). Importantly, CA 12 and CA 1008 retained an azole-resistant phenotype even when assayed {{in the presence}} of FK 506, a multidrug efflux inhibitor.

Not all patients with sitosterolemia have tendon xanthomas, thus absence of this should not be used to exclude this diagnosis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The sterol {{composition}} of two green algae and two brown algae from the South Adriatic was determined. In the green alga Ulva lactuca, the principal sterols were cholesterol and isofucosterol. In the brown alga Cystoseira adriatica, the main sterols were cholesterol and stigmast- 5 -en- 3 ß-ol, while the characteristic sterol {{of the brown}} algae, fucosterol, was found only in low concentration. The sterol fractions of the green alga Codium dichotomum and the brown alga Fucus virsoides contained practically only one sterol each, comprising more than 90 % of the <b>total</b> <b>sterols</b> (clerosterol in the former and fucosterol in the latter) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{supercritical}} extraction of stalks and leaves of Eichhornia crassipes {{was carried out}} using pure and modified carbon dioxide. Preliminary results evidenced that the influence of temperature is weaker than pressure and ethanol content, and thus a design of experiments was performed in the ranges of 200 - 300 bar and 0. 0 - 5. 0 wt. % ethanol. The optima conditions for total extraction yield (eta(Total)) were 250 - 300 bar and 5. 0 wt. % of cosolvent, while for sterols yield (eta(TotalSterol)) they were 300 bar and 2. 5 wt. %. The latter conditions were also the most favorable to maximize the concentration of <b>total</b> <b>sterols</b> in the extracts (C-TotalSterol), particularly stigmasterol (C-stigm), the most abundant one. For the referred optima, eta(Total) = 1. 25 wt. %, eta(TotalSterol) = 0. 35 wt. %, C-TotalSterol = 38. 26 wt. %, and C-stigm = 26. 35 wt. %. This study showed also that the individual trends of stigmasterol and cholesterol were closer to the <b>total</b> <b>sterols</b> fraction behavior than beta-sitosterol did, and also that the sterols concentration {{were higher in the}} first 2 h of extraction. In the whole, this article provides a pertinent contribution for the valorization of E. crassipes biomass through the production of natural extracts with high contents of sterols, especially stigmasterol, mainly if one takes into account it is classified as the most problematic invasive plant worldwide.

40|$|The {{composition}} of blackberry, raspberry, blueberry, redcurrant, and {{blackcurrant seed oil}} from the region of Asturias (Spain) was studied. The oil content of blueberry was 13. 27 ± 0. 11 g/ 100 g seed, blackberry 15. 68 ± 0. 59 g/ 100 g seed, raspberry 10. 55 ± 0. 82 g/ 100 g seed, redcurrant 9. 11 ± 0. 59 g/ 100 g seed, and blackcurrant 26. 15 ± 0. 76 g/ 100 g seed. Polyunsaturated fatty acid contents was also studied, the most notable findings being 67. 96 ± 1. 96 g/ 100 g oil of linoleic acid in blackberry, 14. 91 ± 0. 11 g/ 100 g oil of γ-linolenic acid in blackcurrant, and 4. 48 ± 0. 6 g/ 100 g oil stearidonic acid in redcurrant g/ 100 g oil. Sterol content was also studied, the most notable findings being 87. 58 ± 1. 11 g/ 100 g <b>total</b> <b>sterols</b> and 10. 01 ± 0. 08 g/ 100 g <b>total</b> <b>sterols</b> in ß-sitosterol and campesterol, respectively, in redcurrant. The most notable finding as regards tocopherols content was 109. 17 ± 4. 96 mg/ 100 g oil in raspberry, of which γ-tocopherol constitutes 58. 19 ± 0. 61 mg/ 100 g oil. As to tocotrienol, blackcurrant stood out with a content of 6. 43 ± 0. 36 mg/ 100 g oil. These seeds have a high nutritionalvalue added. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
