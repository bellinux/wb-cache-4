Internationally, the film was released in Hong Kong and Macau on 20 October and in Singapore and Malaysia on 10 November 2011.|$|E
5|$|In the Period II, the finds {{excavated}} revealed <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> {{moved out}} from pit dwelling to structures {{built at the}} ground level. However, the pits and its associated chambers formed the base floor of the superstructure, which was made up by filling the pits and covering it with mud plaster, and occasionally painted in red ochre. Post-holes around the pits revealed that the superstructures were made of wood built over compacted Karewa soil floors.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} shield logo the full club name and sky-blue star beneath the shield were not featured, they were later added when club chairman Eric Persson discovered while abroad <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> trouble identifying what city the club came from {{just by looking}} at the club crest.

5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{morning after}} the arrests the {{soldiers}} continued marching north, proceeding 10 miles (16 kilometers) further to the headwaters of Fishing Creek and {{the base of the}} mountains in northern Columbia County. From here they marched up the valley of East Branch Fishing Creek to its headwaters. The soldiers extensively searched the mountains of northern Columbia County for half a day, going as far north as the headwaters of East Branch Fishing Creek in southern Sullivan County, where they {{climbed to the top of}} North Mountain in three groups. At the headwaters of East Branch Fishing Creek the soldiers turned south again, then headed up West Branch Fishing Creek as far as the Sullivan County line. They found some evidence <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been in the area, but these appeared to have been hunting or logging camps.|$|E

25|$|Gro Steinsland, a {{historian}} of Norse paganism, {{is of the}} opinion that in effect it was economic resources as much as local tradition that {{led to the development of}} dedicated hofs: in the richest areas, actual temples developed, while in poor areas, the spaces <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> were what they used for blót.|$|E
25|$|Historian William McNeill {{asserts that}} the Antonine Plague and the later Plague of Cyprian (251–ca. 270) were {{outbreaks}} of two different diseases, one of smallpox and one of measles, not necessarily in that order. The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox. The latter view seems {{more likely to be}} correct given that molecular estimates place the evolution of measles sometime after 500 AD.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{occasions}} were the bullying was not intentional, but still occurred. It {{should be noted}} that even if the bullying was not consciously intended it can still have awful impacts. One study concluded <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been ostracised online as a way of protecting another group of people. One woman had been listed as a political opponent on a pro-trans website due to misunderstandings and alternating views, which resulted in targeted messages and harassment. The listed person in question did not actually have any reservations against the trans community, and so they ended up being the bullied person. While the motivations {{of the authors of the}} website are unknown, it can be assumed that they did not specifically aim to target the person effected and thus the bullying was an inconsiderate result.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, a Cholera {{outbreak}} {{was confirmed}} in Haiti—the first in Haitian modern history. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of August 4, 2013, over 800,000 cases and 9,600 deaths {{have been reported}} since the outbreak first began in October 2010. MINUSTAH was linked with introducing the disease to the country by sources such as the CDC, the American Society for Microbiology, Yale Law School and the School of Public Health. The cause of the disease was attributed to faulty construction of UN sanitation systems in its base located in the Haitian town of Méyè. Many reports from Méyè stated <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> seen sewage spilling from the UN base into the Artibonite River, the largest river in Haiti, and which is used by residents for drinking, cooking, and bathing.|$|E

Addressing the forum at its concluding session, he praised the WSF for demanding freedom in its most comprehensive form, and was happy <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> assembled under an important idea, rather than for narrow political ends; after reflecting on corporations displacing governments in various countries, and on how Mahatma Gandhi had fought British colonisers non-violently with {{the strength of the}} masses, he predicted that vocal masses the world over would successfully fight by non-violent means the capturing of the world's resources by a few corporations in the name of globalisation. He urged the people to struggle against power corporates and militarism and fight those aspects of globalisation which were against the interests of the people; he hailed people's power as a renascent factor of international politics.|$|E

25|$|The most {{dramatic}} and successful policy event was the currency reform of 1948. Since the 1930s, prices and wages had been controlled, but money had been plentiful. That meant <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages {{did not reflect}} reality, as the black market dominated the economy {{and more than half}} of all transactions were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new Deutsche Mark at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in Marshall Plan money coming in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.|$|E
