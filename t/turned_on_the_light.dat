500|$|Some of MacMillan's most sensational {{allegations}} {{concerned a}} six-week {{period in the}} spring of 1932 when she was filling in at the Brownlee household for an absent maid. [...] She said that she slept in the maid's room, one of three bedrooms {{on the second floor of}} Brownlee's house; a second room was occupied by Brownlee and his son Jack, and the third by Florence Brownlee and her son Alan. [...] During this six-week period, she claimed, she and Brownlee had had sex every night; Brownlee would signal her to leave her room by turning on the tap in the second floor bathroom, and then flush the toilet and walk in lockstep with her to mask the sound of her movement. [...] Once in the premier's room, they would have sex next to his sleeping son, taking care to be quiet. [...] She recounted how on one occasion Jack had seemed to stir, and Brownlee had <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> in the middle of intercourse to make sure that his son was all right.|$|E

2500|$|The {{review of}} the mini-series by Variety {{questioned}} the objectivity of the team, particularly in taking [...] "hazy" [...] assertions and declaring them as fact. For example, during the show it is stated that John Ramsey called {{out that he had}} found JonBenet before he <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> to the dark basement room where the body lay, but the source or veracity of the statement was not clear. Rolling Stone magazine found that there were three ways in which the investigation was flawed: 1)"Confirmation bias, selective hearing and the misleading 911 call analysis", 2)"Dismissing the DNA evidence entirely" [...] and 3)"Overselling linguistic forensics and behavioral analysis as conclusive". They found that since the investigation did not unearth any new evidence, the conclusions were not new but subjective, and based upon the initial [...] "flawed" [...] police investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{investigators}} and psychics such as Annette Martin and Jeanne Borgen and paranormal teams {{have sought to}} [...] "contact spirits" [...] at Alcatraz. KGO Radio Morning News anchor Ted Wygant, a skeptic of the paranormal, visited Alcatraz in 1982 with psychic Jeanne Borgen and spent the night there. Wygant said {{for most of the}} duration of the visit they found nothing, but around 3 am in the utility corridor, the place where three of the men of the 1946 Battle of Alcatraz were shot dead, he said that although it was pitch black, he suddenly got a [...] "tremendous feeling of anger" [...] and felt an evil presence lying on the floor at the place where the men had died. He started cursing and said that he felt a strong compulsion to fire a gun at people. Borgen said that it left Wygant quite out of character, and said that when they <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> [...] "his face was changed, you could see the anger and hate in his eyes". Wygant has said though that it is quite difficult for him to believe there was something really there, but he is certain that he felt that something had happened. In 1984, paranormal investigator and writer Michael Kouri claimed that he visited the prison and in a trance was spoken to by the spirit of a dead prisoner who told him that he had been beaten and had his legs broken and was placed in solitary confinement. According to the Los Angeles Times, one woman, who claimed to be psychic, began speaking German in a child's voice {{on a tour of the}} prison hospital, and said that Alcatraz was frequented by spirits.|$|E
