40|$|An often-contested {{subject in}} the EU is the {{question}} of whether Article 49 TFEU can, or should, facilitate corporate mobility - permitting companies based in one Member State to transfer themselves entirely to another. This essay seeks to revisit this debate in light of recent judicial and legislative developments. It will be contended that the EU Institutions have now introduced corporate mobility in varying forms and as a result the debate has been rendered redundant. The question is no longer if corporate mobility will be introduced, but instead when and how. To this end it is submitted that an over-reliance on judicial harmonisation is hindering developments in this area. The ECJ cannot create a positive right to corporate mobility due to its confined institutional remit. It therefore falls to the EU Legislature to enact this right along with any safeguards needed to protect those with rights against a <b>transferring</b> <b>company...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{legislative}} problem of thin and thick capitalization of subsidiary companies situated abroad. This kind of companies are often used for tax planning purposes, as means for <b>transferring</b> <b>company</b> profit from a high tax state to a low tax state. Today, the legislative flora around the world mainly focuses on the question"how low/high can the capitalization level of the company be, before thin/thick capitalization can {{be considered to be}} at hand?". Instead, this thesis raises the question"how far from the optimal capitalization rate is a probable capitalization level for a company, and can this be an alternative approach to legislation?". The object of the thesis is to point out possibilities, as well as obstacles, to this approach, but also to show a possible design of a regulation based on the approach. It is discussed whether the uncertainty in determining the optimal capitalization rate overthrows the theory behind the approach, or in fact strengthens it. Several advantages, but also a number of drawbacks, are shown. Hence, the conclusion of the study is neither in favor of, nor against, a regulation founded on the optimal capitalization rate, but rather an invitation to further discussion and calculations...|$|E
40|$|Professional service {{firms are}} gaining more {{attention}} in the academic field today due to the improved importance of the sector in the developed world. When professional service firms internationalize, expatriation is a common tool for <b>transferring</b> <b>company</b> specific tacit and explicit knowledge, unique for the firm. Previous scholars have however not, to our knowledge, taken the transfer of knowledge back to the home office into consideration; this thesis aims at describing the flow of knowledge in both directions, managed by the expatriates. To investigate the management of knowledge in internationalizing PSFs, one management consultant firm is studied and three qualitative, in-depth interviews are held with personnel from both the home office {{as well as the}} subsidiary, situated in China. Thereafter, this is analyzed with theories regarding transnational corporations, knowledge, knowledge management, expatriates and professional service firms. The main findings suggest that expatriates do function as an important knowledge sharing mechanism for mainly explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is also accumulated by operating on a foreign market, however our findings indicate that this knowledge is too difficult to spread throughout the whole organization, hence it is kept embedded in the expatriates. These findings are finally discussed and suggestions for future research regarding the transfer of knowledge with the use of real-time information technology, retention of expatriates, choice of knowledge sharing strategy and firm size as an influence on knowledge sharing, are put forward...|$|E

40|$|On the 26 th of January 2010, the Supreme Administrative Court in Sweden gave five rulings which greatly {{affect the}} {{possibility}} to keep a close company within a family by transferring the ownership of the company to the next generation. The five rulings concern {{the interpretation of the}} prerequisite, same or similar activity, which can be found in section 57, clause 4 of the Swedish Income Tax Act.      The prerequisite is fulfilled when an entire or parts of a business is transferred to another close company and the receiving company’s business activity is {{within the framework of the}} transferring company’s business activity or when the companies have a similar connection. Depending on which shares that are being evaluated, the prerequisite can refer to both the shares in the receiving or the <b>transferring</b> <b>company.</b> When the prerequisite is fulfilled, a standardized amount of the business income will be taxed as capital gains and the surplus will be taxed as earned income. This tax treatment will continue as long as the original shareholder or a family member is active in either of the companies.   The present interpretation of the prerequisite results in problems when shareholders want to transfer ownership of the company to the next generation and at the same time place some of the business income in a passive asset management company. The current interpretation of the prerequisite shows that the shares in the asset management company are affected and will continue to be affected by the previous business activity, when it is controlled by the next generation. Therefore, the special tax treatment will continue to affect the original shareholder.   The current interpretation of the prerequisite results in a more favorable tax treatment when the original shareholder sells the company to a third party instead of transferring ownership to the next generation...|$|E
40|$|The {{industry}} {{environment has}} changed in the past decades becoming more complex and unforeseeable than ever. New information and communication technologies and new relationships within and between organisations favoured cultural and socio-economic changes so that interdependency of company services and functions has become evident. The company today faces multiple issues such as faster product cycle times and new industrial and environmental constraints. Those issues result in the redefinition of performance structures of the company. On one hand, on an organizational level, this redefinition consists in the process redesign (Business Process Reengineering, BPR) that helps taking into account the integration of the company activities, which were strongly compartmentalized before their reorganization. On the other hand, it consists in the refocusing of the company on its core competencies by <b>transferring</b> <b>company</b> activities or functions, which are considered as not strategic, to external partners. Our research work is situated within this context. In this PhD, we study the problem of process modeling and redesign {{in the context of the}} logistics reorganization of the industrial Group Rhodia. Our objective is to examine how to attain an optimized transverse company management (internal aspects), to redefine the company processes in the context of outsourcing of certain process parts (focus on core competencies), and finally to integrate an interdependent and multi-actor process organization (partner relationships). Within this perspective, our research aims at bringing about methodological tools and configuration practices for supply chain management by particularly concentrating on supply chain processes as well as the links between the activities and actors that conduct those processes. Our will concerning this research work on an industrial ground is to demonstrate the importance of process organization within the supply chain as well as to present the concepts and approaches, which evolve around process modeling in order to propose, in fine, an outsourcing methodology that is supported by process modeling and reorganization. Thus, the first chapter of our PhD lays the framework of our research: the supply chain organization and the importance of processes within this one. The growing global complexity of the company's industrial environment has changed the mechanisms and organization principles. The company engages in an improvement of its way of working, internally within its organization and externally with its direct partners. The concept of supply chain management is clearly associated to this evolution because it is greatly based on process reorganization of the company for which the major stakes consist in a transverse organization in order to attain global supply chain improvement and not locally optimized silos. The first chapter also allows us to present the problematic we address in our research work: the supply chain organization in the context of outsourcing. Therefore, we introduce the industrial background of our work (restructuring of the organization we consider) as well as the industry sector and the related issues (outsourcing objectives in the sector of specialty chemicals). The Group Rhodia faces major stakes of cost reduction and wants to refocus on its core competencies, the specialty chemicals, through the outsourcing of those parts of its logistics, which the Group considers as not being part of its core organization. Rhodia thus aims, through activity reorganization and process outsourcing, at simplifying and lightening its organization in order to be more productive and to keep and attain new competitive advantage in its four main industries: pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemistry, food and consumer goods, industry and services, automotive, and electronics, and fibers. This chapter allows us to lay and present the basis for our reflection of defining and carrying out the outsourcing process. In order to reach this objective, we concentrate in the second chapter on the concepts and approaches, which are associated to process modeling and reorganization. First we determine the general articulation of the approach we propose and we present a certain number of models, methods, tools, etc. enabling internal process reorganization and accompanying the outsourcing of activities to external service providers. We notice that process reorganization is a relatively new concept, which is particularly being considered in industry during the last decade. The research work around this subject and the methodologies, techniques, etc., used in the industry, points out that in comparison to the “organizational” aspects, there is a predominance for the “technical” point of view in that matter. It is the organizational aspects we consider in our research work in order to extend the application of BPR in the context of outsourcing and the sharing of logistics activities of the partners. We use for our work an international process standard of the supply chain, the SCOR-model, which was chosen by the Group Rhodia for the management of its main management processes. This chapter allows us to develop a structuring methodology including three steps (“as is” – “to be” – “go live”) and to employ this one in the case of outsourcing. The third chapter allows us to apply our research work on an industrial level. Through different case studies, led within the Group Rhodia, we illustrate the importance of an integrated and standardized vision and the activity interdependency for the process reorganization applied to logistics outsourcing. We propose a three stage development: the process modeling, analysis and reorganization, helping to make evolve the company on an internal level, allowing the activity outsourcing (in our case a part of the logistics process), and finally improving multi actor functioning of the supply chain. In order to define a consistent process that is under control, it is necessary, before outsourcing whatever company activity, to have a global vision of the tasks that are to be executed in order to identify those, which are likely to be outsourced, and those, which need to be hold internally. Moreover, for a successful outsourcing process, it is essential to integrate in this one the external service provider as a strategic partner of this reorganization effort. Hence, one also needs to consider the interdependency between all activities so as to respect the global process and thus the supply chain. The third chapter thus allows us to propose a process modeling approach in the context of outsourcing in the following way: ¬ “Why to outsource” – decision making for outsourcing ¬ “What to outsource” – activity identification for the outsourcing effort ¬ “How to outsource” – BPR with the help of the SCOR-model and “traditional” BPR methodology for the processes, which are not in the scope of the SCOR-model Thus based on the results of our industrial case studies, we establish in this chapter an approach for process reorganization and outsourcing within the context of Rhodia's supply chain and define an outsourcing plan through process reorganization. Finally, we conclude this PhD by turning back on the academic and industrial contributions of this manuscript concerning process reorganization of the company in the context of outsourcing. We present at last a certain number of research perspectives in this areaPour faire face à un environnement de plus en plus changeant et compétitif, les entreprises sont conduites à une redéfinition de leurs structures. Sur le plan organisationnel, la redéfinition des processus permet de mieux prendre en compte l'intégration d'activités autrefois fortement cloisonnées; le recentrage des entreprises sur leur cœur de métier conduit à un transfert d'activités ou de fonctions jugées non stratégiques vers des partenaires externes. Cette restructuration qui se traduit par une intégration fonctionnelle importante, permet, à travers des processus transversaux d'atteindre un objectif commun à tous : satisfaire le client au moindre coût. C'est dans ce contexte qu'intervient notre travail de recherche. Nous traitons dans cette thèse, dans le cadre de la réorganisation logistique d'un grand groupe industriel, la problématique de la modélisation et de la réorganisation des processus pour une gestion transversale optimisée d'une entreprise (aspect interne), la redéfinition des processus dans le cadre de l'externalisation d'une partie d'un processus (recentrage des activité), et finalement l'organisation de processus interdépendants multi acteurs (relations partenariales). Ce travail vise à apporter des outils méthodologiques et des pratiques d'aide à la configuration des chaînes, en particulier dans le cadre de l'externalisation. Ainsi, le premier chapitre pose le cadre de nos recherches : l'organisation des chaînes logistiques et l'importance des processus au sein de celles-ci. Ce chapitre permet de poser et présenter les bases de notre réflexion pour définir et mettre en œuvre un processus d'externalisation. Pour atteindre cet objectif, le deuxième chapitre est centré sur les concepts et approches relatifs à la modélisation et à la réorganisation des processus. Nous déterminons dans un premier temps l'articulation générale de l'approche d'intervention que nous proposons et nous présentons un certain nombre de modèles, méthodes, outils, etc. pour permettre une réorganisation des processus internes et accompagner l'externalisation d'activités vers des prestataires extérieurs. Nous constatons que si la réorganisation des processus est une notion relativement récente, elle fait l'objet d'une attention toute particulière, ces dernières années, dans les milieux industriels. Le tour d'horizon des travaux de recherche et des méthodologies, techniques, outils, etc. utilisés par les industriels, montre qu'il existe une prépondérance sur l'axe « technologie » par rapport à l'axe « organisation ». C'est sur ce dernier point que nous positionnons nos travaux pour étendre les champs du BPR au cadre de l'externalisation et du partage partenariales d'activités dans l'exécution du processus logistique. Nous utilisons pour cela un standard international des processus de la chaîne logistique, le modèle SCOR, qui a été choisi par le Groupe Rhodia pour la gestion de ses processus principaux. Ce chapitre nous permet alors de développer une méthodologie structurante en trois temps (« as is » - « to be » - « go live ») et d'employer celle-ci dans le cadre de l'externalisation Le troisième chapitre nous permet d'appliquer notre proposition au niveau industriel. A travers différentes études menées au sein du Groupe Rhodia, nous illustrons l'intérêt d'une vision intégrant standardisation et dépendances entre activités, dans la réorganisation des processus appliquée à la mutualisation ou l'externalisation. Nous proposons une évolution en trois temps : modélisation, analyse et restructuration des processus pour une évolution interne à l'entreprise, puis pour l'externalisation d'activités (logistiques dans le cas qui nous intéresse), et finalement pour l'amélioration du fonctionnement multi acteurs. Le troisième chapitre nous permet de proposer une approche pour la modélisation des processus dans le cadre d'une opération d'externalisation : ¬ « Pourquoi externaliser » - la décision d'externalisation ¬ « Quoi externaliser » - la détermination des activités à externaliser ¬ « Comment externaliser » - le BPR à en utilisant le modèle SCOR ou d'autres méthodes pour les processus n'étant pas adressés par SCOR Nous établissons dans ce chapitre, à partir des résultats issus de nos études industrielles, une démarche de réorganisation des processus et d'externalisation dans le cadre de la chaîne logistique de Rhodia et définissons un plan d'externalisation par la réorganisation des processus. Enfin, nous concluons cette thèse en revenant sur les apports académiques et industriels de ce manuscrit concernant la réorganisation des processus de l'organisation dans le contexte de l'externalisation. Nous ouvrirons enfin un certain nombre de perspectives de recherches dans ce domaine...|$|E
