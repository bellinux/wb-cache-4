500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a child, Cooper has said: [...] "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in <b>the</b> <b>fridge</b> <b>and</b> turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of Joseph Merrick in {{an excerpt from the}} play The Elephant Man.|$|E

40|$|We study {{a quantum}} {{absorption}} refrigerator, {{in which a}} target qubit is cooled by two machine qubits in a nonequilibrium steady-state. It is realized by a strong internal coupling in <b>the</b> two-qubit <b>fridge</b> <b>and</b> a vanishing tripartite interaction among the whole system. The coherence of a machine virtual qubit is investigated as quantumness of <b>the</b> <b>fridge.</b> A necessary condition for cooling shows that the quantum coherence is beneficial to <b>the</b> nonequilibrium <b>fridge,</b> while it is detrimental {{as far as the}} maximum efficiency and the efficiency at maximum power are concerned. Here, the efficiency is defined only in terms of heat currents caused by the tripartite interaction, with the one maintaining the two-qubit nonequilibrium state being excluded. The later can be considered to have no direct involvement in extracting heat from the target, as it is not affected by the tripartite interaction. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures. Submitted versio...|$|R

It was Sonali who had followed Pratyush and Teesata on the fateful night back to 88 Antop Hill, secretly climbed into Teesta's bedroom and slit her throat.
