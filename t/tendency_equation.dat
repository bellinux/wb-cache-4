40|$|The {{role of the}} ageostrophic {{vorticity}} {{tendencies in}} the Zwack–Okossi vorticity <b>tendency</b> <b>equation</b> has been examined within the context that this term in the equation acts as a correction term for the vorticity tendency or height tendency calculations. In this paper, this term is shown to act as both a response to initial forcing and as a forcing mechanism itself in modulating the initial forcing. Using an earlier methodology for partitioning the wind field and the height field into their divergent and rotational parts, the ageostrophic wind is shown to contain components of both parts. Then, using an omega equation, an ageostrophic vorticity tendency is cal-culated, which has forcing mechanisms similar to a height <b>tendency</b> <b>equation.</b> This ageostrophic tendency is then used in this height <b>tendency</b> <b>equation</b> and provides for an improved method of calculating the ageostrophic wind rather than simply calculating it as a residual. Two case studies are then examined to demonstrate this point. For both case studies, the calculated height tendencies using the derived ageostrophic winds and those calculated as a residual overestimated the height tendencies, especially at the surface. While the correlation coefficients show that the two methods are comparable at 500 hPa, at the surface there is a notable degree of improvement in the pattern similarity. This resulted in an improved representation of the 500 -hPa height ten-dencies for {{the onset of the}} Atlantic blocking event despite marginal improvements in the calculated field overall. 1...|$|E

The data input consists of umkehr ozone profile, total ozone (obtained by Brewer No. 067, located at Rome) and horizontal wind at various levels. Analysis of several cases indicates that meridional advection is the main factor responsible for the observed synoptic-scale ozone fluctuations. The problem of modelling and predicting synopticscale ozone changes may be faced by means of statistical schemes {{taking into account the}} relationship between O and other meteorological quantities, like temperature and geopotential height (Poulin and Evans, 1994; Vogel et al., 1995).

The high-resolution model output data are utilized to diagnose the double front structure, and the distributions of potential temperature, equivalent potential temperature, and specic humidity {{in the vicinity of}} the Meiyu Front System (MYFS) in the Jiang-Huai Valley. The results show that both the potential temperature gradient and the specic humidity gradient have important impacts on the two strong equivalent potential temperature gradient zones associated with the double front structure of the MYFS, but the latter (mois ture gradient) is more important. In addition, the <b>tendency</b> <b>equation</b> of specic humidity gradient is theoretically derived.

The persistent episodes are determined with an objective analysis of the low-pass (. 10 day) 350 -mb streamfunction field that uses both pattern correlations and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The composite evolution of each term in the streamfunction <b>tendency</b> <b>equation</b> is calculated relative to the onset day (the {{first day of the}} persistent episode). By projecting each term in the streamfunction <b>tendency</b> <b>equation</b> onto an EOF (the EOF is associated with a particular low-frequency anomaly), the contribution of these terms toward the tendency of the corresponding principal component can be obtained. It is found that the sum of the linear terms dominates during most of the growth and the decay of the low-frequency anomaly. The linear term that accounts for the growth and maintenance of the low-frequency anomaly is the interaction between the anomaly and the time-mean zonally asymmetric flow. After the anomaly attains sufficient amplitude, its decay is accomplished through the divergence term. For one phase of the EOF, it is found that the high-frequency transients prolong the anomaly, whereas in the other phase they do not. Implications of this study for examining monthly averaged anomalies are also discussed. 1...|$|E

40|$|Hydrostatic <b>tendency</b> <b>equations</b> of {{pressure}} and geopotential {{have been used}} in various forms {{since the beginning of the}} twentieth century. In contrast to classical mass flux divergence formulations, all forms that involve vertical integrals of temperature tendencies contain an additional term related to geopotential tendency at the upper limit of the integral. In many previous studies, including a recent work by two of the authors on a case of unusual wintertime precipitation in tropical West Africa, it has been assumed that there exists a pressure level in the stratosphere (usually 100 or 50 hPa) where these tendencies become negligible. This assumption implies a direct relation between net column heating and surface pressure fall. Prompted by a critique of Spengler and Egger, the validity of the concept of a stratospheric level of insignificant dynamics is tested here for the previously studied case on the basis of operational analyses from the ECMWF. At least for low latitudes, significant tendencies with some spatial and temporal variations are found up to 10 hPa, which renders a general neglect of this term on a fixed pressure level problematic. These results call for a more detailed investigation of the dynamical causes of the analyzed tendencies, a reevaluation of some previous work, and a more careful design of future studies on this subject...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of the bark of rubber tree {{over a long period}} is a major concern for rubber planters in order to cope with problems of early replanting due to limited financial means. One of the efficient solutions to this concern is tapping with less longer tapping cuts. The reduction of the tapping cut length in reverse tapping permits to manage better the tapping panel, to improve the productivity of the tapper and to increase the economical life span of rubber trees. On that respect, a study was conducted during six years in south-eastern Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to determine the}} length(s) of tapping cut, in downward tapping, which would provide a suitable solution to the problem of rubber farmers. The influence of the reduction of the tapping cut length on the parameters of yield, radial vegetative growth and physiological profile is evaluated in clones GT 1 and PB 235 of Hevea brasiliensis. Half, third, quarter and eighth spiral tapping cuts were compared to each other and to a full spiral cut (control). The reduction of the tapping cuts length induces losses in rubber yield compared with the control which yet are not proportional to the reduction of the tapping cuts length. The yield per centimetre of tapping cut is more important with the short cuts than the long cuts. Very strong correlations were determinate between tapping intensity and rubber yield, tapping intensity and annual mean girth increment and between tapping intensity and physiological parameters (DRC and Pi). The curve <b>tendency</b> <b>equations</b> were also determinate. In terms of rubber yield, the PB 235 fits the reduction of the tapping cut length better than the GT 1. The reduction of tapping cuts length favours a better vegetative radial growth. It does not impair the physiological profile of the trees which show signs of under-exploitation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the life cycle of {{tropical}} cyclones in terms of a K-Vmax diagram. Such a diagram summarizes the time evolution of the integrated kinetic energy K and the maximum tangential wind Vmax, which respectively measure vortex size and intensity. A typical life cycle consists of an incipient stage in which K and Vmax slowly increase until Vmax≈ 25 m s− 1, a deepening stage in which K and Vmax increase more rapidly until Vmax≈ 60 m s− 1, and finally a mature stage in which K continues to grow at approximately the same rate while Vmax remains fixed or even decreases. This typical life cycle can be diagnostically analyzed using a theoretical argument that is based on the balanced vortex model and, in particular, on the associated geopotential <b>tendency</b> <b>equation.</b> This is a second order partial differential equation containing the diabatic forcing and, under idealized conditions, two spatially varying coefficients: the static stability and the inertial stability, whose ratio determines the local Rossby length ℓ. Thus, the balanced azimuthal wind and temperature tendencies in a tropical vortex depend not only on the diabatic forcing, but also on the spatial distribution of ℓ. Under the simplifying assumption that the diabatic heating and the associated response are confined to the first internal vertical mode, the geopotential <b>tendency</b> <b>equation</b> reduces to a radial structure equation, which can be solved numerically. These solutions illustrate how the vortex response to diabatic heating depends on whether this heating lies in the large Rossby length region outside the radius of maximum wind or in the small Rossby length region inside the radius of maximum wind. Tangential wind tendencies are found to be hypersensitive to the location of the diabatic heating relative to the small Rossby length region in the vortex core...|$|E

One developed explosively over water 60 to 36 {{hours before the}} block first appeared, while the second developed explosively over the southeastern United States {{during the time of}} block formation. In both cases, both vorticity and temperature advection were consistently important forcing mechanisms. This is in contrast to the block itself, in which vorticity advection was easily the dominant forcing mechanism. Latent heat release was also significant, accounting for about 50 percent of the total height falls in the cyclone below 850 mb. Estimates of latent heat release were greatly enhanced by coupling parameterized estimates with values derived from GOES IR data using an algorithm developed by Marshall's F. R. Robertson. Among the difficulties encountered in this work was the identification of an appropriate lower boundary condition for the solution of the height <b>tendency</b> <b>equation.</b> The zero value currently used tends to yield underestimates of the lower troposphere height tendencies. To address this problem a new diagnostic technique was developed in cooperation with Dr. Peter Zwack of the University of Quebec at Montreal.

To that end an extensive investigation of the dynamics and energetics of a major blocking anticyclone and two upstream cyclones, all of which occurred over the North Atlantic Ocean and the United States in January 1979, was undertaken. Data for the study were provided by Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres (GLA) 4 LAT by 5 LON FGGE analyses. The methodology has primarily focused on the diagnosis of circulation forcing mechanisms using the modified forms (referred to as the extended forms) of the height <b>tendency</b> and Zwack-Okossi <b>equations</b> developed by our research group. Calculations use routine second-order finite differencing with boundary layer fraction and sensible heating and latent heat release represented as parameterized quantities. Of particular interest are the latent heat release estimates, which combine convectional parameterized values with estimates derived from satellite IR data. The latter were obtained using an algorithm derived by Dr. Franklin R. Robertson of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Results are contained in project reports, theses and publications identified in previous review summaries and reports, and publications listed {{at the end of}} this summary. Significant accomplishments in the past year are presented...|$|R
40|$|Descriptions {{of entire}} lactations were {{investigated}} using six mathematical equations. comprising the differentials of four growth functions (logistic. Gompertz, Schumacher and Morgan) {{and two other}} equations (Wood and Dijkstra). The data contained monthly milk yield records from 70 first, 70 second and 75 third parity Iranian Holstein cows. Indicators of fit were model behavior, statistical evaluation and biologically meaningful parameter estimates and lactation features. Analysis of variance with equation, parity and their interaction as factors and with cows as replicates was performed to compare goodness of fit of the equations. The interaction of equation and parity was not significant for any statistics, which showed that there vas no <b>tendency</b> For one <b>equation</b> to fit a given parity better than other equations. Although model behaviour analysis showed better performance of growth functions than the Wood and Dijkstra equations in filling the individual lactation curves, statistical evaluation revealed {{that there was no}} significant difference between file goodness of fit of the different equations. Evaluation of lactation features showed that the Dijkstra equation was able to estimate the initial milk yield and peak yield more accurately than the other equations. Overall evaluation of the different equations demonstrated the potential of the differentials of simple empirical growth functions used in file Current study as equations for fitting monthly milk records of Holstein dairy cattle...|$|R
