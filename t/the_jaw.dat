5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> muscles; <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E
5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> and dental attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (grinding of the teeth) caused by the drug. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, the inability to open <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b> Long-term users often experience xerostomia (dry mouth).|$|E

50|$|Former and colloquial names include Osteonecrosis of <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> (ONJ), cavitations, dry or wet socket, and NICO (neuralgia-inducing Cavitational osteonecrosis). The current, more correct, term, {{osteomyelitis}} of <b>the</b> <b>jaws,</b> differentiates <b>the</b> condition {{from the}} relatively recent and better known iatrogenic phenomenon of bisphosphonate-caused Osteonecrosis of <b>the</b> <b>jaws.</b> <b>The</b> latter is found primarily in post-menopausal women given bisphosphonate drugs, usually against osteoporosis.|$|R
50|$|Osteomyelitis of <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> is {{osteomyelitis}} (which is {{infection and}} {{inflammation of the}} bone marrow, sometimes abbreviated to OM) which occurs in the bones of <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> (i.e. maxilla or the mandible). Historically, osteomyelitis of <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> was a common complication of odontogenic infection (infections of the teeth). Before the antibiotic era, it was frequently a fatal condition.|$|R
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. <b>The</b> <b>jaw</b> in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their evolutionary {{need to be able to}} catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. <b>The</b> <b>jaw</b> of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and adductor muscles close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E
5|$|Diastema is a {{condition}} {{in which there is a}} gap between two teeth caused by the imbalance in the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> and the size of teeth.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> fixed <b>jaw</b> is {{attached}} to the shaft with a pivot pin so that <b>the</b> entire <b>jaw</b> assembly can rotate about an axis perpendicular to the shaft. This permits <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> to be rotated over the end of the shaft {{so that they can be}} [...] "flipped" [...] over, to allow the tool to be used to either tighten or loosen a fastener. Mechanical stops limit this rotation to 180° so that when <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> assembly is resting at a stop, <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> will be perpendicular to the shaft and thus aligned to the fastener. When the shaft is held in a vertical orientation, <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> are automatically held against the stop by gravity. Basin wrenches are available with both fixed-length and telescopic handles.|$|R
5|$|Jaws: <b>The</b> <b>jaws</b> {{should be}} strong and powerful. The muzzle should be of medium length {{and should not be}} too tapered. <b>The</b> <b>jaws</b> should hang {{slightly}} and curve gracefully back.|$|R
5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities on the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>jaw,</b> one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of <b>the</b> <b>jaw,</b> the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to <b>the</b> <b>jaw,</b> and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove {{on the inside of}} <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
5|$|Tuataras superficially {{resemble}} lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) {{on either}} side and <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi. The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.|$|E
40|$|Lesions {{specific}} for <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> and not {{occurring in}} any other bones mostly {{are related to the}} teeth or to odontogenic tissues.

25|$|Scansoriopteryx is also {{notable for}} its wide, rounded <b>jaws.</b> <b>The</b> lower <b>jaw</b> {{contained}} at least twelve teeth, larger {{in the front}} of <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> than in <b>the</b> back. <b>The</b> lower <b>jaw</b> bones may have been fused together, a feature otherwise known only in the oviraptorosaurs.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, playing <b>the</b> <b>Jaws</b> harp was {{forbidden}} during Stalin's regime in Russia {{due to its}} close ties with Shamanism. Shamans believed that <b>the</b> <b>Jaws</b> harp could take a person {{to the world of}} spirits.|$|R
5|$|Behind the incisors and canines, {{there were}} no {{additional}} teeth in <b>the</b> <b>jaw.</b> Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth behind the canines, there is instead a large depression, or fossa, {{on the side of}} the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the lacrimal and possibly part of the jugal. This fossa is 48% the length of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this fossa is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on top, and a larger and deeper depression on the bottom. A wide furrow beginning behind the canine contacts the bottom of the fossa and then passes into the interior of the mouth. The bottom portion of the fossa is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Early on, Lull {{postulated}} that the frills may {{have served as}} anchor points for <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and thus power for the muscles. This has been put forward by other authors over the years, but later studies do not find evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E
5|$|Hadrocodium, whose fossils {{date from}} {{approximately}} 195 million years ago, {{in the early}} Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> for the articular, a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids.|$|E
60|$|Tim Keenan {{continued}} {{standing over}} him, but Scott took no further notice of his presence. He {{had managed to}} get the muzzle in between <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> on one side, and was trying to get it out between <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> on <b>the</b> other side.

40|$|Cartilaginous jaws have {{historically}} been considered primitive in comparison to those of bony fishes. Yet sharks are capable of cutting through materials, such as bone and sea turtle shells, which are paradoxically harder than <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> themselves. To examine feeding mechanisms in sharks, I used finite element analysis (FEA) to digitally reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> of four shark species: the sandtiger (Carcharias taurus), great white (Carcharodon carcharias), tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). I developed a new method for material testing shark jaw cartilage. Using this method I obtained multi-directional species-specific mechanical properties for jaw cartilage and incorporated these data into the models. I also examined differences between species and ontogenetic changes in mechanical properties of <b>jaw</b> cartilage. <b>The</b> data show several adaptations of shark jaws that are discussed in relation to feeding mechanics. Comparison of <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> of macropredatory species to <b>the</b> crushing <b>jaws</b> of <b>the</b> Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) show that there are directional differences in the material properties of jaw cartilage {{that are consistent with}} feeding behaviour in sharks. Furthermore, the data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> of subadult great whites are mechanically vulnerable when handling large prey. Ontogenetic mineralisation of <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> is thus considered necessary to feed on large marine mammals. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> of <b>the</b> bull shark stiffen with age. As with the great white, the bull shark undergoes dietary shifts to large mammalian prey. Surprisingly, the data reveal that <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> of sharks are an order of magnitude less stiff than previously believed. This flexibility is exemplified by <b>the</b> highly compliant <b>jaws</b> of <b>the</b> tiger shark, which are here hypothesised to conform to the shape of turtle shells during biting. Close contact between <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> and teeth may enhance sawing through hard materials by the uniquely shaped teeth of the tiger shark...|$|R
5|$|The dentary {{gradually}} became the main bone of <b>the</b> lower <b>jaw</b> which, by <b>the</b> Triassic, progressed towards <b>the</b> fully mammalian <b>jaw</b> (<b>the</b> lower consisting {{only of the}} dentary) and middle ear (which is constructed by the bones that were previously used to construct <b>the</b> <b>jaws</b> of reptiles).|$|R
5|$|In 2012, Sereno {{pointed out}} several skull and {{dentition}} features that suggest a purely {{or at least}} preponderantly herbivorous diet. These include the horny beak and the specialised cheek teeth, which were suitable for cutting off vegetation, as well as fleshy cheeks, which would have helped keeping food within the mouth during mastication. <b>The</b> <b>jaw</b> muscles were enlarged, and <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> joint was set {{below the level of}} the teeth. This deep position of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> joint would have allowed an evenly spread bite along the tooth row, in contrast to the scissor-like bite seen in carnivorous dinosaurs. Finally, size and position of the tusks are very different in separate members of the Heterodontosauridae family; a specific function in feeding thus appears unlikely. Sereno surmised that heterodontosaurids were comparable to today's peccaries, which possess similar tusks and feed on a variety of plant material such as roots, tubers, fruits, seeds and grass. Butler and colleagues suggested that the feeding apparatus of Heterodontosaurus was specialised to process tough plant material, and that late-surviving members of the family (Fruitadens, Tianyulong and Echinodon) probably showed a more generalised diet including both plants and invertebrates. Heterodontosaurus was characterised by a strong bite at small gape angles, but the later members were adapted to a more rapid bite and wider gapes. A 2016 study of ornithischian jaw mechanics found that the relative bite forces of Heterodontosaurus was comparable to that of the more derived Scelidosaurus. The study suggested that the tusks could {{have played a role in}} feeding by grazing against the lower beak while cropping vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. <b>The</b> <b>jaw</b> musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move <b>the</b> <b>jaw</b> further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of}} the shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and innervation in the region.|$|E
