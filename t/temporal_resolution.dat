This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution.</b> This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{still do}} not know the exact {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E

40|$|Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model {{quantitative}} precipitation forecasts (QPF) {{have been}} one of interest to forecasters (and public users) as they influence daily life. The rapid increases in model resolution are proportional to the increases in computer resources. The development of precipitation observation networks and the improvement in measuring techniques are greatly promoting the accuracy of observed precipitation. It is possible to build a model precipitation verification system based on high quality observation from the Continental United States (CONUS) area. The model precipitation forecast skills are more varied (sensitive) to different verification techniques, different spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions,</b> especially model biases. Somehow, the forecast skills are misleading when the model forecasts are strongly biased. The subject of model bias and bias-free verification will be discussed in the separated paper. The past 4 -year NCEP/GFS QPFs have been evaluated by different measures. The skills are improved gradually for past years when model increases the resolution, improves analysis system and physical processes. The winter seasons have more skills than summers.

40|$|The {{development}} of remote sensing has enabled {{the acquisition of}} information on land-cover change at different spatial scales. However, a trade-off between spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions</b> normally exists. Fine-spatial-resolution images have low <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions,</b> whereas coarse spatial resolution images have high temporal repetition rates. A novel super-resolution change detection method (SRCD) is proposed to detect land-cover changes at both fine spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions</b> {{with the use of}} a coarse-resolution image and a fine-resolution land-cover map acquired at different times. SRCD is an iterative method that involves endmember estimation, spectral unmixing, land-cover fraction change detection, and super-resolution land-cover mapping. Both the land-cover change/no-change map and from–to change map at fine spatial resolution can be generated by SRCD. In this study, SRCD was applied to synthetic multispectral image, Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) multispectral image and Landsat- 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral image. The land-cover from–to change maps are found to have the highest overall accuracy (higher than 85 %) in all the three experiments. Most of the changed land-cover patches, which were larger than the coarse-resolution pixel, were correctly detected...|$|R

25|$|<b>Temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> is the {{smallest}} time period of neural activity reliably separated out by fMRI. One element deciding this is the sampling time, the TR. Below a TR of 1 or 2seconds, however, scanning just generates sharper HDR curves, without adding much additional information (e.g. beyond what is alternatively achieved by mathematically interpolating the curve gaps at a lower TR). <b>Temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> can be improved by staggering stimulus presentation across trials. If one-third of data trials are sampled normally, one-third at 1s, 4s, 7s and so on, and the last third at 2s, 5s and 8s, the combined data provide a resolution of 1s, though with only one-third as many total events.|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of parameter sets over different <b>temporal</b> and spatial <b>resolutions</b> is {{common practice in}} many large-domain hydrological modelling studies. The degree to which parameters are transferable across <b>temporal</b> and spatial <b>resolutions</b> is an indicator of how well spatial and temporal variability is represented in the models. A large degree of transferability may well indicate a poor representation of such variability in the employed models. To investigate parameter transferability over resolution {{in time and space}} we have set up a study in which the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model for the Thur basin in Switzerland was run with four different spatial resolutions (1  km [*]×[*]  1  km, 5  km [*]×[*]  5  km, 10  km [*]×[*]  10  km, lumped) and evaluated for three relevant <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions</b> (hour, day, month), both applied with uniform and distributed forcing. The model was run 3150 times using the Hierarchical Latin Hypercube Sample and the best 1  % of the runs was selected as behavioural. The overlap in behavioural sets for different spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions</b> was used as an indicator of parameter transferability. A key result from this study is that the overlap in parameter sets for different spatial resolutions was much larger than for different <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions,</b> also when the forcing was applied in a distributed fashion. This result suggests that it is easier to transfer parameters across different spatial resolutions than across different <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions.</b> However, the result also indicates a substantial underestimation in the spatial variability represented in the hydrological simulations, suggesting that the high spatial transferability may occur because the current generation of large-domain models has an inadequate representation of spatial variability and hydrologic connectivity. The results presented in this paper provide a strong motivation to further investigate and substantially improve the representation of spatial and temporal variability in large-domain hydrological models...|$|R

25|$|The fMRI {{technique}} can complement or supplement {{other techniques}} {{because of its}} unique strengths and gaps. It can noninvasively record brain signals without risks of ionising radiation inherent in other scanning methods, such as CT or PET scans. It can also record signal from all regions of the brain, unlike EEG/MEG, which are biased toward the cortical surface. But fMRI <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> is poorer than that of EEG since the HDR takes tens of seconds to climb to its peak. Combining EEG with fMRI is hence potentially powerful because the two have complementary strengths—EEG has high <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution,</b> and fMRI high spatial resolution. But simultaneous acquisition needs {{to account for the}} EEG signal from varying blood flow triggered by the fMRI gradient field, and the EEG signal from the static field.

Global {{estimation of}} evapotranspiration on the basis of observational data can only be achieved by using remote sensing. Several algorithms have been developed that are capable of estimating the daily evapotranspiration from remote sensing data. Evaluation of remote sensing algorithms in general is problematic because of differences in spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions</b> between remote sensing observations and field measurements. This problem can be solved in part by using soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) models, because on the one hand these models provide evapotranspiration estimations also under cloudy conditions {{and on the other hand}} can scale between different <b>temporal</b> <b>resolutions...</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> of fMRI {{is limited}} by: (1) the {{feedback}} mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait till net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve <b>temporal</b> <b>resolution</b> address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford.
