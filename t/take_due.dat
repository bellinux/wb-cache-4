25|$|As can be noted, {{liability}} {{is generally}} not extended to the acts of independent contractors. Though such a distinction has been criticised, there are several circumstances in which an employer may be liable for the acts of contractors. If an employer commissions a tort, this will render the employer a joint tortfeasor. Additionally, where an employer is negligent in selecting a competent third party contractor, liability may be imposed. The broadest exception however is where a non-delegable duty is imposed upon an employer, either by statute or through common law, to prevent the harm of others. Where a duty is imposed by statute, either to carry out work in a certain way, or to <b>take</b> <b>due</b> care in carrying out work, then this is non-delegable. Common law duties may arise in several exceptional circumstances. One such is where an activity is being undertaken which is especially hazardous, and involves obvious risks of damage. This duty was recognised in Honeywill and Stein Ltd v Larkin Brothers Ltd, where photographers who negligently photographed {{the interior of a}} theatre set alight to the building. Their employers were found vicariously liable, as the dangerous methods of photography created a fire hazard. Additionally, where work is being undertaken on a highway, a non-delegable duty is created not to endanger any road users. Lastly, occupiers are liable in full where an independent contractor, through negligence, allows fire to spread to neighbouring land.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a motion}} to censure is passed, the chair (or the vice-president, if the {{presiding}} officer is being censured) addresses the censured member by name. He may say {{something to the effect}} of, [...] "Brother F, you have been censured by vote of the assembly. A censure indicates the assembly's disapproval of your conduct". ( [...] This phrase should not be included as the cause for censure may have occurred outside of meetings.) [...] "A censure is a warning. It is the warning voice of suspension or expulsion. Please <b>take</b> <b>due</b> notice thereof and govern yourself accordingly." [...] Or, if the chair is being censured, the vice-president may say, [...] "Mr. X, you have been censured by the assembly for the reasons contained in the resolution.

2500|$|Nick Drake's {{first two}} albums with Island Records, Five Leaves Left (1969) and Bryter Layter (1971), had sold poorly, and {{combined}} with Drake's reluctance to perform live or engage in album promotion, Island was not confident of another album from Drake. Additionally, Drake had isolated {{himself in his}} London apartment and was suffering from depression. In 1971 he saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed antidepressants which {{he was reluctant to}} <b>take</b> <b>due</b> to the stigma associated with depression and his fears concerning the medication's interaction with marijuana, which he smoked regularly. [...] Although critics often associate Drake's music, and especially the perceived melancholy of Pink Moon, with his depression, Cally Calloman of Bryter Music, which manages Drake's estate, remembers it differently: [...] "Nick was incapable of writing and recording while he was suffering from periods of depression. He was not depressed during the writing or recording of Pink Moon and was immensely proud of the album." [...] After facing disappointment with various aspects of his first two albums, Drake sought a more organic sound with Pink Moon.|$|E

2500|$|Language {{conveys the}} {{importance}} of religion throughout the play. Henry's language often echoes the Bible. For example, hearing of the Cade rebellion, he comments [...] "Ο graceless men, they know not what they do" [...] (4.4.37), echoing the Gospel of Luke: [...] "Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do" [...] (23:34). Earlier in the play, he refers to heaven as [...] "the treasury of everlasting joy" [...] (2.1.18), recalling the Gospel of Matthew's [...] "lay up treasures for yourselves in heaven" [...] (6:20), {{and then a few}} lines later he muses [...] "blessèd [...] are the peacemakers on earth" [...] (2.1.34), echoing Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. On both of these occasions however, Cardinal Winchester, ostensibly a pious man, distorts Henry's genuine piety. After Henry's assessment of heaven, Winchester says to Gloucester, [...] "Thy heaven is on earth, thine eyes and thoughts/Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart" [...] (2.1.19–20). Then, after Henry praises peacemakers, Winchester hypocritically says, [...] "Let me be blessèd [...] for the peace I make,/Against this proud Protector with my sword" [...] (2.1.35–36). The Cardinal mocks religion shortly before the murder of Gloucester. Speaking of the forthcoming murder, Suffolk says, [...] "And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,/Say but the word and I will be his priest" [...] (3.1.271–272), to which Winchester responds [...] "But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,/Ere you can <b>take</b> <b>due</b> orders for a priest" [...] (3.1.273–274), disdaining priesthood and trivialising murder. After Gloucester is dead, Winchester continues to blaspheme himself, proclaiming the death of Gloucester to be [...] "God's secret judgement" [...] (3.2.31), a callous and knowing distortion.|$|E

60|$|We shall find on {{examination}} {{that this}} view of the general permanence of the oceanic and continental areas, with constant minor fluctuations of land and sea over the whole extent of the latter, enables us to understand, and offer a rational explanation of, most of the difficult problems of geographical distribution; and further, that our power of doing this is in direct proportion to our acquaintance with the distribution of fossil forms of life during the Tertiary period. We must, also, <b>take</b> <b>due</b> note of many other facts of almost equal importance for a due appreciation of the problems presented for solution, the most essential being, the various powers of dispersal possessed by the different groups of animals and plants, the geological antiquity of the species and genera, and the width and depth of the seas which separate the countries they, inhabit. A few illustrations will now be given {{of the way in which}} these branches of knowledge enable us to deal with the difficulties and anomalies that present themselves.|$|E
60|$|These {{were the}} subject of the first night's cogitataions after I was come home again, while the apprehensions which had so {{over-run}} my mind were fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours, as above. Thus fear of danger is ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to the eyes; and we find the burthen of anxiety greater, by much, than the evil which we are anxious about: and, which was worse than all this, I had not that relief in this trouble from the resignation I used to practise, that I hoped to have. I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained not, only that the Philistines were upon him, but that God had forsaken him; for I did not now <b>take</b> <b>due</b> ways to compose my mind, by crying to God in my distress, and resting upon his providence, as I had done before, for my defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had at least been more cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps carried through it with more resolution.|$|E
