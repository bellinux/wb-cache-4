5|$|Braathens SAFE {{was also}} {{given the right}} <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> its first {{international}} scheduled flights {{for the first time}} in several decades. On 19 August 1988, the airline was granted concession <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> to Billund in Denmark. At the same time, Air-X was granted concession <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> the route via Sandefjord and Skien. The route started on 2 May 1989. Previously the rules stated that if SAS flew to a non-Scandinavian destination from any capital, no other Scandinavian airlines could fly to that city. Braathens SAFE lost many contracts in the charter market in 1990, following Scanair's purchase of larger Douglas DC-10 aircraft. On 18 May 1990, Braathens SAFE was awarded the concession a route from Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger to Newcastle, which opened on 3 April 1991. The airline was also awarded the route from Tromsø to Murmansk, Russia, once per week from 28 January 1993.|$|E

5|$|Conventional {{defensive}} weapons {{included the}} anti-aircraft artillery piece. The three main types were the 4.5-inch, 3.7-inch and 3-inch guns. The first two were modern, and effective over 8000 metres (26,000 feet). The last was a First World War weapon effective only to 4,250 metres (14,000 feet). Usually batteries were sited in fours, with a range-finder and predictor which measured the speeds and heights of enemy aircraft while {{taking into account}} the time shell took to reach their intended targets, thus calculating when to detonate the fuse in the shell. As with most artillery weapons firing at aircraft, the higher the shell travelled the less effective it became. A shell fired to 1,500 metres (5,000 feet) would only be half as effective at 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) and a quarter as accurate at 4,500 metres (15,000 feet). The German bombers usually tried <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> around heavy concentrations of anti-aircraft guns, and if forced <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> through them, chose <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> at heights of around 4,500 metres (15,000 feet).|$|E

He continued to pursue his dream of writing, and had a poem published in the Op-Ed section of the New York Times on June 17, 1943.

Those restrictions were further relaxed in 1948, when people were allowed <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> the flag on national holidays. In January 1949, the restrictions were abolished and anyone could fly the Hinomaru at any time without permission.

5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, Braathens SAFE applied for a {{concession}} <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> to it along the West Coast, as well as the direct route from Oslo. SAS applied <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> the Oslo-service. The ministry wanted Braathens SAFE <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> the route with a concession granted to SAS, but Braathens SAFE rejected this. Instead, they were granted both the routes on temporary basis. The new airport received three daily flights to Oslo, of which two went via Ålesund, and four services on the West Coast route. At the same time, there was a discussion about who was to operate the new STOL-airports on the West Coast. Braathens SAFE stated that they wanted a local airline to do the flying, and chose not to apply. The concession was granted to Widerøe, and Braathens SAFE subsequently bought part of the airline.|$|E

5|$|The {{display of}} the Hinomaru at homes and {{businesses}} is also debated in Japanese society.
