5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} <b>to</b> <b>position</b> <b>the</b> capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but {{made no attempt to}} move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell, or olfaction, is highly {{important}} to lemurs and is frequently used in communication. Lemurs have long snouts (compared {{to the short}} snouts of haplorrhines) that are traditionally thought <b>to</b> <b>position</b> <b>the</b> nose for better sifting of smells, although long snouts do not necessarily translate into high olfactory acuity since {{it is not the}} relative size of the nasal cavity that correlates with smell, but the density of olfactory receptors. Instead, the long snouts may facilitate better chewing.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and {{critically}} in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed {{the game to}} Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, {{and dozens of other}} places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped <b>to</b> <b>position</b> <b>the</b> company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s (1996–1999).|$|E

5|$|On 7 June 2012, Knight Frank {{announced}} that administrators Ernst & Young had entered into an exclusive agreement with Malaysian developers SP Setia and Sime Darby, {{who were given}} 28 days to conduct due diligence and agree the final terms of the deal. Completion of the sale to the Malaysian consortium took place in September 2012. The redevelopment of the site will use the existing Vinoly master plan which intends <b>to</b> <b>position</b> <b>the</b> Power Station as the central focus of the regenerated 40-acre site, housing a blend of shops, cafes, restaurants, art and leisure facilities, office space and residential accommodation. The plan includes {{the restoration of the}} historic Power Station itself, {{the creation of a new}} riverside park to the north of the Power Station and the creation of a new High Street which is designed to link the future entrance to Battersea Power Station tube station with the Power Station. The redevelopment is hoped to bring about the extension of the existing riverside walk and facilitate access directly from the Power Station to Battersea Park and Chelsea Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The DNC {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred <b>to</b> <b>position</b> <b>the</b> tripod foremast behind the forward funnel with the tripod legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel's six, further increasing the smoke from the forward funnel.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate {{released}} Knight Lore {{third in}} the Sabreman series despite having completed it first. The Stamper brothers withheld its release for a year <b>to</b> <b>position</b> <b>the</b> company advantageously {{in anticipation of the}} game's effect on the market. Knight Lore novel image masking technique, Filmation, let images appear to pass atop and behind each other without their contents colliding. This created the illusion of depth priority, which the computer did not natively support. By delaying Knight Lore release, Ultimate protected sales of their upcoming Sabre Wulf and created another Filmation game before other developers could copy the style. Ultimate released the original Sabreman trilogy in quick succession in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum. Knight Lore came last, in November. Ports followed for the BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC, MSX, and Famicom Disk System. The game was later included in compilations including Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} WarioWare series, WarioWare: Smooth Moves is a puzzle game focusing on microgames, which are short games that last for about five seconds. Each microgame requires that the player position the Wii Remote in a specific way, such as holding it vertically, or placing the bottom end of the device against the nose. The player is required to use the Nunchuk attachment for the Wii Remote in certain microgames. Before each microgame begins, the required position for the Wii Remote is shown to the player, to allow them time <b>to</b> <b>position</b> <b>the</b> device. The game is broken up into stages, each represented by a WarioWare character and loosely connected by a story, with the microgames divided among the stages. After the player completes a stage's microgames, they advance to the boss stage, which is a microgame that is longer and {{more complex than the}} others. After the player completes all of the single-player stages, the game unlocks a multiplayer mode, in which only one Wii Remote is used and shared by up to 12 players. While a player plays a microgame in this mode, other players watch, and after the microgame is completed, the player passes the Wii Remote to the next person.|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} between dependency- and constituency-based grammars derives {{in large part}} from the initial division of the clause. The constituency relation derives from an initial binary division, whereby the clause is split into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP). This division is certainly present in the basic analysis of the clause that we find in the works of, for instance, Leonard Bloomfield and Noam Chomsky. Tesnière, however, argued vehemently against this binary division, preferring instead <b>to</b> <b>position</b> <b>the</b> verb as {{the root of all}} clause structure. Tesnière's stance was that the subject-predicate division stems from term logic and has no place in linguistics. The importance of this distinction is that if one acknowledges the initial subject-predicate division in syntax as something real, then one is likely to go down the path of constituency grammar, whereas if one rejects this division, then the only alternative is <b>to</b> <b>position</b> <b>the</b> verb as the root of all structure, which means one has chosen the path of dependency grammar.|$|E
