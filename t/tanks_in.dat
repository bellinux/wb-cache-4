5|$|With few modern tanks at {{the time}} of the Korean War, the Australian Army had to rely on British and US tank support. During the 1950s the Army {{standardised}} on the British Centurion tank, which saw action in Vietnam and remained in service until it was replaced with the German Leopard 1 in the mid-1970s. After an internal debate on whether the Army should continue to operate tanks as part of its force structure, the Australian Government replaced the Leopards with a small fleet of American M1A1 Abrams <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> 2007, which are now the Army's only <b>tanks.</b> <b>In</b> addition to these types, the Army has operated small numbers of other tank designs for training and evaluation purposes.|$|E
5|$|About 20 {{armoured}} vehicles, including tanks, {{were destroyed}} in the fighting. Before the conflict, Georgia possessed 230–240 <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> total.

After the end of hostilities, the Russian military seized a total of 65 Georgian tanks. 20 of those were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|An oil tanker's {{inert gas}} system {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parts of its design. Fuel oil itself is very difficult to ignite, but its hydrocarbon vapors are explosive when mixed with air in certain concentrations.

5|$|On 1 June 1941, the Red Army had 10,268 T-26 light {{tanks of}} all models on their inventories, {{including}} {{armoured combat vehicles}} based on the T-26 chassis. T-26s composed {{a majority of the}} fighting vehicles in Soviet mechanised corps of the border military districts. For instance, the Western Special Military District had 1,136 T-26 tanks on 22 June 1941 (52 percent of all <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> the district). The T-26 (mod. 1938/39, especially) could withstand most German <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> 1941 but were inferior to the Panzer III and Panzer IV participating in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and all of the Red Army's tank models suffered severe losses due to the air supremacy of the German Luftwaffe. The majority of the Red Army's T-26s were lost in the first months of the German-Soviet War, mainly to enemy artillery and air attacks. Many tanks broke down for technical reasons and lack of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} day, Grodno was finally cleared of Polish troops. The 27th Brigade had lost two burned and 12 damaged BT-7 light <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> the battle, some to Molotov cocktails thrown by the {{defenders}} from attics and trenches, and its casualties totaled 19 killed and 26 wounded. The 20th Brigade lost a BA-10 to Molotov cocktails, suffering casualties of 3 killed and 20 wounded. The 16th Rifle Corps' motorized detachment lost 25 killed, 110 wounded, and a burned tank. During the battle, the corps killed 320 officers, 20 non-commissioned officers, and 194 soldiers, {{many of whom}} were crushed by <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> {{the eastern part of the}} city. Between 20 and 21 September, they had captured 38 Polish officers, 20 non-commissioned officers, and 1,477 enlisted men, as well as 514 rifles, 146 machine guns, a mortar, and an anti-aircraft gun.|$|E

5|$|The Factory No. 174 {{produced}} {{its last}} T-26 <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> February 1941. After that, the factory began retooling {{to produce the}} new and much more complex T-50 light tank. This work was slowed by delays {{in the delivery of}} new equipment and series production of the T-50 did not begin on schedule (planned for 1 June 1941). As a result, factory management decided to resume the production of the T-26, using T-26 hulls, turrets, and other parts already in stock. About 47 T-26 tanks were assembled and 77 were repaired in July–August 1941 before the factory was relocated from Leningrad to Chelyabinsk in the end of August 1941, and then to Chkalov in September 1941. The Factory No. 174 produced engines and spare parts for the T-26, installed additional armour plates on some T-26s, replaced flame-throwers with 45mm tank guns in turrets of 130 KhT-133 flame-throwing tanks, repaired <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> army units (846 T-26s since the beginning of 1941) and mounted about 75 turrets from the T-26 and the T-50 as bunkers for the defence of Leningrad.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the wood}} {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 September 5, Lieutenant Colonel Rollins S. Emmerich, {{one of the}} ROK I Corps KMAG advisers, {{hastened to}} Yonil Airfield where he conferred with Lieutenant Colonel D. M. McMains, {{commanding}} the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry, stationed there, and informed him {{of the situation in}} P'ohang-dong. Emmerich obtained a platoon of tanks and returned with them to the town. He placed the <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> position and awaited the expected North Korean armored attack. At 05:30 he received information that elements of the ROK 22nd Regiment had retreated in the face of North Korean attack. North Korean troops entered this gap and just before 11:00 the American <b>tanks</b> <b>in</b> P'ohang-dong were under heavy North Korean machine gun fire. Five NK SU-76 self-propelled guns approached and began firing. At a range of one city block the US tanks knocked out the lead gun, killing its three crew members. In the ensuing exchange of fire the other four withdrew. Emmerich then directed air strikes and artillery fire which destroyed the other four guns. But that afternoon at 14:35 the order came to evacuate all materiel and supplies from the Yonil airstrip.|$|E
