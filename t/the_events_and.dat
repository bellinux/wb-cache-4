5|$|After {{the events}} of November 1, the Terminal and Traction Company hired 300 {{professional}} strikebreakers from the Pinkerton Agency in Chicago to operate the streetcars.

He wrote that if his workers could only get adequate police protection, they could resume normal operations.|$|E

5|$|The {{case had}} all the {{elements}} to ignite a fervent popular interest: the wicked squire and the poor girl, the iconic murder scene, the supernatural element of the stepmother's prophetic dreams, the detective work by Ayres and Lea (who later became detective Pharos Lee in stage versions of <b>the</b> <b>events),</b> <b>and</b> Corder's new life which {{was the result of}} a lonely hearts advertisement.

5|$|The date of Krishna's {{birth is}} celebrated every year as Janmashtami. According to mythologies in the Jain tradition, Krishna was {{a cousin of}} Neminatha, the 22nd Tirthankara of the Jains.

40|$|We {{introduce}} in {{this paper}} a formalism for representing flexible temporal causal relationships between <b>events</b> <b>and</b> their effects. A formal characterization of the so-called (most) General Temporal Constraint (GTC) is formulated, which guarantees the common-sense assertion that “the beginning of the effect cannot precede the beginning of its causal event”. It is shown that there are actually in total 8 possible temporal causal relationships which satisfy the GTC. These include cases where, (1) the effect becomes true immediately {{after the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>and</b> remains true for some time after the event; (2) the effect holds only over the same time over which <b>the</b> <b>event</b> is in progress; (3) the beginning of the effect coincides with the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>event,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> effect ends before <b>the</b> <b>event</b> completes; (4) <b>the</b> beginning of the effect coincides with the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>event,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> effect remains true for some time after the event; (5) the effect only holds over some time during the progress of the event; (6) the effect becomes true during the progress of <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>and</b> remains true until <b>the</b> <b>event</b> completes; (7) <b>the</b> effect becomes true during the progress of <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>and</b> remains true for some time after the event; and (8) where there is a time delay between <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>and</b> its effect. We shall demonstrate that the introduced formulation is versatile enough to subsume those existing representative formalisms in the literature...|$|R

5|$|At R. J. Reynolds' request, NASCAR began {{cutting down}} {{on the number of}} races in 1972 season by {{eliminating}} midweek races. It also dropped 13 short tracks and had a 31-race schedule. Pearson began racing for the Wood Brothers that season. He raced in 17 of <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> had six wins, which earned him a 20th-place finish in the season points. Pearson was racing against Bobby Isaac and Buddy Baker {{at the end of the}} Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway when Jimmy Crawford spun into Isaac; Pearson won the race. He won later that season at the Firecracker 400, a race that he would win three straight times.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the {{remainder}} of the series was under threat. Jardine was shaken by <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> by the hostile reactions to his team. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting the captain and his tactics. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E
5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E

5|$|Featuring {{a number}} of erudite characters, The Elegance of the Hedgehog is full of allusions to {{literary}} works, music, films, and paintings. It incorporates themes relating to philosophy, class consciousness, and personal conflict. <b>The</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> ideas of the novel are presented through the thoughts and reactions, interleaved throughout the novel, of two narrators, Renée and Paloma. The changes of narrator are marked by switches of typeface. In the case of Paloma, the narration {{takes the form of}} her written journal entries and other philosophical reflections; Renée's story is also told in the first person but more novelistically and in the present tense.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life, or as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E

The war room was located at 15, Rakabganj Road and kept track of 160 Lok Sabha constituencies where the party needed to boost its preparations. The Congress party initiated its election campaign in January 2014. It gave extra focus to the new middle class of India which was above the poverty line but not enough rich to be in middle class. This new economic class comprises 700 million people out of the country's total population of 1.2 billion. This class includes railway coolies, servants, rickshaw-pullers, labourers, fishermen, guards and other people who earn their living by doing minor chores.|$|E

5|$|In September 1998, {{four months}} after the fall of Suharto, the Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah {{declared}} that the film would no longer be compulsory viewing material, reasoning that it was an attempt to manipulate history and create a cult with Suharto in the centre. Tempo reported in 2012 that Saleh Basarah of the Air Force had influenced this decree. The magazine stated that Basarah had called the Education Minister Juwono Sudarsono and asked him to not screen Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI, as it was damaging to the Air Force. Two other films, Janur Kuning (Yellow Coconut Leaves; 1979) and Serangan Fajar, were likewise affected by the decree; Janur Kuning portrayed Suharto as the hero behind the 1 March 1949 General Assault while Serangan Fajar showed him as a major hero of the revolution. At the time it was suggested that TVRI was attempting to distance itself from the former president. This occurred in a period of desanctifying symbols related to <b>the</b> <b>events,</b> <b>and</b> by the early 2000s non-government versions of the G30S coup were easily available in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|In the 1979–80 European Cup, Linfield {{were drawn}} to face Dundalk from the Republic of Ireland. In the first leg, which was played in Dundalk and ended in a 1–1 draw, crowd {{disturbance}} prompted UEFA to switch the second leg to the Haarlem Stadion, Netherlands. Linfield were held almost entirely accountable for <b>the</b> <b>events,</b> <b>and</b> were forced to pay Dundalk's costs {{to travel to the}} Netherlands as well as an additional £5,000 for damage sustained to Oriel Park. Dundalk were fined £870 for providing insufficient security at the match. Dundalk eventually won the match 2–0 to progress 3–1 on aggregate. In the 1987–88 campaign, Linfield's home game against Lillestrøm was marred by missile throwing, resulting in UEFA sanctions which meant that the club had to play their next two home games in European competitions at Welsh club Wrexham in 1988–89 and 1989–90.|$|E
5|$|In the December 11, 1892 Sunday paper, Dunne wrote another dialect column, {{this time}} {{set in the}} upscale Dearborn Street saloon of Colonel Malachi McNeary (in all columns but the first spelled McNeery). That barkeeper was based on James McGarry, owner of a saloon near Chicago's {{newspaper}} district; Dunne and other journalists would drink there and write their stories. Beginning in the second McNeery column, the listener for his monologues is Johnny McKenna, a real-life figure, who was a Republican in a mostly Democratic Irish community, and who often received government jobs as a token of bipartisanship. The World's Columbian Exposition was the major event of 1893 in Chicago, and McNeery {{was used as a}} mouthpiece for Dunne's commentary on <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> sights of the fair. For example, McNeery views a meeting of the fair's Board of Lady Managers, chaired by Bertha Palmer, who in the column proves incapable of stopping an argument between the members.|$|E

5|$|Irataba {{lived through}} a tumultuous period of Mohave history {{where the people}} {{went from being a}} {{politically}} independent nation to coming under the political control of the United States, and the events surrounding his role in these encounters are well documented. Most historical sources for the life of Irataba come from descriptions by white explorers or government agents with whom he interacted, or from contemporary newspapers that reported on his visits to the East Coast and California, and on the conflicts in Arizona territory. Some Mohave versions of the events also exist: in the early 20th century anthropologist A. L. Kroeber interviewed Jo Nelson (Mohave: Chooksa homar), a Mohave man who participated in many of <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> knew Irataba personally; another version was told to ethnographer George Devereux by Irataba's granddaughter Tcatc, and versions recounted by members of the Fort Mohave band of Mohave, the descendants of Homoseh quahote, were recorded by ethnographer Lorraine Sherer during the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Lactantius' De Mortibus Persecutorum, a {{political}} Christian pamphlet on the reigns of Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, provides valuable but tendentious detail on Constantine's predecessors and early life. The ecclesiastical histories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret describe the ecclesiastic disputes of Constantine's later reign. Written {{during the reign}} of Theodosius II (408–50AD), a century after Constantine's reign, these ecclesiastic historians obscure <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> theologies of the Constantinian period through misdirection, misrepresentation and deliberate obscurity. The contemporary writings of the orthodox Christian Athanasius and the ecclesiastical history of the Arian Philostorgius also survive, though their biases are no less firm.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos left Constantinople for Adrianople, {{situated}} {{close to}} the Byzantine–Bulgarian border, in order to monitor <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> to exploit the situation in Bulgaria in his favour. The demise of Constantine Tikh {{came as a shock}} for the Byzantines. Initially, Michael VIII considered marrying his daughter to Ivaylo, but eventually decided that it would be more favourable to install a protégé of his own. His candidate was Ivan, son of former Emperor Mitso Asen, who had sought asylum in Byzantium and possessed estates in Asia Minor. Ivan promptly married Michael VIII's daughter Irene, pledged allegiance to Michael VIII and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria as Ivan Asen III. The Byzantines sent gifts to the Bulgarian nobles to incite them to support Ivan Asen III and envoys were dispatched to Tarnovo to arrange for his recognition and the surrender of Empress Maria. In the meantime, Ivan Asen III marched north {{at the head of a}} Byzantine army while Ivaylo was besieging Tarnovo.|$|E
