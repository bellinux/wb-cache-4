5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grammatical subject, creating {{a set of}} four verb subclasses. The {{distinction between the two}} genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E

5|$|Thomas {{originally}} wrote Veronica Mars as a {{young adult}} novel, featuring a male as the protagonist. He changed <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique. The original pilot script was darker in tone than the one filmed, and several details were changed. Although it ranked low in the ratings, the pilot was critically acclaimed and Bell's performance as the protagonist was praised.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences. These were still issues in 2014, and further {{compounded by the fact that}} the majority of animal studies also exclude females or fail to account for differences in sex and gender. for instance despite the higher incidence of depression amongst women, less than half of the animal studies use female animals. Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|Typologically, Erromintxela {{displays}} the same features as the Basque dialects it derives its grammatical structures from. Its case marking follows the ergative–absolutive pattern where {{the subject of}} an intransitive verb is in the absolutive case (which is unmarked), the same case being used for the direct object of a transitive verb. The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the ergative case. Similarly, auxiliary verbs agree with the subject and any direct object and indirect object present and verb forms are marked for allocutive (i.e. a marker is used to indicate <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> addressee).|$|E
40|$|The article {{comprehensively}} {{reviews the}} {{theoretical and empirical}} work on <b>gender</b> and <b>the</b> knowledge society and introduces <b>the</b> articles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special issue.

Using data from the Labour Force Survey, an original analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK knowledge economy is presented. It finds that <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knowledge economy makes a difference to its <b>gender</b> composition: <b>the</b> more centred on technology and fixed capital, the more masculine, the more centred on human capital, <b>the</b> more <b>gender</b> balanced. <b>The</b> knowledge economy provides better work and conditions. Gender gaps are narrower in the knowledge economy than the overall economy: occupational hierarchies are narrowed to women's advantage, while differences in work temporalities are narrowed to men's advantage...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to define the {{depression}} symptom levels and the mobbing executions’ levels they are subjected to according to <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> vocational high school students. <b>The</b> ranks <b>of</b> being subjected to mobbing and the depression levels are examined via <b>the</b> <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. According to the findings, there is a significant correlation between <b>the</b> <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students and being subjected to mobbing, but there is no statistical correlation between <b>genders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students and <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> depression symptoms.
