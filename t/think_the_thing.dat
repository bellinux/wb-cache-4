25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E

Snyder {{explained}} his {{reason for his}} casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> you realize {{when you look at}} Diane and Kevin, in our decision to cast them so far, you sort of {{get a sense of how}} tonally we're looking at the movie, and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E

She suggested the line-up {{at the time}} were [...] "melodically challenged". Reviewing the group's performance at Carols by Candlelight in December 2016, which served as the debut performance of most group members, David Knox of TV Tonight stated [...] "while it wasn’t a memorable first outing, perhaps they will find their place in a setting that showcases their talent". In 2017, Australian Minister for Communications Mitch Fifield jokingly expressed concern {{about the nature of the}} group which allows the membership to change over time, suggesting [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that should most worry parents is the ever-changing ensemble that makes up Hi-5".|$|E

500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> is that I {{have a lot of}} younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|The ninth {{season of}} the show was {{produced}} by Reveille Productions and Deedle-Dee Productions, both in association with Universal Television. The show {{is based on the}} British comedy series of the same name, which was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant for the BBC. In addition, the two are executive producers on the show. On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth season. Series developer Greg Daniels returned as showrunner this season. Daniels stated that the season would feature more big season arcs, saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs."

500|$|On May11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth {{season and}} it was later {{announced}} that Greg Daniels, {{who had been the}} series showrunner from season one through five, would be returning. [...] "New Guys" [...] was written and directed by Daniels. This is his first writing credit for the series since the seventh season entry, [...] "Goodbye, Michael", and his first directing credited since season seven's [...] "PDA". This also marks the third time he has both written and directed an episode, after the first season episode [...] "Basketball" [...] and the fourth season opener, [...] "Fun Run". Daniels later revealed that [...] "New Guys" [...] would be the inception of big season arcs. He went on the record saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs". Jenna Fischer later stated that part of the Jim and Pam arc would be dependent on [...] "things that happened in seasons past that didn't seem very relevant at the time and [...] they're going to become important this season." ...|$|E

Dunst Bruce lauded the K Foundation, concluding [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> KLF do are fantastic.

Although, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that changed {{everything}} was how quickly the ratings were off the charts. By spring, nine months into the show, we were No. 1 — and No. 1 in a big way — and we realized that no matter what we did, we weren’t going to get away from each other.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Todd and Marty's {{relationship}} became {{based on}} a psychiatrist/patient dynamic and not something physical. When asked if romance could be a possibility, Carlivati stated, [...] "I'd like to watch it unfold a beat at a time, a day at a time, {{a week at a}} time and not have the audience jump to, 'Are they going to kiss? Are they going to fall in love? Are they going to sleep together?' The goal is more to take these two characters who have an unbelievable, dark history with each other and explore where it would or could go if they didn't have that obstacle [...] the rape [...] between them." [...] However, Carlivati said that this obstacle would always be there and that the audience would see close moments. These close moments include Todd helping Marty walk and physical contact between the two while he nurses her back to health. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> about the two of them, the characters and the actors, is you feel a chemistry when they're just talking, so I don't necessarily categorize it as romantic," [...] stated Carlivati. [...] "They're definitely forming a relationship and it continues to grow and build through the fall." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Dark layers", and a nuanced {{personality}} of [...] "many different levels and shades" [...] attracted Akingbola to the role. Malick has a violent streak, and is introduced after hitting his former boss, though he becomes calmer with time. A February 2011 episode saw his composure {{threatened by a}} racist patient. Akingbola appreciated the storyline for highlighting the continuation of racism and prejudice: [...] "In this country, we can feel like there's no racism and it's like a lovely Benetton advert but it's still there – that's the truth." [...] He characterised Malick as [...] "not all bad", capable of becoming [...] "a nice guy", and expanded: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> with Malick is that he's young, confident and he speaks from the heart. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and I don't think there's many people like that on the ward! He doesn't care if what he says offends people, because that's what he believes. But he becomes a bit more sensitive." [...] Akingbola anticipated many [...] "twists and turns" [...] in Malick's storylines. He described him as having many secrets, and being a closed off person who [...] "keeps his cards very close to his chest." [...] Using the simile of an onion, he asserted that Malick's layers would be peeled back slowly, to reveal his [...] "wonderful heart".|$|E

2500|$|After Oscar Wao, Diaz {{began work}} on a second novel, a science-fiction epic with the working title Monstro. Diaz had {{previously}} attempted to write a science fiction novel twice prior to Oscar Wao, with earlier efforts in the genre [...] "Shadow of the Adept, a far-future novel in the vein of Gene Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer, and Dark America, an Akira-inspired post-apocalyptic nightmare" [...] remaining incomplete and unpublished. Part {{of the appeal of}} science fiction to Diaz, he explained in an interview with Wired, is that science fiction grapples with the idea of power in a manner other genres do not: [...] "I didn't see mainstream, literary, realistic fiction talking about power, talking about dictatorship, talking about the consequences of breeding people, which of course is something that in the Caribbean is never far away." [...] In an interview with New York Magazine prior to the release of This Is How You Lose Her, Diaz revealed that the work-in-progress novel concerns [...] "a 14-year-old 'Dominican York' girl who saves the planet from a full-blown apocalypse". but he also warned that the novel may never be completed: [...] "I'm only at {{the first part of the}} novel, so I haven't really gotten down to the eating," [...] he says, [...] "and I've got to eat a couple cities before I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> will really get going." [...] As of June 2015, the novel-in-progress appears to be abandoned– in a June 2015 interview for Words on a Wire, when asked about his progress on Monstro, Diaz said [...] "Yeah, I'm not writing that book anymore..." [...] Diaz's next book, Islandborn, is to be a children's book, due for publication in March 2018.|$|E
