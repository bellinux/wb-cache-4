25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are so excited to finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been lucky enough to have some amazing support shows... but to be able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E

60|$|Carl {{even took}} work home with him, though for Ruth's sake he wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play.</b> It really {{was for her}} sake; he himself liked to play, but the disease of {{perpetual}} overwork had hold of him. He {{was glad to have}} her desert him for an evening now and then and go out to the Peace Waters Country Club for a dance with Phil and Olive Dunleavy. She felt guilty when she came home and found him still making calculations. But she hummed waltzes while she put on a thin, blue silk dressing-gown and took down her hair.|$|E
6000|$|In the case, for example, of {{the child}} not allowed {{to go out into}} the yard, but {{required}} to remain in the house in sight of his mother, the mother should not try to make the punishment more heavy by speaking again and again of his fault, and evincing her displeasure by trying to make the confinement as irksome to the child as possible; but, on the other hand, should do all in her power to alleviate it. [...] "I am very sorry," [...] she might say, [...] "to have to keep you in the house. It would be much pleasanter for you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> in the yard, if it was only safe. I don't blame you very much for running away. It is what foolish little children, as little as you, very often do. I suppose you thought it would be good fun to run out a little way in the street. And it is good fun; but it is not safe. By-and-by, when you grow a little larger, you won't be so foolish, and then I can trust you in the yard at any time without having to watch you at all. And now what can I get for you to amuse you while you stay in the house with me?" ...|$|E

60|$|A new {{experience}} {{had come to}} the little wolf cubs in a single night,--the experience of fear. For weeks they had lain hid in the dark den, or played fearlessly in the bright sunshine, guarded and kept at every moment, day or night, by the gaunt old mother wolf that was their only law, their only companion. At times they lay for hours hungry and restless, longing {{to go out into the}} bright world, yet obeying a stronger will than their own, even at a distance. For, once a wild mother in her own dumb way has bidden her little ones lie still, they rarely stir from the spot, refusing even to be dragged away from the nest or den, knowing well the punishment in store if she return and find them absent. Moreover, it is useless to dissimulate, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> and then to be sleeping innocently with the cubs when the old wolf's shadow darkens the entrance. No concealment is possible from wolf's nose; before she enters the den the mother knows perfectly all that has happened since she went away. So the days glided by peacefully between sleep and play, the cubs trusting absolutely in the strength and tenderness that watched over them, the mother building the cubs' future on the foundation of the two instincts which are strong in every wild creature born into a world of danger,--the instinct to lie still and let nature's coloring hide all defenseless little ones, and the instinct to obey instantly a stronger will than their own.|$|E

50|$|Coach Herb Brooks: Coach Brooks is {{an iconic}} figure for his motivational speech before the 1980 {{championship}} {{game in which}} USA played a championship hockey game against the Soviets.

Brooks motivated his team <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> {{as if it was}} their night, as if they deserved this game.

50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1990s to early 2000s, video game {{trailers}} began to be produced as they became more mainstream. Used to entice viewers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> the game, game trailers are very useful. The content and production process {{is similar to that}} for movies, complicated by the need to convey the way the game plays. The trailer for Aliens: Colonial Marines, for example, featured graphics that were of a higher standard than the game that was eventually sold. Hideo Kojima, a game creator strongly influenced by Hollywood movies, edits the elaborate trailers for his own games from a special studio in his office.|$|E
