5|$|The {{system of}} {{education}} in Iceland is divided in four levels: playschool, compulsory, upper secondary and higher, and {{is similar to that}} of other Nordic countries.

5|$|Thelema is a {{rarely used}} in {{classical}} Greek. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> few documents, the earliest being Antiphon the Sophist (5th century BCE).

The intention of the individual was less understood as an overall, generalized, ontological place wherever it was arranged.|$|E
5|$|While {{the music}} {{industry}} has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are {{much less likely to}} have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra.

5|$|In some {{countries}} the monarch had {{little control over}} lords, or required {{the construction of new}} castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission– {{as was the case in}} England in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9thcentury. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the {{anthropomorphic}} form, Varaha {{often has}} a stylized boar face, like the zoomorphic models. The snout may be shorter. The position {{and size of}} the tusks may also be altered. The ears, cheeks and eyes are generally based on human ones. Early sculptors in Udayagiri and Eran faced the issue of how to attach the boar head to the human body and did not show a human neck. However, in Badami, the problem was resolved by including a human neck. While some sculptures show a mane, it is dropped and replaced by a high conical crown - typical of Vishnu iconography - in others. Varaha sculptures generally look up to the right; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> rare instances of left-facing Varaha depictions.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly...

On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E

5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{also consider the}} connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E
5|$|That Ouania is Govan is now {{reasonably}} certain, but {{the location}} of Newanbirig is less so. Although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> many Newburghs, it is Newburgh-on-Tyne near Hexham {{that has been the}} preferred location. An alternative interpretation of the events of 756 has been advanced: it identifies Newanbirig with Newborough by Lichfield in the kingdom of Mercia. A defeat here for Eadberht and Óengus by Æthelbald's Mercians would correspond with the claim in the Saint Andrews foundation legends that a king named Óengus son of Fergus founded the church there as a thanksgiving to Saint Andrew for saving him after a defeat in Mercia.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdown Hills have, since 1991, been {{designated}} as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). As {{they have the}} same landscape quality, AONBs may be compared to the national parks of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as the national parks: the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. However, National Parks, unlike AONBs, have their own authorities and have special legal powers to prevent unsympathetic development. By contrast, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> limited statutory duties imposed on local authorities within an AONB. Further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E

5|$|The Danish {{name is not}} unexpected; the {{language}} of the Ormulum, an East Midlands dialect, is stringently of the Danelaw (Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.174–75). It includes numerous Old Norse phrases (particularly doublets, where an English and Old Norse term are co-joined), but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> few Old French influences on Orm's language (Bennett 1986, p.33). Another—likely previous—East Midlands work, the Peterborough Chronicle, shows a great deal of French influence. The linguistic contrast between it and the work of Orm demonstrates both the sluggishness of the Norman influence in the formerly Danish areas of England and the assimilation of Old Norse features into early Middle English (Bennett 1986, pp.259–63).|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> few rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal {{that is difficult to}} fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.|$|E
5|$|The mansion {{itself was}} {{originally}} constructed as a Federal-style {{home by the}} prominent family of iron masters; an 1895 remodeling transformed the structure {{with the addition of}} Victorian features. The mansion is constructed of locally quarried red sandstone, as are the outbuildings, which at one time numbered nearly 30. The grounds is also notable for its pre-1840 American formal garden, of which <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> few surviving. The estate currently hosts the Mount Hope Estate and Winery, the Swashbuckler Brewing Company, the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire, and other events held throughout the year (see below).|$|E

5|$|The slender smooth-hound has a {{very thin}} body and a broad, highly {{flattened}} head. The snout is long, with a distinctive bell-shaped outline when viewed from above. The eyes have an elongate horizontal oval shape, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath each eye is a prominent ridge, and behind is a much smaller spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by small, almost triangular flaps of skin. The line of the mouth forms an angle; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> short furrows at the mouth corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 96–99 and 108–114 rows respectively of small, very closely spaced teeth; each tooth has a narrow upright central cusp flanked by smaller cusplets on both sides. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|The {{triploid}} {{onion is}} a hybrid species with {{three sets of}} chromosomes, two sets from A. cepa and the third set from an unknown parent. Various clones of the triploid onion are grown locally in different regions, such as 'Ljutika' in Croatia, and 'Pran', 'Poonch', and 'Srinagar' in the India-Kashmir region. 'Pran' is grown extensively in the northern Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> small genetic differences between 'Pran' and the Croatian clone 'Ljutika', implying a monophyletic origin for this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of the {{district}} in the Vale of York borders on and is drained by the River Derwent. The landscape is generally low-lying and flat although minor ridges and glacial moraines provide some variations in topography.

Arable fields dominate the land cover of the area and grasslands are infrequent. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> few flood meadows left, although some significant areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.|$|E
