500|$|In 1943, Lewis co-wrote Make <b>this</b> <b>Your</b> Canada with F. R. Scott, {{then the}} CCF's National Chairman. [...] The book's main {{argument}} was that national economic planning had proven itself during wartime with the King government's imposition of wage and price controls through the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. [...] Lewis and Scott further argued that its wartime success could translate to peacetime, and that Canada should adopt a mixed economy. [...] They {{also called for}} public ownership of key economic sectors, and for the burden {{to be placed on}} private companies to demonstrate that they could manage an industry more effectively in the private sector than the government could in the public sector. [...] The book also outlined the history of the CCF up to that time and explained the party's decision-making process. By Canadian standards, the book was popular, and sold over 25,000copies in its first year of publication.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the region}} around Medina, the Islamic capital, was recaptured, Khalid entered Nejd, a stronghold of the Banu Tamim tribes. Many of the clans hastened to visit Khalid and {{submit to the}} rule of the Caliphate. But the Banu Yarbu' tribe, under Sheikh Malik ibn Nuwayrah, hung back. Malik avoided direct contact with Khalid's army and ordered his {{followers}} to scatter, and he and his family apparently moved away across the desert. He also collected taxes and sent his men to Medina to deliver them. Nevertheless, Malik was accused of rebelling against the state of Medina and charged for entering into an anti-Caliphate alliance with Sajjah, a self-proclaimed prophetess. Malik was arrested along with his clansmen, and asked by Khalid about his crimes. Upon hearing Malik's response: [...] "your master said <b>this,</b> <b>your</b> master said that" [...] referring to Abu Bakr, Khalid declared Malik a rebel apostate and ordered his execution.|$|E

2500|$|With {{their fifth}} album, {{the group also}} had a No. 1 single, [...] "If You Tolerate <b>This</b> <b>Your</b> Children Will Be Next". [...] The song's theme is taken from the Spanish Civil War, and the idealism of Welsh volunteers who joined the left-wing International Brigades {{fighting}} for the Spanish Republic against Francisco Franco's military rebels. The song {{takes its name from}} a Republican poster of the time, displaying a photograph of a young child killed by the Nationalists under a sky of bombers with the stark warning [...] "If you tolerate <b>this,</b> <b>your</b> children will be next" [...] written at the bottom. An original of this poster can be seen at the Imperial War Museum, London, {{as well as at the}} Southworth Spanish Civil War Collection at the University of California, San Diego. The song is in the Guinness World Records as the number one single with the longest title without brackets.|$|E

Archbishop Warham of Canterbury invited Colet to make the speech. Colet's speech is both direct and insightful. It represents his work, or as Colet said himself, he is [...] "speaking out of zeal, a man sorrowing for the ruin of the Church". Furthermore, Colet stated that he came [...] "…here today, fathers, to admonish you with all your minds to deliberate, in <b>this</b> <b>your</b> Council, concerning the reformation of the Church".|$|E

They, like Roman Catholics and many Anglicans, see [...] and [...] as biblical evidence for confession. The first form of confession and absolution is {{done at the}} Divine Service with the assembled congregation (similar to the Anglican tradition). Here, the entire congregation pauses {{for a moment of}} silent confession, recites the confiteor, and receives God's forgiveness through the pastor as he says the following (or similar): [...] "Upon <b>this</b> <b>your</b> confession and in the stead and by the command of my Lord Jesus Christ, I forgive you all your sins {{in the name of the}} Father and of [...] the Son and of the Holy Spirit." ...|$|E

The Pope also recalled the [...] "invisible hand" [...] that saved John Paul II.

2500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Jacques de Molay cursed King Philip IV of France and his {{descendants}} from his execution pyre. However, {{the story of}} the shouted curse appears to be a combination of words by a different Templar, and those of Molay. An eyewitness to the execution stated that Molay had shown no sign of fear and had told those present that God would avenge their deaths. Another variation on this story was told by the contemporary chronicler Ferretto of Vicenza, who applied the idea to a Neapolitan Templar brought before Clement V, whom he denounced for his injustice. Some time later, {{as he was about to}} be executed, he appealed [...] "from <b>this</b> <b>your</b> heinous judgement to the living and true God, who is in Heaven", warning the Pope that, within a year and a day, he and Philip IV would be obliged to answer for their crimes in God's presence.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was {{involved}} in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo; Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan {{that he was going to}} have Jarrett lie down for him, simulating a real conflict, although Jarrett was not told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett lay down in the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, [...] "Is <b>this</b> <b>your</b> idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!" [...] After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, [...] "I can guarantee you that this is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!" [...] This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the [...] "creative control" [...] clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, [...] "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [...] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!". Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.|$|E
