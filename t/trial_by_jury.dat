5|$|Even {{after the}} initial {{production}} of <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury,</b> however, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring {{in the summer of}} 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s La Périchole, and La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein, Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot and Léon Vasseur's La Timbale d'argent), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (Happy Hampstead and <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury).</b> Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included W.H. Denny.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Carte {{became the}} {{business}} {{manager of the}} Royalty Theatre, {{under the direction of}} his client, the popular singing actress Madame Selina Dolaro. There he programmed Offenbach's La Périchole. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act comic opera that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury.</b> Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, Cox and Box, had been revived at the Gaiety Theatre in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create Thespis in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury.</b> Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time. <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury,</b> a comic treatment of an English courtroom, was an unexpected hit, outrunning La Périchole, and becoming the first step in Carte's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera.|$|E

5|$|Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera {{companies}} (of {{which there}} were often several playing simultaneously) usually programmed <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury</b> as a companion piece to The Sorcerer or H.M.S.

In the 1884–85 London production, a transformation scene was added at the end, in which the Judge and Plaintiff became the Harlequinade characters Harlequin and Columbine and the set was consumed by red fire and flames. From 1894, the year when the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company established a year-round touring company that had most of the Gilbert and Sullivan works in its repertory, <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury</b> was always included, except for 190103, and then again from 194346, when the company played a reduced repertory during World War II.

5|$|After {{the premiere}} of <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury</b> in 1875, {{operetta}} companies in London, the British provinces and elsewhere picked it up rapidly, usually playing it as a forepiece or an afterpiece to a French operetta. The first American productions were at the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia on 22 October 1875 and the Eagle Theatre in New York City on 15 November 1875. The world tour of the original British production took it to America, Australia, and elsewhere. It was even translated into German, and premièred as Im Schwurgericht, at the Carltheater on 14 September 1886, and as Das Brautpaar vor Gericht at Danzer's Orpheum on 5 October 1901.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury,</b> Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{managed the}} first tour of <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury,</b> which {{stopped at the}} Theatre Royal in Dublin, Ireland, in September 1875.

5|$|During the company's 1975 centennial {{performances}} of all thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan Operas at the Savoy Theatre, Trial was given four times, as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer, Pinafore and Pirates {{and as an}} afterpiece following The Grand Duke. Before {{the first of the}} four {{performances of}} Trial, a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Carte, Kenneth Sandford as Gilbert and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875. <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury</b> was eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Gilbert wrote a short {{libretto}} on commission from producer-conductor Carl Rosa, {{whose wife}} would {{have played the}} leading role, but her death in childbirth cancelled the project. Not long afterwards, Richard D'Oyly Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury</b> was composed and staged {{in a matter of}} weeks.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury,</b> there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E

The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Richard D'Oyly Carte, who {{was then}} {{managing}} the Royalty Theatre for Selina Dolaro, brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to write their second show, a one-act opera entitled <b>Trial</b> <b>by</b> <b>Jury.</b> This proved a success, and in 1876 D'Oyly Carte assembled a group of financial backers to establish the Comedy Opera Company, which was devoted to the production and promotion of family-friendly English comic opera. With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera. This next opera was The Sorcerer, which opened in November 1877. It too was successful, running for 178performances. Sheet music from the show sold well, and street musicians played the melodies.|$|E
