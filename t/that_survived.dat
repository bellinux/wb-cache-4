5|$|As {{part of the}} Mycenaean {{heritage}} <b>that</b> <b>survived,</b> {{the names}} of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity.

5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened {{due to the}} Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{the demand}} for metal for the war effort {{resulted}} in many bells being melted down for scrap. As a result, those <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> are generally regarded as important historic artifacts. More than 70,000 bells (approximately 90 per cent of the bonshō then in existence) were destroyed in this way. However, rapid production of bells during the post-war period meant that by 1995 the number of temple bells in Japan had returned to pre-war levels.|$|E

5|$|Each {{mission has}} a timed {{duration}} that the player must beat, with two tiers of time bonus. The player is rewarded with space credits {{dependent on the}} amount of cargo <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> the mission and how quickly they completed it. Reputation, displayed as stars, is rewarded based whether or not the player met cargo or time thresholds. Space credits are used between missions in order to purchase special abilities and bonuses for modules, while gaining reputation unlocks new modules.|$|E
5|$|In Apra Harbor, ten ships or tugs were sunk, as were {{numerous}} smaller vessels. One {{of the ships}} <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> in the harbor was the cutter Basswood of the Coast Guard, which recorded a wind gust of 220km/h (140mph). Pamela's damage prevented regular flights {{in and out of}} the island.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005 BBC Worldwide {{released}} a DVD box set {{of all their}} existing Quatermass material.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the idea that}} rational players should not play iteratively weakly dominated strategies by showing that when {{a particular type of}} adaptive learning process converges, then players must have learned to play strategy profiles equivalent to those <b>that</b> <b>survive</b> iterated nice weak dominance and, for certain games, equivalent to those <b>that</b> <b>survive</b> iterated weak dominance. For games satisfying the weak single crossing condition, the set of strategies <b>that</b> <b>survive</b> iterated weak dominance is small in that its bounds are pure strategy Nash equilibria. The results hold regardless of the order in which dominated strategies are eliminated...|$|R

5|$|In {{colonies of}} the paper wasp, Polistes chinensis antennalis, workers can lay up to {{a quarter of the}} male eggs in the colony. The number of eggs <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> to hatching, however, was minimal {{compared}} to the number produced by the queen. Analysis of the microsatellite markers showed that both queens and workers contributed to policing of worker and queen-laid eggs even in monogynous and monandrous colonies.|$|E
5|$|The Paleo-Indians <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> are {{now known}} as the Archaic peoples of the Florida peninsula. They lived on after the {{extinction}} of most big game and were primarily hunter-gatherers who depended on smaller game and fish. They relied on plants for food more than their ancestors. They were able to adapt to the shifting climate and the resulting change of animal and plant populations.|$|E
5|$|To {{supplement}} their incomes, the rangers trapped predators such as coyote, fox, lynx, mountain lion, and wolverine for their furs, a practice <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> until 1925. Predator control continued however; 43mountain lions {{were killed in}} Yosemite by the state lion hunter in 1927. Cooper's hawk and sharp-shinned hawk were hunted to local extinction.|$|E

5|$|Both Calakmul and Tikal were {{sizeable}} Preclassic cities <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> {{into the}} Classic Period. Early hieroglyphic texts from stelae found in Structure 2 record the probable enthronement {{of a king}} of Calakmul in AD 411 and also records a non-royal site ruler in 514. After this there is {{a gap in the}} hieroglyphic records that lasts over a century, although the Kaan dynasty experienced a major expansion of its power at this time. The lack of inscriptions recording the events of this period may be either {{due to the fact that}} the Kaan dynasty was located elsewhere during this time or perhaps that the monuments were later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|However, much of {{the blame}} for the decay and ruinous state of {{preservation}} of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, but the political agendas of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. Those <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E
5|$|If {{the green}} parrots Leguat {{referred}} to {{were not the}} Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodericanus), they might perhaps have been a green colour morph of Newton's parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested. As A. Newton observed in his original description, some feathers of the female specimen display both blue and green tinges, depending on the light. This may {{explain some of the}} discrepancies. The green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of Psittacula species from other islands, <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> on Rodrigues for a short time.|$|E

5|$|In January 1945, {{the handful}} of naval {{personnel}} <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> were transferred to the 32nd SS Volunteer Grenadier Division 30 Januar, and {{the remnants of the}} former division were reorganized as II Battalion of the 14th SS Volunteer Mountain Infantry Regiment of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. On 21 January 1945, Schmidhuber was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS (brigadier) and placed in command of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. After the war, he was found guilty of war crimes and hanged. In February 1945, the battalion was disbanded altogether and its remaining manpower was assigned to the German police regiment near Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|In early 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} two planets orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257+12. This discovery was confirmed, and is {{generally considered to be}} the first definitive detection of exoplanets. These pulsar planets are believed to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of giant planets <b>that</b> <b>survived</b> the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits.|$|E
5|$|Numerous notable and {{prominent}} {{people of the}} era, who held tickets for the westbound passage or were guests of those who held tickets, did not sail.

Many unused tickets <b>that</b> <b>survived,</b> whether they were for the westbound passage or the return eastbound passage, have become quite valuable as Titanic-related artifacts. Among those who held tickets for a passage, but did not actually sail, include: Theodore Dreiser, Henry Clay Frick, Milton S. Hershey, Guglielmo Marconi, John Pierpont Morgan, Edgar Selwyn, and Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt (who died in {{the sinking of the}} RMS Lusitania).|$|E
