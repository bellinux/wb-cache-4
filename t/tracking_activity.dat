Examples where this problem arises include, among others, appearance–based multi–frame <b>tracking,</b> <b>activity</b> recognition from video and dynamic texture analysis/synthesis. Our main result is a semi-definite programming based manifold embedding algorithm that exploits the dynamical information encapsulated in the temporal ordering of the sequence to obtain embeddings with lower complexity that those produced by existing algorithms, at a comparable computational cost. In addition, the use of spatio-temporal information allows for minimizing the effects of outliers on the manifold structure and for handling fragmented sequences, {{where some of the}} data is missing, for instance due to occlusion. 1...|$|E

Human performance within our environments during large amplitude 3 D tracking was assessed by objective and subjective methods in the presence and absence of these defects. Results show that 1) removal of our relatively small spatial sensor distortion had minor effects on the <b>tracking</b> <b>activity,</b> 2) an Adapted Cooper-Harper controllability scale proved the most sensitive subjective indicator of the degradation of dynamic fidelity caused by increasing latency and decreasing frame rates, and 3) performance, as measured by normalized RMS tracking error or subjective impressions, was more markedly influenced by changing visual latency than by update rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of wireless localization technologies provides a promising future for serving {{human beings in}} indoor scenarios. Their applications include real-time <b>tracking,</b> <b>activity</b> recognition, health care, navigation, emergence detection, and target-of-interest monitoring, among others. Additionally, indoor localization technologies address the inefficiency of GPS (Global Positioning System) inside buildings. Since people {{spend most of their}} time in indoor environments, indoor tracking service is in great public demand. Based on this observation, this paper aims to provide a better understanding of state-of-the-art technologies and stimulate new research efforts in this field. For these purposes, existing localization technologies that can be used for tracking individuals in indoor environments are reviewed, along with some further discussions.

40|$|Abstract: Traceability and <b>tracking</b> <b>activity</b> are {{increasing}} significantly, since underlying technology such as GPRS/UMTS and satellite positioning is mature {{and ready for}} widespread market traceability solutions. This paper focuses on the roll-out of the Cold-Trace solution by Disfrimur, a leading transport company based in Spain. Cold-Trace is a unique, integrated solution based on mobile communications that helps in quality control, traceability and efficiency in the refrigerated transportation industry. It consists in a management tool on board trucks that collects and processes information from a set of sensors distributed throughout the vehicle, and offers an easy-to-use software application that allows truck drivers to manage all administrative tasks performed during the trip. Thanks to Cold-Trace, communication at Disfrimur between fleet managers and truck drivers has improved dramatically, therefore boosting efficiency in execution of their daily tasks. In addition, Cold-Trace is having significant impact on Disfrimur customers (supermarket chains) and consumers in general. 1...|$|E

40|$|A common video {{surveillance}} {{task is to}} keep track of people moving around the space being monitored. It is often difficult to track activity between cameras because locations such as hallways in office buildings can look quite similar and do not indicate the spatial proximity of the cameras. We describe a spatial video player that orients nearby video feeds with the field of view of the main playing video to aid in tracking between cameras. This is compared with the traditional bank of cameras with and without interactive maps for identifying and selecting cameras. We additionally explore the value of static and rotating maps for <b>tracking</b> <b>activity</b> between cameras. The study results show that both the spatial video player and the map improve user performance when compared to the camera-bank interface. Also, subjects change cameras more often with the spatial player than either the camera bank or the map, when available. Author Keywords Video surveillance, activity tracking, multiple vide...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a wind tracker (MOKHTAR 1) with implementation of Zigzag and Spiral algorithms for detecting the wind source. For odor tracking research the Wind tracking is important. A novel wind flow and direction sensor based on an array of Evaporative Heat Rejection Devices (EHRD) {{such as the ones}} used in cooling towers is developed during the present work. The developed sensor is installed on the wind tracker (MOKHTAR). MOKHTAR seeks the location of the wind source with Zig-Zag and Spiral tracking algorithms. Both the Zig Zag and Spiral algorithms are implemented and their performance is compared with respect to step size, time taken and the probability of reaching the wind source. Finally, results of path monitoring for comparison between the two algorithms are shown. The proposed system is used on a robot vehicle as the initial stage of plume <b>tracking</b> <b>activity.</b> Moreover, the proposed wind sensor array can be used in the meteorological and environmental studie...|$|E
40|$|Video {{surveillance}} {{currently is}} one of the most active research topics in public safety and security, in which foreground ex-traction is important and fundamental for further processing, such as target <b>tracking,</b> <b>activity</b> recognition, and behavior pre-diction. In this paper, by assuming the background is high-ly correlated across different frames, we propose to separate foregrounds via speeded up low rank matrix recovery. The proposed method first shrinks the scale of data to roughly catch outliers (foregrounds) of the background. Based on the outliers, we design a sampling strategy that selects a num-ber of frames to construct the low rank model of background. According to the constructed background model, our method further recovers both the background and the foreground for the rest frames in a reconstruction manner. Experimental re-sults on both simulated and real data demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach compared to the state of the arts, in terms of accuracy and efficiency...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} scenarios {{in which}} we wish to perform joint scene understanding, object <b>tracking,</b> <b>activity</b> recognition, and other tasks in environments in which multiple people are wearing body-worn cameras while a third-person static camera also captures the scene. To do this, we need to establish person-level correspondences across first- and third-person videos, which is challenging because the camera wearer is not visible from his/her own egocentric video, preventing the use of direct feature matching. In this paper, we propose a new semi-Siamese Convolutional Neural Network architecture to address this novel challenge. We formulate the problem as learning a joint embedding space for first- and third-person videos that considers both spatial- and motion-domain cues. A new triplet loss function is designed to minimize the distance between correct first- and third-person matches while maximizing the distance between incorrect ones. This end-to-end approach performs significantly better than several baselines, in part by learning the first- and third-person features optimized for matching jointly with the distance measure itself...|$|E

40|$|SummaryTo ensure equal {{chromosome}} segregation during mitosis, the macromolecular kinetochore must remain attached to depolymerizing microtubules, which drive chromosome movements. How kinetochores associate with depolymerizing microtubules, which undergo dramatic structural changes forming curved protofilaments, {{has yet to}} be defined in vertebrates. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved kinetochore-localized Ska 1 complex tracks with depolymerizing microtubule ends and associates with both the microtubule lattice and curved protofilaments. In contrast, the Ndc 80 complex, a central player in the kinetochore-microtubule interface, binds only to the straight microtubule lattice and lacks <b>tracking</b> <b>activity.</b> We demonstrate that the Ska 1 complex imparts its tracking capability to the Ndc 80 complex. Finally, we present a structure of the Ska 1 microtubule-binding domain that reveals its interaction with microtubules and its regulation by Aurora B. This work defines an integrated kinetochore-microtubule interface formed by the Ska 1 and Ndc 80 complexes that associates with depolymerizing microtubules, potentially by interacting with curved microtubule protofilaments...|$|E
