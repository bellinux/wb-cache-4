It is also possible to use code coverage tools by using sbt plugins such as scoverage or jacoco4sbt.|$|R
40|$|Scala {{provides}} an actor library where computation entities, called actors, communicate by exchanging messages. The schedule of message exchanges is in general nondeterministic. Testing non-deterministic programs is hard, {{because it is}} necessary to ensure that the system under test has executed all important schedules. Setac is our proposed framework <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>Scala</b> actors that (1) allows programmers to specify constraints on schedules and (2) makes it easy to check test assertions that require actors to be in a stable state. Setac requires little change to the program under test and requires no change to the actor run-time system. In sum, Setac aims to make it much simpler to test nondeterministic actor programs in Scala...|$|R

Dependent types, higher-order functions and implicit conversions bring new ideas and challenges when implementing code refactoring.

40|$|Objective:To assess current {{surgical}} techniques <b>for</b> <b>scala</b> tympani cochlear implantation among North Amer-ican surgeons. Material: A {{survey was}} distributed to all cochlear implant surgeons {{participating in the}} 2006 William House Cochlear Implant Study Group in Toronto, Can-ada. Participants were asked to anonymously identify their routine surgical practices. Images of trans-facial recess approaches to the round window and cochlear promontory were used in a multiple-choice fashion to assess the surgeon’s typical exposure and cochleostomy location. Returned questionnaires were electronically processed and evaluated. Results: Fifty-five (75 %) of 73 returned surveys had adequate data validity and availability. Landmark iden-tification and preferred cochleostomy locations varied greatly. About 20 % of surgeons selected cochleostomy lo-cations superior to the round window membrane. Co-chleostomy size and location appeared {{to be influenced by}} surgical experience and whether or not the round window overhang was drilled off. Conclusion:This survey clearly documentsmarked variations in surgical techniques <b>for</b> <b>scala</b> tympani cochlear implantation. Future studies should more clearly define the surgical anatomy of this region for appropriate placement of a scala tympani cochleostomy. These findingsmay ultimately have an impact on hearing and neural preservation cochlear implant surgeries...|$|R
