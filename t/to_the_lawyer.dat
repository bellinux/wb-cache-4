Eventually a few socialist lectures did come and Spargo made the acquaintance of many leading radicals in the city, including Christian Socialist George D. Herron, Job Harriman, and Algernon Lee. Spargo cast his lot with the dissident (and newly independent wing of the Socialist Labor Party headed by Henry Slobodin and Morris Hillquit), teaching at a SLP education center in Brooklyn, and working as an assistant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> Hillquit.|$|E
25|$|Webster {{attended}} Phillips Exeter Academy, a preparatory {{school in}} Exeter, New Hampshire, before attending Dartmouth College. He was chosen Fourth of July orator in Hanover, the college town, in 1800, {{and in his}} speech appears {{the substance of the}} political principles for the development of which he became famous. After he graduated from Dartmouth (Phi Beta Kappa), Webster was apprenticed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> Thomas W. Thompson in Salisbury. When his older brother Ezekiel's studies required Webster's support, the young man resigned from the law office and worked as a schoolteacher– as young men often did then, when public education consisted largely of subsidies to local schoolmasters. In 1802 Webster began as the headmaster of the Fryeburg Academy, Maine, where he served for one year. When Ezekiel's education could no longer be sustained, Webster returned to his apprenticeship.|$|E

500|$|A Dream Play is {{positioned}} at the median of Strindberg's series of portrayals {{of his own}} marriage, the Bosse role imbued with both light and darkness. With its associative dream structure, this play is a milestone of modernist drama, described by Strindberg as a lawless reflection of The Dreamer's (Strindberg's) consciousness, limited only by his imagination which [...] "spins and weaves new patterns… on an insignificant basis of reality". Agnes, played by and representing Bosse, {{is the daughter of}} the Vedic god Indra, descending to earth to observe human life and bring its disappointments to the attention of her divine father. [...] The [...] "Oriental" [...] aspect of the play is based on Bosse's dark, exotic looks. [...] Yet she is also drawn into mere humanity and into a claustrophobic marriage <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lawyer,</b> one of the versions of The Dreamer and, thereby, of Strindberg. [...] Shut up indoors by a possessive husband, Agnes can not breathe; she despondently watches the servant working to exclude light and air from the house by pasting insulating strips of paper along the windows' edges. Recognizably, the [...] "insignificant basis of reality" [...] of Agnes' marriage <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lawyer</b> is the frustration of the newly married Bosse, yearning for fresh air, sunshine, and travel but fobbed off with a Baedeker.|$|E
500|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> {{representing}} Slee's estate, Gerald Ragland, Slee had [...] "dropped {{dead from}} the stress {{associated with the}} program". Ragland, a specialist in lawsuits dealing with claims related to psychological trauma from encounter groups, noted that though autopsies cannot specifically test for death caused by stress, circumstantial {{evidence in the case}} would show this occurred with regard to Slee. Ragland further stated that Slee was pressured into taking the course, that he endured mind control that reduced his capacity for mental defense, and that est trainers prevented medical professionals from quickly gaining access to his body.|$|E
500|$|There are 66 letters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> Daines Barrington [...] (1727–1800), occupying {{half the}} book. Letter 1, on summer birds of passage, is dated 30 June 1769; Letter 66, on thunderstorms, is dated 25 June 1787. The Barrington letters {{therefore}} largely overlap {{the time frame}} of those to Pennant, but began and ended somewhat later. It was Barrington who suggested to White that he should write a book from his observations; although Pennant had been corresponding with White for a while, he was relying on White for natural history information for his own books, and, suggests White's biographer Richard Mabey, must have wanted White as a continuing source of information, not as a rival author. Barrington, on the other hand, liked to theorize about the natural world, but {{had little interest in}} making observations himself, and tended to accept claimed facts uncritically.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an ethnographic {{exploration}} of the lawyer–client relationship focusing on the attitudes held by legally aided lawyers to their criminal clients. The study combines formal interviews with participant observation in a mixed methodology approach designed to give voice <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> taking part as well as allow <b>the</b> researcher <b>to</b> provide their own perspective. The research produced two quite contradictory viewpoints as lawyers claimed to hold positive attitudes of their clients in interview while presenting negative attitudes under observation.
