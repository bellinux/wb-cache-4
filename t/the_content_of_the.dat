5|$|As was {{the case}} with many of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was {{completed}} in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections to <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.|$|E
5|$|At first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet {{diplomatic}} {{hints that}} Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler authorised Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August; and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty {{is known as}} the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it was Stalin and Hitler, and not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treaty.|$|E

5|$|Crawford {{announced}} {{his plans for}} a sequel, Frog Fractions 2, via a Kickstarter campaign in March 2014, with a planned release in 2015. The campaign included a number of elements that pointed players towards a larger alternate reality game (ARG) that incorporated a number of web sites, social media accounts, real-life locations, and around two dozen independent video games. The ARG was solved by players around December 2016, discovering a physical box that triggered the release of Frog Fractions 2, hidden within <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> video game Glittermitten Grove.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Slayer {{released}} Divine Intervention, the band's {{first record}} with drummer Bostaph. The album featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an {{architect of the}} Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils of church, and the lengths to which governments will go to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much of <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lyrics.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, {{and that he had}} only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{screening}} came a {{month after}} the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) aired the first episode of television sitcom Citizen Khan.

The BBC received 200complaints regarding <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode, including accusations that it perpetuated stereotypes about British Asians, ridiculed Islam and disrespected the Qur'an; some of these criticisms would be echoed in the furore regarding Holland's documentary.|$|E

5|$|The {{libraries}} of Europe contain many medieval {{copies of}} ancient Greek and Latin texts. Many of these contain short notes or 'subscriptions' {{on the final}} page that, in hundreds of cases, give {{the total number of}} lines in the work. In texts of classical authors such as Herodotus and Demosthenes, these totals are expressed in the older, acrophonic numerals that were used in Athens during the classical period but abandoned sometime during the Hellenistic period. Thus these stichometric totals are thought to descend, along with <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> texts, from very early editions.|$|E

The music video had several references to horror films and featured extensive horror imagery, with zombies, decapitated corpses and heavily atmospheric cinematography.

5|$|When Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) {{bought the}} paper in 2006, Brian P. Tierney and the {{business}} people behind PMH signed a pledge promising {{that they would not}} influence <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper. Tierney, a Republican activist who had represented many local groups in the Philadelphia area, had criticized The Inquirer in the past on behalf of his clients. One of Tierney's clients had been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented during the Cipriano affair. PMH membership also included Bruce E. Toll, vice chairman of Toll Brothers Inc. Tierney said that the group was aware that the fastest way to ruin its investment in The Inquirer was to threaten the paper's editorial independence. The 2012 sale of Philadelphia Media Network to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest. The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser George Norcross III, media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz, and CEO of Liberty Property Trust and chairman of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce William Hankowsky, pledged not to influence <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper.|$|E
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E

In the video, scenes of Lewis performing {{in front of a}} heart engulfed in flames and sitting on an apartment floor barefoot are intercut. In the United States, Lewis performed the song live on the Late Show with David Letterman, whilst in the United Kingdom, she performed on multiple television shows, including So You Think You Can Dance, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The National Lottery Draws. It was included on the set list of her debut tour, The Labyrinth (2010).|$|E
5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied {{to each of the}} recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the slow}} start, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light proved {{enough of a}} success that a new game was commissioned. This would become Fire Emblem Gaiden, which {{released}} in 1992.

It would release internationally under the title , marking the first time <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Fire Emblem was made available outside Japan.
