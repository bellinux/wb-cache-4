5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{emergence}} of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of Calypso, and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of your answer was: That many people exhort others to charity from self-interest; that men of fortune must mind their fortune; that you cannot go about {{to look for}} poor people; <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen them your-self, and relieved them, they were scarce ever satisfied; that many make an ill use of what you give them; that you cannot trust the account people give of themselves by letters; that nevertheless you do give to private persons by the hands of Colonel Hudson and others; that you have also given to several hospitals an hundred pounds at a time, but that you must support your family; that the Lowther family has continued above four hundred years; that you are for great things -- for public charities and for saving the nation from ruin; and that others may think as they please, but this is your way of thinking, {{and has been for}} many years...|$|E

500|$|Kim Newman and Alan Jones {{suggest that}} the mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle, Rex Stout and Agatha Christie were all obvious {{influences}} on Tenebrae, {{and there are many}} references to these authors throughout the film. One example is the use of a quote from Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's novel The Sign of Four (1890): [...] "How often have I said to you <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" [...] A variation of this quote is delivered many times in Tenebrae. Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a non sequitur, the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–1902). Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene. The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to Elizabeth Taylor in that film.|$|E
500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{was nothing}} done {{in there to}} stop anyone from asking questions", Fishman said. [...] "It's {{important}} <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{that many people in}} the room who may not be familiar with the Israeli–Palestinian situation, those people have the opportunity also to hear those areas that are questionable in the book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I think <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> {{had to do}} so somehow, my dear, {{but that}} is not the {{question}} now. My plan was <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> succeeded in doing this you should marry him and go home with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't work, Professor," [...] he said. [...] "I'm proof against assassins. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>had</b> an idea <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{killed me}} <b>you</b> could rob {{me of my}} {{valuable}} possessions; but they wouldn't be a particle of use to a scoundrel like you, I assure you! Good morning." ...|$|R
60|$|It is not unlikely, moreover, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{got over}} the first shock of finding your hands so {{unexpectedly}} large and red, you felt disposed to chat with the young lady who looked after that branch of the business. In your genial way <b>you</b> may <b>have</b> permitted a note of gay (but gentlemanly) badinage to creep into your end of the dialogue.|$|R
2500|$|President Richard Nixon did not {{publicly}} {{comment about the}} decision. In private conversation later revealed {{as part of the}} Nixon tapes, Nixon said [...] "There are times when an abortion is necessary, I know <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a black and a white" [...] (a reference to interracial pregnancies) [...] "or a rape." [...] However, Nixon was also concerned that greater access to abortions would foster [...] "permissiveness," [...] and said that [...] "it breaks the family." ...|$|E
2500|$|Now that we {{are talking}} about {{literary}} subjects I ask you if you know a great writer, Rafael Barrett, with a free and bold spirit. With tears in my eyes and on my knees I beg you <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a national or two to spend, go straight to Mendesky's, or any other library- and ask for a copy of [...] "Looking the life" [...] of this author. I think that it was published in Montevideo. Is a great book, and reading it soothed me from the foolishness of Giusti, Soiza, O'Reilly and my cousin Alvarito Melián Lafinur.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{communities}} in widespread areas across the United States are aggressively targeting dog fighting by coordinating {{local and regional}} dog fighting task forces. [...] "It's clear <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> dogfighting, drugs and gambling and other criminal subcultures follow," [...] according to Mark Plowden, {{a spokesman for the}} South Carolina Attorney General's Office, which in 2004 created a dogfighting task force. In Chicago, Illinois, a special police unit is devoted to investigating cases of abuse due to the connection between dog fighting and other gang crimes. In 2005, the police in Los Angeles, California formed an Animal Cruelty Task Force, leading to prosecutions of gang members there for animal abuse.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come, Berenger, {{this will}} not serve,' said his mother, trying to rouse and cheer him. 'You should rather be thankful <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been so foully ensnared by their wiles, good Osbert brought you off with your life away from those bloody doings. Yes, you may thank Heaven and Osbert, for {{you are the only}} one of them living now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why did I {{ever see}} you at all? Why did my father treat you as a son; <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> grown and got strong on his {{kindness}} you could thus insult his daughter in the darkest hour of her pain and her shame!' She almost choked with passion. There was now nothing {{in the whole world}} that she could trust. In the pause he spoke: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Forester. [...] "Suppose, for instance, <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> caught your fish, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> said, 'There, Jeremiah, {{that fish}} is yours; {{he was coming}} up to your hook, and would have bitten at it if I had not put my line in;' and, then, if Jeremiah had said, 'No, it is not mine; it is yours, for you caught it with your hook;' {{this would have been}} a {{friendly}} dispute. It would have been very easily settled." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Keys {{equation}} {{predicts the}} effect of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet on serum cholesterol levels. Keys found that saturated fats increase total and LDL cholesterol {{twice as much as}} polyunsaturated fats lower them.hope <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> read this book I shall have convinced you that sugar is really dangerous." [...] This message was extremely unwelcome to the sugar industry and manufacturers of processed foods and these firms employed a number of methods to impede Yudkin's work. The final Chapter of Pure, White and Deadly lists several examples of attempts to interfere with the funding of his research and to prevent its publication. It also refers to the rancorous language and personal smears used by Ancel Keys to dismiss the evidence that sugar was the true culprit.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a lovely}} stone floor!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "And your copper kettle, too, is delightful! Do you mean <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not a lodger here, you cook and do {{everything}} for yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Serious! a quoi bon? I am serious--serious in my {{surprise}} <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> had either of these women, <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> preferred that hideous wife of yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is enough," [...] Colonel de Serres said, {{stepping}} forward; [...] "you <b>have</b> {{done what}} <b>you</b> {{thought to be}} your duty, Monsieur le Comte, but it needs very different blades from those of yourself and your companions to stand before Colonel Campbell. He <b>had</b> <b>you</b> at his mercy, and {{had a right to}} take your life if he chose; but as he refrained from doing <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> your sword in your hand, he certainly will not do so now. Messieurs, we wish you good morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But <b>that</b> was <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{nobody to}} take care of her,' she said quickly. 'How absurd of him to write now! Does he know you are married? He must, surely.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sire," [...] read on Hugh, [...] "I {{ask your}} royal pardon to Hugh de Cressi and Richard the Archer for these slayings, believing <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> read these letters {{it will be}} granted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One has to," [...] the lad said, [...] "everyone {{else does}} it; {{and there is}} no doubt <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got the middle watch on cold nights with foul winds, it is a comfort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And yet you won't do {{anything}} for us? You ain't above taking all our money and seeing us starve; and <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got everything round you here like an estated gentleman, as you are?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] Aaron murmured thoughtfully. [...] "I used {{to think}} of you {{travelling}} {{from one to the}} other of the great cities, and I {{used to think}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> spoken to them, the people would see the truth and rise and take their own. I used to be very fond of the Old Testament once," [...] he went on, his voice sinking a little lower. [...] "Life was so simple in those days, and the words of a prophet seemed greater than any laws." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} what <b>you</b> said <b>that</b> night, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to hold <b>that</b> poor man in his delirium, and his wife was so wild with fright {{that she could not}} help?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You don't {{mean to say}} {{you walked}} here!' said Mrs Griffith, as she shut the front door. 'Fancy <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> could <b>have</b> all the {{carriages}} in Blackstable to drive you about!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You desire porters," [...] she {{repeated}} meditatively. [...] "We will talk of <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> rested here a moon or two. Meanwhile, give me Little Bonsa {{that she may}} be restored to her own place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So be it, Sister Medliker," [...] said Staples, {{drawing a}} long, {{satisfactory}} breath; [...] "and let us trust <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> rastled with his flesh and spirit, you {{will bring us}} joyful tidings to Wednesday's Mother's Meeting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] I replied, in {{a calming}} voice, and bending forward, [...] "I humbly {{acknowledge}} {{to being the}} unfortunate cause of it. But I hope, sir, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> heard the circumstances explained, and the innocence of my intentions--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Consent, or he dies,' they said, {{and for my}} love's sake I consented. This was the plot, Olfan: {{to marry}} me to you, partly because the woman yonder, who was my nurse, did not desire my death, and partly that Nam might use me to save himself from the anger of the people. But {{do not think that}} <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> kept me long, Olfan; for this was in the plot also, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> served their purpose you should die by secret means, as one who knew too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know because}} I am a villain, sir. I am {{not worthy of}} your kindness. I told you so. I found the book, sir, <b>that</b> night, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> too much wine at Barbeau's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do not {{understand}} a man like Wingrave," [...] she declared. [...] "Nothing {{that he has done}} is inconsistent with my point of view. He gave you a safe tip, knowing very well <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> won a little, you would try again on your own account and lose--which you did.
