She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Protestant missionaries {{on a large}} scale {{beginning}} in 1814 was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Sri Lankan Tamils. Activities by missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and Methodist and Anglican churches led to a revival among Hindu Tamils who created their own social groups, built their own schools and temples, and published their own literature to counter the missionary activities. The success of this effort led to a new confidence for the Tamils, encouraging <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of themselves as a community, and it paved the way for their emergence as a cultural, religious, and linguistic society in the mid-19th century.|$|E

When they learn more about what a bris is, and misconstrue it as a party {{where they are going}} to remove his penis, Kyle tries {{to find a way to}} hide his brother from his parents and the {{circumcision}} process. Kyle puts Ike on a train to Nebraska and makes an Ike-style doll out of meat bones in an attempt to not arouse his parents' suspicions. This backfires when the doll is eaten by a dog, which leads to <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Ike is dead. It is at the funeral that Kyle finds out that Ike is not his biological brother, but was adopted from Canada due to the tombstone featuring the Canadian flag. Upon discovering this, Kyle decides that Ike is no longer his brother. His parents are shocked after Kyle reveals the truth, and Ike is retrieved from Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|The Analytical Review offered {{its readers}} {{access to a}} wide variety of works. In July 1789, when the Bastille fell, the Analytical {{reviewed}} The Rural Economy of Gloucestershire, Life of Thomas Chatterton, Transactions in Bengal, Military Operations on the Coromandel Coast, Poetry and Music of the Italian Opera, and Histoire Politique de la Revolution en France. The journal also laid provocative facts before the public to prompt <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and, if necessary, to take action, although it claimed not to advocate one viewpoint over another. For example, when philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke issued his politically controversial Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), the Analytical Review reviewed it extensively, as well as the many responses to it, such as Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), Vindiciae Gallicae (1791) by James Mackintosh, and Rights of Man (1791) by Thomas Paine. However, the majority of the excerpts that the reviewers chose to publish came from the rebuttals to Burke's work.|$|E

In 1897, {{at the age of}} 40, he was brevetted colonel (the {{youngest}} colonel in the British Army) and given command of the 5th Dragoon Guards in India. A few years later he wrote a small manual, entitled Aids to Scouting, a summary of lectures he had given on the subject of military scouting, much of it a written explanation of the lessons he had learned from Burnham, to help train recruits. Using this and other methods he was able to train <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> independently, use their initiative, and survive in the wilderness.|$|E
25|$|Florence Hawley (September 17, 1906-1991) {{was one of}} {{the first}} anthropologists to work {{extensively}} on dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating. She conducted archaeological and ethnographic research in the Southwestern United States; and undertook some of the first dendrochronological research in eastern North America in the mid 20th century, examining samples from a number of archaeological sites. She was also highly regarded as a passionate teacher who pushed her students toward greatness by encouraging <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for themselves and work hard for what they wanted to achieve. Although faced with many challenges in her career, and discriminated against for being a woman, she persevered in her research and became a great influence both for her students and for other women in her field.|$|E

And, indeed, considering how small a tax would suffice for such a work, it is a public scandal that such a thing should never have been endeavoured, or, perhaps, so much as thought on.|$|E

500|$|Writer Barry Ulanov commented in 1946 that Tristano [...] "was {{not content}} merely to feel something, [...] {{he had to}} explore ideas, to {{experience}} <b>them,</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> them through carefully, thoroughly, logically until he could fully grasp them and then hold on to them." [...] Tristano criticized the free jazz {{that began in the}} 1960s for its lack of musical logic as well as its expression of negative emotions. [...] "If you feel angry with somebody you hit him on the nose – not try to play angry music", he commented; [...] "Express all that is positive. Beauty is a positive thing." [...] He expanded on this by distinguishing emotion from feeling, and suggested that playing a particular emotion was egotistical and lacking in feeling.|$|E

500|$|Series co-creator and {{executive}} producer Weiss praised Clarke's portrayal in the scene saying [...] "Emilia absolutely crushed it. It's one of those weird scenes because it was half shot in Spain, half in Belfast. But largely due to her performance, it works brilliantly." [...] Sackheim, {{the director of the}} episode, noted in an interview, [...] "With the interior, {{there was only one way}} for her to play it, which is, bemused. She's the keeper of the secret. She knows how to extricate herself from this. I thought the ease with which she delivered the lines was necessary for the audience to feel jeopardy for her and for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> she was crazy. The sequence outside was all about claiming the throne — or reclaiming the throne." [...] Sackheim also stated, [...] "We wanted to clearly distinguish everything we've seen from the end of the last season and the beginning of this one." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{women and}} {{children}} contributed {{to a sense of}} normality as their presence provided conventional social, family, and gender relations. [...] The internees believed the children's presence made them less selfish, as it forced <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the latter's welfare. The women organised Christmas and birthday celebrations. Other diversions such as musicals, plays, recitals, and variety shows were also staged. Although the camp lacked books and educational supplies, the teachers and educational administrators amongst the internees were able to provide lessons for the children at the primary and secondary levels. Additionally, extensive educational opportunities were available for the adults: language courses for Chinese, Malay, and French, and also lectures on photography, yachting, journalism, and poultry-keeping. In addition to the personal diaries kept by internees, many of them now held by the Imperial War Museum, a record of life in the camp was created using a double bed sheet. The Day Joyce Sheet was embroidered and appliquéd with 1100 names, signs and figures including a diary in code.|$|E
500|$|In February 1995, {{two months}} after the release of Star Trek Generations, Paramount decided to produce another Star Trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release. Paramount wanted writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, who had written the Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes, to pen the screenplay. Producer Rick Berman told Braga and Moore that he wanted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about doing a story {{involving}} time travel. Braga and Moore, meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. [...] "Right on the spot, we said maybe we can do both, the Borg and time travel," [...] Moore recalled. The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of The Next Generation, [...] "", and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor. [...] "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and we liked them," [...] Moore said. [...] "They were fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home.

[...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else."

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 4, Rachel is broody and upset that she is infertile. She and Adam begin an application process for an adoption, and are soon paired up with eight-year-old Laura (Katie Riddoch), {{the daughter of a}} drug addict. Adam and Laura bond at their first meeting at her foster home, and Adam and Rachel begin plans for her to move in with them. However, after a routine hospital appointment reveals that Rachel is four months pregnant, social worker Ruth Wylie (Samantha Spiro) retracts the adoption application, concerned about the effect a new baby will have on Laura if she moves in with Adam and Rachel. Adam and Rachel vow to take legal action against the adoption agency but change their minds after Laura's foster mother Jean (Jacqueline Pilton) persuades <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the effect it will have on Laura. Reluctantly, Adam and Rachel walk away from the adoption and instead plan for their own baby. The original Series 4 story arc for Adam and Rachel was radically different, and had to be changed considerably after Helen Baxendale learned she was pregnant. Mike Bullen quipped at the time, [...] "We're looking at a number of ideas, including alien abduction". Though heavily pregnant, Rachel's doctor advises her that it is safe to fly to Australia for Pete and Jo's (John Thomson and Kimberley Joseph) wedding in Series 4, Episode 8. On the day of the wedding ceremony, Rachel collapses outside the hotel, having gone into labour two months prematurely, and is rushed to hospital.
