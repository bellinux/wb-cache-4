5|$|Broadly speaking, {{daylight}} saving time was abandoned {{in the years after}} the war (with some notable exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, and Ireland). However, it was brought back for periods of <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> different places during the following decades and commonly during World War II. It became widely adopted, particularly in North America and Europe, starting in the 1970s {{as a result of the}} 1970s energy crisis.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, for {{the first}} <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, Robey {{appeared}} in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in Sinbad the Sailor; Fred Emney Sr played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable. During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income. His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were as popular as his annual performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.|$|E

25|$|After {{winning a}} {{democratic}} mandate in the 2004 election, {{it was thought}} that Karzai would pursue a more aggressively reformist path in 2005. However, Karzai has proved to be more cautious than was expected. After his new administration took over in 2004, the economy of Afghanistan began growing rapidly for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years. Government revenue began increasing every year, although it is still heavily dependent on foreign aid.|$|E
25|$|Fresh fish is {{a highly}} {{perishable}} food product, {{so it must be}} eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>many</b> countries, fresh fish are filleted and displayed for sale on a bed of crushed ice or refrigerated. Fresh fish is most commonly found near bodies of water, but the advent of refrigerated train and truck transportation has made fresh fish more widely available inland.|$|E

25|$|At {{various times}} {{there have been}} {{concerns}} about concentration of newspaper ownership, notably in 1970 and 1980 with two commissions, the Davey Committee on combines and the Kent Royal Commission on Newspapers respectively, and most recently when Conrad Black's Hollinger acquired the Southam newspapers in the late 1990s. When Hollinger sold its Canadian properties, however, many of their smaller-market newspapers were in fact purchased {{by a variety of}} new ownership groups such as Osprey Media, increasing the diversity of newspaper ownership for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years.|$|E

25|$|The 1932 {{election}} {{brought about}} a major realignment in political party affiliation, and is widely {{considered to be a}} realigning election. Franklin D. Roosevelt was able to forge a coalition of labor unions, liberals, Catholics, African Americans, and southern whites. These disparate voting blocs together formed a broad majority and handed the Democrats seven victories out of nine presidential elections to come, as well as control of both houses of Congress during much of this <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> <b>many</b> ways, it was the American civil rights movement that ultimately heralded the demise of the coalition.|$|E
25|$|The Brownwood Lions {{had long}} been on the losing side of the {{football}} field, only winning one district championship between 1920 and 1959. 1960 was Coach Wood's first year in Brownwood and he brought the team a 13-1 season. Temple was the only loss the Lions received that year and Brownwood easily claimed the district title for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years. The Lions went undefeated in the playoffs and won their first state championship, beating Port Lavaca Calhoun 26 to 6 for the state crown.|$|E
25|$|In December 1996, {{the fifteenth}} {{congress}} was held, {{this time in}} Porto, with more than 1600 delegates participating. The congress criticized the right-wing policies of the socialist government of António Guterres and debated {{the future of the}} PCP following the debacle of the Socialist Bloc. In the subsequent local elections, the party continued to decline, but in the legislative election of 1999, the party increased its voting percentage for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years. The sixteenth congress was held in December 2000, and Carlos Carvalhas was reelected secretary-general. In the legislative election of 2002, the PCP achieved its lowest voting result ever, with only 7.0% of the vote.|$|E

However, due to customer feedback, the Class 153 was re-introduced from 15 March until mid June, when the Parry People Mover finally entered full service. For the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, a Sunday service is operated.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons, Collingwood would start the years with win-loss records of 8–3, but {{finished}} those seasons poorly and missed the finals. 2014 was the first season since 2005 where they did not make finals. In both 2016 and 2017, Collingwood missed the finals again, though elected to extend the contract of senior men's coach Nathan Buckley an additional two years. In 2017, the club made significant on-field and administrative changes, creating a senior women's football team and senior women's netball team in the AFL Women's and National Netball League respectively, as well as revealing a new club logo for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years.|$|E

During promotion for the bout, Hopkins caused huge controversy by throwing the Puerto Rico flag {{on the floor in}} press conferences in both New York City and Puerto Rico, the latter conference leading to a riot in which Hopkins had to be run to safety from the angry mob.|$|E
