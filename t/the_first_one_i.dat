In 2006, she was acknowledged for her meticulous classical performance style in Giselle {{and created a}} role in Jorma Elo's Glow–Stop. Elo said: [...] "“Often with me in my creative moments—they are very fast, and I can't repeat them myself. Misty has the capability to absorb something extremely fast and then reproduce it exactly, and she gives such clarity to the material. If I were {{to make my own}} company, she would be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> would call." [...] That year, she also returned to Southern California to perform at Orange County Performing Arts Center and danced one of the cygnets and reprised her role as the Hungarian Princess in Swan Lake in New York. In both 2006 and 2007, Copeland danced the role of Blossom in James Kudelka's Cinderella. Copeland's [...] "old-style" [...] performance continued to earn her praise in 2007. In 2007, she danced the Fairy of Valor in The Sleeping Beauty. Other roles that Copeland played before she was appointed a soloist by ABT included Twyla Tharp roles in In the Upper Room and Sinatra Suite as well as a role in Mark Morris's Gong. A Dance Magazine feature stated that Copeland's [...] "sublime rapport with her partners in ... Sinatra Suite has earned her the honor of dancing with the company’s male superstars".|$|E

2500|$|On April 5, {{documentary}} filmmaker Sean Pamphilon released audio of {{a meeting}} Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back Kendall Hunter, {{even if it meant}} hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to tear wide receiver Michael Crabtree's ACL, injure tight end Vernon Davis' ankles and go after kick returner Kyle Williams specifically because he had a history of concussions. He also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback Alex Smith; according to Pamphilon, after Williams told his men to hit Smith in the chin, [...] "then he rubs his thumb against his index and middle fingers – the cash sign – and says, I got <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one.</b> <b>I</b> got the first one. Go get it. Go lay that motherfucker out." [...] Pamphilon, who was doing a documentary on Steve Gleason and his fight against Lou Gehrig's Disease, released the audio to Yahoo! Sports without Gleason's approval. However, the Saints were not penalized for illegal hits during that game, which they lost 36–32.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, Waits {{was extremely}} busy working on movie soundtracks, acting, {{and contributing to}} a number of music projects by other artists. First, Waits appeared on the Primus album Sailing the Seas of Cheese as the voice of [...] "Tommy the Cat", which exposed him to a new audience in alternative rock. This was the first of several collaborations between Waits and the group; Frontman Les Claypool would appear on several subsequent Waits releases. The same year saw Waits provide spoken word contributions to Devout Catalyst, an album by one of Waits' greatest influences, Ken Nordine, on the songs [...] "A Thousand Bing Bangs" [...] and [...] "The Movie." [...] Waits also contributed vocals to a duet with singer Bob Forrest on the song [...] "Adios Lounge" [...] on the Thelonious Monster album Beautiful Mess. He also contributed vocals to two songs ("Little Man" [...] and [...] "I'm Not Your Fool Anymore") on jazz tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards' album Mississippi Lad. Edwards was extremely complimentary of Waits' contributions, saying:Tom Waits is the one who got me my contract with PolyGram. He's wonderful, he's America's best lyricist since Johnny Mercer. He came down to the studio on the Mississippi Lad album, that's <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> did for PolyGram, and he sang two of my songs, wouldn't accept any money, just trying to give me the best boost that he could.|$|E

She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always have a great time working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E

He was shipped off with just enough money in his pocket--no, in the purser's pocket--for the needs of the voyage--and when he reached his destined port he would find a remittance awaiting him there. Not a large one, but just enough to keep him a month. A similar remittance would come monthly thereafter. It was the remittance-man's custom to pay his month's board and lodging straightway--a duty which his landlord did not allow him to forget--then spree away the rest of his money in a single night, then brood and mope and grieve in idleness till the next remittance came. It is a pathetic life.|$|E

I had been innocent enough to suppose that this would end with married life, and it gave me a dreadful shock to realize that such was not the case. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> noticed was a young man who came to the house, at an hour when John was out, for the purpose, so he said at least, of reading the gas meter. He looked at me in just the boldest way and asked me to show him the way to the cellar. I don't know whether it was a pretext or not, but I just summoned all the courage I had and showed him {{to the head of the}} cellar stairs. I had determined that if he tried to carry me down with him I would scream for the servants, but I suppose something in my manner made him desist, and he went alone. When he came up he professed to have read the meter and he left the house quite quietly. But I thought it wiser to say nothing to John of what had happened.|$|E

The displacement field is first estimated on a coarse resolution image and progressively finer details are introduced in the analysis as the displacement {{is more and more}} securely and accurately determined. Such a scheme has been developed to increase the robustness, accuracy and reliability of the image matching algorithm. The details of the program are then presented. The procedure, CORRELIQ 4, is implemented in MatlabTM. The different steps are presented. The procedure is used on one example deal-ing with Portevin-Le Châtelier bands in an aluminum alloy, and with an artificially deformed picture of stone wool. Other published applications using the present code are listed. The software has been protected under the IDDN. FR. 001. 110004. 000. S. P. 2008. 000. 21000.
