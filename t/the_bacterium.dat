5|$|For {{many years}} exobiologists have {{proposed}} {{the existence of}} a shadow biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> GFAJ-1, was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.|$|E
50|$|Upon passive {{diffusion}} of organic acids into <b>the</b> <b>bacteria,</b> where <b>the</b> pH is near or above neutrality, the acids will dissociate and lower <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> internal pH, leading to situations that will impair or stop <b>the</b> growth of <b>bacteria.</b> Thereafter, <b>the</b> anionic {{part of the}} organic acids, which cannot escape <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> in its dissociated form, will accumulate within <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> and disrupt many metabolic functions, leading to osmotic pressure increase, incompatible with the survival of <b>the</b> <b>bacteria.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thalassiosira pseudonana and the {{heterotrophic}} alphaproteobacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi form {{a chemical}} symbiosis in coculture. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> provide vitamin B12 to the diatoms, which in exchange provide organic nutrients to <b>the</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In <b>the</b> presence of <b>the</b> diatom, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> start producing a transporter for dihydroxypropanesulfonate (DHPS), a nutrient {{produced by the}} diatom for <b>the</b> <b>bacteria.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Methyl-accepting {{chemotaxis}} protein (MCP) is a transmembrane sensor protein of <b>bacteria.</b> Use of <b>the</b> MCP allows <b>bacteria</b> {{to detect}} concentrations of molecules in the extracellular matrix so that <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> may smooth swim or tumble accordingly. If <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> detects rising levels of attractants (nutrients) or declining levels of repellents (toxins), <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> will continue swimming forward, or smooth swimming. If <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> detects declining levels of attractants or rising levels of repellents, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> will tumble and re-orient {{itself in a}} new direction.

40|$|Oysters {{collected}} in late winter, {{when they were}} free of Vibrio vulnificus, were exposed in the organism in the laboratory. The oysters effectively concentrated <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> from seawater, but when the inoculum was removed, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> were rapidly cleared from the oyster tissues. These results suggest that V. vulnificus {{may be found in}} oysters as a result of filtration of <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> from seawater rather than active multiplication of <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> in <b>the</b> oysters...|$|R
50|$|Bacterial wilt of {{cucurbits}} {{is cause}} by <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> Erwinia tracheiphila, it affects cucumber, squash, muskmelon, pumpkin, gourds; certain varieties of cucumber and squash have {{different degrees of}} resistance. Once a plant is infected, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> spread through <b>the</b> xylem vessels from the area of infection to the main stem, and the entire plant wilts and dies. Initial symptoms may include the wilting of single leaves and smaller stems. Infected plants may produce a creamy white bacterial ooze when cut. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> survive winter in the digestive tract of striped cucumber beetles and spotted cucumber beetles. In the spring when the beetles are feeding on susceptible plants, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria,</b> which are contained in the fecal matter of the beetles enters the plant through wounds in <b>the</b> epidermis. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> need a film of water to facilitate infection. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> can also be transmitted from one plant to another when beetles feed on an infected plant and <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> becomes attached to the beetles mouthparts.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bacterium</b> Paenibacillus popilliae {{which causes}} milky spore disease {{has been found}} useful in the control of Japanese beetle, killing the larvae. It is very {{specific}} to its host species and is harmless to vertebrates and other invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} element hafnium {{is named after}} Copenhagen (Latin name Hafnia), where it was discovered. <b>The</b> <b>bacterium</b> Hafnia is also named after Copenhagen: Vagn Møller of the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen named it in 1954.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E

50|$|Pseudonocardia is {{the type}} genus of <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> family Pseudonocardiaceae. Members of this genus have been found living mutualistically on the cuticle of the leafcutter ants because <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> has {{antibiotic}} properties that protect the fungus grown by <b>the</b> ants. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> may {{also be found in}} crypts on the propleural plate.|$|R
5|$|Caterpillars {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and {{only a small percentage}} of the butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. <b>The</b> <b>bacterium</b> Bacillus thuringiensis has been used in sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{representatives of}} the genus were {{assigned}} to the family Azotobacteraceae Pribram, 1933, but then were transferred to the family Pseudomonadaceae based on the studies of nucleotide sequences 16S rRNA. In 2004, a phylogenetic study revealed that A. vinelandii belongs to the same clade as <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and in 2007 it was suggested that the genera Azotobacter, Azomonas and Pseudomonas are related and might be synonyms.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent rainscald, it is {{important}} {{to stop the spread of}} <b>the</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Tick and insect control is an effective way to stop the spread of <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> from one animal to another. As well, separating infected animals will help to stop the spread of <b>the</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Keeping <b>the</b> animal in a dry, well-ventilated area out of the rain and wet conditions will stop <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> from growing. This dry environment includes dry ground as well as dry air.|$|R
25|$|The {{causal agent}} of Ring Rot of Potato does not overwinter in <b>the</b> soil. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> survives inside {{infected}} tubers or as dried slime on machinery or containers. For instance, if a knife cuts into an infected tuber, the next 20 tubers that the knife cuts {{have a high}} risk of becoming infected. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> enters <b>the</b> host through wounds and invades the xylem where it multiplies via binary fission. If colonization is successful, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> may plug <b>the</b> xylem vessels. In advanced stages of infection, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> will move out of the vessels and break down the surrounding parenchyma tissue before moving into new vessels. <b>The</b> <b>bacteria</b> may also invade the roots and cause them to deteriorate.|$|R
50|$|In humans, L. pneumophila invades and {{replicates}} inside macrophages. The internalization of <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> can {{be enhanced}} {{by the presence of}} antibody and complement, but is not absolutely required. Internalization of <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> appears to occur through phagocytosis. However, L. pneumophila is also capable of infecting nonphagocytic cells through an unknown mechanism. A rare form of phagocytosis known as coiling phagocytosis has been described for L. pneumophila, but this is not dependent on the Dot/Icm secretion system and has been observed for other pathogens. Once internalized, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> surround themselves in a membrane-bound vacuole that does not fuse with lysosomes that would otherwise degrade <b>the</b> <b>bacteria.</b> In this protected compartment, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> multiply.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of Mitch, disease {{outbreaks}} occurred throughout Central America, including cholera, leptospirosis, and dengue fever. Over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported, killing 34people. Guatemala was most affected by <b>the</b> <b>bacterium,</b> {{where most of the}} deaths occurred from contaminated food. 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in Nicaragua, killing seven people. There were over 1,357 cases of dengue reported, though no deaths were reported from the disease.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{is thought}} to be the primary cause of acne in 80% of cases. The role of diet and {{cigarette}} smoking is unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part. During puberty, in both sexes, acne is often brought on by an increase in hormones such as testosterone. A frequent factor is excessive growth of <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> Propionibacterium acnes, which is normally present on the skin.|$|E
5|$|Links between other {{infections and}} GBS are less certain. Two other herpesviruses (Epstein–Barr virus/HHV-4 and {{varicella}} zoster virus/HHV-3) and <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> Mycoplasma pneumoniae {{have been associated}} with GBS. The tropical viral infection dengue fever and Zika virus have also been associated with episodes of GBS. Previous hepatitis E virus infection {{has been found to be}} more common in people with Guillain–Barré syndrome.|$|E
50|$|The cytosol of {{the host}} cell {{contains}} nutrients, adenosine triphosphate, amino acids, and nucleotides which are used by <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> for growth. For this reason, {{as well as to}} avoid phagolysosomal fusion and death, rickettsiae must escape from the phagosome. To escape from <b>the</b> phagosome, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> secrete phospholipase D and hemolysin C. This causes disruption of the phagosomal membrane and allows <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> to escape. Following generation time in the cytoplasm {{of the host}} cells, <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> utilizes actin based motility to move through the cytosol.|$|R
25|$|Toxin is {{produced}} by <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> when environmental conditions are favourable for the spores to replicate and grow, but the gene that encodes for the toxin protein is actually carried by a virus or phage that infects <b>the</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Unfortunately, {{little is known about}} the natural factors that control phage infection and replication within <b>the</b> <b>bacteria.</b>|$|R

5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> Citrobacter, {{can absorb}} concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E
5|$|The toner {{contains}} glycolic acid, an exfoliant, and witch hazel, an astringent.

Benzoyl peroxide has been used since 1934 to kill Propionibacterium acnes, <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, Neutrogena Advanced Systems, PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E
5|$|Two {{kinds of}} control {{measures}} have been advocated since the 19th century. One aims at total pest population reduction, while the other is aimed at protection of the particular crop. , integrated pest management (IPM), an array of techniques and approaches to control pests, was recommended. Practices such as deep ploughing, mechanical destruction, and trap crops are also used to kill different instars. Chemical control is widely successful, and includes the use of applying mineral oil inside the tip of each corn ear, which suffocates the young larvae. Pesticides are one method by which corn earworm populations are controlled; however, since they have been widely used, the insects have become resistant to many pesticides. The use of biological controls, such as <b>the</b> <b>bacterium</b> Bacillus thuringiensis and various forms of nematodes, is also common, although not without their own problems. Corn earworm moths are not always vulnerable to <b>the</b> <b>bacterium,</b> and they are only afflicted by nematodes once the larvae have pupated and dropped to the ground.|$|E

50|$|The {{definition}} of “endosymbiont” indicates that <b>the</b> <b>bacteria</b> are localized within the cytoplasm of cells or hyphae of the fungi partner.
