The rotor blade reduces {{the noise of}} rotorcraft, including both standard helicopters and advanced systems such as tiltrotors. The primary noise reduction feature is the forward sweep of the planform over {{a large portion of}} the outer blade radius. The rotor blade also includes an aft-swept section. The purpose of the aft-swept region is to provide a partial balance to pitching moments produced by the outboard forward-swept portion of the blade. The rotor blade has a constant chord width; or has a <b>chord</b> <b>width</b> which decreases linearly along the entire blade span; or combines constant and decreasing <b>chord</b> <b>widths,</b> wherein the blade is of constant <b>chord</b> <b>width</b> from the blade root to a certain location on the rotor blade, then decreases linearly to the blade tip thereafter.

In this case, suitable architectures may introduce proper modulations to keep the measured deformation low while preserving the information content. In the current paper, the designed monitoring system combines the use of a span-wise fiber reinforced patch with a chord-wise sliding beam. The two elements make up a closed grid, allowing the reconstruction of the complete deformed shape under the acceptable assumption that the transformation refers to regular geometry variations.

Calculated lift and drag parameters are compared to measured parameters for 55 airfoil data sets including 585 test points.

When the proposed equations were applied to the calculation of power from a stall-controlled wind turbine tested in a NASA wind tunnel, mean deviation from 54 data points was - 1. 3 percent and standard deviation was 4. 0 percent. Pressure-rise calculations for a large wind tunnel fan deviated by 2. 7 percent (mean) and 4. 4 percent (standard).

40|$|Both the {{interception}} {{of solar}} radiant energy and photosynthesis {{depend on the}} surface area of foliage. "One-sided " foliage surface area {{is used in the}} calculation of intercepted radiant energy, whereas total foliage surface area is commonly used in the calculation of photosynthesis for amphistomatic foliage. In experiments, either "one-sided " or total surface area can be measured; hence, {{there is a need to}} be able to convert from "one-sided " to total surface area and vice-versa. The length and width of foliage of broadleaved species are large in comparison to their thickness. If such foliage is placed on a horizontal surface so that the foliage thickness is perpendicular to the surface, then the "one-sided " surface area is the vertical projection of the foliage on to the horizontal surface. Total surface area is assumed to be twice the "one-sided " surface area. Problems arise when one attempts to define "one-sided " surface area for pine needles as the needle width approaches the needle thickness and there is no obvious top or bottom to the needle.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of this current work is to design a z-axis translation for an earth sensor test facility in the Earth Lab, Laboratory for Electro-Optics System (LEOS), ISRO Bangalore. It is targeted to develop the best solution for the z-axis translation, {{taking into account the}} physical and material constraints as well as the operator’s safety and easy accessibility of the device. Nowadays there exist a set of z-axis translators that has been implemented on a limited number for testing equipments. The device developed in this thesis reveals a relatively new concept that is fitting space, safety and easyaccess requirements of the test facility in the earth lab. To achieve the goals of this current work, I followed the project design methodology from specialized books that lead us to final concept which was submitted to structural analysis and that will be furthermore optimized.

40|$|Fatigue {{tests were}} carried out on welded {{thin-walled}} (t< 4 mm) T-joints made of circular hollow section (CHS) braces welded onto square hollow section (SHS) chords, under the loading conditions of “in-plane bending in the brace”. Stress distributions were measured at different hot spot locations around the chord-brace junction, where cracks were observed to initiate and grow causing fatigue failure. The degree of non-linearity from the measured stress distributions around the weld toes of the brace-chord junction showed that stress distribution is significantly non-linear, along specified locations for brace diameter to <b>chord</b> <b>width</b> ratios greater than 0. 5. The quadratic method of extrapolation of local strains/stresses to determine hot spot stresses is recommended. Using the measured stress distributions from this investigation and results from previous research, hot spot location lines that produce the highest hot spot stresses are recommended. The stress concentration factors for the welded thin-walled CHS-SHS T-joints lie in between the predicted values of SCFs for CHS-CHS and SHS-SHS T-joints for given non-dimensional parameters. A method is suggested for estimating SCFs for welded thin-walled CHS-SHS Tjoints using existing parametric equations for SHS-SHS T-joints.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a test program {{on a wide}} range of cold-formed stainless steel welded tubular T-joints fabricated from square and rectangular hollow section brace and chord members. A total of 22 tests was performed. High strength stainless steel (duplex and high strength austenitic) and normal strength stainless steel (AISI 304) specimens were tested. The tests were performed by supporting the chord member of the specimen along its entire length with the pure concentrated force applied to the chord face by the brace member. The ratio of brace <b>width</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>width</b> (β) of the specimens varied from 0. 5 to 1. 0 so that failure modes of chord face failure and chord side wall failure were observed. The test results were compared with the design procedures in the Australian/New Zealand Standard for stainless steel structures, CIDECT and Eurocode design rules for carbon steel structures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the current design specifications are conservative for the test specimens calculated using the 0. 1 %, 0. 2 %, 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % proof stresses as the yield stresses. The 0. 2 % proof stress is comparatively more reasonable to predict the design strengths of stainless steel welded tubular T-joints for both ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state. In this study, it is shown that the ultimate limit state controls rather than the serviceability limit state for most of the test specimens. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Effectiveness of self-adaptive flaps in delaying flow {{separation}} on low aspect ratio wings {{of three different}} planforms were ascertained experimentally in a low speed wind tunnel at a Reynolds number of 105 based on their root <b>chord.</b> Flap <b>widths</b> between 0. 08 c and 0. 15 c; placement location between 0. 4 x/c and 0. 8 x/c were investigated. The flapped configurations exhibit good stall margin and higher CLmax in most cases. The chordwise placement location of adaptive flap for better lift enhancement varies with planform. Adaptive flaps placed at the maximum span location on a varying span planform exhibit better lift characteristics than flaps placed at other chordwise location. However, for a constant span planform like rectangle, chordwise location close to trailing edge seems to be optimal for flap placement. Full span flaps were efficient in obstructing the forward progression of reverse flow from stall vortex than part span flaps. The lift enhancing capabilities of double adaptive flapped configuration was relatively low compared to single adaptive flapped configuration. No detrimental effects were observed in the drag characteristics of the single flapped configurations of rectangular and inverse Zimmerman planform. However, significant drag increase was observed for the flapped configurations of Zimmerman model and double flapped configurations. The temporal behavior of the adaptive flap is aperiodic. Spectral analysis of the adaptive flap oscillation shows that it oscillates at multiple frequencies and the wing planform only influence the mean angle and magnitude of oscillation, while frequency of the oscillation seems to be flow dependent...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a brief theory of aeroelastic flutter of airfoils and the relevant algorithm {{for the development}} of a computer code in FORTRAN for dynamic coupling of the airfoil structure, in the time domain, to a two-dimensional subsonic aerodynamic flow, so that the aeroelastic motion can be simulated in the time domain and the flutter boundary be determined for a typical rigid airfoil (of heave and pitch degrees of freedom) in the subsonic flow. The relevant computer code with fluid structure coupling has been developed at the Structural Technologies Division (STTD) for the purpose. The present work starts with a brief introduction to the fundamental concepts of airfoil flutter. The relevant equations of motion of the airfoil in subsonic airflow have been derived from the first principles. First, the classical method, based on the eigenvalue approach is used to solve the equations of motion and to determine the flutter boundary of the airfoil in the subsonic flow regime. A symmetric NACA 0012 airfoil profile of unit <b>chord</b> and <b>width</b> is chosen for analysis, with suitable spring stiffness and inertia values so that flutter instability can occur in the subsonic regime. Results from the panel code for steady flow conditions over the NACA 0012 confirm the validity of the code. For the purpose of time domain flutter simulation the panel code with the Prandtl-Glauert compressibility correction factor is suitably coupled to the airfoil through a Newmark's implicit time integration scheme. Unsteady motion in the fluid-structure system is numerically simulated through the code with small initial conditions. Flutter boundary is indicated by the critical free stream flow speed (and dynamic pressure) beyond which oscillation amplitudes show divergence in time. Flutter frequencies and flutter velocities obtained by the various methods are then compared, and good agreement is observed. Present analysis with a simple airfoil coupled to a 2 D subsonic flow (simulated by the panel method) indicate that it is possible, in principle, to simulate flutter even in the transonic and supersonic regimes, using more sophisticated aerodynamic codes (Navier Stokes) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{solution}} is obtained to the boundary-value problem arising in the unsteady motion of a thin aerofoil {{in a stream}} bounded by porous walls. The flow is two-dimensional, inviscid, and incompressible. The condition holding at the porous boundaries {{is assumed to be}} a proportionality between the normal velocity com-ponent at the wall and the pressure difference across the wall. The solution relies on a form of this boundary condition which is valid for small values of the frequency of the oscillations, although conditions at the aerofoil surface are independent of frequency. The usual assumption of small amplitude of the disturbances is made. A formula is derived for the pressure on the aerofoil surface in terms of the flow direction at the surface. The relations for the lift and moment about the mid-chord point are obtained for a harmonic upwash distribution. For the case of a rigid aerofoil, particular types of harmonic oscillations are investigated, and the lift and moment are given as dimensionless 'air-load coefficients'. The results are expressed as the first-order terms of expansions in powers of a parameter which depends on the ratio of aerofoil <b>chord</b> to tunnel <b>width,</b> and are valid for small values of this ratio. 1...|$|R

Three-dimensional (3 D) models were segmented from CT scans and each rib vertex cloud was placed into a local coordinate system defined from the rib principal axes. Rib clouds were then analysed using best fitting ellipses of the external contours of the cross-section areas. The centroid of each ellipse was then used to measure the centroidal pathway between each slice (rib midline). Curvature of the ribs was measured from the mid-line of the ribs as the sum of angles between successive centroids in adjacent cross sections. Distinct common patterns were noted in all rib geometric parameters for modern humans. The Kebara 2 reconstructed ribs also followed the same patterns. This study demonstrated that there are differences between the sexes in rib geometrical parameters, with females showing smaller rib <b>width,</b> <b>chord</b> length and arc length, but greater curvature (rib torsion, rib axial curvature, rib anterior-posterior bending) than males.

Previous {{studies have shown that}} redesigning {{the leading edge of the}} rudder will increase the manoeuvrability. A method for increased manoeuvrability is by mimicking the tubercles on the leading edge of the humpback whales flipper. The tubercles on the leading edge of the flipper will delay the separation, increasing the lift-to-drag ratio which in turn will yield a highly efficient rudder, making manoeuvring easier. A parametric foil with the possibility to easily change the foils <b>chord</b> length, span <b>width</b> and thickness as well as the tubercles amplitude and wave length. Three different validation studies were conducted to confirm that it was possible to recreate the results from previous studies. The investigation conducted by this thesis investigated 16 different foils with different characteristics to see which foil yielded the highest lift-to-drag ratio. From the investigation of the foils it can be concluded that tubercles on the leading edge has a negative influence on the lift-to-drag ratio. Contradicting to our expectations was the foil that yielded the highest lift-to-drag ratio the foil with a flat-leading edge. However, further investigation of the foils at an angle of attack = 0 ° needs to be conducted to examine the drag coefficient. If a foil, yields a high lift coefficient for high angles of attack while not increasing the drag for 0 ° it might still be beneficial to use that foil.

40|$|I {{examined}} 537 band recoveries {{and returns}} to determine differences in crossover, dispersal, and winter distribution of presumed eastern and western subpopulations of the Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo regalis). Only 4. 1 % of eastern banded hawks were recovered west of the continental divide, while 27. 5 % of western banded hawks were found east of the divide, for an overall crossover proportion of 8. 6 %. Mean winter recovery latitude {{of the two groups}} was not significantly different, but longitude differed significantly. Winter recoveries of both subpopulations were in concentrated areas in northwest Texas, western Kansas, and northern Mexico, although western recoveries were more dispersed. Ferruginous Hawks were recovered in highest proportions (48. 7 %) within their first year and 59. 3 % of post-fledging birds were recovered within 25 km of banding sites. A high proportion (48. 6 %) of breeding-age birds were found within 50 km of their natal site during the breeding season. Shooting remains a serious mortality factor: 36. 5 % of the reported shooting mortalities have occurred since 1972. Of the total recoveries, 16 (3 %) that had crossed the divide were of minimum breeding age, indicating some degree of potential mixing and gene flow between the two presumed subpopulations. I trapped 67 adult Ferruginous Hawks during the breeding season in 1991 and 1992, to examine morphological and genetic differences between the postulated subpopulations. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated that both sexes of eastern birds were significantly larger in mass, and eastern females were larger for third toe length, bill <b>chord,</b> and gape <b>width</b> than western birds. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) correctly classified 89. 6 % of females, and 93. 33 % of males into their respective subpopulations. Mass was the predominate variable influencing four of six misclassifications. Latitudinal variation accounted for most of the morphological differences; eastern capture sites were farther north than western sites. Morphological differences between the eastern and western groups could not be explained by localized ecological adaptation to a different prey base, as previously suggested. No genetic differences were found between postulated eastern and western groups, using the Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, with a survey of 40 primers on 29 birds. An external morphometric method was developed to determine the sex of nestling Ferruginous Hawks. MANOVA indicated that five measured characters were significantly different between males and females. For nestlings 24 days and older, DFA classified 100 % of 32 nestlings into their presumed sex, based on flexed-hallux, tarsus length, and toe-pad measurements. Nestlings 20 days and older had a classification of 94. 7 % to their presumed sex with these three variables.
