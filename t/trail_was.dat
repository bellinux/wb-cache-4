5|$|The {{predecessor}} of the Pacific Crest <b>Trail</b> <b>was</b> the Oregon Skyline Trail, {{established in}} 1920, which connected Mount Hood to Crater Lake.|$|E
5|$|Avery {{became the}} first to walk the trail end-to-end, though not as a thru-hike, in 1936. In August 1937, the <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} to Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine, and the ATC shifted its focus toward protecting the trail lands and mapping the trail for hikers.|$|E
50|$|It has 3 mi {{currently}} {{open and}} 15.53 mi of proposed trails. The {{majority of the}} <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> a paved surface.

5000|$|The Double Trouble State Park Nature <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a 1.5 mile loop <b>trail.</b> (This <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{not rated}} by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection). The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} New Jersey Coastal Heritage Route.|$|R
5|$|In 2001, Shawangunk, Montgomery and the Walden began {{applying}} for over $600,000 in TEA-21 grants {{to create a}} paved, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)-accessible trail between Walden and Wallkill. The total cost of paving the <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> expected to be $750,000, though it eventually ballooned to $1.5 million. The decision to pave the <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> vehemently opposed by horseback riders who felt it would endanger them, and protested at several public meetings by the Mid-Hudson Horse Trails Association. The decision was also opposed by nearby homeowners who believed an increase in trail use would threaten their privacy.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Yar, {{originating}} in the north-east of the island, extends an infant tributary to Whitwell and at one point, a stone sheep wash is still present. The River Yar <b>Trail</b> <b>was</b> set up on 24 May 2002, with a milestone outside the White Horse in Whitwell.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass {{on the north side of}} Mount Hood, but that <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons.|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> several <b>trails</b> within Whitefish Dunes. The Black <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 2.5 {{miles long}} {{through the woods}} with rock exposure. The Brachipod <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 1.5 miles long with fossils and nature views. The Clark Lake Spur <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 0.7 miles long. The Green <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 1.8 miles long. There are also the Red, Red Pine, Whitefish Creek Spur, and Yellow trails.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trails</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} {{beginning in}} 1993 and {{were used for}} hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding until <b>trails</b> <b>were</b> separated in November 2011.

50|$|Jacks Knob <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a hiking <b>trail</b> {{that has}} <b>been</b> {{designated}} as a National Recreation Trail in Georgia. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> 4.5 miles (7.2 km) long and {{is located in the}} Chattahoochee National Forest in the Brasstown Ranger District. The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> managed by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|R
5|$|By 1959, the 559th had 6,000 {{personnel}} in two regiments alone, the 70th and 71st, not including combat troops in security roles or North Vietnamese and Laotian civilian laborers. In {{the early days}} of the conflict the <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> used strictly for the infiltration of manpower. This was due to the fact that Hanoi could supply its southern allies much more efficiently by sea.|$|E
5|$|Edmiston Industrial, an {{industrial}} park {{located in the}} Northwest portion of the Edmonton near the Yellowhead <b>Trail,</b> <b>was</b> named in his honour in 1975. The architectural firm of Edmiston & Johnson lasted up until the 1960s, changing partners multiple times, and ultimately folding in 1964 under the name Howard and Robert Bouey Architects.|$|E
5|$|Forks Road, a river road {{following}} Forks Creek, {{served to}} connect the Grand River at Dunnville with the Welland River west of Welland. Like many early roads in Upper Canada, it was built along a river bank. It can therefore be assumed that this <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> built prior to {{the completion of the}} Feeder Canal in 1832.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, the {{sections}} of I-94 from the Indiana state line to the M-63 interchange was designated {{as part of the}} West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway. The West Michigan Pike originated in efforts in the 1910s to improve a highway along {{the western part of the}} Lower Peninsula of Michigan and to increase tourism along the Lake Michigan shore. The auto <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> eventually superseded by US12 and US31 after the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Since NASA's Space Shuttle {{program had}} not been launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team had to create the rocket launch footage without any reference. Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty rewinds to incorporate everything.|$|E
5|$|The {{first route}} through {{this portion of}} Utah was the Old Spanish Trail, a trade route between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Los Angeles, California. The <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> in common use before the Mexican-American War in 1848. Although the trail serves a {{different}} route than I-70, they were both intended to connect southern California with points further east. I-70 generally parallels {{the route of the}} Old Spanish Trail west of Crescent Junction. I-15 south of the junction with I-70 also generally parallels the trail.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} pathway {{along the}} Grand River Avenue corridor was an Indian trail, a footpath {{used by the}} native population. This <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> later used by the first European settlers to the area now known as Michigan. In Detroit, Grand River {{is one of five}} major avenues (along with Woodward, Michigan, Gratiot, and Jefferson) planned by Judge Augustus Woodward in 1805 that extended from Downtown Detroit in differing directions; Grand River Avenue extends northwesterly from the city's downtown. In the middle of the 19th century, the <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> expanded into a plank road that formed the basis for one of the first state trunkline highways as M-16 in the early 20th century. Later, the highway was rerouted to replace M-126 and create M-104. Current segments of the roadway are still part of the state highway system as sections of M-5, M-11, M-43 or business loops off I-96. The portion of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the intersection with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in Downtown Detroit is an unsigned state trunkline, sometimes referred to as Old Business Spur I-96 (Old BS I-96).|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{of these}} two Indian trails later became the Chicago Road. Father Gabriel Richard, the first priest {{to serve in the}} U.S. House of Representatives, petitioned Congress to fund a highway between Detroit and Chicago in March 1824. A year later, the road was established in federal law, and it was surveyed by the end of 1825. Construction started in 1829, and the road was finished across Michigan in 1833. The northern Indian <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> established as an unnamed territorial road in 1829.|$|E
5|$|The <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> {{used for}} more than 20 years, until the {{completion}} of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Among the emigrants were the Mormon handcart pioneers of 1856–60. Two of the handcart companies, led by James G. Willie and Edward Martin, met disaster on the trail when they departed late and were caught by heavy snowstorms in Wyoming.|$|E
50|$|The Lehigh Gorge <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a 26 mi, multiuse rail <b>trail.</b> The <b>trail</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} 165 mi, D & L <b>Trail.</b> It <b>is</b> open year-round for {{hiking and}} biking.

5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, new {{historical}} research (especially by Air Force historians Earl Tilford, Bernard Nalty, and Jacob Van Staaveren) and the publications of the Military Institute of Vietnam finally opened new perspectives on aerial interdiction during the Vietnam War. During Commando Hunt for example, the Air Force claimed that 46,000 PAVN trucks {{had been destroyed}} or damaged by air strikes in Laos. These figures were hard to reconcile with the 6,000 trucks imported annually into North Vietnam between 1965 and 1970 – {{for all of its}} operations. American claims that 80 percent of the materiel that started down the <b>trail</b> <b>was</b> destroyed while en route to the southern battlefields had to be altered in the face of loss claims of only 15 percent by the Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|Cominco had {{produced}} electrolytic hydrogen at Trail, British Columbia, since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 {{that it could}} produce heavy water. To the existing $10million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon catalyst {{for the first three}} stages while Urey developed a nickel-chromia one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's heavy water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. Heavy water from <b>Trail</b> <b>was</b> used for Chicago Pile 3, the first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.|$|E
50|$|The Dobson <b>Trail</b> <b>is</b> a 57.75 km {{hiking trail}} {{that runs from}} Riverview, New Brunswick to Fundy National Park.
