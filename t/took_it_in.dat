Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> {{his right hand}} with a dive, leaving England at 1/1.

5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who {{promptly}} removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his right hand. This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again {{and this time the}} England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.|$|E
5|$|On the August 1 {{episode of}} Raw, Vince McMahon officially {{announced}} Hardy's return to WWE, adding that Hardy would face Edge at SummerSlam. Hardy made his in-ring return, defeating Snitsky on the August 8 Raw. Seconds after the victory, Hardy {{was attacked by}} Edge, and as he was being carried backstage, Matt counterattacked Edge in the locker room. On August 21 at SummerSlam, their match came to a premature end when Edge dropped Hardy onto {{the top of a}} ring post, causing him to bleed heavily. The referee ended the match on the grounds that Hardy could not continue, and Edge was declared the winner. After SummerSlam, the two continued fighting on Raw, including a Street Fight that resulted in Hardy performing a Side Effect on Edge off the entrance stage and into electrical equipment below. At Unforgiven, Edge faced Hardy in a steel cage match. Hardy caught an interfering Lita with the Twist of Fate and won the match with a leg-drop {{off the top of the}} cage. Hardy and Edge faced each other at WWE Homecoming in a Loser Leaves Raw ladder match. Edge's briefcase holding his Money in the Bank Contract for his WWE Championship opportunity was suspended above the ring. The winner of the match received the contract and the loser was forced to leave Raw. After a contentious match, Edge tied Hardy's arms in the ropes, and Lita trapped Hardy in a crucifix hold, leaving Hardy only able to watch Edge win. When the match ended, Edge and Lita gloated over the victory, but Hardy <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> stride and left the arena.|$|E

40|$|By {{virtue of}} the {{election}} of certain type of antagonistic entailment between Literature and philosophy, {{we set out to}} review how the philosophical metaphor has contributed to the stupidity of the philosopher, whereas the literary metaphor, contributes to the engrandecimiento of the author nonphilosopher. Since, in certain type of philosophy, good number of occasions, the content than is said does not {{have to do with the}} declaratory intention of the author, we enunciate the paradox of which if we took in serious to the philosophical text, it sounds to hair seizure and if, on the contrary, we did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> serious, that is to say, if when we read the philosophical declaration, we understand that indeed it is an indirect speech, then we have to judge it like literary text; consequently, to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> is not to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> serious and not to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> serious is to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> serious...|$|R

The final match was broadcast on CBC and followed by 544,000 Canadian televiewers.|$|E
25|$|A third {{stimulus}} was {{the changes}} in the criteria for University examinations in the early 1970s. The government decided that they wanted to standardize the university admission criteria, based on the language the entrance exams were taken in. It was noted that students who took the exams in Tamil scored better than the students who <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Sinhala. Thus the government decided that Tamil students had to achieve a higher score than the students who took the exam in Sinhala to enter the universities. As a result, the number of Tamil students entering universities fell.|$|E

During the voyage to Carnarvon, the damaged and overloaded German lifeboat was swamped, and the Kormoran survivors were transferred into two of Centaurs lifeboats. Arriving in Carnarvon on the afternoon of 27 November, the Germans were relocated from the boats to Centaurs number one cargo hold, where they were joined by the sailors from the two lifeboats that had reached shore and 40 Australian Army guards.|$|E
