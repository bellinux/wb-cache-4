50|$|His early {{research}} was on inorganic substances. He studied sulphur {{and its compounds}} and suggested structures for liquid and plastic sulphur. In 1922 he showed that the polymer polyoxymethylene results from the sublimation of <b>trioxymethylene.</b> It {{was not until the}} 1960s that this polymer was to be used commercially.|$|E
40|$|We {{obtained}} twelve new {{far infrared}} laser transitions by optically pumping the CH 2 DOH, CH 3 I, CD 3 I and <b>Trioxymethylene</b> molecules with a CW CO 2 laser having a tunability range of 280 MHz. We measured the wavelength, polarization, relative intensity and pump offset {{relative to the}} CO 2 center frequency for all the new lines...|$|E
