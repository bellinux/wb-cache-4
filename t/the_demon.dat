5|$|In Bhattikavya, Jatayu dies in {{the arms}} of Rama without {{revealing}} that Sita is in the clutches of Ravana. After his arms are chopped, the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. <b>The</b> <b>demon</b> tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana. <b>The</b> <b>demon</b> praises Rama, who purified <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> by his sword. <b>The</b> <b>demon</b> urges Rama to believe him as he is telling the truth. At last, <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> transforms into a radiant divine being as {{he was telling the truth}} and plunges into the sky.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, Kabandha {{appeared}} before them. <b>The</b> <b>demon</b> blocked {{the path of}} the brothers, who tried to escape by taking a different route, but were finally caught by Kabandha. <b>The</b> <b>demon</b> grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left. Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to <b>the</b> <b>demon.</b> Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew them closer to his mouth. The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of <b>the</b> <b>demon,</b> who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E

50|$|Vaikundar then {{assembled}} all <b>the</b> <b>demons</b> in one place. He {{made some}} {{persons in the}} gathering, who were accustomed to ‘possession’, to get ‘possessed’ of <b>the</b> <b>demons</b> in <b>the</b> presence of <b>the</b> people. <b>The</b> <b>demons</b> that had ‘come on to these persons’ began to tremble with fear and, by making loud cries, bemoaned their end. Resigned to their fate, they requested Vaikundar {{to tell them the}} modalities to surrender. When <b>the</b> <b>demons</b> asked it themselves, Vaikundar ordered them to make an oath in front of the people that they had surrendered all their powers. Accordingly, <b>the</b> <b>demons</b> made a public oath that they had surrendered all their powers. Then they fled to the mountain and killed themselves by falling into fire. As this happened, those that were dancing due to the ‘possession’ of <b>the</b> <b>demons</b> got exhausted and fell flat on the grounds. As the crowd was witnessing all these happenings, a few shepherds, tending their flock in the mountain, came rushing and reported that they heard the loud cries of <b>the</b> <b>demons</b> as they were falling in the fire. When the crowd heard these, they appreciated <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>demons</b> were destroyed and acknowledged that Vaikundar was really the Narayanar needed for the country.|$|R

5|$|According to mythologist Pattanaik, Mohini {{is just a}} {{disguise}} to delude <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> Bhasmasura, rather than a sexual transformation in this legend. Mohini is a disillusion, Vishnu's maya.|$|E
5|$|After {{falling asleep}} that night, Sam is visited {{in a dream}} by Azazel, who reveals that he has brought them all {{together}} {{so that they can}} fight to the death, with the sole survivor becoming the leader of his army of demons.

Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing <b>the</b> <b>demon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, the two {{follow the}} cloud to a castle. There, the cloud {{condenses}} into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, {{been transformed into a}} hideous demon.

5|$|Another legend about <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than}} the god himself. <b>The</b> <b>demon</b> Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman (extreme chastity).

5|$|As {{they return}} to the human world, Yusuke is {{stripped}} of his detective title as King Enma orders he be captured and executed in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him {{to go on a}} rampage in the human world. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to <b>the</b> <b>Demon</b> Plane.

5|$|Key {{elements}} in the game are negotiation with and the fusion and creation of demons. Encountered in battle, demons can be talked with and negotiated into running from the battle, giving money or items, or joining the player's party. If the negotiation fails, <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> will attack. Once a demon is won over, they are given a loyalty meter which {{is influenced by the}} player's actions. If <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> is treated well and performs actions in battle it approves of, its loyalty will increase. If the opposite occurs, <b>the</b> <b>demon</b> will begin to disobey the protagonist, then leave. Demons can be fused together at a special location in the game called the Hotel Goumaden, where fusions are supervised by the NPC Dr. Victor. Demon fusion is governed by a comparability system, with more favorable fusions emerging from better demon compatibility. Demons can also be fused with weapons to grant stat boosts, and after a certain point in the game artificial demons called Zomas can be used and strengthened through repeated fusions.|$|E

5|$|Muramasa {{takes place}} on Honshu, the main island of the Japanese archipelago, with its overall style and setting drawing heavily upon Japanese {{folklore}} and mythology.
