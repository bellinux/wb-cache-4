40|$|This study {{supplements}} extant {{literature on}} implementation in the European Union (EU). The quantitative analysis, which covers the EU transport acquis, reveals five main findings. First, the EU has a <b>transposition</b> <b>deficit</b> in this area, with almost 70 % of all national legal instruments causing problems. Second, transposition delay is multifaceted. The results provide {{strong support for}} the assertion that distinguishing between the outcomes of the transposition process (on time, short delay or long delay) is a useful method of investigation. Third, factors specific to European directives (level of discretion and transposition deadline) and domestic-level factors (national transposition package and number of veto players) have different effects on the length of delay. Furthermore, the timing of general elections in member states as well as policy (sub) sector-related accidents influence the timeliness of national transposition processes...|$|E
40|$|The EU {{suffers from}} an {{implementation}} deficit. Member states {{often do not}} comply with EU policies, which in turn hampers the process of European integration. This book documents {{the problem with the}} timely transposition of EU directives. It explores the size and the causes of the <b>transposition</b> <b>deficit</b> for the case of the Netherlands. Using a mixed methods design, it critically assesses the explanatory value of several legal and administrative factors, as well as the goodness of fit and several hypotheses flowing from rationalism and constructivism. The main conclusion of this work is that the Netherlands suffers from a structural problem with timely transposition. Domestic politics {{play an important role in}} explaining transposition problems. In theorizing these ‘politics of compliance’, we should not limit our analyses to substantive conflicts but also include the procedural politics that often surround the process of Europeanization.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between administrative co-ordination of EU affairs {{at the national level}} and compliance with EU law. First, we develop two hypotheses about the impact of co-ordination. We expect that the strength of the co-ordination structure (level of centralisation and political support) will improve levels of transposition of EU law. Administrative co-ordination becomes irrelevant, however, for the transposition of EU laws that attain political salience and trigger political opposition. We test these conjectures by an aggregate country-level analysis of transposition rates and a qualitative comparative analysis of eight cases covering two directives. Both analyses support our expectations that strong administrative co-ordination of EU affairs leads to smaller <b>transposition</b> <b>deficits</b> in the aggregate. However, for highly salient directives that touch upon constitutional issues and trigger opposition from political actors outside the executive, administrative co-ordination cannot help. policy coordination; implementation; comparative public policy; administrative adaptation; East-Central Europe; political science...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Western {{infants with}} {{congenital}} heart disease have frequently been reported to have a low birthweight for gestational age. Studies in Asian infants seem to be lacking in this area. This is the first extensive study presenting the birthweight distribution of Chinese newborns with symptomatic {{congenital heart disease}}. Methods: The birth data of 454, mainly southern-Chinese infants with symptomatic cardiovascular defects, born between 1990 and 1995 and admitted to Grantham Hospital, Hong Kong in 1994 and 1995, were analysed retrospectively. Infants with (non) -genetic syndromes or other major extracardiac malformations were excluded. Results: Fifteen per cent of all newborns had a birthweight below the reference mean of - 2 Z-score. After correction for length of gestation, no significant difference could be detected in birthweight between the cyanotic and acyanotic groups, nor between the different haemodynamic disturbances. Infants with atrial or ventricular septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, heart with univentricular atrio-ventricular connection or double outlet right ventricle showed significant birthweight <b>deficits.</b> <b>Transposition</b> of the great arteries {{was not related to}} being small for gestational age. Conclusions: Similar to Western infants, prenatal growth impairment was a common feature in Chinese infants with symptomatic congenital heart disease. The birthweight distribution in Chinese might be comparable to that in Western populations. Exceptions are possibly the high frequency of low birthweight in Chinese newborns with atrial septal defect or a single-ventricle abnormality. Further studies on fetal anthropometry and haemodynamics are necessary to provide insight into the relation between cardiovascular malformations and being small for gestational age. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
