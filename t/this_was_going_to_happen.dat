5|$|Smith {{hoped to}} be posted to Britain {{at the end of}} his training, and was {{initially}} told that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> but he was instead sent to the Middle East. He was despatched to Idku, a small RAF base near Cairo, in late 1942, from where he was posted to an operational training unit based at Baalbek in Lebanon. He spent six weeks there, flying over much of the Levant in a Hawker Hurricane fighter, before being posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron to begin active service, again piloting Hurricanes. The squadron was stationed near the Iranian capital of Tehran when Smith joined it, but it almost immediately transferred to Kirkuk in Iraq, to help guard the oil wells and pipelines there. In March 1943, it was again committed to the Western Desert Campaign in North Africa, having previously served there during 1941–1942, and Smith served on this front as a Hurricane pilot. He was promoted to flying officer on 25 March 1943.|$|E
500|$|Following the episode's release, ScreenRant's Andre Dyce {{reviewed}} the series' ratings performance {{up to that}} point, noting that over 7 million viewers is [...] "still {{a far cry from}} trouble on their own", but as the show [...] "continues to slip in both viewers and demographics, the trend could become problematic." [...] He noted that the drop in viewers from the series premiere, which had [...] "some of the highest ratings in recent history" [...] for ABC, to the second episode was to be expected, but [...] "the fact that [...] can’t seem to hold steady in its fifth week is a sign that it may be charting troubled waters ... A rocky start is to be expected, but by this point in the season, most procedural dramas tend to have hit their pace both in structure and audience." [...] He remembered that much of the MCU films' large fanbase had been expected to watch the series and provide [...] "a healthy viewership", and how, if <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> [...] "enthusiasm seems to be waning" [...] among those fans now.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, in the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} released by HBO for [...] "The Door", David Benioff and D. B. Weiss {{revealed that the}} closing scene involving Hodor's name origin and subsequent death was an idea that was presented to them directly from George R. R. Martin. Benioff stated, [...] "We had this meeting with George Martin where we're trying {{to get as much}} information as possible out of him, and probably the most shocking revelation he had for us was when he told us the origin of Hodor and how that name came about. I just remember Dan and I looking at each other when he said that and just being like, 'Holy shit.'" [...] Weiss continued, [...] "It {{was just one of the}} saddest and most affecting things. Even sitting in a hotel room having someone tell you <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in the abstract in some way and that 'hold the door' was the origin of the name Hodor, we just thought that was a really, really heart-breaking idea." ...|$|E

500|$|Hearing {{reports of}} the heavy {{fighting}} taking place between the junction and the Chinese Farm, Dayan suggested withdrawing Matt's brigade and canceling the operation. He voiced concerns that the paratroopers were threatened with annihilation and noted that all attempts to open a corridor for the bridges had failed. Gonen rejected the suggestion, stating that, [...] "If we knew in advance <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> {{we would not have}} started the crossing operation, but now that we have crossed then let us follow through to the bitter end." [...] Bar-Lev concurred with Gonen, and Dayan decided not to press his suggestion. At around 6:00 AM, Golda Meir telephoned Dayan to inquire about the situation. Dayan informed her that the bridges had not yet been laid and that the Egyptians had closed the routes leading to Deveroir. He also stated there were high hopes that Egyptian resistance would be overcome and that the bridges would be laid during the morning. Dayan also told her that Matt's paratrooper brigade had crossed to the west bank without encountering resistance and that Southern Command, as yet, had no intentions of withdrawing the brigade, even if the bridge-laying was delayed.|$|E
2500|$|Nimoy {{returned}} for [...] {{with the promise}} of a dramatic death scene. Nimoy enjoyed the production of the film so much that he asked if the previously irrevocable death could be reversed. Nimoy did not know how <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> until he saw the film. To facilitate his return in the following film, Paramount executives agreed that Nimoy could direct it and following the success, he was asked to direct once more for [...] The call for Spock to betray Kirk and side with his half-brother Sybok in [...] was changed at Nimoy's insistence, as he felt the character had already comes to terms with his human-side and Sybok would have no influence on him. Nimoy organised , appointing the director, writers and producers. To hand over to [...] at the time of The Undiscovered Country, Nimoy agreed to appear as Spock in the episode [...] "Unification". Nimoy subsequently turned down the directing role on Star Trek Generations as the role for Spock was limited; the character's lines were subsequently given to Chekov and Scotty.|$|E
60|$|There is {{a little}} talk about Mr Dombey, but very little. It is chiefly {{speculation}} as to how long he has known that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Cook says shrewdly, 'Oh a long time, bless you! Take your oath of that.' And reference being made to Mr Perch, he confirms her view of the case. Somebody wonders what he'll do, and whether he'll go out in any situation. Mr Towlinson thinks not, and hints at a refuge {{in one of them}} genteel almshouses of the better kind. 'Ah, where he'll have his little garden, you know,' says Cook plaintively, 'and bring up sweet peas in the spring.' 'Exactly so,' says Mr Towlinson, 'and be one of the Brethren of something or another.' 'We are all brethren,' says Mrs Perch, in a pause of her drink. 'Except the sisters,' says Mr Perch. 'How are the mighty fallen!' remarks Cook. 'Pride shall have a fall, and it always was and will be so!' observes the housemaid.|$|E

50|$|De Roche later {{expressed}} some {{dissatisfaction with}} the film:Unfortunately, the bush {{comes across as a}} threat too early; it should have emerged as a threat only after the audience had sympathized with the animals. And I don’t think that sympathy is there. Long Weekend would have been much better if the audience had been told at the beginning that Peter and Marcia were going to die. This way, it wouldn’t have had to sympathize with them, and could have concerned itself solely with when <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Such is the essence of suspense.|$|E
5000|$|The task of {{updating}} the Build engine to a true 3D renderer was taken on by Silverman himself.

Well, {{after a few months}} passed, I saw no sign of somebody working on a true hardware-accelerated port of Build, just people saying it wasn't possible. Eventually, I realized the only way <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> was for me to do it myself." ...|$|E

5000|$|After the Apollo 1 {{accident}} in 1967, Webb told the media, [...] "We've {{always known that}} something like <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> sooner or later. ...

[...] Webb went to President Johnson and asked that NASA be allowed to handle the {{accident in}}vestigation, and to direct its recovery, according to a procedure established following the in-flight accident on Gemini 8. He promised to be truthful in assessing blame, and he pledged to assign that to himself and NASA management, as appropriate. The agency set out to discover the details of the tragedy, to correct problems, and to continue progress toward the Apollo 11 lunar landing.|$|E

Manfred Mann were so amazed by them {{that they wanted to}} take them as their support for their UK tour, but the negotiations failed. It has been rumoured that The Beatmen were not allowed to go unless Olympic, by then the most successful Czechoslovak rock 'n' roll band from Prague, was to go too. It was not usual that a Slovak act overshadowed a big and stable Czech one and many people were not happy about this fact. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> several times in the future, e.g. when Slovak Miroslav Žbirka was voted the best male singer of the country instead of the by-then annual winner Karel Gott in 1982. Manfred Mann's management didn't agree on Olympic and so The Beatmen were not allowed to go.|$|E
