5|$|Destiny 2 {{was later}} ported to the PSP. Development began in 2005, after the {{commercial}} success of Eternias PSP port. The port {{was developed by}} Alfa System, a frequent collaborator with the Tales team on spin-off titles. The project was directed by Yoshito Higuchi, who had worked on Destiny 2 and became {{the director of the}} GameCube port of Tales of Symphonia. While the earlier port of Destiny made significant changes, the Destiny 2 port was meant to preserve and add onto the content of the original. Some of <b>the</b> <b>adjustments</b> included minor tweaks to gameplay, adjustments to fit the PSP's control layout, and adjusting the graphics from 4:3 to 16:9 screen ratio. A new dungeon featuring added story elements was also created. It was released on February 15, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Development of Life Is Strange {{began in}} April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both {{financial}} and creative.

Player feedback influenced <b>the</b> <b>adjustments</b> made to the episodes. Story and character arc serve as the central point in the game rather than traditional graphic adventure tropes like point-and-click puzzles. The voice recording sessions took place in Los Angeles.|$|E
40|$|Least squares {{adjustment}} problems are considered {{in which the}} condition equations are nonlinear in both the observations and <b>the</b> <b>adjustment</b> parameters ('unknowns'). A solution algorithm is presented which {{takes into account the}} second (as well as the first) order derivatives in <b>the</b> <b>adjustment</b> residuals (observation errors) and the corrections to the initially available approximations to <b>the</b> <b>adjustment</b> parameters. <b>The</b> inclusion of second-order terms in <b>the</b> <b>adjustment</b> residuals is necessary whenever <b>the</b> <b>adjustment</b> residuals themselves cannot be regarded as negligible as compared to <b>the</b> <b>adjustment</b> parameters, i. e., whenever the linearized condition equations would no longer be practically equivalent to the rigorous ones.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of complex least squares <b>{{adjustment}}</b> method (CLSAM), <b>the</b> theory of complex total least squares adjustment method (CTLSAM) is proposed. The algorithms of complex total least squares and complex LS-TLS method are derived. Through two examples, the complex LS method under <b>the</b> <b>adjustment</b> criterions that minimize the sum of squares of the module of observation vector residual (adjustment criterion 1) and the sum of squares of the real part and imaginary part of <b>the</b> observation vector (<b>adjustment</b> criterion 2), <b>the</b> complex TLS method under <b>the</b> <b>adjustment</b> criterions that minimize the sum of squares of the module of observation vector and coefficient matrix residual (adjustment criterion 3) and the sum of squares of the real part and imaginary part of the observation vector and coefficient matrix residual (adjustment criterion 4) are compared and analyzed respectively.

5|$|According to Yoichi Wada, then-CEO of Square Enix, XIV {{was being}} planned {{as a serious}} rival to {{successful}} western MMORPG World of Warcraft. The game was developed primarily for Windows, and was then ported across to PS3. XIV was originally scheduled for simultaneous release on Windows and PS3 in 2010, but the PS3 version was delayed into 2011. This was explained as due to it taking longer than expected to make <b>the</b> <b>adjustments</b> needed so the game could fit within the console's limited memory. The game {{did not use the}} PlayOnline service used for XI. This was explained as being due to the marked decrease of content on the service. Instead, they would migrate to a new service that still allowed cross-platform gameplay, including the use of a universal Square Enix ID that would allow players to play from wherever they left off. In October 2009, the game's Beta release was announced as being only for Windows. First print runs of the PS3 version of Final Fantasy XIII contained a bonus code for the PS3 version of XIV for a special in-game item.|$|E

Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from the blocks to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force.

While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for <b>the</b> <b>adjustments</b> ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines.

They arrive it time for Duggan to knock Scaroth out before he can reach the ship. Scaroth's body returns to the present, and when his alien form is discovered by his bodyguard, they get into a fight that damages the equipment and sets the mansion on fire, killing them both. By the time the Doctor, Romana and Duggan arrive, the original Mona Lisa and 5 of the 6 copies have been burnt, but the last copy remains safe. Duggan argues that they've lost an invaluable piece of art, but the Doctor assures him that the copy, still done by da Vinci's hand, will go unnoticed, and that art is worthless if its monetary value is all that matters. The Doctor and Romana say goodbye to Duggan at the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

25|$|Halladay's fastball was clocked up to , but it {{had little}} movement, and his pitches were up in the strike zone, which was {{ultimately}} the reason why his 2000 season was so unsuccessful. He worked with former Blue Jays pitching coach Mel Queen. The problem, Queen realized, was Halladay's total reliance on his strength—his attempt to overpower batters with straight-ahead pitches. Within two weeks, Halladay had altered his arm angle for a more deceptive delivery, and added pitches that sank and careened. Instead of throwing over the top, he chose to use a three-quarters delivery (the middle point between throwing overhand and sidearm). Originally a fastball pitcher, he became reliant on keeping his pitches low across the plate, regardless {{of the type of}} pitch thrown. <b>The</b> <b>adjustments</b> proved successful. After a month and a half, he was promoted to Double-A Tennessee, and a month later, to Triple-A Syracuse. By mid-season, he was back in the Blue Jays' rotation. He posted a 5–3 win–loss record with a 3.19 ERA for the Blue Jays in 16 starts in 2001.|$|E
