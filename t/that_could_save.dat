The first steps {{in the development of}} stem cell studies occurred in Israel, with research in this field dating back to studies of bone marrow stem cells in the early 1960s. By 2006, Israeli scientists were leaders on a per capita basis in the number of articles published in scientific journals related to {{stem cell research}}. In 2011, Israeli scientist Inbar Friedrich Ben-Nun led a team which produced the first stem cells from endangered species, a breakthrough <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>save</b> animals in danger of extinction. In 2012, Israel was one of the world leaders in stem cell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita.|$|E

Verdugo then tried to starve the surrounding area so as to make sure the town held out longer but the besiegers however, had ensured a sufficient supply of food and ammunition.

At a cabin, while a storm goes on outside, Babe helps Bianca give birth to her baby daughter, Miranda Montgomery. Bianca falls unconscious and Babe leaves to go get help.

The day before (on One Life to Live), Paul helped his sister, Kelly, {{give birth to a}} baby boy, but the baby died right after birth.

25|$|Some Medicare {{supplemental}} insurance (or “Medigap”) plans {{cover all}} of an enrollee's cost-sharing, insulating them from any out-of-pocket costs and guaranteeing financial security to individuals with significant health care needs. Many policymakers {{believe that such}} plans raise the cost of Medicare by creating a perverse incentive that leads patients to seek unnecessary, costly treatments. Many argue that unnecessary treatments are {{a major cause of}} rising costs and propose that people with Medicare should feel more of the cost of their care to create incentives to seek the most efficient alternatives. Various restrictions and surcharges on Medigap coverage have appeared in recent deficit reduction proposals. One of the furthest-reaching reforms proposed, which would prevent Medigap from covering any of the first $500 of coinsurance charges and limit it to covering 50 percent of all costs beyond <b>that,</b> <b>could</b> <b>save</b> $50 billion over 10 years.

The society noted that studies had shown that patients without insurance were more than twice as likely to have their cancer diagnosed in the late stages of the disease.

They were protected (as he believed) by the elite Xiaoguo Army (驍果). [...] However, by this point, even the Xiaoguo soldiers were plotting rebellion, as they missed their families in the north. [...] When a lady in waiting reported the plot to Empress Xiao, she told the lady in waiting, [...] "I will let you report it to the emperor." [...] Emperor Yang, not willing to hear any bad news, however, instead executed the lady in waiting. Later, when other ladies in waiting wanted {{to report on the}} plot, Empress Xiao advised them against it, reasoning that there was nothing left <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>save</b> the dynasty. Soon, a plot led by the general Yuwen Huaji came to fruition, and Emperor Yang, along with his sons Yang Jian and Yang Gao and grandson Yang Tan the Prince of Yan were killed.

2500|$|Further studies, e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems {{referred}} {{to the role of}} the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge. The Science wars of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while scientism, a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies. However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. Bruno Latour noted that [...] "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>save</b> our lives. [...] Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the {{availability}} of bit-slice and 16-bit microprocessors started to revolutionize high-resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became intelligent, semi-standalone and standalone workstations. Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and mini-computers. Typical of the early move to high-resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from Bell-Northern Research, and led by David Pearson, an early workstation pioneer. The Orca 3000 was based on Motorola 68000 and AMD bit-slice processors and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector. Artists and graphic designers {{began to see the}} personal computer, particularly the Commodore Amiga and Macintosh, as a serious design tool, one <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>save</b> time and draw more accurately than other methods. [...] The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses. Modern computers, dating from the 1980s, often use graphical user interfaces (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text. Graphics are one of the five key elements of multimedia technology.|$|E

60|$|NAPOLEON (quickly). What? (The {{hand holding}} the paper involuntarily drops. The lady {{looks at him}} enigmatically in {{tranquil}} silence.

First, my information as to Beaulieu's retreat.

He promised to take steps in earnest for the final settlement with the creditors; and though still far from the last act, Clara began to consider of hastening her plans. It was exceedingly doubtful whether Oliver would hear of living at Dynevor Terrace, and Clara could not be separated from him; besides which, she was resolved that her brother should not be burthened, and she would give James no promises, conditional or otherwise.|$|E
