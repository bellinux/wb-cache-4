25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> look {{up for the}} {{franchise}} in 1990. On Week 1 Dallas won their first home game since September 1988 when they defeated the San Diego Chargers 17–14.

25|$|Conditions in {{the camp}} were {{initially}} quite poor, as the dire situation of the British economy prevented the Army from providing more than the bare necessities at first. There was not enough food, clothing and living space. In October 1945, there was a hunger strike and demonstration against conditions {{in the camp}}. <b>Things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> improve only {{by the summer of}} 1946, when the population had decreased.|$|E

The enemy kept on firing at them and soon Seel's companion was killed. He spent three days there, close to madness, believing himself forgotten.|$|E

25|$|With {{expectations}} high at Edgbaston, Warwickshire entertained Somerset in {{the first}} clash of the 2004 season. The Bears secured victory by 7 wickets. After Warwickshire lost to Glamorgan (by 26 runs), <b>things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> look bad for the Bears. Defeats against Worcestershire (by 3 wickets), and Northamptonshire (by 4 wickets), left the team in danger of not qualifying for the Quarter-Finals, but victory over Gloucestershire (by 2 wickets) on the last day, meant that Warwickshire qualified {{as one of the}} best third-placed team.|$|E
25|$|That {{was the end}} as far as Schofield's brief {{relationship}} with an England cap was concerned. He returned to his county, and though he was picked for another A tour to the West Indies in 2000–01 <b>things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> fall apart shortly afterwards. In 2001 he took only 14 wickets {{at an average of}} over 54, though 26 wickets at 18.53 in List A cricket were a compensation, and although his average of 18.38 in 2002 looked better it was deceptive: Schofield was bowled only 122 first-class overs in total that summer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, clothes were mostly sold by {{individual}} shopkeepers who were often the artisans {{who made the}} goods. Customers usually {{lived in the same}} neighborhood as the shops and the shops would gain popularity by their customers’ word-of–mouth recommendation, with the exception of warehouses (i.e., any retail on wholesale), where goods being sold were not necessarily made in the shop. However, <b>things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> change during the transition to the 19th century. People sought efficiency and variety; {{under the influence of the}} Industrial Revolution, improved transportation and introduction of machines in manufacturing allowed fashion to develop at an even faster pace.|$|E

25|$|By {{the third}} round <b>things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> get interesting. Amelita, David and Hayley took up the {{challenge}} in the Australian-themed episode. Amelita's signature dish was an organic rib fillet with shaved ham, banana, and hollandaise sauce. Ben's comments were 'You eat with your eyes and that is beating me to death!' Amelita fired back saying 'Your shoes are beating me to death.' It did her no favours. David cooked up a delightful black sesame seed-crusted tuna which was favoured among the judges. Hayley's simple salmon on potato rösti was elegant and delighted the judges who commented on her presentation in particular the height. Despite her good looks and clever articulation it was David who was chosen to go through to the semi finals.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the war the {{hospital}} in Martin had suffered serious damage. The consequences of fighting had taken its toll and buildings were in need of significant structural repair. It had also become necessary to supplement the lack of medical and technical material. Dr. Jàn Longauer became the new manager and <b>things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> improve. A new generation of doctors arrived who contributed to the growth of professional and social prestige. One of those doctors was Dr. Vladimir Galanda who in Turiec developed a high level of medical care for children. Another was the father of modern Czechoslovak cardiac surgery Pavol Steiner, who performed in Martin the first open cardiac surgery in Slovakia. By the 1960s it had become a teaching hospital serving medical students from nearby Jessenius School of Medicine, and new departments were added continuously.|$|E
25|$|UK {{soap operas}} {{for many years}} usually only aired two nights a week. The {{exception}} was the original Crossroads, which began as a weekdaily soap opera in the 1960s, but later had its number of weekly broadcasts reduced. <b>Things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> change in 1989 when Coronation Street began airing three times a week. In 1996, it expanded again, to air four episodes a week. Brookside premiered in 1982 with two episodes a week. In 1990, it expanded to three episodes a week; the trend was followed by EastEnders in 1994 and Emmerdale in 1997, In 2000, the soap went five episodes a week. Family Affairs debuted as a weekdaily soap in 1997, producing five episodes a week throughout its entire run. The imported Neighbours screens as five new episodes a week, which are shown once at 1:45p.m. and repeated at 5:30p.m. on Channel 5 each weekday.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{the raid}} went well, and they met no {{resistance}} entering the town. They cut the telegraph wires and easily captured the armory, which was being defended {{by a single}} watchman. They next rounded up hostages from nearby farms, including Colonel Lewis Washington, great-grandnephew of George Washington. They also spread the news to the local slaves that their liberation was at hand. <b>Things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> go wrong when an eastbound Baltimore & Ohio train approached the town. The train's baggage master tried to warn the passengers. Brown's men yelled for him to halt and then opened fire. The baggage master, Hayward Shepherd, became the first casualty of Brown's war against slavery. Ironically, Shepherd was a free black man. Two of the hostages' slaves also died in the raid. For some reason, after the shooting of Shepherd, Brown allowed the train to continue on its way.|$|E
25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> {{change when}} during the European renaissance, the high heel became a status symbol worn by {{both male and}} females from the higher social statuses. Catherine de' Medici, a Franco/Italian noblewoman, pioneered the use of heels as a fashion statement. Catherine de Medici is {{believed}} to have worn them to impress the French court when she wed the Duke of Orleans, the future king. It {{is believed to be the}} first instance when heels were worn however, this reference may be apocryphal, as the development of heels did not begin to come about until the late 1580s, based on iconographic evidence and extant pieces. Two hundred years later King Louis XIV of France decreed that only nobility could wear heels, and that only members of his specific court could wear red ones. Seventeenth-century portraits of King Louis XIV depict the various intricate heels worn by the king and they were often decorated with miniature battle scenes.|$|E
25|$|But {{just as the}} war seemed {{decided in}} the allies' favour, <b>things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> go wrong. The Greek {{commander}} Michael Palaeologus alienated some of his allies by his arrogance, and this stalled the campaign as rebel Count Robert of Loritello refused to speak to him. Although the two were reconciled, the campaign {{lost some of its}} momentum. Worse was to come: Michael was soon recalled to Constantinople. Although his arrogance had slowed the campaign, he was a brilliant general in the field, and his loss was a major blow to the allied campaign. The turning point was the battle for Brindisi, where the Sicilians launched a major counterattack by both land and sea. At the approach of the enemy, the mercenaries who were serving in the allied armies demanded impossible increases in their pay; when these were refused, they deserted. Even the local barons started to melt away, and soon Adrian's Byzantine allies were left hopelessly outnumbered. The naval battle was decided in the Sicilians' favour, and the Byzantine commander was captured. The defeat at Brindisi {{put an end to the}} restored Byzantine reign in Italy, and by 1158 the Byzantine Army had left Italy.|$|E

25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> look {{up for the}} Dutch in {{the naval}} war also. Both {{countries}} had {{each other in a}} strategic death-grip. The English might be stronger in their home waters, but as in the first Anglo-Dutch conflict, the Dutch were able to close down English communications farther afield. This time also, the Danes joined the war on the Dutch side, shored up by a Dutch fleet, and closed the Sound to English shipping and trade. The Hanseatics, on the other hand, ostensibly neutral, helped the Dutch circumvent any English blockades. In the Mediterranean the parties made trade impossible for each other. In the East Indies the VOC swept the EIC from the seas and took this opportunity to help itself to the last remaining English toeholds in the Indonesian archipelago. In other words, English trade was devastated, with predictable results for the economy, and for Charles' finances. This was the crucial factor. The English might arguably win a few more naval battles, and even inflict appreciable damage, as in the raid by admiral Holmes in August, 1666, but the end was never in doubt. The strangulating grip of the Dutch blockade got worse by the day, even preventing coal from Newcastle reaching cold Londoners during the winter of 1666.|$|E

Drake, who {{by this time}} was smoking what Kirby has described as [...] "unbelievable amounts" [...] of cannabis and exhibiting [...] "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time.

500|$|Because of the {{successful}} media blitz, she quickly became a household name. In 1960, Mansfield topped press polls for more words in print {{than anyone else in}} the world, made more personal appearances than a political candidate, and was regarded as the world's most-photographed Hollywood celebrity. She made news on a regular basis, from dresses falling off, to clothing that burst strategically at the seams, to low cut dresses worn without a bra. <b>Things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> get over the top, even by her standards, when she took charge of her own publicity without advice. According to Shiffrin, [...] "She became a freak." [...] James Bacon wrote in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner in 1973, [...] "Here was a girl with real comedy talent, spectacular figure and looks and yet ridiculed herself out of business by outlandish publicity." ...|$|E

500|$|Other symbols, images, and allusions that {{appeared}} throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly. Moore mentioned that [...] "he whole thing with Watchmen {{has just been}} loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping {{up all over the}} place". Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic, citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship. In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the Galle crater, which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue. Moore said, [...] "We found a lot of these <b>things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> generate themselves as if by magic", in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the [...] "Gordian Knot Lock Company".|$|E
500|$|On 13 February 1997, Prost {{bought the}} Ligier team from Flavio Briatore and renamed it [...] "Prost Grand Prix". The {{day after he}} bought the team, Prost signed a three-year deal with French car {{manufacturer}} Peugeot, who would supply the team with engines from [...] until [...] For the team's first season, Prost kept one of Ligier's 1996 drivers, Olivier Panis, who had won the Monaco Grand Prix the previous year; Japanese driver Shinji Nakano was signed to partner Panis. The team raced with the Mugen-Honda engines used by Ligier the previous season, while the car was actually the originally intended Ligier JS45, but was renamed the Prost JS45. Things looked promising {{at the start of}} the season, as the team picked up two points on its Grand Prix debut in Australia when Olivier Panis finished fifth. The team scored a further 13 points before Panis broke his leg in an accident during the Canadian Grand Prix. He was replaced by Minardi's Jarno Trulli. From there, <b>things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> go downhill slightly, the team scored only five points during Panis's recovery. The Frenchman came back at the end of the season to race the final three Grand Prix. Prost GP finished sixth in the Constructors' Championship in its first season, with 21 points.|$|E
500|$|During game six, Valeri Kharlamov was {{targeted}} by Team Canada for attention. According to Conacher, [...] "every {{time they get}} a chance, they're taking him for a rough ride along the boards." [...] Kharlamov {{was the target of}} numerous bodychecks by Brad Park. <b>Things</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> heat up in the second period. Kharlamov had knocked down Bobby Clarke, who in retaliation, rubbed Kharlamov's face with his glove to raise Kharlamov's temper and the two exchanged punches. Bergman then stepped in and bumped into Kharlamov and harassed him {{all the way back to}} the bench. Peter Mahovlich later elbowed Kharlamov, who retaliated by dumping Mahovlich to the ice. Later, Clarke raced down the ice to catch a streaking Kharlamov and deliberately slashed Kharlamov's already sore ankle, injuring it and according to reports, fracturing it. Kharlamov skated over to the Canadian bench and yelled at the Canadians, before limping off the ice to the dressing room. The referees handed Clarke a minor penalty for slashing and an additional 10-minute misconduct penalty. Later, with Clarke still stuck in the box serving the misconduct, the referees also gave Dennis Hull a slashing penalty, during which Yakushev scored. On his injured ankle, Kharlamov returned to play and very nearly scored on Dryden during a power play later in the second period.|$|E
