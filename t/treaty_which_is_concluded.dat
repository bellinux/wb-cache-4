Ray wrote President John Quincy Adams requesting a treaty to acquire land for the project.

5000|$|The Allied Powers were {{initially}} reluctant to recognise the <b>treaty,</b> <b>which</b> had <b>been</b> <b>concluded</b> without their participation. Their postwar conferences had supported the Curzon Line as the Polish-Russian border, and Poland's territorial {{gains in the}} treaty lay about 250 km east of that line. French support led to its recognition in March 1923 by France, Great Britain, Italy and Japan, followed by the US in April. In Poland, the Peace of Riga was met with criticism from the very beginning. Some characterised the treaty as short-sighted and argued {{that much of what}} Poland had gained during the Polish-Soviet war was lost during the peace negotiations. Józef Piłsudski had participated in the Riga negotiations only as an observer, and called the resulting treaty [...] "an act of cowardice". Piłsudski felt the agreement was a shameless and short-sighted political calculation, with Poland abandoning its Ukrainian allies. On 15 May 1921 he apologised to Ukrainian soldiers during his visit to the internment camp at Kalisz. The treaty substantially contributed to the failure of Piłsudski's plan to create a Polish-led Intermarium federation of Eastern European countries, as portions of the territory proposed for the federation were ceded to the Soviets.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly, from July 1581 to March 1595, {{analysing}} the role {{he played in the}} confessional politics of the period (both national and internation) and how a strong Catholic magnate affected the balance of power and wider policy decisions in Scotland. The thesis is a narrative, with comentary on the political events of the reign of James VI, including the relationship Huntly had with James VI and the wider repercussions thereof. Huntly returned to Scotland from France in July 1581, becoming a courtier and an adherent of Esme Stewart, duke of Lennox. He served a political apprenticeship to Lennox and was exposed to covert Catholic politicking, {{as well as to the}} nascent Jesuit mission in Scotland. After James was captured by the Ruthven Raiders in August 1582, Huntly entered politics in his own right, becoming influential in the opposition to the rithven regime. Huntly assisted in enforcing the regime change when James escaped from the Ruthven lords in June 1583, his loyalty to the king winning James's trust and close friendship - the dividends of which he reaped throughout his life. Huntly initially supported the new administration under James Stewart, earl of Arran and assiduously attended to his duties in both the locality and the central government. Following Arran's fall in November 1585, Huntly deliberately distanced himself from the Court and the new Anglophile government. He opposed the anglo-Scottish <b>treaty</b> <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> in July 1586 and worked hard to counter the rise of John Maitland of Thirlestane. For the first time, Huntly made contact with the European counter-Reformation in Apriland May 1586. The period June 1587 to April 1589 was marked by faction fighting between Huntly and Maitland, who were both instrumental in James' pursuit of diametrically opposed policies. The discovery of Huntly's covert correspondece with Spain in February 1589 made his Catholic politicking public, subsequently colouring the conflict vetween Maitland and Huntly with confessional politics. Events excalated until Huntly mustered troops on the field of Brig o' Dee near Aberdeen, Although Huntly refused to meet the king on the field, Maitland's vitory was only parial. Brig o' Dee was not the manifestation of the politics of the Counter-Reformation in Scotland, but the productof years of faction fighting between Maitland and Huntly. The period of January 1590 to March 1595 was characterised by Hunrly's continuing influence at Court with marked favour from James and his bloodfeud with James Stewart, second earl of Moray. Huntly used his twin centres of influnce, the Court and power in the region, to fight a vivious and protacted bloodfeud with Moray and his faction. The interception of the Spanish Blanks at the end of 1592 brought confessional politics to bear on a purely secular bloodfeud. Political agitation from the Kirk and Stewarts caused James to commission an army under Archibald Campbell, seventh earl of Argyll to pursue Huntly in October 1594. The result was the battle of Glenlivet between Huntly and Argyll which came to represent the fight against Catholicism, although its root cause was Huntly's bloodfeud with Moray and the Stewarts. When James later raised his own army and marched north against Huntly, the early refused to face James on the field and in March 1595 he voluntarily went into exile abroad. This ended the most active phase of huntly's participation in national and international politics; after his political rehabilitation in 1597, he no longer played an influential role in the king's domestic or foreign policies. Overall, the thesis agues that Huntly needs to be understood as a political faction leader, whose Catholicism was a tool he eomplyed to widen his political influence but not the determinant of all his actions...|$|R

It will interest many of your readers to know why this, that, and the other provision was incorporated in the treaty; it will interest others to know in what manner and to what extent the treaty will affect our existing relations with China. Apart from its grave importance, the subject is really as entertaining as any I know of and--asking pardon for the presumption--I desire to write a few paragraphs upon it.

40|$|The {{focal point}} {{of this study is}} the legal rules which govern {{international}} labour migration. It attempts to explore and critically analyse the relationships between international labour migration as an economic phenomenon and the legal norms which affect and influence this process. Firstly, it underlines the importance of the legal thinking in providing adequate protection to migrant workers and members of their families. Secondly, it argues for establishing an international legal framework to regulate and harmonize the national immigration policies of States. Chapter Two examines the economics of international labour migration, the economic function and the social status of migrant labour in the receiving States. The focus is on the post Second World War migratory flow to France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. Chapter Three analyses the national laws of the receiving States. It concentrates on the issues of residence, work permit systems, family reunification and the social security systems of the receiving States. Chapter Four is concerned with the international recruitment agreements <b>which</b> have <b>been</b> <b>concluded</b> after the Second World War period and registered with the UN Secretariat. The provisions of these treaties are compared with the provisions of investment <b>treaties</b> <b>which</b> have also <b>been</b> <b>concluded</b> between the same parties, and with the ILO model agreement on temporary migration for employment. Chapter Five explores the relations between the existing international human rights instruments and the immigration laws of the selected States and the adequacy and the capacity of these instruments in protecting migrant workers...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the former disputes between Saudi Arabia and Yemen over title to the territories of' Asir, Jizan, Najran and the Rub' Al-Khali Desert frontier. Although the disputes were settled by the 2000 Treaty of Jeddah, it was possible right until the conclusion of that agreement that one of the disputing states could have submitted the disputes to arbitration, in which case the legal claims made by each state would have been highly significant. After examining the political and historical background of the disputed territories, the thesis examines three legal phases of the disputes. The first phase of the analysis is to identify the nature of claims: were they title or boundary claims or a combination of the two. The analysis shows that the two states asserted claims of both a title and a boundary nature, although the focus of this thesis is primarily on the title claims. It appears from the analysis that the title claims fall into two categories: claims related to international treaties and claims based on title acquisition modes. The second legal phase of the analysis will therefore concentrate on claims related to the two treaties that were pertinent to the disputes: the 1914 Anglo-Turkish Convention and the 1934 Treaty of Taif. The first treaty arguably delimited a boundary line, the 'Violet Line', located in the Rub' Al-Khali Desert. However, this purported delimitation {{was the subject of a}} series of claims and counter-claims between Saudi Arabia and Britain from 1934, until southern Yemen's independence in 1967, which put into doubt the continuing validity of the delimitation. This phase of the analysis considers arguments of Saudi succession to the treaty and the validity of the conclusion of the 1914 Convention by the Ottoman Empire. The second relevant treaty was the 1934 <b>Treaty</b> of Taif <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> by Saudi Arabia and northern Yemen following a short war, the two states having failed to settle title claims to 'Asir, Jizan and Najran through negotiations. Under the 1934 Treaty, Yemen renounced former title claims to these provinces, which she had formerly raised during the 1927 - 1934 negotiations. She also agreed with Saudi Arabia on a boundary line. However, from the mid-late 1970 s, Yemen resumed its former title claims on various grounds, including the invalidity or termination of the 1934 Treaty. These claims will also be considered in the second phase of the analysis. The third phase of the analysis considers various arguments based on title acquisition/loss modes recognised by international law, such as cession, conquest, and prescription. It seeks to determine which of the two states had stronger claims to title to the disputed territories. Finally, the settlement in the 2000 Treaty of Jeddah is examined and it is asked to what extent the two states respected or ignored their former legal claims in the political settlement. It will also discuss any problems arising from the application of the 2000 Treaty...|$|R
6000|$|Henry Clay {{was born}} on the twelfth day of April, 1777, in Hanover County, Virginia. Of his father, {{who died in the}} fourth or fifth year of Henry's age, little seems to be known, except that he was a respectable man and a preacher of the Baptist persuasion. Mr. Clay's {{education}} to the end of life was comparatively limited. I say [...] "to the end of life," [...] because I have understood that from time to time he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life. Mr. Clay's lack of a more perfect early education, however it may be regretted generally, teaches at least one profitable lesson: it teaches that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that, if he will, he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably. In his twenty-third year Mr. Clay was licensed to practise law, and emigrated to Lexington, Kentucky. Here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803, when he was first elected to the Kentucky Legislature. By successive elections he was continued in the Legislature till the latter part of 1806, when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the United States Senate. In 1807 he was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, and by that body chosen Speaker. In 1808 he was re-elected to the same body. In 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy of two years in the United States Senate. In 1811 {{he was elected to the}} United States House of Representatives, and on the first day of taking his seat in that body he was chosen its Speaker. In 1813 he was again elected Speaker. Early in 1814, being the period of our last British war, Mr. Clay was sent as commissioner, with others, to negotiate a <b>treaty</b> of peace, <b>which</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> in the latter part of the same year. On his return from Europe he was again elected to the lower branch of Congress, and on taking his seat in December, 1815, was called to his old post-the Speaker's chair, a position in <b>which</b> he <b>was</b> retained by successive elections, with one brief intermission, till the inauguration of John Quincy Adams, in March, 1825. He was then appointed Secretary of State, and occupied that important station till the inauguration of General Jackson, in March, 1829. After this he returned to Kentucky, resumed the practice of law, and continued it till the autumn of 1831, when he was by the Legislature of Kentucky again placed in the United States Senate. By a reelection he was continued in the Senate till he resigned his seat and retired, in March, 1848. In December, 1849, he again took his seat in the Senate, which he again resigned only a few months before his death.|$|R
