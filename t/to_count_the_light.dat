40|$|We study {{geometric}} engineering of Argyres–Douglas superconformal theories {{realized by}} type IIB strings propagating in singular Calabi–Yau threefolds. We use this construction <b>to</b> <b>count</b> <b>the</b> degeneracy of <b>light</b> BPS states under small perturbations {{away from the}} conformal point, by computing the degeneracy of D 3 –branes wrapped around supersymmetric 3 –cycles in the Calabi–Yau. We find finitely many BPS states, the number of which depends on how this deformation is done, similarly to the degeneracy of kink solutions for the deformation of N = 2 Landau–Ginzburg superconformal theories in two dimensions. Also, some aspects of worldsheet theories near general Calabi–Yau singularities are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} of an Internal Reflection Cherenkov, {{equipped with a}} SiO 2 (fused silica) radiator bar optically connected to a cylindrical mirror, was tested at CERN SPS in March 2015 with a beam of relativistic ions obtained from fragmentation of primary argon nuclei at energies 13, 19 and 30 GeV/n. The detector, designed to identify cosmic nuclei, features an imaging focal plane of dimensions similar to 4 cm x 3 cm equipped with 16 arrays of NUV-SiPM (near-ultraviolet sensitive silicon photon avalanche detector) {{for a total of}} 1024 sensitive elements. The outstanding performance of the photodetectors (with negligible background in between adjacent photopeaks) allowed us to apply the technique of photon <b>counting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cherenkov <b>light</b> collected on <b>the</b> focal plane. Thanks to the fine granularity of the array elements, the Cherenkov pattern was recorded together with the total number of detected photoelectrons increasing as Z(2) {{as a function of the}} atomic number Z. In this paper, we report the performance of the SiPM arrays and the excellent resolution achieved by the digital Cherenkov prototype in the charge identification of the elements present in the beam.

40|$|In this paper, we derive in a {{much detail}} <b>the</b> formula of <b>count</b> rates, {{in terms of the}} {{integral}} of time, of gamma-ray bursts in the framework of fireballs, where the Doppler effect of the expanding fireball surface is the key factor to be concerned. Effects arising from the limit of the time delay due to the limited regions of the emitting areas in the fireball surface and other factors are investigated. Our analysis shows that the formula of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> rate of fireballs can be expressed as a function of τ which is the observation time scale relative to the dynamical time scale of the fireball. <b>The</b> profile of <b>light</b> curves of fireballs depends only on the relative time scale, entirely independent of the real time scale and the real size of the objects. It displays in detail how a cutoff tail, or a turn over, feature (called a cutoff tail problem) in the decay phase of a light curve can be formed. This feature is a consequence of a hot spot in the fireball surface, moving towards the observer, and was observed in a few cases previously. By performing fits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>count</b> rate <b>light</b> curves of six sample sources, we show how to obtain some physical parameters from the observed profile of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> rate of GRBs. In addition, the analysis reveals that the Doppler effect of fireballs could lead to a power law relationship between the FWHM of pulses and energy, which were observed previously by many authors.
