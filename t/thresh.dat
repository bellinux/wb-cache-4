40|$|Performance of a Yanmar DB 1000 {{mechanised}} paddy <b>thresher</b> was comparatively assessed against manual <b>threshing</b> by {{impact method}} using a locally-made wooden box for Amankwatia and AGRA rice varieties under farmer’s field conditions at Nobewam in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The mechanised <b>thresher</b> was evaluated at various <b>threshing</b> drum speeds (550 rpm, 600 rpm and 650 rpm) and feeding rates (200 kgh– 1, 400 kgh– 1 and 600 kgh– 1). Results showed that <b>threshing</b> was satisfactory at grain moisture content between 16. 9 % w. b. and 18. 0 % w. b. for both rice varieties. <b>Threshing</b> efficiency increased from 94. 6 % to 95. 8 % with {{no significant difference}} observed whereas cleaning efficiency decreased significantly from 84. 2 % to 81. 6 % with increasing feed rate irrespective of rice variety. Again, <b>threshing</b> efficiency increased with increasing drum rotational speed, irrespective of feed rate and rice variety. Percentage broken grain and grain loss both increased with increasing peripheral drum speed and paddy feed rate irrespective of rice variety. Average fuel consumption, physical energy requirement and <b>threshing</b> capacity increased significantly with increasing drum speed and feed rate. Crop moisture content and shattering ability influenced the <b>threshing</b> efficiency, <b>threshing</b> capacity, grain loss, broken grain, fuel and physical energy requirement at <b>threshing.</b> AGRA rice variety generally performed better than Amankwatia under both mechanical and manually <b>threshing</b> methods. Mechanised <b>threshing</b> was significantly better at reducing grain loss and physical energy demand whilst yielding over 200 % higher <b>threshing</b> capacity than manual <b>threshing</b> by impact using the wooden box.

25|$|Bells were vitally {{important}} to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, {{to call the}} Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells. The daily routine began with sunrise Mass and morning prayers, followed by instruction of the natives in {{the teachings of the}} Roman Catholic faith. After a generous (by era standards) breakfast of atole, the able-bodied men and women were assigned their tasks for the day. The women were committed to dressmaking, knitting, weaving, embroidering, laundering, and cooking, while some of the stronger girls ground flour or carried adobe bricks (weighing 55 lb, or 25kg each) to the men engaged in building. The men worked a variety of jobs, having learned from the missionaries how to plow, sow, irrigate, cultivate, reap, <b>thresh,</b> and glean. In addition, they were taught to build adobe houses, tan leather hides, shear sheep, weave rugs and clothing from wool, make ropes, soap, paint, and other useful duties.|$|E
500|$|There {{was already}} a [...] "Great Barn" [...] on the site, and as early as 1110 a manor record shows that men who were not wanted for {{ploughing}} were required to [...] "thresh in the Great Barn until sunset". A granary was recorded in a survey conducted in 1293–4 and a further survey of 1324 recorded {{the existence of a}} monastic grange in addition to the granary. The wheat barn at Harmondsworth was damaged in a storm in 1398 and records from Winchester College show that two carpenters were sent to make repairs, for which a large quantity of tiles, nails and other roofing materials was purchased. By this time, however, the existing barn was evidently becoming inadequate. The college's records indicate that in 1426–7 it commissioned two men, William Kypping (or Kipping) and John atte Oke, to obtain timbers from Kingston upon Thames to use for a new barn at Harmondsworth. This date matches an early fifteenth-century origin for the Great Barn's timbers, which has been established through dendrochronology. The architect is not known, but it is possible that William Wyse may have been involved. He was the main carpenter for New College, Oxford and the master carpenter at Windsor Castle in 1430, and worked on repairing the aisles at the church of St Mary's in Harmondsworth, practically next door to the manor. Carpenters from Ickenham and Uxbridge were also involved and a tiler appears to have been employed by the college at the same time. Once completed, the barn would have been used to <b>thresh</b> and store grain from the manor farm.|$|E
500|$|The common <b>thresher</b> (Alopias vulpinus), {{also known}} by many {{names such as}} Atlantic <b>thresher,</b> big-eye <b>thresher,</b> fox shark, green <b>thresher,</b> swingletail, slasher, swiveltail, thintail <b>thresher,</b> whip-tailed shark and Zorro <b>thresher</b> shark, is the largest species of <b>thresher</b> shark, family Alopiidae, {{reaching}} some [...] in length. About half of its length consists of the elongated upper lobe of its caudal fin. With a streamlined body, short pointed snout, and modestly sized eyes, the common <b>thresher</b> resembles (and has often been confused with) the pelagic <b>thresher</b> (A. pelagicus). It can be distinguished from the latter species by the white of its belly extending in a band over the bases of its pectoral fins.

Comparisons were also made between The Hunger Games premise of children killing each other, and the child soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony. In a Jezebel article published March 26, 2012, Dodai Stewart reported that several users on Twitter posted racist tweets, criticizing the portrayals of Rue, <b>Thresh</b> and Cinna by African American actors. In a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Collins stated that while she did not have any ethnic background in mind for lead characters Katniss and Gale because the book is written in [...] "a time period where hundreds of years have passed" [...] and there would be [...] "a lot of ethnic mixing", she explains [...] "there are some characters in the book who are more specifically described", and states that both Rue and <b>Thresh</b> are African American.

2500|$|Reaping is {{the process}} of {{harvesting}} a crop. [...] Traditionally reaping was done with the scythe and reaping hook, but in Britain these have been entirely superseded by machinery.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Threshing</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} associated with cowpea production in Nigeria. In spite of the food and nutritional importance of the crop to human diet, its <b>threshing</b> has been and remains a serious problem to the farmers. The techniques for <b>threshing</b> cowpea in most rural areas are still the traditional methods of seed separation which are uneconomical, labourous and time consuming. A manually operated cowpea <b>thresher</b> to stimulate manual <b>threshing</b> has been designed, fabricated and tested. The <b>thresher</b> was fabricated using locally available materials at the engineering workshop of the University of Agriculture, Makurdi. Two varieties of cowpea (B 301 and C 70) were tested on the <b>thresher</b> for performance evaluation in terms of <b>thresher</b> efficiency and mechanical (visible) damage. The test results revealed that for optimum performance, the <b>thresher</b> should operate at a cylinder speed of between 60 - 75 rpm at a feed rate of 24 kg/hr. 94 %- 97 % <b>threshing</b> efficiency was achieved for the two varieties of cowpea.
