50|$|The Hermitage was a folly first {{built by}} Captain Robert Riddell of Friars Carse (known as Glenriddell {{at this time}} and later {{returned}} to its ancient name) {{as part of his}} enthusiasm for antiquities. It is famous for its connection with the bard Robert Burns who through his friendship with Robert Riddell was permitted to use it to compose poetry in this secluded and tranquil sylvan spot. Burns also used his diamond point pen <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> <b>lines</b> on the window pane at the Hermitage following the premature death of Robert Riddell. The original Hermitage fell into disrepair and was rebuilt in 1874. It was further restored to its former glory more recently (2009).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} engrave gravure plate with fine lines structures, {{conventional}} art used lithography with dry/wet etching. Lithography with dry/wet etching method allows <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> <b>lines</b> with smooth concave shape, but its disadvantages include difficulty in controlling aspect ratio, high and uniform in large size process, substrate material limitation due to etching solution availability, and process complexity. We developed ultra-fast laser technology to directly engrave a stainless plate, a gravure plate, {{to be used}} for fabricating 23 in. metal-mesh touch panel by gravure offset printing process. The technology employs high energy pulse to ablate materials from a substrate. Because the ultra-fast laser pulse duration is shorter than the energy dissipation time between material lattices, there is no heating issue during the ablation process. Therefore, no volcano-type protrusion on the engraved line edges occurs, leading to good printing quality. After laser engraving, we then reduce surface roughness of the gravure plate using electro-polishing process. Diamond like carbon (DLC) coating layer is then added onto the surface to increase scratch resistance. We show that this procedure can fabricate gravure plate for gravure offset printing process with minimum printing linewidth 10. 7 µm. A 23 in. metal-mesh pattern was printed usin...|$|E

50|$|In the 19th century, <b>line</b> <b>engraving</b> {{was both}} helped and hindered.

50|$|The {{compass card}} {{is in the}} form of a bold {{parallel}} sided arrow which indicates magnetic north. Some models have an east/west cross bar as well. Overalying this but in the same gimbal or suspension is a transparent plate which can be rotated around the same axis as the compass card but has sufficient friction (or a mechanical clamp) to stay fixed relative to the gimbal system once set to a course. Across this disk are engraved a series of parallel lines. The outer edge of this disk is marked in clockwise in degrees, the radial line meeting 0º being parallel <b>to</b> the <b>engraved</b> <b>lines,</b> so that a course can be laid for any bearing from 0º to 359º. By keeping the arrow on the card and the lines on the overlay parallel the pilot or helmsman can keep the course set. The frequency of the degree markings depend upon the size of the compass.|$|R

5000|$|Stipple {{engraving}} is {{a technique}} used to create tone in an intaglio print by distributing a pattern of dots of various sizes and densities across the image. The pattern is created on the printing plate either in engraving by gouging out the dots with a burin, or through an etching process. Stippling {{was used as an}} adjunct <b>to</b> conventional <b>line</b> <b>engraving</b> and etching for over two centuries, before being developed as a distinct technique in the mid-18th century.|$|R

5000|$|The blocks were skillfully {{carved with}} {{extremely}} fine lines to create stippling and variations in tone. [...] Areas {{intended to be}} printed in a solid colour were marked, and then hatching lines of various thickness were carved into the wood so that colours could be overprinted, creating a variety of hues and tones. To create a blend of colours, blocks were hatched horizontally and diagonally to allow applications of multiple colours that resulted in browns, greens and greys. [...] Gascoigne explains that a [...] "blockmaker would know whether <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> thin white <b>lines</b> (for an almost solid tone), medium white lines (a mid-tone) or crosshatchings (leaving larger or smaller lozenges of colour to achieve sometimes {{little more than a}} faint tint when seen at a normal viewing distance)." [...] Overlapping diagonal lines were carved to create dot-like shapes on the surface that took less ink and resulted in paler tones.|$|R
50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 13 mm and 30 mm. The solid shell has a rather tumidly conical shape. The whorls are slopingly convex, densely {{strongly}} grained, here and there linearly <b>engraved.</b> The <b>lines</b> are obliquely minutely crenulated. The basal margin is obtusely rounded. The shell has a golden strawcolor, <b>engraved</b> <b>lines</b> chocolate-purple. It is strongly grained upon a bright golden straw-color, enlaced with <b>engraved</b> <b>lines</b> of a deep chocolate-purple.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{introduces the}} basic techniques for digital facial engraving, which imitates traditional copperplate engraving. Inspired by traditional techniques, we first establish {{a set of}} basic rules thanks <b>to</b> which separate <b>engraving</b> layers are built {{on the top of}} the original photo. Separate layers are merged according to simple merging rules and according to range shift/scale masks specially introduced for this purpose. We illustrate the introduced technique by a set of black/white and color engravings, showing different features such as engraving-specific image enhancements, mixing different regular <b>engraving</b> <b>lines</b> with mezzotint, irregular perturbations of <b>engraving</b> <b>lines</b> etc. We introduce the notion of engraving style which comprises a set of separate engraving layers together with a set of associated range shift/scale masks. The <b>engraving</b> style helps <b>to</b> port the look and feel of one <b>engraving</b> <b>to</b> another. Once different libraries of pre-defined mappable engraving styles and an appropriate user interface are added to the basic system, producing a decent gravure starting from a simple digital photo will be a matter of seconds. The engraving technique described in this contribution opens new perspectives for digital art, adding unprecedented power and precision to the engraver’s work...|$|R

50|$|Engraving for {{the purpose}} of printmaking creates plates for {{intaglio}} printing. Intaglio engravings are made by carving into a plate of a hard substance such as copper, zinc, steel, or plastic. Afterward ink is rubbed into the carved areas and away from the flat surface. Moistened paper is placed over the plate and both are run through the rollers of an intaglio press. The pressure exerted by the press on the paper pushes it into the <b>engraved</b> <b>lines</b> and prints the image made by those lines. In an intaglio print, the <b>engraved</b> <b>lines</b> print black.|$|R
50|$|To make a print, the {{engraved}} plate is inked all over, then the ink is wiped off the surface, leaving only ink in the <b>engraved</b> <b>lines.</b> The plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press {{together with a}} sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the <b>engraved</b> <b>lines,</b> making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the printing plate shows much sign of wear, except when drypoint, which gives much shallower lines, is used.|$|R

5000|$|He next {{produced}} {{a number of}} small subjects of similar character, which were well received, and at the Salon of 1799 he exhibited his engraving of Venus disarming Cupid, after Robert Lefèvre, which won a prize of 2000 francs. In this year he entered the studio of Alexandre Tardieu, where he made some studies in etching and line engraving; but an engagement <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> Hilaire Ledru's Pénibles Adieux did not allow him to remain for any great length of time. The success of his <b>line</b> <b>engraving</b> of [...] "Hope supporting Man to the Tomb," [...] after a sketch by Caraffa exhibited at the Salon of 1801, procured him a commission <b>to</b> <b>engrave</b> for the Musée La belle jardinière of Raphael.|$|R

50|$|It was {{discovered}} later that a proof {{could be taken}} on damped paper by filling the <b>engraved</b> <b>lines</b> with ink and wiping it off {{the surface of the}} plate. Pressure was then applied to push the paper into the hollowed lines and draw the ink out of them. This was the beginning of plate printing.|$|R

50|$|When {{the surface}} of a metal plate is {{sufficiently}} polished to be used for engraving, the slightest scratch upon it will print as a black <b>line.</b> An <b>engraved</b> plate from which visiting cards are printed {{is a good example of}} some elementary principles of engraving. It contains thin lines and thick ones, as well as a considerable variety of curves. An elaborate <b>line</b> <b>engraving,</b> if it is a pure <b>line</b> <b>engraving</b> and nothing else, will contain only these simple elements in different combinations. The real <b>line</b> <b>engraver</b> is always <b>engraving</b> a <b>line</b> more or less broad and deep in one direction or another; he has no other business than this.|$|R
25|$|Within a {{month after}} his {{appointment}} as Postmaster General, Reagan ordered that ads be placed in both Southern and Northern newspapers seeking sealed proposals from printing companies for producing Confederate postage stamps. Bids arrived from companies in New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, New Orleans and Richmond. After the war started, however, it became evident that the contract to print Confederate stamps should go to a Confederate firm. The Confederate Post Office Department therefore awarded the contract to lithographers Hoyer & Ludwig, a small firm in Richmond. The stamps they produced were inferior in image quality <b>to</b> the <b>line</b> <b>engraved</b> stamps printed by the U.S. Post Office, but with what resources they had, they produced some handsome images by many accounts. The first Confederate postage issues were placed in circulation in October 1861, five months after postal service between the North and South had ended. Jefferson Davis is depicted on {{the first issue of}} 1861. The appearance of a living person on a postage stamp marked a break from the tradition adhered to by the US Post Office, that a person may be depicted on U.S. postage or currency only after death.|$|R
