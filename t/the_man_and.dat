40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the prevalence, social correlates, and clustering of cardiovascular disease risk factors in a predominantly Black, poor, urban community. METHODS: Associations of risk factor prevalences with sociodemographic variables were examined in a population-based sample of 695 <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women aged 18 to 65 years living in Central Harlem. RESULTS: One third of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women were hypertensive, 48 % of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 41 % {{of the women were}} smokers, 25 % of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 49 % of the women were overweight, and 23 % of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 35 % of the women reported no leisure-time physical activity over the past month. More than 80 % of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women had at least 1 of these risk factors, and 9 % of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> 19 % of the women had 3 or more risk factors. Income and education were inversely related to hypertension, smoking, and physical inactivity. Having 3 or more risk factors was associated with low income and low education (extreme odds ratio [OR] = 10. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 3. 0, 34. 5 for education; OR = 3. 7, CI = 1. 6, 8. 9 for income) and with a history of unstable work or of homelessness. CONCLUSIONS: Disadvantaged, urban communities are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. These results highlight the importance of socioenvironmental factors in shaping cardiovascular risk...|$|R

5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E
