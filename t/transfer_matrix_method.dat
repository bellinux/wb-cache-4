40|$|The {{computational}} cost of <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>methods</b> for the Potts {{model is}} related to the question into how many ways can two layers of a lattice be connected?. Answering the question leads to the generation of a combinatorial set of lattice configurations. This set defines the configuration space of the problem, and the smaller it is, the faster the <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> can be computed. The configuration space of generic (q, v) <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>methods</b> for strips is in the order of the Catalan numbers, which grows asymptotically as O(4 m) where m is the width of the strip. Other <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>methods</b> with a smaller configuration space indeed exist but they make assumptions on the temperature, number of spin states, or restrict the structure of the lattice. In this paper we propose a parallel algorithm that uses a sub-Catalan configuration space of O(3 m) to build the generic (q, v) <b>transfer</b> <b>matrix</b> in a compressed form. The improvement is achieved by grouping the original set of Catalan configurations into a forest of family trees, {{in such a way that}} the solution to the problem is now computed by solving the root node of each family. As a result, the algorithm becomes exponentially faster than the Catalan approach while still highly parallel. The resulting matrix is stored in...|$|R
