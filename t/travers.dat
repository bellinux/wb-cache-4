5|$|Disney {{learns that}} <b>Travers</b> is {{actually}} her pen name, {{taken from her}} father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she's actually Australian, not British. This gives Disney new insight into <b>Travers,</b> and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her door, Disney tells her that {{he also had a}} less-than-ideal childhood, but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges <b>Travers</b> to not let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. <b>Travers</b> relents and grants Disney the film rights.|$|E
5|$|Travers' {{difficult}} {{childhood in}} Allora, Queensland, Australia, is depicted through flashbacks, {{and is the}} inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. <b>Travers</b> idolized her loving, imaginative father, <b>Travers</b> Robert Goff, but his chronic alcoholism resulted in his repeated firings, strained her parents' marriage, and caused her distressed mother to attempt suicide. Goff died {{at an early age}} from tuberculosis when <b>Travers</b> was seven years old.|$|E
5|$|General Assembly, {{winner of}} the 1979 <b>Travers</b> Stakes, setting {{a track record of}} 2:00 flat that stood for 37 years.|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, <b>Travers</b> is {{irritated by}} what she {{perceives}} as the city's unreality and the inhabitants' intrusive friendliness, personified by her limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, <b>Travers</b> meets the creative team that are developing Mary Poppins for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi, and music composers Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view she also holds of the jocular Disney.|$|E
5|$|Saving Mr. Banks depicts several {{events that}} differ from {{recorded}} accounts. The premise of the script—that Walt Disney had to convince P.L. <b>Travers</b> {{to hand over the}} film rights, including the scene when he finally persuades her—is fictionalized, as Disney had already secured the film rights (subject to Travers' approval of the script) when <b>Travers</b> arrived to consult with the Disney staff. Disney, in fact, left Burbank to vacation in Palm Springs a few days into Travers' visit and was not present at the studio when several of the film's scenes depicting him to be present actually took place. Therefore, many of the dialogue scenes between <b>Travers</b> and Disney are adapted from letters, telegrams, and telephone correspondence between the two. Although <b>Travers</b> was assigned a limousine driver, the character of Ralph is fictionalized and intended to be an amalgamation of the studio's drivers. In real life, Disney story editor Bill Dover was assigned as Travers' guide and companion during her time in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Stephen <b>Travers</b> {{heard the}} gunmen rummaging {{in the back}} of the minibus, where he kept his guitar. Concerned it might be damaged, he {{approached}} the two gunmen and told them to be careful. Asked whether he had anything valuable inside the case, <b>Travers</b> replied no. The gunman turned him round, punched him in the back and pushed him on the shoulder back into the line-up.|$|E
5|$|The team realize <b>Travers</b> has valid criticisms {{and make}} changes, though she becomes {{increasingly}} disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking {{to understand what}} troubles her, Disney invites <b>Travers</b> to Disneyland, which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, {{and the addition of}} a new song and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins working with the team; however, when <b>Travers</b> discovers that there is to be an animation sequence, she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, as <b>Travers</b> {{recovered}} in hospital, the second survivor Des McAlea gave the police {{a description of}} McDowell as the gunman with a moustache and wearing dark glasses who {{appeared to have been}} the leader of the patrol.|$|E
5|$|As a three-year-old, Harry Bassett {{also won}} the Jerome Handicap, the <b>Travers</b> Stakes, the Reunion Stakes, the Kenner Stakes, the Champion Stakes and the Jersey Derby. He was undefeated in nine starts at age three.|$|E
5|$|In 2065, the Zero-X {{spacecraft}} launches from Glenn Field as {{the first}} attempt at a manned mission to Mars. Unknown to Captain Paul <b>Travers</b> and his crew of two astronauts and two scientists, criminal mastermind the Hood has infiltrated the ship to photograph Zero-Xs wing mechanism. When his foot becomes trapped in the hydraulics, the Hood causes a systems failure and Zero-X loses control. While the villain manages to extract his bloodied foot and parachute from the undercarriage, <b>Travers</b> and his crew eject in an escape pod and Zero-X crashes into the ocean before leaving Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Miami Showband {{reformed}} in 2008, with <b>Travers,</b> Des McAlea, Ray Millar {{and other}} new members. It is fronted by McAlea, who returned to Northern Ireland the same year after living in South Africa since about 1982.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, in 1964, Mary Poppins is to {{have its}} world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Disney has not invited <b>Travers,</b> fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, <b>Travers</b> shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches Mary Poppins {{with a lack of}} enthusiasm, {{particularly}} during the animated sequences. She gradually warms {{to the rest of the}} film, however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption.|$|E
5|$|Daniel {{was born}} on Deal Island in Somerset County, Maryland on January 24, 1826, the son of <b>Travers</b> Daniel and his wife, Mary Wallace Daniel. <b>Travers</b> Daniel arrived at Deal Island {{at the age of}} {{eighteen}} to teach school but soon turned to farming after marrying Mary Wallace. William Daniel and his siblings were raised on the farm and attended the local school. He attended Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1848. While in college, he {{became a member of the}} Methodist Episcopal Church; he would remain affiliated with the church for the rest of his life. After finishing third in a class of twenty-eight, Daniel returned to Maryland to study law in the office of William S. Waters, a Somerset County lawyer who had recently served as Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates. Daniel was admitted to the bar in 1851.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 Warner Bros. Pictures {{released}} Shiloh, {{which was}} directed by Dale Rosenbloom. The first of Naylor's more than 100 juvenile and adult works to be adapted into a movie, it starred Blake Heron as Marty and Scott Wilson as Judd <b>Travers.</b> Budgeted at less than $2 million, Shiloh was filmed in 30 days in October 1996 at Topanga, California.|$|E
5|$|Paynter's next {{race was}} {{scheduled}} to be the <b>Travers</b> Stakes on August 25. With all three Triple Crown race winners for 2012 already retired from racing (all due to injury), Paynter was considered a contender to become the 3-year-old Horse of the Year if he continued to win races.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time after}} the attack, RUC {{officers}} questioned Stephen <b>Travers</b> at Dublin Castle. He subsequently stated they refused to accept {{his description of the}} different-coloured beret worn by the soldier with the English accent. The UVF gunmen had worn green UDR berets, whereas the other man's had been lighter in colour.|$|E
5|$|The film also depicts Travers' Aunt Ellie (her mother's sister), {{who comes}} to help the family when her father becomes terminally ill, as Travers' model for Mary Poppins, with her even using several of Poppins' catchphrases from the film. In fact, <b>Travers</b> {{identified}} her great aunt Helen Morehead (her mother's aunt), {{as the model for}} Poppins.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{dedicated to}} the dead Miami Showband members was unveiled at a ceremony at Parnell Square North, Dublin, on 10 December 2007. Survivors Stephen <b>Travers</b> and Des McAlea were both present at the unveiling, as was the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, who made a tribute. The monument, made of limestone, bronze and granite, by County Donegal sculptor Redmond Herrity, is {{at the site of}} the old National Ballroom, where the band often played.|$|E
5|$|An American dancer, Jerry <b>Travers</b> (Fred Astaire) {{comes to}} London {{to star in}} a show {{produced}} by the bumbling Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton).

She storms upstairs to complain, whereupon Jerry falls hopelessly {{in love with her}} and proceeds to pursue her all over London.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{has also}} {{influenced}} popular culture. Many {{of his works}} have been made into popular films and television serials, including: <b>Travers</b> Vale's Père Goriot (1915), Les Chouans (1947), Le Père Goriot (1968 BBC mini-series), and La Cousine Bette (1974 BBC mini-series, starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren; 1998 film, starring Jessica Lange). Balzac is mentioned to humorous effect in Meredith Willson's musical The Music Man. He is included in François Truffaut's 1959 film, The 400 Blows. Truffaut believed Balzac and Proust {{to be the greatest}} French writers.|$|E
5|$|Casualties in Greece {{included}} Mackay's son-in-law, Captain W. H. <b>Travers,</b> who {{was captured}} in the Battle of Crete. Mackay resolved to reform the battalions that had been destroyed in Greece, and to rebuild his shattered division from the remnants that had been evacuated to Alexandria. He developed a training program in Syria in which he attempted to apply {{the lessons of the}} campaign in Greece.|$|E
5|$|From facial {{measurements}} and still {{photographs of the}} human templates, sculpting supervisor John Brown constructed Cliff Richard, while Brian Bennett was entrusted to Christine Glanville, Hank Marvin to Terry Curtis, John Rostill to Mary Turner and Bruce Welch to Tim Cooksey. Curtis went on to sculpt Zero-X crewmembers Captain Paul <b>Travers</b> and Co-Pilot Greg Martin, modelling the first on 1960s James Bond actor, Sean Connery and the latter partly on himself, {{in addition to the}} Glenn Field Controller, Commander Casey.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Disney {{produced}} Mary Poppins, {{based on}} the book series by P. L. Travers; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the 1940s. It became the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although <b>Travers</b> disliked the film intensely and regretted having sold the rights. The same year he also became involved in plans to expand the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw up blueprints for a new building.|$|E
5|$|Krypton was {{discovered}} in Britain in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris <b>Travers,</b> an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air. Neon {{was discovered}} by a similar procedure by the same workers {{just a few weeks}} later. William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including krypton.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{promptly}} {{responded by}} ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and <b>Travers</b> and Jaquinot's two Chevau-léger (lancer) regiments in the I Corps light cavalry division. Disorganized and milling about {{the bottom of}} the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the countercharge of Milhaud's cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.|$|E

5|$|Top Hat is a 1935 American screwball {{musical comedy}} film in which Fred Astaire plays an American dancer named Jerry <b>Travers,</b> {{who comes to}} London to star in a show {{produced}} by Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton). He meets and attempts to impress Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers) to win her affection. The film also features Eric Blore as Hardwick's valet Bates, Erik Rhodes as Alberto Beddini, a fashion designer and rival for Dale's affections, and Helen Broderick as Hardwick's long-suffering wife Madge.|$|E
5|$|<b>Travers</b> also {{visited the}} home of Thomas Crozier, hoping to meet with him, but the latter {{did not come to}} the door. He {{presently}} resides near Craigavon. James McDowell lives in Lurgan, and John James Somerville became an evangelical minister in Belfast. The UVF had cut all ties with Somerville after he had opposed the 1994 ceasefire. In January 2015 he was found dead in his Shankill Road flat. Aged 70, he died of cancer of the kidney.|$|E
5|$|<b>Travers</b> was {{replaced}} by former Yeovil Town manager Dave Halliday, {{one of more than}} a hundred applicants for the role, and the club moved from their black and gold strip to red and white. Halliday had barely begun his work when World War II halted competitive football in the United Kingdom. For these six years, the club was temporarily taken over by then-directors Charles B Forbes and George Anderson while Halliday served in the war.|$|E
5|$|Each module {{was fitted}} with {{external}} components {{specific to the}} experiments that were carried out within that module, the most obvious being the <b>Travers</b> antenna mounted to Priroda. This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was {{most of the other}} equipment on Priroda, including various radiometers and scan platforms. Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or Ikar, was mated. This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned Buran {{in a manner similar to}} the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, but it was only used once, during EO-5.|$|E
5|$|Gravesend Blockhouse was {{designed}} by the Clerk of the King's Works, James Nedeham, and the Master of Ordnance, Christopher Morice, with Robert Lorde serving as the paymaster for the project and Lionel Martin, John Ganyn and Mr <b>Travers</b> acting as the local overseers. The Crown bought the land for the fort, along with the space for Gravesend Blockhouse, from William Burston for £66; it is uncertain how much the building work cost, but earlier estimates in 1539 had suggested that it would cost £211 to build such a blockhouse, including the 150,000 bricks and quantities of stone, chalk, lime, timber and labour that would be needed. The work was quickly completed, and by 1540 the blockhouse was fully operational.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, he {{emigrated to}} the United States and became the {{professional}} at The Apawamis Club in Rye, New York, a course featuring pronounced land forms and blind shots. When you combine this with his time spent at Royal St George's, the course nearest his home where he learned to play golf, you start {{to see a lot}} of his architectural influence. In 1911, he moved to Inwood Country Club and remodeled the course over several years eventually leading to the course hosting the 1921 PGA Championship and the 1923 U.S. Open. On 16 September 1905 Strong partnered with 18-year-old Jerome <b>Travers</b> to tie for second place, shooting 72, in a four-ball tournament—part of the 1905 Metropolitan Open—that was held at Fox Hills Golf Club on Staten Island.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Moore {{worked with}} her husband {{for the third time}} in the comedy Trust the Man, and starred in the true story of a 1950s housewife, The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio. Her first release of 2006 was Freedomland, a mystery co-starring Samuel L. Jackson. The {{response}} was overwhelmingly negative but her follow-up, Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men (2006), was highly acclaimed. Moore had a supporting role in the dystopian drama, playing the leader of an activist group. It is listed on Rotten Tomatoes as one of the best reviewed films of her career, and was named by Peter <b>Travers</b> as the second best film of the decade.|$|E
5|$|In his {{breeding}} career, Springbok sired {{the stakes}} winners Audrain, East Lynne, Ethel, Huntress, and Vallera. Audrain, an 1881 stallion out of Alme by Planet, won the 1884 Latonia Derby, 1884 St. Louis Derby and the 1884 Hindoo Stakes. East Lynne was an 1882 mare out of Easter Planet by Planet.

Vallera, an 1888 stallion out of Valasco by Pat Malloy, won the 1891 Tennessee Derby, 1891 <b>Travers</b> Stakes, and the 1891 Kenner Stakes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{airplane}} terrorism mystery film Non-Stop, Parker plays a computer programmer, who {{by the end}} of the film, is revealed as one of the two criminal masterminds behind the film's extortion plot. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times notes that Parker's talents are well-employed in his supporting role. In Every Secret Thing, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times found Parker and his detective partner to Elizabeth Banks to have been overwhelmed in their roles. <b>Travers</b> also found the detectivework to be uncompelling. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter found Parker's performance to have had its moments.|$|E
5|$|Narrator and protagonist Marty Preston {{lives in}} the hills of Friendly, West Virginia. After finding an abused beagle owned by his brutal {{neighbor}} Judd <b>Travers,</b> Marty defies his society's standards of not meddling with each other's business.
