5|$|Advanced systems {{played a}} key role in the rig's operation, from {{pressure}} and drill monitoring <b>technology,</b> <b>to</b> automated shutoff systems and modelling systems for cementing. The OptiCem cement modelling system, used by Halliburton in April 2010, played a crucial part in cement slurry mix and support decisions. These decisions became a focus for investigations into the explosion on the rig that month.|$|E
