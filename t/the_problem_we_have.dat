2500|$|Some {{concerns}} with Qatar's bid {{deal with the}} extreme temperatures. The World Cup is always held in the European off-season in June and July and during this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar is in excess of 40°C (104°F), with the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30°C (86°F). Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, responded saying [...] "the event has to be organised in June or July. We {{will have to take}} the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> other plans up our sleeves as well." [...] The first five proposed stadiums are planned to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the upper tiers of the stadiums will be dis-assembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.|$|E

60|$|Now these anticipations are to a {{considerable}} extent justified. Remoteness on the earth's surface is usually an indication of diversity in the fauna and flora, while strongly contrasted climates are always accompanied by {{a considerable}} contrast in the forms of life. But this correspondence {{is by no means}} exact or proportionate, and the converse propositions are often quite untrue. Countries which are near to each other often differ radically in their animal and vegetable productions; while similarity of climate, together with moderate geographical proximity, are often accompanied by marked diversities in the prevailing forms of life. Again, while many groups of animals--genera, families, and sometimes even orders--are confined to limited regions, most of the families, many genera, and even some species are found in every part of the earth. An enumeration of a few of these anomalies will better illustrate the nature of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to solve.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{to discuss}} {{is whether there}} is any reason for believing in what is called 'the {{uniformity}} of nature'. The belief in the uniformity of nature {{is the belief that}} everything that has happened or will happen is an instance of some general law to which there are no exceptions. The crude expectations which we have been considering are all subject to exceptions, and therefore liable to disappoint those who entertain them. But science habitually assumes, at least as a working hypothesis, that general rules which have exceptions can be replaced by general rules which have no exceptions. 'Unsupported bodies in air fall' is a general rule to which balloons and aeroplanes are exceptions. But the laws of motion and the law of gravitation, which account for the fact that most bodies fall, also account for the fact that balloons and aeroplanes can rise; thus the laws of motion and the law of gravitation are not subject to these exceptions.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to {{consider}} is this: Granted that we are certain of our own sense-data, have we any reason for regarding them as signs {{of the existence of}} something else, which we can call the physical object? When we have enumerated all the sense-data which we should naturally regard as connected with the table, have we said all there is to say about the table, or is there still something else--something not a sense-datum, something which persists when we go out of the room? Common sense unhesitatingly answers that there is. What can be bought and sold and pushed about and have a cloth laid on it, and so on, cannot be a mere collection of sense-data. If the cloth completely hides the table, we shall derive no sense-data from the table, and therefore, if the table were merely sense-data, it would have ceased to exist, and the cloth would be suspended in empty air, resting, by a miracle, in the place where the table formerly was. This seems plainly absurd; but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities.|$|E
