5|$|Locomotive tenders {{were also}} changed as new, {{improved}} designs became available. Some {{examples of the}} second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A <b>tender,</b> which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 gallons. Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another <b>tender</b> design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, {{due to the fact}} that they were intended for use on longer runs in the north of the railway network. This <b>tender</b> design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members to mount the <b>tender</b> to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E
5|$|Blitz {{participated in}} {{extensive}} training and experimentation in the Torpedo School, {{under the command}} of Alfred von Tirpitz, the future architect of the High Seas Fleet. In 1889, Pfeil was sent to German East Africa to participate in the suppression of a local revolt against German colonial rule. By 1899, both ships were withdrawn from front line service; Pfeil was used for fishery protection, and Blitz became a fleet <b>tender.</b> In 1912, both Blitz and Pfeil were serving as tenders to the I Battle Squadron and the II Battle Squadron, respectively. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Blitz was mobilized as a coastal patrol ship, while Pfeil remained a <b>tender.</b> Blitz returned to her <b>tender</b> duties in 1915. Both ships were sold for scrapping in the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|By 1883, most coins on {{the islands}} were American, due to the close {{economic}} integration between islands and mainland. The laws of Hawaii reflected this, making gold American coins legal <b>tender</b> for an unlimited amount and American silver coins legal <b>tender</b> to $50. In 1879, the kingdom issued its first currency notes, technically certificates of deposit, redeemable in silver coin and with denominations ranging from $10 to $500.|$|E

5|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{can also be}} used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard suction hose match those of the <b>tender</b> dumping water. This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water <b>tender,</b> from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E
5|$|Hell money: Hell {{money is}} a form of joss paper printed to {{resemble}} fake legal <b>tender</b> bank notes. The notes are not an official form of recognized currency or legal <b>tender</b> since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt offerings to the deceased as a superstitious solution to resolve their ancestors financial problems. This custom has been practiced by the modern Chinese and across East Asia since the late 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in World War II did {{not operate}} any {{seaplane}} <b>tenders.</b> However, the Luftwaffe had nineteen seaplane <b>tenders.</b> These ships were mostly converted from existing civilian seaplane <b>tenders,</b> and {{were capable of}} carrying 1-3 seaplanes. The French and Italian Navies also had seaplane <b>tenders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Type MT1 <b>tenders</b> were {{modified}} Type MT <b>tenders</b> with enlarged coal bunkers. The original Type MT <b>tenders</b> entered {{service on}} the South African Railways between 1928 and 1945.|$|R

5|$|Her {{service as}} a fishery {{protection}} ship lasted until 1899, {{when she returned to}} service with the fleet. She was withdrawn from active service in 1904, when she resumed her old <b>tender</b> duties. In 1912, Pfeil was assigned as the <b>tender</b> for the pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron. While in the II Squadron, she wore a yellow identification band on her funnel, to distinguish her from her sister Blitz, which wore a white identification stripe. She remained in her <b>tender</b> duties through 1919. She was stricken from the naval register on 16 February 1922 and broken up for scrap at Wilhelmshaven.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 Manson was {{replaced}} as locomotive superintendent by James Johnson, {{the son of}} Samuel W. Johnson, then locomotive superintendent at the Midland Railway. In 1893 Neilsons delivered six new 4-4-0 <b>tender</b> locomotives that were more powerful any previous Great North locomotive and the first not to have Clark's smoke prevention apparatus. Classified as Class S and known for rapid acceleration and sustained high speed, these were the blueprint for the later Great North <b>tender</b> locomotives. Manson had left a design for a 0-4-4 tank locomotive and Johnson changed the firebox, boiler and value gear so {{they were the same}} as the Class S <b>tender</b> locomotives before ordering nine to work the Deeside Line. These arrived in 1893 and most were transferred to the Aberdeen suburban services in 1900.|$|E

Portion sizes corresponded to the Chicken <b>Tenders.</b> It was discontinued in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Five {{locomotive}} {{classes were}} delivered new with Type XM2 <b>tenders.</b> Bearing {{in mind that}} <b>tenders</b> could and did migrate between engines, these <b>tenders</b> should have been renumbered in the SAR number ranges as shown.|$|R
5|$|In September 2016, {{as part of}} the broadcaster's Compete Or Compare Strategy, the BBC {{confirmed}} the show {{would be one of the}} first put up for <b>tender.</b> In the <b>tender</b> released in October, it was {{confirmed the}} contract, open to independent producers and BBC Studios, would be for 3 series of a minimum 50 episodes per series, delivered from December 2017 with no break in transmission and produced from the existing production base at BBC Elstree Centre. A decision on the winning <b>tender</b> was also confirmed for February or March 2017.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X <b>tender,</b> the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the <b>tender.</b> The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million <b>tender,</b> and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would participate in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. The <b>tender</b> was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
5|$|Jersey issues its own {{postage stamps}} and Jersey {{banknotes}} and coins that circulate with UK coinage, Bank of England notes, Scottish notes and Guernsey currency within the island.

50|$|Type EW2 <b>tenders</b> were rebuilt from Type CZ <b>tenders</b> {{which had}} entered service between 1953 and 1955 as steam {{condensing}} <b>tenders</b> to the Class 25 4-8-4 Northern type condensing steam locomotives. The <b>tenders</b> were {{stripped of their}} condensing equipment and fitted with huge water tanks when their engines were modified to Class 25NC non-condensing locomotives between 1973 and 1980.|$|R
50|$|In the process, their Type CZ {{condensing}} <b>tenders</b> {{were also}} rebuilt to ordinary coal-and-water Type EW2 <b>tenders</b> {{by removing the}} condensing radiators and roof fans {{and replacing it with}} a massive water tank. Since the Type CZ <b>tenders</b> were built on single cast steel water-bottom frames it was impractical to attempt to shorten them, which resulted in the rebuilt Type EW2 <b>tenders</b> with their long round-topped water tanks. Locomotives with these rebuilt <b>tenders</b> were soon nicknamed Worshond (Sausage dog or Dachshund).|$|R
50|$|Only Class 9 {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} new with Type XM3 <b>tenders.</b> Bearing {{in mind that}} <b>tenders</b> could and did migrate between engines, these <b>tenders</b> should have been numbered in the SAR number range from 727 to 731.|$|R

In its first three days, March 4–6, the film grossed $46,977 from exclusive engagements at the Tower East Theater in New York ($21,183), the Fine Arts Theater in Los Angeles ($18,254) and the Carnegie Theater in Chicago ($7,540). <b>Tender</b> Mercies eventually played at a total of 37 theaters and grossed $8,443,124.|$|E
5|$|The German-built {{seaplane}} <b>tender</b> Zmaj {{was commissioned}} into the KJRM in 1930, but was {{converted to a}} minelayer in 1937. Captured by the Germans in April 1941, she saw service in the seaplane <b>tender,</b> aircraft rescue and troop transport roles as Drache. In late 1942, she was re-commissioned as a minelayer, and was used for shipboard trials with helicopters in 1943 before being sunk in September 1944.|$|E
50|$|The rest of {{the fleet}} was rebuilt at the Salt River shops in Cape Town {{at a rate of}} about fifteen per year. There, the {{condensing}} <b>tenders</b> were rebuilt to ordinary coal-and-water <b>tenders</b> by removing the condensing radiators and roof fans and replacing it with a massive round-topped water tank. These <b>tenders</b> were reclassified as Type EW2 and nicknamed Worshond <b>tenders.</b>|$|R
40|$|Collaborative {{working methods}} offer {{the hope of}} reduced waste, lower <b>tendering</b> costs and {{improved}} outputs. The costs of <b>tendering</b> {{may be influenced by}} the introduction of different working methods. Transaction cost economics appears to offer an analytical framework for studying the costs of <b>tendering,</b> but it is more to do with providing explanations at the institutional/industry level, not at the level of individual projects. Surveys and interviews were carried out with small samples in UK. The data show that that while <b>tendering</b> costs are not necessarily higher in collaborative working arrangements, there is no correlation between costs of <b>tendering</b> and the way the work is organized. Practitioners perceive that the benefits of working in collaborative procurement routes far outweigh the costs. <b>Tendering</b> practices can be improved to avoid waste, and the suggested improvements include restricting selective <b>tendering</b> lists to 23 bidders, letting bidders know who they are competing with, reimbursing <b>tendering</b> costs for aborted projects and ensuring that timely and comprehensive information is provided to bidders...|$|R
