5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit {{stops to}} change to {{intermediate}} tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button moved up to eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the following lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at <b>the</b> <b>Spoon</b> Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time deficit by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was oversteering, and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at <b>the</b> <b>Spoon</b> Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Hamilton set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at one minute and 35.078 seconds; Rosberg was second, and Bottas third. Button was fourth-fastest, ahead of Vettel and Räikkönen. Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into the turn-18 barrier. Kobayashi {{lost control of the}} rear end of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, and Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting <b>the</b> <b>Spoon</b> Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering <b>the</b> <b>Spoon</b> Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14, which brought out a second red flag; the session ended early, due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Massa was fourth-fastest; Bottas was fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Magnussen was seventh, Vergne eighth, Kvyat ninth and Button completed the top ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car. Although Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear end leaving turn 15, he avoided crashing into the wall.|$|E

5|$|Although Hamilton became {{concerned}} about his Mercedes' brakes, {{he was told that}} it was a relatively minor sensor problem. He and Vergne reported that conditions had improved, but Vettel and Massa said that visibility remained poor. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} ninth lap, and the cars were allowed to overtake. Button immediately made a pit stop to fit intermediate tyres. Hamilton attempted to pass Rosberg heading into the first corner, but could not overtake him. Rosberg began to pull away from him; Vettel tried to pass Magnussen going into the hairpin, but was unable to complete the manoeuvre. He ran wide at <b>the</b> <b>Spoon</b> Curve, remaining on the track by running onto the kerb. Pérez overtook Kvyat to claim ninth position on the lap. At the end of the first racing lap, Rosberg led Hamilton by 1.3 seconds; Hamilton was followed by Bottas, Massa, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vettel, Räikkönen, Pérez and Kvyat.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} world records in egg-and-spoon racing are held by New-Yorker and serial record-holder Ashrita Furman; these include, as {{published}} by Guinness World Records, fastest 100 m egg-and-spoon race (19.39 seconds); fastest 100 m egg-and-spoon race while holding <b>the</b> <b>spoon</b> in the mouth (25.13 seconds); fastest mile egg-and-spoon race (7 minutes, 8 seconds); fastest mile egg-and-spoon race holding <b>the</b> <b>spoon</b> with both hands (8 minutes, 5 seconds); and fastest mile egg-and-spoon race holding <b>the</b> <b>spoon</b> in the mouth (9 minutes, 29 seconds).

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>spoons</b> {{position}} or spooning is a sexual position and a cuddling technique.

This holding style is essentially the same as holding salad spoons for single hand serving; except for this purpose <b>the</b> <b>spoons</b> should not be back to back.|$|R

25|$|Competitors race either {{individually}} or in {{teams in the}} manner of a relay race. If the egg falls from <b>the</b> <b>spoon</b> then competitors may be required to stop, retrieve, and reposition their egg; or to start again; or may even be disqualified. Due to the lesser penalty imposed for dropping the egg, and consequent encouragement of greater risk-taking, the first penalty scenario may result in a race that is faster overall. Common methods of cheating include sticking the egg to <b>the</b> <b>spoon,</b> or holding onto the egg with one finger. For an extra challenge, contestants might carry <b>the</b> <b>spoon</b> with both hands, with their teeth, or have their hands tied behind their backs.|$|E

25|$|Plastic {{changes to}} the body schema are active and continuous. For example, gradual {{changes to the}} body schema must occur over the {{lifetime}} of an individual {{as he or she}} grows and absolute and relative sizes of body parts change over his or her life span. The development of the body schema has also been shown to occur in young children. One study showed that with these children (9-, 14-, and 19-month-olds), older children handled spoons so as to optimally and comfortably grip them for use, whereas younger children tended to reach with their dominant hand, regardless of the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>spoon</b> and eventual ease of use. Short-term plasticity has been shown with the integration of tools into the body schema. The rubber hand illusion has also shown the rapid reorganization of the body schema on the timescale of seconds, showing the high level of plasticity and speed with which the body schema reorganizes. In the Illusion, participants view a dummy hand being stroked with a paintbrush, while their own hand is stroked identically. Participants may feel that the touches on their hand are coming from the dummy hand, and even that the dummy hand is, in some way, their own hand.|$|E
