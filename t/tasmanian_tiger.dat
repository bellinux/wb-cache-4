25|$|The Bell Pettigrew Museum {{houses the}} University's natural history {{collections}}. Founded in 1912, it {{is housed in}} the old Bute Medical School Building in St. Mary's Quad. Among its collections are the remains of several extinct species such as the dodo and <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>tiger</b> as well as fossilised fish from the nearby Dura Den, Fife, which when found in 1859 stimulated the debate on evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Tasmania {{was home to}} the thylacine, a {{marsupial}} which resembled a wild dog. Known colloquially as the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>tiger</b> for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia about 4,000 years ago because of competition by the introduced dingo. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, {{it appears to have}} been exterminated in Tasmania.|$|E

25|$|Far {{more recent}} {{possible}} or presumed extinctions of species which {{may turn out}} still to exist include the thylacine, or <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>tiger</b> (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the Japanese wolf (Canis lupus hodophilax), last sighted over 100 years ago; the ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris), not seen since 2007.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, geneticists at the Australian Museum {{announced}} that they had replicated DNA of the thylacine (<b>Tasmanian</b> <b>tiger),</b> at the time extinct for about 65 years, using polymerase chain reaction. However, on 15 February 2005 the museum {{announced that}} it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the (ethanol) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in New South Wales and Victoria.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Tasmania {{was home to}} the thylacine, a {{marsupial}} which resembled a Fossa (animal) or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>tiger</b> for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the dingo, introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, {{it appears to have}} been exterminated in Tasmania. The Tasmanian devil became the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world following the extinction of the thylacine in 1936, and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania {{was one of the last}} regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and emus. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters, and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginals.|$|E

25|$|Australia has a rich {{mammalian}} fossil history, {{as well as}} {{a variety}} of extant mammalian species, dominated by the marsupials,currently however there is limited taxonomic research into Australia’s mammals. The fossil record shows that monotremes have been present in Australia since the Early Cretaceous 145–99 MYA, and that marsupials and placental mammals date from the Eocene 56–34 MYA, when modern mammals first appeared in the fossil record. Although marsupials and placental mammals did coexist in Australia in the Eocene, only marsupials have survived to the present. The placental mammals made their reappearance in Australia in the Miocene, when Australia moved closer to Indonesia, and bats and rodents started to appear reliably in the fossil record. The marsupials evolved to fill specific ecological niches, and in many cases they are physically similar to the placental mammals in Eurasia and North America that occupy similar niches, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. For example, the top predator in Australia, the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>tiger,</b> bore a striking resemblance to canids such as the gray wolf; gliding possums and flying squirrels have similar adaptations enabling their arboreal lifestyle; and the numbat and anteaters are both digging insectivores. For the most part, mammals are not a highly visible part of the faunal landscape, as most species are nocturnal and many arboreal. Furthermore, there are few extant large ground-dwelling species.|$|E

2500|$|The {{domestic}} dog {{has largely}} been responsible for introducing canine distemper to previously unexposed wildlife and now causes a serious conservation threat to many species of carnivores and some species of marsupials. The virus contributed to the near-extinction of the black-footed ferret.

2500|$|In 1999, the Federal Government {{announced}} that it would contribute $5 million to upgrade Bellerive. [...] The TCA added $10 million, on loan from the state government, and the Clarence City Council $1 million, enabling a $16 million upgrade. The first part of this upgrade was the state-of-the-art indoor nets. The 6,000-seat Southern Stand came next, which blocked winds and views of the Derwent, and contained the new media centre. The new Members' Area was the last of the upgrades, along with new perimeter fence and entry gates. The Members' Area features press and radio media areas, corporate boxes and lunchrooms, as well as the players areas, members' bars and TCA offices. The redevelopment was officially opened on 11 January 2003, when an overcrowd of 16,719 (official capacity 16000) witnessed a thrilling one-day match between Australia and England, the victory going to Australia. <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>Tiger</b> Shane Watson became the hero for Australia, bowling the very tense final over.|$|E
2500|$|Australia has the world's {{largest and}} most diverse range of marsupials. Marsupials are characterised by the {{presence}} of a pouch in which they rear their young. The carnivorous marsupials—order Dasyuromorphiaare represented by two surviving families: the Dasyuridae with 51 members, and the Myrmecobiidae with the numbat as its sole surviving member. The <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>tiger</b> was the largest Dasyuromorphia and the last living specimen of the family Thylacinidae died in captivity in 1936. The world's largest surviving carnivorous marsupial is the Tasmanian devil; it {{is the size of a}} small dog and can hunt, although it is mainly a scavenger. It became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in Tasmania. There are four species of quoll, or [...] "native cat", all of which are threatened species. The Eastern quoll for example is believed to have been extinct on the mainland since the 1960s, though [...] The remainder of the Dasyuridae are referred to as [...] "marsupial mice"; most weigh less than 100g. There are two species of marsupial moleorder Notoryctemorphiathat inhabit the deserts of Western Australia. These rare, blind and earless carnivorous creatures spend most of their time underground; little is known about them.|$|E
