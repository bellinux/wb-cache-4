25|$|The fully low-floor Variotram units, {{acquired}} in 1998–2003 from Adtranz (later Bombardier) and built by <b>Transtech</b> Oy in Otanmäki, {{proved to be}} unreliable, causing a shortage of operable trams. Starting in 2004, HKL purchased ten DUEWAG series second-hand trams from Mannheim in Germany to cover for the shortage. Eventually arrangements were made with Bombardier to keep {{a sufficient number of}} the units in operation. All of the DUEWAG units were either withdrawn or relegated to charter service by the end of 2014.|$|E
500|$|A test {{carriage}} from an ETR 460 {{arrived by}} boat into Finland from Italy in March 1993. It {{was used to}} test how the Pendolino would cope with Finland's winter and rail network by running it in Northern Carelia between Nurmes and Vieki. The carriage had to be fitted with new bogies over night at Hanko as it was designed for standard gauge instead of the broader Finnish [...] gauge. Another carriage was built by <b>Transtech</b> according to the specifications of the new train (nomenclature KOEV from koevaunu, test carriage). It was later included in the first completed unit as the fourth car, TT 7401. Before a full trainset was finished, some test runs were made with only the first three carriages of the train in late 1994.|$|E

2500|$|As of February 2015, HKL has up to 124 tram {{units that}} can be used in {{scheduled}} passenger service. [...] HKL reported that it used 97 trams to operate peak-time scheduled traffic in the spring of 2013. Additionally, there are six trams in reserve and eight in charter use. The MLNRV I and II series (rebuilt Valmet Nr I and Valmet Nr II units), MLNRV Variotram, and Valmet NrI series comprise the current backbone of the fleet, but HKL is in the process of receiving 40 new <b>Transtech</b> Artic units.|$|E
2500|$|HKL {{is now in}} {{the process}} of {{acquiring}} 40 new low-floor Artic trams from <b>Transtech.</b> They have a double-articulated, eight-axle design, are [...] long and have 74 fixed seats, 14 foldable seats and space for 75 standing passengers. The design has a 100% low floor and conventional, turning bogies designed to run without problems on Helsinki's challenging old-fashioned track network. Two prototype units were delivered in 2013, and each entered passenger service approximately two months after delivery. The first unit of the production series, no. 403, arrived in Helsinki in January 2016. The order is worth €113 million and it includes an option for a further 90 trams.|$|E
2500|$|In the 21st century, Billings saw the {{development}} of operations centers in the city's business parks and downtown core by such national companies as GE, Wells Fargo and First Interstate Bank. It also saw renewed growth in the downtown core {{with the addition of}} numerous new buildings, new parking garages and a new MET Transit Center, and in 2002 Skypoint was completed. Downtown also saw a renaissance of the historic areas within the downtown core as building after building was restored to its previous glory. In 2007, Billings was designated a Preserve America Community. With the completion of the Shiloh interchange exit off Interstate 90, the <b>TransTech</b> Center was developed and more hotel development occurred as well. In 2010 the Shiloh corridor was open for business with the completion of the Shiloh parkway, a [...] multi-lane street with eight roundabouts. More shopping centers were developed in the 21st century. One of the new centers is Shiloh Crossing, which brought the first Kohl's department store to Montana. Other new centers include Billings Town Square with Montana's first Cabela's, and West Park Promenade, Montana's first open-air shopping mall. In 2009, Fortune Small Business magazine named Billings the best small city in which to start a business. Billings saw continued growth with the largest actual growth of any city in Montana. On June 20, 2010 (Father's Day), a tornado, dubbed by the media the Fathers Day Tornado, touched down in the downtown core and Heights sections of Billings. The Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark and area businesses suffered major damage.|$|E

50|$|The {{purchase}} of {{a new series of}} 40 low-floor trams was initiated in 2007, and the trams were eventually ordered from the Finnish manufacturer <b>Transtech</b> in December 2010. In preparation for the acquisition, in 2007-2008 one CROTRAM TMK 2200 type tram built in Croatia was used for test running in Helsinki. Due to the hilly nature of Helsinki's tram network compared to that of Zagreb (for which the TMK 2200 type was designed), the TMK 2200 could be operated only on the relatively flat-terrain lines 6 and 8. The tram performed technically without problems. Passenger feedback was largely negative, but mostly concerned issues - such as the seating arrangements - that would be changed if the type were mass-produced for HKL. During the initial phase of the call for bids opened in late 2008, Alstom, Bombardier Transportation, CAF, Končar (Crotram), ON's Industry, Siemens, Škoda, <b>Transtech</b> and Vossloh (reportedly in collaboration with Heiter Blick) submitted tenders. Of these, Bombardier, CAF, Škoda, <b>Transtech</b> and Vossloh were selected for {{the second phase of the}} call for bids.
