50|$|The Si2 Common Power Format, or CPF is a {{file format}} for specifying power-saving {{techniques}} {{early in the}} design process. In the design of integrated circuits, saving power is a primary goal, and designers are forced to use sophisticated techniques such as clock gating, multi-voltage logic, and <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> entirely to inactive blocks. These techniques require a consistent implementation in the design steps of logic design, implementation, and verification. For example, if multiple different power supplies are used, then logic synthesis must insert level shifters, place and route must deal with them correctly, and other tools such as static timing analysis and formal verification must understand these components. As power became an increasingly pressing concern, each tool independently added the features needed. Although this {{made it possible to}} build low power flows, it was difficult and error prone since the same information needed to be specified several times, in several formats, to many different tools. CPF was created as a common format that many tools can use to specify power-specific data, so that power intent only need be entered once and can be used consistently by all tools. The aim of CPF is to support an automated, power-aware design infrastructure.|$|E

Typically a fall time of less than 1 {micro}s can't be achieved by just <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to the ion source due to the slow decay of plasma density (partly determined by the fall time of the RF power in the circuit). In this paper, we discuss the method of using an array of mini-apertures (instead of one large aperture beam) such that gating the beamlets can be done with low voltage and a small gap. This geometry minimizes the problem of voltage breakdown as well as reducing the time of flight to produce fast gating. We have designed and fabricated an array of 16 apertures (4 x 4) for a beam extraction experiment. Using a gating voltage of 1400 V and a gap distance of 1 mm, the fall time of extracted ion beam pulses is less than 1 {micro}s at various beam energies ranging between 400 eV to 800 eV.

40|$|In modern {{integrated}} circuits, one way {{to reduce}} power consumption is to turn off power to parts of the circuit when those are idle. This method is called power gating. This thesis presents a state-preserving technique to achieve power savings in GasP family of asynchronous circuits by <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> when the circuit is idle. The power control logic turns on the power {{in anticipation of the}} receiving data. The power control logic turns off the power when the stage is idle either because it is empty or because the pipeline is clogged. The low logical effort of GasP circuits makes just-in-time power gating possible on a stage-by-stage basis. A new latch called Lazy Latch is introduced in this thesis. The lazy latch preserves its output and permits power gating of its larger transistors. The lazy latch is power efficient because it drives strongly only when necessary. A new latch called Blended Latch is proposed in this thesis which blends the advantages of the Conventional latches and the Lazy latches. Performance of power gating is evaluated by comparing the power-gated pipeline against the non-power gated pipeline. Power savings achieved are dependent on the duty cycle of operation. The fact that just-in-time power gating achieves power savings after it is idle for a minimum of 106 cycles makes it useful in limited applications where a quick start is required after long idle times...|$|E
40|$|The {{basic and}} most {{important}} function of a computer {{is that it can}} be used to process and storage data. The part of the computer where information is stored is generally known as hard disk unit. Hard disk unit may be a magnetic disk, which is composed of several round metal plates, and is recently often composed of glass or ceramic, with the magnetic recording surface. Each plate has its own read-write heads. This is the coil magnet that can drive the surface (write) or magnetic sensor (reading). In magnetic media recording the information is stored in the form of areas with different magnetic pole direction. The entirely different storage unit, which is becoming more effective, is the drive with a so-called solid state technology or the SSD drive – Solid State Disk (no moving parts). SSD drives from most companies consist of NAND flash memory which retains data even after <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> supply and DRAM, which is used as a cache. NAND flash technology stores data in the sets (fields) of memory cells. Based on how many bites can be stored in each cell, we divide memory cells into two kinds: MLC (Multi Level Cell) and SLC (Single Level Cell). With the help of different electric change levels, a MLC cell can write more than one bite of information. SLC cell stores only one bit (0 or 1) of data per cell and thus provides faster transmission, lower energy consumption and longer cell lifetime. SLC cell in 10 times more reliable then the MLC cell. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{studying}} circuit theory, {{we learn}} that there are threefundamental circuit elements: the resistor, the capacitor,and the inductor. The first element determines the relationbetween current and voltage, the second between charge and voltage, and the third between current and magnetic flux (or the time integral of the voltage). These passive two-terminal devices are basic building blocks of modern electronics and are therefore ubiquitous in circuits. However, we are also taught {{that they do not}} store information. Even if the state of one of the above elements changes, the information about the new state will be lost once we turn off the power source and wait some time. This point may seem irrelevant, but it is instead fundamentally crucial: storing information without the need of a power source would represent a paradigm change in electronics. For instance, we would need many less active elements (like transistors) to perform any type of computation or processing. This state of affairs has changed completely by the introduction in 1971 of the concept of memristor (short for memory-resistor) by Chua [1], [9], who noticed that fundamental circuit theories miss an element determining the relation between magnetic flux and charge. Equivalently, the memris-tor relates the current to the voltage [1], [9] but, unlike its traditional coun-terpart, its resistance, upon <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> source, depends on the integral of its entire past current wave-form. In other words, it has memory of past states through which the system has evolved.

40|$|Modern {{commercial}} aircraft {{are becoming increasingly}} dependent on electrical power. More {{and more of the}} systems traditionally powered by hydraulics or pneumatics are being migrated to run on electricity. One consequence of the move towards electrical power is the increase in the storage capacity of the bat- teries used to supplement the power generation. The increase in battery size increases the maximum stress that a short circuit failure can put on the power distribution system. Although such failures are extremely rare, the fail safe switches in the distribution system must be capable of handling extremely high energy short circuits and <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to protect the electrical systems from damage. Traditionally aircraft have used electromechanical relays in this role. However, they are large, heavy and slow to switch. As the potential power level is increased, the slow switching becomes more of a problem. The solution is a semiconductor switch. An IGBT can handle the high short circuit currents and switches fast enough to prevent short circuits damaging key systems. However, the inherent voltage drop in the forward current path significantly reduces its efficiency during nominal operation. A power MOSFET would be considerably more efficient than an IGBT during nominal operation. However, during high current surges, the ohmic behaviour of the switch leads to extremely high power loss and thermal failure. In this thesis a solution to this problem is presented. A new class of semiconductor device is proposed that has the highly efficient low current performance of the power MOSFET and the high current handling capability of the IGBT. The device has been named the Hybrid Unipolar Bipolar Field Effect Transistor or HUBFET. The HUBFET operates in unipolar mode, like a MOSFET, at low currents and in bipolar mode, like an IGBT, at high currents. The structure of the HUBFET is a merging of the MOSFET and IGBT. It is a vertical device with a traditional MOS gate structure, however the backside consists of alternating regions of both N-type and P-type doping. Through simulation the key on-state characteristics of the HUBFET have been shown. Fabricated test modules have been tested to validate the simulations and to show how the HUBFET can dynamically transistion from unipolar to bipolar mode during a short circuit event. Following the proof of concept the pattern of implants on the backside of the device that give the HUBFET its characteristic were investigated and potential improvements to the design were identified...|$|E
40|$|Mediated Electrochemical Oxidation (MEO) is a {{promising}} {{technology for the}} destruction of organic containing wastes and the remediation of mixed wastes containing transuranic components. The combination of a powerful oxidant and an acid solution allows the conversion of nearly all organics, whether present in hazardous or in mixed waste, to carbon dioxide. Insoluble transuranics are dissolved in this process and may be recovered by separation and precipitation. The oxidant, or mediator, is a multivalent transition metal ion which is cleanly recycled in a number of charge transfer steps in an electrochemical cell. The MEO technique offers several advantages which are inherent in the system. First, the oxidation/dissolution processes are accomplished at near ambient pressures and temperatures (30 - 70 {degrees}C). Second, all waste stream components and oxidation products (with the exception of evolved gases) are contained in an aqueous environment. This electrolyte acts as an accumulator for inorganics which were present in the original waste stream, and the large volume of electrolyte provides a thermal buffer for the energy released during oxidation of the organics. Third, the generation of secondary waste is minimal, as the process needs no additional reagents. Finally, the entire process can be shut down by simply <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power,</b> affording a level of control unavailable in some other techniques. Although the oxidation of organics and the dissolution of transuranics by higher valency metal ions has been known for some time, applying the MEO technology to waste treatment is a relatively recent development. Numerous groups, both in the United States and Europe, have made substantial progress in the last decade towards understanding the mechanistic pathways, kinetics, and engineering aspects of the process. At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, substantial contributions have been made to this knowledge base in these areas and others. Conceptual design and engineering development have been completed for a pilot plant-scale MEO system, and numerous data have been gathered on the efficacy of the process {{for a wide variety of}} anticipated waste components.
