5|$|Corky waits next-door {{with the}} money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After {{watching}} Johnnie flirt with Violet and taunt him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. In an angry panic, he kills both Gino and Johnnie, and Gino's bodyguard Roy. He tells Violet that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived, lest their Mafia pals find the money or men missing. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey (John P. Ryan), a Mafia friend, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.|$|E
2500|$|A similar problem faces {{honeybee}} swarms. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new home, and {{the many}} scouts and wider participants have to reach consensus about which of perhaps several candidate homes to fly to. And then they all have to fly there, with their queen. The bees approach works reliably, but when researchers are so unkind as to offer two hives, equally attractive by all the criteria bees apply, catastrophe ensues, the swarm breaks up, and all the bees die.|$|E
2500|$|... wasn't so {{much about}} The Beatles. It {{was a very good}} script in which the agency of these two famous people and their story takes you somewhere deeper. To me, that's the nature of friendship: How we grow, how we grow up, and how things change. These boys knew each other when they were 16 and now they're 35 and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new truth. We all have our own {{relationships}} like that, whether they're matrimonial relationships or friendships.|$|E

50|$|At Paniel's Key Stand, teams {{received}} {{a key to}} the Porta do Céu, which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> on their own.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Alun-alun Selatan, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their next clue, attached {{in one of}} the cycling car, known as odong-odong.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How do {{they know}} their places?' you asked, or should have asked. Yes, {{and they have to}} do much more than know them: <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their way to them, and that quietly and at once, without running against each other.|$|E
60|$|The {{excitement}} in Vancouver's Island itself is quite insignificant {{compared to that}} in Washington and Oregon territories, and in California, and which, of course, is increased by every possible means by interested parties. The result has been that several hundred persons from American territory have already flocked to the newly reported auriferous regions, and by the last accounts fresh steamers, and even sailing vessels, were being chartered to convey passengers to Puget Sound, or to Vancouver's Island, whence <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{their way to the}} diggings principally by canoes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly; or {{that she}} should not love me. I am not such a puppy as to suppose that she is to throw herself into my arms just because I ask her. But I think that she must have known {{something}} of herself so as {{to have been able}} to tell me either to hope or not to hope. She was as calm as a Minister in the House of Commons answering a question; and she told me to wait till Friday just as those fellows do when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out from the clerks in the office what it is they ought to say." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Upon {{arriving}} in Hong Kong, teams went to Kowloon Walled City Park where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the warriors <b>to</b> identify with history.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the leg, teams {{received}} only two dried butterflies in their clue and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> figure out that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Dali's Butterfly Spring.|$|R
50|$|Once {{arrived in}} Bangkok, teams took the BTS Skytrain from Siam Station, then {{traveled}} to Erawan Shrine where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the next clue near the temple dancers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{hope this}} will reach {{you before you}} move on to Palestine. You said in your last--at the end of September, so I hope you'll just get it. There is one great piece of news, which I'm afraid will hurt and trouble you; Nollie is married to Jimmy Fort. They were married down here this afternoon, and have just gone up to Town. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a house of course. She has been very restless, lonely, and unhappy ever since you went, and I'm sure it is really for the best: She is quite another creature, and simply devoted, headlong. It's just like Nollie. She says she didn't know what she wanted, {{up to the last}} minute. But now she seems as if she could never want {{anything}} else.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not so}} bad as that, Beorn. I do not {{say that}} we are not in an {{unpleasant}} position, but at any rate we are a great deal better off than we were when we were driving headlong on to the coast of Normandy, or when there were but three of us {{in the midst of the}} Bretons. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> us in the first place, and it will need a good many of them to overcome us when they do. I fancy that we are very near the head of this valley, the ground is rising rapidly. I propose that we push on now till the trees cease, and lie down there till morning breaks, and then cross the next hill so as to find shelter in some other valley before the sun is fairly up. From the top of the hill we may get a general view of the country, and shall have some idea as to the course to take. We must first of all try to find a native who can tell us which is the direction of Porthwyn and how far it lies away. Our orders are to reconnoitre it and that must be done before there is any question of return. Even if I were absolutely alone, I would carry out that order." ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing was so {{astonishing}} {{and significant}} in the discoveries of the embryologists, nor anything so absurdly little appreciated, as this recapitulation, {{as it is now}} called: this power of hurrying up into months a process which was once so long and tedious that the mere contemplation of it is unendurable by men whose span of life is three-score-and-ten. It widened human possibilities to the extent of enabling us to hope that the most prolonged and difficult operation of our minds may yet become instantaneous, or, as we call it, instinctive. It also directed our attention to examples of this packing up of centuries into seconds which were staring us in the face in all directions. As I write these lines the newspapers are occupied by the exploits of a child of eight, who has just defeated twenty adult chess players in twenty games played simultaneously, and has been able afterwards to reconstruct all the twenty games without any apparent effort of memory. Most people, including myself, play chess (when they play it at all) from hand to mouth, and can hardly recall the last move but one, or foresee the next but two. Also, when I have to make an arithmetical calculation, I have to do it step by step with pencil and paper, slowly, reluctantly, and with so little confidence in the result that I dare not act on it without 'proving' the sum by a further calculation involving more ciphering. But there are men who can neither read, write, nor cipher, to whom the answer to such sums as I can do is instantly obvious without any conscious calculation at all; and the result is infallible. Yet some of these natural arithmeticians have but a small vocabulary; are at a loss when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> words for any but the simplest everyday occasions; and cannot for the life of them describe mechanical operations which they perform daily {{in the course of their}} trade; whereas to me the whole vocabulary of English literature, from Shakespear to the latest edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, is so completely and instantaneously at my call that I have never had to consult even a thesaurus except once or twice when for some reason I wanted a third or fourth synonym. Again, though I have tried and failed to draw recognizable portraits of persons I have seen every day for years, Mr Bernard Partridge, having seen a man once, will, without more strain than is involved in eating a sandwich, draw him to the life. The keyboard of a piano is a device I have never been able to master; yet Mr Cyril Scott uses it exactly as I use my own fingers; and to Sir Edward Elgar an orchestral score is as instantaneously intelligible at sight as a page of Shakespear is to me. One man cannot, after trying for years, finger the flute fluently. Another will take up a flute with a newly invented arrangement of keys on it, and play it at once with hardly a mistake. We find people to whom writing is so difficult that they prefer to sign their name with a mark, and beside them men who master systems of shorthand and improvise new systems of their own as easily as they learnt the alphabet. These contrasts are to be seen on all hands, and have nothing to do with variations in general intelligence, nor even in the specialized intelligence proper to the faculty in question: for example, no composer or dramatic poet has ever pretended to be able to perform all the parts he writes for the singers, actors, and players who are his executants. One might as well expect Napoleon to be a fencer, or the Astronomer Royal to know how many beans make five any better than his bookkeeper. Even exceptional command of language does not imply the possession of ideas to express; Mezzofanti, the master of fifty-eight languages, had less to say in them than Shakespear with his little Latin and less Greek; and public life is the paradise of voluble windbags.|$|E
5000|$|Off the Charts - The {{team was}} given a wordsearch puzzle {{resembling}} an eye chart and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> four words with a common theme in 30 seconds with clues placed around the puzzle for assistance.|$|R

5000|$|The second {{refers to}} a {{restaurant}} opened in Busan by two from Hamheung in North Korea. For the dishes, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out ingredients in easier supplies with more popularity for residents in Busan.|$|E
50|$|Before the Detour, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to Manzanillo del Mar {{and look}} for a juice stand named Terraza Melló Farándula Jugos Naturales. Once there, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> some locals playing dominoes who would give them their next clue.|$|R
50|$|The caravan was {{significantly}} slowed as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> grazing areas, {{a rarity in}} the desert, for the camels {{because one of the}} team members had skimped on buying fodder for the animals. Stromer could do nothing but fume.|$|R
50|$|When the FDIC and {{eventually}} the Resolution Trust Corporation {{took control of the}} assets, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> institutions, organizations and private investors that would be willing to purchase the assets of closed banks including both performing and non-performing (delinquent or charged-off) accounts.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} of two sisters, {{their love and}} sacrifices for each other. Circumstances put them {{opposite}} each other as mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their own path towards their values and ethics.|$|E
50|$|Angel, Spike, and Gunn head to {{the garage}} and get in a Camaro that drives itself. Gunn tells them <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the Wrath, which {{they need to go}} through to return to Wolfram & Hart.|$|E

50|$|Ryan, Speier, Dwyer, and Annibourne {{stayed the}} night in Jonestown while {{other members of the}} delegation, {{including}} the press corps and members of Concerned Relatives, were told that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> other accommodations. <b>They</b> went to Port Kaituma and stayed at a small café.|$|R
50|$|At Largo da Carioca, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{conduct a}} survey {{with the people}} of Rio de Janeiro. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> eight people from eight {{different}} states of Brazil and bring them to the judge, who would verify their place of birth and stamp the survey.|$|R

50|$|Another issue {{raised by}} aerial {{eradication}} is rights violations. First of all, aerial eradication is destroying the only economic option {{for a number}} of peasants involved in illicit drug crops. Also, when the crops are destroyed, it causes forced displacement of peasants, because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new place to grow their crops.|$|E
50|$|Dirty Laundry: Three {{players were}} chosen to do the contestants laundry.
