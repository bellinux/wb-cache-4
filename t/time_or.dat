5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway, the Kriegsmarine stationed over 240 U-boats in the Nordic country at one <b>time</b> <b>or</b> another, {{most of them}} members of the 11th U-boat Flotilla, which had 190 U-boats in its fleet during the flotilla's entire career. Other well-known flotillas in Norway included the 13th and 14th Flotillas.|$|E
5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with <b>time</b> <b>or</b> items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E

Moulting may occur up to three <b>or</b> four <b>times</b> <b>or,</b> in some insects, fifty <b>times</b> <b>or</b> more during its life.

30|$|Among Whites, high {{frequency}} (2.8 <b>times)</b> <b>or</b> moderate frequency (1.7 times) gambling, gambling online (2.6 <b>times)</b> <b>or</b> both online and in land-based venues (2.7 times), purchasing scratch-off tickets (2.7 times), betting on sports (2.3 times), playing games of skill (1.8 times), live casino games (1.7 times) and/or gaming machines (1.6 times) were most predictive of at-risk problem gamblers.|$|R
5|$|Even in finite dimensions, the {{concepts}} of functional analysis have illuminated economic theory, particularly in clarifying the role of prices as normal vectors to a hyperplane supporting a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities. However, problems of describing optimization over <b>time</b> <b>or</b> under uncertainty {{require the use of}} infinite–dimensional function spaces, because agents are choosing among functions or stochastic processes.|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could be because the stones constituting the wall were robbed over <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> simply because the wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|It {{is worth}} remembering that {{conducting}} detritylation {{for an extended}} <b>time</b> <b>or</b> with stronger than recommended solutions of acids leads to depurination of solid support-bound oligonucleotide and thus reduces the yield of the desired full-length product.|$|E
50|$|For example, by Metcalfe, if a {{hypothetical}} network of 100,000 members has {{a value of}} $1M, doubling its membership would increase its value (200,0002/100,0002) <b>times,</b> <b>or</b> in other words quadruple to $4M.However, per Odlyzko, that its value would only grow by 200,000 log (200,000) / 100,000 log(100,000) <b>times,</b> <b>or</b> in other words, slightly more than double to $2.1M.|$|R

40|$|For spectrally {{negative}} Lévy processes, adapting {{an approach}} from BoLi:sub 1, we identify joint Laplace transforms involving local times evaluated at either the first passage <b>times,</b> <b>or</b> independent exponential <b>times,</b> <b>or</b> inverse local <b>times.</b> The Laplace transforms {{are expressed in}} terms of the associated scale functions.

5|$|Karamokho Alfa's {{maternal}} {{cousin was}} Maka Jiba, {{the ruler of}} Bundu, and both men studied in Fugumba under the famous scholar Tierno Samba. However, there are no records of Bundu participation in the Futa Jallon jihad, {{perhaps because of the}} internal troubles in Bundu at that <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> perhaps because Maka Jiba was not greatly interested in the cause.|$|E

5|$|On a Riemannian manifold, any smooth simple {{closed curve}} will remain smooth and {{simple as it}} evolves, {{just as in the}} Euclidean case. It will either {{collapse}} to a point in a finite amount of <b>time,</b> <b>or</b> remain smooth and simple forever. In the latter case, the curve necessarily converges to a closed geodesic of the surface.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{earliest}} history, {{from the}} time of its founding as a small tribal village, to the downfall of its kings, is the least well preserved.
