500|$|Test pilot Roland Beamont {{finally made}} the first flight from the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, on 27 September 1964. Initial flight tests were all {{performed}} with the undercarriage down and engine power strictly controlledwith limits of [...] and [...] on the first (15-minute) flight. Shortly after takeoff on XR219's second flight, vibration from a fuel pump at the resonant frequency of the human eyeball caused the pilot to <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> one engine to avoid momentary loss of vision.|$|E
500|$|All {{the enemy}} {{were shot down}} by Marseille in a turning dogfight. As soon as he shot, he needed only to glance at the enemy plane. His pattern [...] began at the front, the engine's nose, and {{consistently}} ended in the cockpit. How {{he was able to}} do this not even he could explain. With every dogfight he would <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> as far as possible; this enabled him to fly tighter turns. His expenditure of ammunition in this air battle was 360 rounds (60 per aircraft shot down) ...|$|E
500|$|The U-shaped {{centring}} post was sized so {{the tips}} of the U were the same width as the range indication line when the target was at , which indicated that the pilot should <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> and begin his final approach. Two vertical lines to the sides of the display, the goal posts, indicated that the target was [...] ahead {{and it was time to}} look up to see it. Two smaller lines indicated a range of , at which point the pilot should have seen the target, or had to break away to avoid collision.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} suggests that the pilot had <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> a moment before impact and that his engines had been running normally up to that time.|$|R
5000|$|The captain {{carried out}} test {{procedures}} immediately after takeoff: autopilot engage, <b>throttling</b> <b>back</b> the left engine, and tripping the hydraulic circuit breaker; this took him temporarily [...] "out of the piloting loop." ...|$|R
50|$|By 1994 Harry {{had marked}} his half {{century in the}} business, an {{unprecedented}} accomplishment. However, in 1997, after completing his 53rd safari season, he <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> from the demands of full-season hunting, and finally retired from professional hunting in 2000 {{at the age of}} 75.|$|R
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of [...] "The Broken Man", series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss spoke {{about some of the}} thought process behind the motivations of the characters that were featured prominently in the episode. David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Nakhchivan at 17:52 local time. At an altitude of [...] and an airspeed of , the no. 1 engine failed. The co-pilot Sergey Kuliyev, {{who was at the}} controls, responded by countering the left bank, but five seconds later the flight engineer Alexander Sokolov reported, in error, that the no.2 engine had failed. The captain Eduard Hasanov took over control of the aircraft. However, because the co-pilot had countered the left bank, the captain did not have the sensory information which could have alerted him that it was the no.1 engine that had failed. The aircraft continued to climb. The captain then ordered the no. 2 engine to be shut down. The flight engineer retarded the right throttle and noticed that the power on the working engine was decreasing, he then pushed the No.2 <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> to full power, but the No.2 engine had already stopped. Eight seconds later, the flight engineer reported that both engines had failed. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of , while the speed had decreased to [...] The captain decided to make an emergency landing, but encountered an apartment block and made a sharp right turn to avoid it. The aircraft crashed into a field with a 37-degree right bank and a sink rate of [...] Thirty people out of eighty two on-board survived the accident (26 passengers and four crew members).|$|E
50|$|A launch {{from high}} {{altitude}} need not <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> at Max Q as it starts above the thickest {{portion of the}} Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|As {{the vehicle}} cleared the tower, the SSMEs were {{operating}} at 104% of their rated maximum thrust, and control switched from the Launch Control Center (LCC) at Kennedy to the Mission Control Center (MCC) at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. To prevent aerodynamic forces from structurally overloading the orbiter, at T+28 the SSMEs began throttling down {{to limit the}} velocity of the shuttle in the dense lower atmosphere, per normal operating procedure. At T+35.379, the SSMEs <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> further to the planned 65%. Five seconds later, at about 5800 m, Challenger passed through Mach 1. At T+51.860, the SSMEs began <b>throttling</b> <b>back</b> up to 104% as the vehicle passed beyond Max Q, the period of maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The JT3D-3B {{engines are}} readily {{identifiable}} {{by the large}} gray secondary air inlet doors in the nose cowl. These doors are fully open (sucked in at the rear) during takeoff to provide additional air. When the engines are <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> to cruise, the doors are shut.|$|R
50|$|With the Zeroes in pursuit, Captain Wagner {{suddenly}} <b>throttled</b> <b>back,</b> {{letting the}} surprised enemy fly over his head. Then he poured machine gun bullets into their tails, Turning back, the young Captain strafed a Japanese airfield leaving {{five of the}} 12 aircraft on the runway in flames.|$|R
5000|$|Ratio [...] is the {{quantity}} that determines the throttle {{setting of the}} engine. So, for instance, raising intake stagnation temperature by increasing flight speed, at a constant , will cause the engine to <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> to a lower corrected flow/pressure ratio.|$|E
5000|$|... 'The country is, I think, like an {{aeroplane}} at the take-off stage. It has become airborne; {{that is the}} stage of maximum risk and any failure of power {{could lead to a}} crash. It will {{be a long time before}} we can <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> to level flight.' (1961) ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{moderate}} acceleration: Because hybrid cars can <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> {{or completely}} {{shut off the}} engine during moderate, but not rapid, acceleration, they are more sensitive than conventional cars to driving style. Hard acceleration forces the engine into a high-power state while moderate acceleration keeps the engine in a lower power, high efficiency state (augmented by battery boost).|$|E
5000|$|John Fordham of The Guardian {{compared}} Shiina with pianist Wynton Kelly and {{commented that}} Shiina [...] "keeps his virtuosity <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> and maintains a hip expressiveness by letting insinuations, nuances and implied swing, and the subtle tick of the rhythm section {{do much of}} the work." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speed {{was limited}} {{due to the}} length of track (6.4 mi) and vehicle {{acceleration}} rates. Two Pratt & Whitney J52 jet engines were added to the vehicle to propel the vehicle up to higher speeds, after acceleration the engines were then <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> so that the thrust equaled their drag.|$|R
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|R
50|$|When {{traffic is}} {{particularly}} heavy, an ISP can deliberately <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> the bandwidth available to classes of users or for particular services. This {{is known as}} traffic shaping and careful use can ensure {{a better quality of}} service for time critical services even on extremely busy networks. However, overuse can lead to concerns about fairness and network neutrality or even charges of censorship, when some types of traffic are severely or completely blocked.|$|E
5000|$|While {{choosing}} their plane, {{the player}} {{can use the}} throttle to choose between four different paintjobs {{for each of the}} three planes. These paint jobs consist of a [...] "Standard" [...] scheme, [...] "Camouflage" [...] scheme, [...] "Special" [...] scheme, and [...] "Low Visibility" [...] scheme. After choosing their plane, the player can also choose to listen to After Burner Climax's music or the original soundtrack from After Burner II by holding the <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> and hitting the missile button.|$|E
50|$|The game's podracing {{utilizes}} the Kinect {{to simulate}} the dual throttle controls on podracers. Players extend arms fully to operate at full speed, and retract their arm to <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> on one or both engines. Multiple courses are offered. Rancor Rampage, the games third mode, allows players to control one of multiple species of rancor which are let loose in various Star Wars locales. Arm movements synchronize between the player and their rancor, and players can execute special attacks in this destruction-based game mode.|$|E
50|$|A fourth {{test was}} planned to {{simulate}} a full autorotative descent. The ATV would climb to an altitude 10,000 ft (3,050 m) {{under its own}} power, before <b>throttling</b> <b>back</b> and returning for a soft landing. At this point, given that further funding was then unlikely, safety considerations prevented the test being attempted.|$|R
5000|$|At the 1951 at Farnborough Airshow, Żurakowski {{demonstrated}} a new aerobatics manoeuvre, the [...] "Zurabatic Cartwheel", {{in which he}} suspended the Gloster Meteor G-7-1 prototype he was flying in a vertical cartwheel. [...] "This jet manoeuvre was the first new aerobatic in 20 years." [...] The cartwheel used the dangerously asymmetric behaviour the Meteor had with one engine <b>throttled</b> <b>back.</b> It started with a vertical climb to 4,000 feet, by which point the aircraft had slowed to only 80 mph. Cutting the power of one engine caused the Meteor to pivot. When the nose was pointing downwards, the second engine was <b>throttled</b> <b>back.</b> The aircraft continued to rotate through a further 360 degrees on momentum alone, having lost nearly all vertical velocity. Carrying out the cartwheel and recovering from it without entering an inverted spin (which the Meteor could not be brought out of) required great skill.|$|R
50|$|In the Angara A5, {{the four}} URM-1s used as {{boosters}} operate at full thrust for approximately 214 seconds, then separate. The URM-1 forming the vehicle's core is operated at full thrust for lift off, then throttled down to 30% to conserve propellant. The core is <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> {{up after the}} boosters have separated and continues burning for another 110 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Slower {{traffic in}} his lane forces Delaney to brake, {{allowing}} Stahler to overtake on the left. Delaney drafts the German, then both move alongside Wilson. Rather {{than try to}} pass Stahler, then possibly Wilson, Delaney drops back and bumps Stahler, forcing him to <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> to avoid spinning out when the Ferrari goes partially off the pavement. Delaney then uses the guardrail to block the aggressive Stahler's last ditch effort to overhaul, ensuring a win for Porsche. The teammates cross the finish line 1-2.|$|E
50|$|Test pilot Roland Beamont {{finally made}} the first flight from the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, on 27 September 1964. Initial flight tests were all {{performed}} with the undercarriage down and engine power strictly controlled - with limits of 250 kn and 10,000 ft on the first (15-minute) flight. Shortly after takeoff on XR219's second flight, vibration from a fuel pump at the resonant frequency of the human eyeball caused the pilot to <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> one engine to avoid momentary loss of vision.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, {{piloting}} {{his second}} homebuilt, [...] "Chief Oshkosh", Wittman placed {{second in the}} Greve Trophy Race. Wittman flew [...] "Bonzo" [...] in the Thompson Trophy race, and he led for the first 18 laps of the 20 lap race, at an average speed of over 275 mph (442.57 km/h). Suddenly his engine began to run rough, and Wittman was forced to <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> {{to remain in the}} race, finishing in 5th place. In 1938, he was awarded the Louis Blériot medal by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E
50|$|The {{delivery}} of the Class 210s being to Kempten in 1971 for work in the Allgaeu region meant that the less powerful V 219 001 was outdated. Thus, when the gas turbine failed with damage to the combustion chamber in 1974, the locomotive was converted for other uses. The diesel engine was <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> to , and the heating system was also shut down.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, the RS-68 {{became the}} first large liquid-propellant rocket engine {{designed}} in the U.S. since the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) in the 1970s. The primary goal for the RS-68 was to reduce cost versus the SSME. Some sacrifice in chamber pressure and specific impulse was made, hurting efficiency; however, development time, part count, total cost, and assembly labor were reduced to {{a fraction of the}} SSME, despite the RS-68's significantly larger size. Typically, the RS-68 runs at 102% rated thrust for the first few minutes of flight, and then throttles down to 58% rated thrust before main engine cutoff. On the Heavy variant, the main CBC's engine throttles down to 58% rated thrust around 50 seconds after liftoff, while the strap-on CBCs remain at 102%. This allows the main CBC to conserve propellant and burn after booster separation. After the strap-on CBCs separate, the main CBC's engine <b>throttles</b> <b>back</b> up to 102% before <b>throttling</b> <b>back</b> down to 58% prior to main engine cutoff.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} where rapid cooling arises is on descent from altitude. In this condition, less power is demanded {{of the engine}} (it is <b>throttled</b> <b>back)</b> so it is developing much less heat. In a descent, the plane's airspeed increases, simultaneously increasing the cooling rate of the engine. As metals expand and contract under temperature changes, dimensional changes in the engine may exceed tolerance limits.|$|R
50|$|As T1 {{increases}} {{along the}} SOT plateau, the engines will <b>throttle</b> <b>back,</b> causing both {{a decrease in}} corrected airflow and overall pressure ratio. As shown, the chart implies a common T3 limit for both the low and high design T1 cycles. Roughly speaking, the T3 limit will correspond to a common overall pressure ratio at the T3 breakpoint. Although both cycles will increase throttle setting as T1 decreases, the low design T1 cycle has a greater 'spool-up' before hitting the corrected speed limit. Consequently, the low design T1 cycle has a higher design overall pressure ratio.|$|E
50|$|Anzio used a {{hydraulic}} catapult to launch planes, and these imposed {{a much higher}} G-force than the steam ones that later replaced them. When launching, Sharer had to brace {{his head against the}} headrest, but more importantly, he had to put his right elbow {{against the back of the}} arm rest. Since this hand held the throttle, if it wasn't braced this way, the cat launch would force his hand to move the <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> to idle. The plane would end up stalling and likely be run over by the carrier after falling into the drink after launch.|$|E
50|$|The U-shaped {{centring}} post was sized so {{the tips}} of the U were the same width as the range indication line when the target was at 2500 feet km, which indicated that the pilot should <b>throttle</b> <b>back</b> and begin his final approach. Two vertical lines to the sides of the display, the goal posts, indicated that the target was 1000 feet m ahead {{and it was time to}} look up to see it. Two smaller lines indicated a range of 500 feet m, at which point the pilot should have seen the target, or had to break away to avoid collision.|$|E
5000|$|... † When this cap {{is reached}} the {{connection}} is <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> to 10% of its advertised speed {{for the rest of}} the month. Note that if a user were able to run the connection steadily at its advertised downlink speed he/she would reach the cap after a period between 5 and 16 hours and would get 10% of advertised speed {{for the rest of the}} month.|$|R
5000|$|Around 30 seconds into ascent, the SSMEs were {{throttled}} down—usually to 72%, {{though this}} varied—to reduce the maximum aerodynamic forces {{acting on the}} Shuttle at a point called Max Q. Additionally, the propellant grain design of the SRBs caused their thrust to drop by about 30% by 50 seconds into ascent. Once the Orbiter's guidance verified that Max Q would be within Shuttle structural limits, the main engines were <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> up to 104.5%; this <b>throttling</b> down and <b>back</b> up was called the [...] "thrust bucket". To maximize performance, the throttle level and timing of the thrust bucket was shaped to bring the Shuttle as close to aerodynamic limits as possible.|$|R
50|$|For initial {{tests the}} {{aircraft}} was fitted with dual controls {{in the side}} by side cockpit. Flight trials were relatively successful, but revealed a tendency to drop the starboard wing at high speeds (known colloquially as val'ozhka). Other problems included vibrations of the rear fuselage with the rear engine <b>throttled</b> <b>back</b> and the front engine at maximum power, the twin mainwheels proved troublesome as well as unreliable radio and very poor performance from the radar.|$|R
