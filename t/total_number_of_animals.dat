40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam H. HsuCaterina M. ScoglioEarly {{detection}} of livestock diseases {{and development of}} cost optimal mitigation strategies are becoming a global necessity. Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) {{is considered one of}} the most serious livestock diseases owing to its high rate of transmission and extreme economic consequences. Thus, it is imperative to improve parameterized mathematical models for predictive and preventive purposes. In this work, a meta-population based stochastic model is implemented to assess the FMD infection dynamics and to curb economic losses in countries with underdeveloped livestock disease surveillance databases. Our model predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of FMD over a weighted contact network where the weights are characterized by the effect of wind and movement <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> and humans. FMD incidence data from countries such as Turkey, Iran and Thailand are used to calibrate and validate our model, and the predictive performance of our model is compared with that of baseline models as well. Additionally, learning-based prediction models can be utilized to detect the time of onset of an epidemic outbreak. Such models are computationally simple and they may be trained to predict infection in the absence of background data representing the dynamics of disease transmission, which is otherwise necessary for predictions using spatio-temporal models. Thus, we comparatively study the predictive performance of our spatio-temporal against neural networks and autoregressive models. Also, Bayesian networks combined with Monte-Carlo simulations are used to determine the gold standard by approximation. Next, cost-effective mitigation strategies are simulated using the theoretical concept of infection network fragmentation. Based on the theoretical reduction in the <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> infected <b>animals,</b> several simulative mitigation strategies are proposed and their cost-effectiveness measures specified by the percentage reduction in the <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> infected <b>animals</b> per million US dollars, are also analyzed. We infer that the cost-effectiveness measures of mitigation strategies implemented using our spatio-temporal predictive model have a narrower range and higher granularity than those for mitigation strategies formulated using learning-based prediction models. Finally, we coin optimal mitigation strategies using Fuzzy Dominance Genetic Algorithms (FDGA). We use the concept of hierarchical fuzzy dominance to minimize the <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> infected <b>animals,</b> the direct cost incurred due to the implementation of mitigation strategies, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> culled, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> vaccinated to mitigate an epidemic.

40|$|Background: Leptospirosis, a spirochetal zoonosis, is {{considered}} an occupational disease of persons engaged in agriculture, sewage works, forestry, and butchery. Objective: To determine the environmental sources and the knowledge, attitude and practices for leptospirosis among butchers and slaughterhouse workers, {{as well as the}} seroprevalence of leptospirosis among cattle and pigs presented for slaughter. Methods: Using an interviewer administered questionnaire, all 110 butchers and other slaughterhouse workers in the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew, Jamaica were surveyed. In addition, 179 blood samples from animals presented for slaughter were tested for anti- Leptospira antibodies using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Results: Analyses indicated that people with the studied occupations are at risk for developing leptospirosis due to several environmental risk factors that exist in slaughterhouses. Among the risk factors, limited knowledge of the disease and its transmission, lower educational level attained, younger age and unhealthy behaviors (e. g., hand washing and improper or lack of use of personal protective gears), presence of stray dogs and rodents, and inadequate maintenance of physical plants, were found to be important. <b>Of</b> the <b>total</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> samples tested, 20 (11 %) were positive.
