25|$|On 14 August, it was {{reported}} that Fernandes had flown to the Merseyside to complete the deal after being left out of the squad in Benfica's game, and he attended Everton's match against Blackburn 11 days later. Adding to the fact the player's rights were partly owned by an agency, the Premier League did not agree to the transfer as Everton would only half-own the player's contract – the English were not <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> this as the league had previously let Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano move to other clubs under the same agreements.|$|E

500|$|... {{is one of}} Mei Terumi's bodyguards. He is {{a middle-aged}} ninja who wears an eyepatch on his right eye, and is often {{critical}} of his teammate Chōjūrō's indecisiveness, likely {{as a result of}} his upbringing during the time when the village was known as [...] "the Blood Mist". When Mifune suggests Danzo Shimura to lead the inter-village effort against Akatsuki, Ao reveals that he has a Byakugan under his eyepatch and uses it to discover that Danzo's eye and arm are that of a ninja he previously fought, Shisui Uchiha, who had the ability to control others minds without their knowledge. He then goes after Danzo's group when they flee, but falls for Fu's trap, with Danzo not <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> him possessing abilities taken from a Konoha ninja. He is eventually saved by Mei and Chojuro. He serves in the Allied Shinobi Forces as captain of the Sensor Division stationed in the Shinobi Alliance Headquarters in Kumogakure. When the Ten Tails fires a Tailed Beast Bomb to decimate the HQ, Ao is presumably killed, alongside Shikaku Nara and Inoichi Yamanaka. However, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations reveals that he survives, albeit with heavy injuries which are treated by Katasuke's scientific ninja tools. Years after the Fourth Ninja War, he is working for Kara, an organization researching cursed seals. He is voiced by Tadahisa Saizen in the Japanese anime, while Steven Blum voices him in the English adaptation.|$|E

Dracula forces him to try the procedure anyway, and when it does not work, the antagonists set out again to find Anna.|$|R
2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E

He was cute-looking and tall, over six feet.... I was in my last year at Hunter College; we were still dating when Sid went into the service, the Coast Guard. Luckily he was stationed in New York so we were able to continue seeing each other, even though my parents weren't <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> it. They never thought he would amount to anything, that he'd never have a real career or make any money. But we were married one year after we met, in July of 1943."

30|$|Respondents {{were also}} asked about a variety of family and {{individual}} characteristics. In terms of their parents, participants were asked about the educational attainment of their mothers and fathers. The higher of the two (when two parents were present) was then included {{as a measure of}} the highest parental education, with responses including “eighth grade or less” (1), “beyond the eighth grade but did not complete high school” (2), “high school degree” (3), “attended college but did not finish degree” (4), “four-year college degree” (5), and “graduate or professional degree” (6). Maternal employment was also assessed, with respondents being queried about whether their mother was employed for pay outside the home (yes[*]=[*] 1, no[*]=[*] 0). Since the familial context is likely to influence both dating and marriage patterns among young adults, participants were asked: “For most of the time when you were growing up, did you think your parents’ marriage was not <b>too</b> <b>happy</b> (1), just <b>about</b> average (2), <b>happier</b> than average (3), or very happy (4).” Since western culture could potentially affect dating and marriage patterns among Chinese young adults, the respondents were also queried as to whether English was spoken in their homes (1 [*]=[*]yes, 0 [*]=[*]no). In regard to parental influence, participants were offered the following statement: “I would be willing to date someone of whom my parents/family did not approve.” Responses ranged from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (5).|$|R
