5|$|The Lights at <b>the</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tunnel</b> by William Wainwright, a large {{reflective}} mobile in the station's mezzanine. It {{was removed}} in 1986 after a lead weight fell off.|$|E
5|$|While {{plans to}} {{construct}} the bypass existed as late as 1985, the connection to the Queens Boulevard line at Northern Boulevard was built {{as an alternative to}} the bypass. A bellmouth was built at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> should construction on the bypass ever commence.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 November 1923, a slight misjudgement at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{enlargement}} work left the tunnel unstable near Borough. A collapse on the same day, caused when a train hit temporary shoring near Elephant & Castle, filled the tunnel with wet gravel. Later a gas main exploded, causing a water main to break and leaving a water-filled crater {{in the middle of}} the street. The line was briefly split in two, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E
50|$|Cho {{moved to}} the Qatar Stars League after <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2010 World Cup to Al Rayyan Sports Club on a 2-year deal, until <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2011-2012 season. After <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2011-2012 season, Cho renewed his {{contract}} for one more year which will keep him at the Qatari club until <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2012-2013 season.|$|R

He left <b>the</b> club at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season.|$|R
5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. The light at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, {{in an attempt to}} nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E

At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2011-12 season the club returned to Liga Alef (now the third tier), following a victory of 2-1 against Hapoel Azor in the promotion play-off.|$|R

25|$|Fictional catastrophe: Unlike real disasters, catastrophes {{which are}} only made up or solved in one's mind might be humorous, {{as can be}} seen in the quotation: The light at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> is only muzzle flash.|$|E
25|$|He {{produced}} two music albums for entertainer and actress Grace Lee Whitney: Light at <b>the</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tunnel</b> in 1996, and Yeoman Rand Sings! in 1999.

25|$|Force India's big updates {{were showing}} {{improvements}} as Adrian Sutil came 6th {{in the first}} session, while in the second session Sutil came 6th again while Giancarlo Fisichella showed a bit of form {{when he came in}} 8th. BMW Sauber were still struggling as they came 12th and 15th. But Robert Kubica was hopefully showing a light at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> as he came 7th in the second session, splitting the two Force Indias.|$|E

25|$|On Friday 28 February 1975, a {{southbound}} {{train on}} the Northern City Line failed {{to stop at}} its Moorgate terminus and ploughed into the wall at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> In the resulting tube crash, 43 people died and a further 74 were injured, this being the greatest loss of life during peacetime on the London Underground. In 1976 the Northern City Line {{was taken over by}} British Rail and linked up with the main line railway at Finsbury Park, a transfer that had already been planned prior to the accident.|$|E
25|$|The Moorgate tube crash {{occurred}} on 28 February 1975 at 08:46 GMT on the Northern City Line, then operated by London Underground as the Highbury {{branch of the}} Northern line. A train failed {{to stop at the}} Moorgate station, the line's southern terminus, and crashed into the wall at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> In the greatest loss of life during peacetime in the London Underground, 43 people died and a further 74 were injured. With no fault being found with the train equipment, a report from the Department of the Environment found that the driver had failed to slow the train and stop at the station and there was insufficient evidence to determine the reason.|$|E
25|$|East of the station, {{the center}} tracks also {{continue}} disused along Houston, but rise to an upper level and stub-end near Avenue A at bumper blocks. Near the end, these tail tracks begin to separate {{to create a}} provision for a center track which only extends about 10 or 15 feet and stops at the bulkhead at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> It was planned that these tracks would continue under the East River to the South Fourth Street Line, part of a never-built system expansion. These tracks east of the station were previously used for train storage but became an oft-frequented spot for the homeless due to its location near local missions and soup kitchens. The area was cleared out in 1990, and corrugated metal walls with bumper blocks were installed just past {{the east end of}} the platforms to seal the tunnels.|$|E

25|$|The {{memorial}} {{is shaped}} like a ship's prow; the crypt is accessible by two staircases and a lowered square protected by a metal portcullis. The crypt leads to a hexagonal rotunda that includes two chapels containing earth and bones from concentration camps. The walls display literary excerpts. Pingusson intended that its long and narrow subterranean space convey a feeling of claustrophobia. The memorial's entrance is narrow, marked by two concrete blocks. Inside is the tomb of an unknown deportee who was killed at the camp in Neustadt. Along both walls of the narrow, dimly lit chamber are 200,000 glass crystals with light shining through, meant to symbolize each of the deportees {{who died in the}} concentration camps; at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> is a single bright light. Ashes from the camps, contained within urns, are positioned at both lateral ends. Both ends of the chamber have small rooms that seem to depict prison cells. Opposite the entrance is a stark iron gate overlooking the Seine {{at the tip of the}} Île de la Cité.|$|E
500|$|The riverbanks in Yonkers {{are often}} lined with tires, {{shopping}} carts, plastic bottles, and other trash. In 2008, DEC found trash and pollution from the river's mouth to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> [...] "Urban refuse (tires, bottles, cans, etc.) lines {{much of the}} lower river," [...] it reported. [...] "Oil/gasoline slicks are regularly observed along this segment." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{stretches}} further upriver {{were slightly}} better. Between <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and Woodlands Lake, {{the river was}} still found to be impaired for recreation, drinking and aquatic life, but less strewn with litter, and as a whole the habitat was merely stressed. Above that point, the Saw Mill's waters were merely stressed for aquatic life and recreation, with only fish consumption considered to be impaired. DEC {{did not know the}} sources of pollutants in this stretch and called for further research." ...|$|E
50|$|On 9 December 2015 it was {{announced}} that his contract would not be renewed at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season.

500|$|The line then {{runs through}} the [...] Nåli Tunnel, the longest on the line. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> lies Kårdal Station, {{traditionally}} serving the farm furthest up in the valley. The station is [...] from Myrdal and [...] AMSL. On {{the other side of}} the valley is Trodlatoppen, the site of several avalanches every year. The line then {{runs through the}} [...] Blomhelleer Tunnel, after which it reaches Blomheller Station, [...] from Myrdal and [...] AMSL. The railway then crosses the river Flåmselvi and runs through a series of short tunnels.|$|E
500|$|By 1985, the line's {{construction}} {{had cost}} $800 million, {{and the line}} would need another $200 million of fixes {{in order to make}} it usable. The MTA considered abandoning the line, but because the tunnel was examined and found to be sturdy, the MTA decided to add a single station in Queens: the 21st Street–Queensbridge station in Long Island City. However, the 63rd Street Subway's eastern Queens extension was no longer being planned, although a bellmouth was built at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> past 21st Street–Queensbridge, as a provision for the express bypass. The usage estimates for 21st Street–Queensbridge, calculated in 1984, were 220 passengers per hour. The MTA considered four alternatives to improve the line's functionality by extending it farther into Queens: ...|$|E
500|$|When Henriksen {{first got}} the script, he mistook {{it for a}} film because of its [...] "powerful" [...] story. He was not fond {{of the idea of}} {{participating}} in a television project. Henriksen contacted Carter about the character; his first question was [...] "How {{are you going to make}} this hero a hero? I mean, it is so dark, how are you going to handle this?" [...] Carter replied saying that Frank was a hero because he was able to [...] "stand-up" [...] against all of this. Henriksen was also worried about the dark [...] "feel" [...] of the show, saying that all shows needs some glimpse of light at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> According to Carter [...] "The yellow house" [...] was the light, which Henriksen later agreed upon.|$|E

50|$|McDonald signed another one-year {{extension}} {{that would}} see him to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2010 season. He also broke {{the record for the}} most games by a Rookie Listed player (238). On 20 August, McDonald announced that he would retire at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2010 season, saying he felt he could have played on for another year, but that the club came first and the club's decision was for him to retire at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season.|$|R
50|$|By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, the European powers, having {{recovered}} from their previous defeats and emboldened by Napoleon's absence, organized a new Second Coalition.
