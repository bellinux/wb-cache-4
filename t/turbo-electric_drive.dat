5000|$|<b>Turbo-electric</b> <b>drive</b> was {{introduced}} on the battleship , launched in 1917. Over {{the next eight}} years the US Navy launched five additional turbo-electric-powered battleships and two aircraft carriers (initially ordered as s). Ten more turbo-electric capital ships were planned, but cancelled due to the limits imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. Although New Mexico was refitted with geared turbines in a 1931-33 refit, the remaining turbo-electric ships retained the system throughout their careers. This system used two large steam turbine generators to drive an electric motor on each of four shafts. The system was less costly initially than reduction gears and made the ships more maneuverable in port, with the shafts able to reverse rapidly and deliver more reverse power than with most geared systems. Some ocean liners were also built with <b>turbo-electric</b> <b>drive,</b> as were some troop transports and mass-production destroyer escorts in World War II. However, when the US designed the [...] "treaty cruisers", beginning with [...] launched in 1927, geared turbines were used to conserve weight, and remained in use for all fast steam-powered ships thereafter.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the lessons}} of Jutland, the {{protection}} scheme incorporated a sophisticated torpedo defense system (TDS). By adopting a <b>turbo-electric</b> <b>drive,</b> this allowed a wholesale rearrangement and close subdivision of the machinery spaces, while simultaneously narrowing them and permitting more space outboard for a layered system of voids, liquid-filled tanks and thin armored bulkheads. By contrast, [...] "thin-skinned" [...] cruisers and carriers relied only on numerous compartments to prevent flooding from spreading. Some were upgraded with anti-torpedo blisters, though these were much inferior to the battleships armored belt. During the Pearl Harbor attack, TDS and damage control counterflooding saved West Virginia from nine torpedo hits, while , which lacked it, capsized after just three.|$|E
50|$|As an {{alternative}} to steam turbine propulsion found in full size destroyers and larger warships, many US destroyer escorts of the World War II period had diesel-electric or <b>turbo-electric</b> <b>drive,</b> in which the engine rooms functioned as power stations supplying current to electric motors sited close to the propellers. Electric drive was selected {{because it does not}} need gearboxes (which were heavily in demand for the fast fleet destroyers) to adjust engine speed to the much lower optimum speed for the propellers. The current from the engine room can be used equally well for other purposes, and post-World War II many destroyer escorts were recycled as floating power stations for coastal cities in Latin America under programs funded by the World Bank.|$|E

The T2-SE-A2 Escambias had more powerful engines and were markedly faster than the -A1s. 30 of these oilers were ordered, but {{three of them were}} canceled before their completion; two others were converted into water distillation ships (AW) and one into a water tanker. One of these oilers sank in 1947, and a second in MSC service in 1972. Some of the Escambias were later transferred to the US Army and used as mobile electric power plants in Vietnam.|$|E

50|$|In steamships, {{advantages}} of steam turbines over reciprocating engines are smaller size, lower maintenance, lighter weight, and lower vibration. A steam turbine is only efficient when {{operating in the}} thousands of RPM, while the most effective propeller designs are for speeds less than 300 RPM; consequently, precise (thus expensive) reduction gears are usually required, although numerous early ships through World War I, such as Turbinia, had direct drive from the steam turbines to the propeller shafts. Another alternative is turbo-electric transmission, in which an electrical generator run by the high-speed turbine is used to run one or more slow-speed electric motors connected to the propeller shafts; precision gear cutting may be a production bottleneck during wartime. <b>Turbo-electric</b> <b>drive</b> was most used in large US warships designed during World War I and in some fast liners, and was used in some troop transports and mass-production destroyer escorts in World War II.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{somewhat}} experimental class, the Caldwells differed in their engineering. Gwin and Conner, built by Cramp, followed the class's original design, with three-shaft direct drive steam turbines. A high-pressure turbine {{on the center}} shaft exhausted to low-pressure turbines on the outboard shafts. A geared cruising turbine was provided on the center shaft for fuel economy at low and moderate speeds. The remaining ships had two shafts with geared turbines and no cruising turbines. This arrangement saw an increase from [...] and the ships' speed from 30 to 32 kn. With a further increase in horsepower, this geared turbine arrangement was adopted for the mass-production classes. Caldwell had an experimental [...] "electric speed reducing gear" [...] connecting the cruising turbines to the main turbines, a forerunner of the <b>turbo-electric</b> <b>drive</b> {{that would be used}} on several US battleships and aircraft carriers built from World War I through the 1920s.|$|E
