Over 450 Carnegie Mellon students, staff members, {{and friends of}} Pausch attended the lecture, leaving only standing room as {{this was more than}} the auditorium could hold. Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying [...] "A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding– hopefully at the appropriate times– that gives a lot of validation <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> {{that a lot of people}} believe in this, and a lot of people who knew me believe that I did my best to try to live this way." [...] The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon. Nair first explained the university's aforementioned lecture series called [...] "Journeys", in which eight more professors from Carnegie Mellon would share their insights on their professional and personal experiences over the years.|$|E

Lombardo remembers listening to a live rendition of [...] "South of Heaven" [...] and thinking, Man! There's just so much groove in that song.' <b>To</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> I was saying, 'Listen to that! Listen to how groovy that is!' And it's heavy."

But how to raise a child with a mind for managing money and a heart for helping others? Despite a career in finance, I found it hard to speak <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> about money. While I didn't want them to feel entitled, I didn't want them to stress over money either. We all know that if you do not learn to manage money responsibly it will end up managing you. If we're lucky, we also understand that by helping others we are really helping ourselves. Both of these values are at the core of ThreeJars.|$|E
