Hence, the Malays were said to claim dominance in both political and cultural spheres, which led to resentment of the Malay aristocratic class and Malays in general.|$|E

30|$|Power {{systems are}} {{vulnerable}} to cyber attacks. Modern IT technologies are heavily used in today’s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems of industrial control systems including power systems.

For example, the connectivity of SCADA systems and enterprise networks improves business visibility and efficiency, but it makes SCADA systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. According to the 2003 ~ 2006 data from Eric Byres, BCIT, 49  % cyber attacks at industrial control systems are launched via connected enterprise networks.

25|$|Madden's {{stewardship}} of the NLRB came under increasing attack, however. Section 9(b) of the NLRA authorized the Board to determine the appropriate bargaining unit, but did not specify what standards to use to make that determination. The AFL had long preferred craft unionism, whereby workers were organized into unions {{on the basis of}} craft, trade, or skill. But other unions sought to organize workers on an industry-wide basis (industrial unionism) to create more powerful unions as well as to take advantage of changes in the workplace that mass production and increases in corporate size were making. The intense philosophical differences led the AFL to eject <b>those</b> <b>organizations</b> advocating industrial unionism, and these unions formed the CIO in November 1936.|$|E
25|$|Foreign missionaries {{are allowed}} in the country if they {{restrict}} their activities to social improvements and refrain from proselytizing.

They refused, and in 1985 President Hosni Mubarak restored Pope Shenouda III, who had been accused of fomenting interconfessional strife. Particularly in Upper Egypt, the rise in extremist Islamist groups such as the Gama'at Islamiya during the 1980s was accompanied by increased attacks on Copts and on Coptic Orthodox churches; these have since declined with the decline of <b>those</b> <b>organizations,</b> but still continue.

25|$|The {{organizing}} model, as {{the term}} refers to trade unions (and sometimes other social-movement organizations), {{is a broad}} conception of how <b>those</b> <b>organizations</b> should recruit, operate, and advance the interests of their members, though the specific functions of the model are more detailed and are discussed at length below. It typically involves many full-time organizers, who work by building up confidence and strong networks and leaders within the workforce, and by confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. The organizing model is strongly linked to social movement unionism and community unionism. The organizing model contributes to the discussion of how trade unions can reverse the trend of declining membership, which they are experiencing in most industrial nations, {{and how they can}} recapture some of the political power, which the labor movement has lost over the past century.|$|E
