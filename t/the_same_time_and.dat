5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an artificial lake built on a flat piece of land {{to the front of}} the mansion house. The landscape gardener William S Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate at about <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> it is assumed he gave help with the work at Pitfour. The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system had spread {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams to play at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club {{to continue with the}} advantage of the extra forward.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being done {{at the same point}} in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
5|$|Development of Qwak! {{began in}} 1974, {{finishing}} in November. It {{was presented at}} the November 1974 Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition for release that month. The game was not commercially successful; according to Ralph H. Baer, it sold approximately 250 units. A two-player clone game by U.S. Billiards, Duck Shooting, was produced around <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> Qwak! has been noted as a possible inspiration for the 1984 Nintendo Entertainment System light gun game Duck Hunt.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} week of sales in the United Kingdom Batman: Arkham Origins was the number-one-selling game on all {{available}} formats, topping the all-format chart.

It was the eleventh-best-selling boxed game of 2013 in the country. It was also the top-selling game on the digital-distribution platform Steam between October 20 and 26, 2013.|$|E

The Cricket Club served notice to quit at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> so in 1943 the tenancy was officially ended. Hull were forced to return to the Boulevard Ground from 1944 until 1945 because of the poor {{condition}} of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road. The new stadium was finally opened under the revised name of Boothferry Park on 31 August 1946.|$|E

Special Chess Engine Communication Protocol compatible engines have been written that support bughouse, examples are Sunsetter, Sjeng and TJchess.

5|$|The Independent and Ledger offered {{different}} versions of events, the former more sympathetic to the Nelsons. According to the Independent, Laura grabbed another gun, a Winchester rifle hidden behind a trunk. L.

A shell passed through Constable Martin's pant legs, grazing him in the thigh, then hit Loney in the hip and entered his abdomen. He walked outside and died a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping is greatly augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the fluctuations we see are not all in phase. It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E

The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they noticed the audience would all stand up at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> stay standing.
