5|$|In the 11th century, William the Conqueror {{brought the}} Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a {{predominantly}} white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound {{derived from the}} St. Hubert Hound which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably {{gave rise to the}} Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules. At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E
5|$|One of Harrison's first acts as {{president}} was {{to implement a}} new training program for college graduates hired by the company. Rather than being placed in supervisory roles, they were given regular entry-level jobs in the engine shops and on the building and repairing of railroad track, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> understanding of the basics of the railroad business. He also instituted a remedial education program for the regular workforce; they were trained in mathematics and other subjects to high school level, {{as well as in}} engine and machine-shop basics. The program was designed to help train new supervisors in the skills needed to oversee other workers.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} against HLS {{led to its}} share price crashing, the Royal Bank of Scotland closing its bank account, and the British government arranging for the Bank of England <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> account. The company's share price, worth around £300 in the 1990s fell to £1.75 in January 2001, stabilizing at 3 pence by mid-2001. In 2000, HLS was dropped from the New York Stock Exchange because of its market capitalization had fallen below NYSE limits.|$|E

Then in 1986, Harris added an extension to the set, building the fourth side of Albert Square, and in 1987, Turpin Road was added, which included buildings such as The Dagmar.|$|E

Since {{art director}} Yusuke Naora convinced the Square staff to make Final Fantasy X an Asian-themed game, Nomura designed the characters <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> Asian look. Nomura first illustrated the characters' faces and started adding details upon receiving {{information from the}} staff. Since the PlayStation 2's capabilities allowed to feature multiple details, Nomura did so with characters and asked the staff to make them consistent. The hardest part from his work involved making the characters's clothes identical between full motion scenes and in-game parts.|$|E
25|$|Adding to {{the growing}} {{tensions}} between the Congressional Union and NAWSA, Burns made a radical proposal once again at the 1913 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Because Democrats controlled the White House and both houses of Congress at the time, Burns wanted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> ultimatum—support our bill for suffrage or we will make sure you don’t get reelected. Burns stated “Inaction establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open hostility.” She was {{no longer going to}} stand for the apathy from the Democratic Party. Burns was particularly infuriated with President Wilson because he had told them he would support the Committee on Suffrage, but then never mentioned his promise in his address to Congress. When a delegation of women from NAWSA tried to meet with him to address this incident and register their protest, Wilson claimed to be ill. A few days later, Wilson reneged his vow to support suffrage and said he would not impose his private views on Congress.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 28 March sappers from the Viet Cong (VC) 409th Sapper Battalion {{approached}} the wire of FSB Mary Ann and took up positions to launch an attack. The exact number of sappers involved is uncertain, but most sources agree that {{there were at least}} 50. As was common practice for such units, the sappers wore khaki shorts and soot camouflage and were armed with either an AK-47 or RPG-7 and satchel charges and grenades to attack bunkers. Sappers relied on stealth, shock and surprise <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> advantage, and rarely carried heavy weapons or equipment. The 409th was known to the intelligence section of the 196th LIB, but had previously operated against ARVN targets north of Quang Tin Province. It was assumed by the 196th LIB's intelligence personnel that both the 409th and the 402nd Sapper Battalions were east of FSB Mary Ann, preparing to attack ARVN targets in that region. None of them predicted an attack on the US base.|$|E

25|$|The Arizona Diamondbacks led {{off what}} would {{ultimately}} be a 6–5 victory on July 21 over the visiting Nationals with back-to-back-to-back home runs off Scherzer, {{the first time}} in Nationals history that an opponent had blasted three consecutive home runs in a game and the first time it had happened to Scherzer. The Nationals rallied to win the second game of the series behind a revamped pitch arsenal from starter Roark, who befuddled Diamondbacks batters by ditching his four-seam fastball and mixing in a heavier-than-usual dose of curveballs. Facing rookie starting pitcher Anthony Banda in his major league debut, Harper crushed a 467-foot home run onto the Chase Field concourse in right-center field — the longest home run of his career to that point — to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 15 games. Heisey suffered a groin injury while legging out a pivotal triple in the 4–3 contest and was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Left fielder Ryan Raburn was also assigned to the bereavement list, taking leave to attend his grandfather's funeral. Washington recalled catcher Pedro Severino and selected the contract of outfield prospect Andrew Stevenson to take Heisey and Raburn's roster spots. Stevenson made his major league debut in the July 23 rubber game, being inserted mid-game to replace Wilmer Difo in left field and going 0-for-2 at the plate. The Nationals won 6–2, but Strasburg exited the game just two innings into his start with forearm tightness, with Blanton picking up the win in relief. The Nationals announced July 25 that Strasburg had been treated for a nerve impingement. He was placed on the 10-day disabled list, with top pitching prospect Erick Fedde tabbed to make a spot start in his place. Raburn was transferred from the bereavement list to the disabled list with a trapezius strain on July 26. The Nationals recalled Solis <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> extra reliever the next day, bringing the bullpen up to a total of five left-handed relievers. First base coach Davey Lopes returned the same day after an extended leave of absence.|$|E

500|$|The {{performance}} {{is connected with}} the several odes that Gray also wrote and those of Joseph Warton and [...] William Collins. The poem, as it developed from its original form, advanced from the Horatian manner and became more Miltonic. The poem actively relied on [...] "English" [...] techniques and language. The stanza form, quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, was common to English poetry and used throughout the 16th century. Any foreign diction that Gray relied on was merged with English words and phrases <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> [...] "English" [...] feel. Many of the foreign words Gray adapted were previously used by Shakespeare or Milton, securing an [...] "English" [...] tone, and he emphasised monosyllabic words throughout his elegy to add a rustic English tone.|$|E
500|$|The most {{challenging}} effect was the [...] "limbo" [...] city level {{at the end}} of the film because it continually developed during production. Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan gave his ideal vision: [...] "Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture, but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs". Franklin and his team ended up with [...] "something that looked like an iceberg version of Gotham City with water running through it." [...] They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page based on this rough computer animation Franklin had created. Inception had close to 500 visual effects shots (in comparison, Batman Begins had approximately 620) which is considered minor in comparison to contemporary visual effects epics that can have around 1,500 or 2,000 special effects images.|$|E

500|$|Early autumn {{marked the}} return of the Champions League and Manchester United were paired up with Italian champions, Juventus, Dutch giants Feyenoord and Slovakians Košice in Group B. Ferguson's men started their quest away to Košice; it didn't take them long to stamp their {{authority}} – Denis Irwin tapped in an intercepted cross, Henning Berg scored his first goal with a thumping header and Andy Cole completed the rout three minutes from time with a composed finish. The first night of October brought Juventus to Old Trafford in what was to be perhaps one of the best European matches ever staged at Old Trafford. After going a goal down inside 24 seconds to Alessandro Del Piero's cool finish, Teddy Sheringham replied with a looping header before Scholes put United into the lead, dribbling round Angelo Peruzzi to place the ball {{in the back of the}} net. They weren't finished yet – Giggs fired into the top left hand corner <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> historic win.

500|$|It {{is unclear}} when Kujau {{produced}} his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau {{gave him a}} diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978, after a month's practice writing in the old German gothic script Hitler had used. Kujau used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and attempted to put the letters [...] "AH" [...] in gold on the front—purchasing plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a department store, he inadvertently used [...] "FH" [...] rather than [...] "AH". He took the black ribbon from a genuine SS document, and attached it to the cover using a German army wax seal. For the ink he bought two bottles of Pelikan ink—one black, one blue—and mixed them with water so it would flow more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Finally he sprinkled tea over the pages and bashed the diaries against his desk <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>an</b> aged look. Kujau showed the first volume to Stiefel, who was impressed and thought it a genuine Hitler diary; Stiefel wanted to buy it, but when the forger refused, the pair agreed that the collector could have it on loan.|$|E
