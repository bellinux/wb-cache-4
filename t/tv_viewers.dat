Immediately after the Broncos got the ball back, Smith broke ahead of Falcons safety Eugene Robinson, caught a pass from Elway, and took off for an 80-yard touchdown reception, giving Denver a 17–3 lead (the fourth 80+ yard touchdown pass play in Super Bowl history). <b>TV</b> <b>viewers</b> did not see most of the play, as Fox was still airing a commercial for The Matrix at the time. Aided by Dwight's 42-yard kickoff return to the 49-yard line, the Falcons responded by driving to Denver's 11-yard line and scored with Andersen's 28-yard field goal to cut Atlanta's deficit to 17–6 going into halftime.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Fuller created Pop Idol, a Saturday night {{prime time}} TV show that {{uncovered}} Will Young whose single Evergreen {{later became the}} 'biggest selling single of the century' in the UK. Fuller sold Pop Idol to Fox in the US, and American Idol quickly became a No.1 rated show making stars of its presenter Ryan Seacrest as well as judges Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell, {{as well as many}} of its performers including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and others. And later the show has featured many more high profiled judges including Ellen DeGeneres, Kara DioGuardi, Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez, Nicki Minaj, Mariah Carey, and Keith Urban. American Idol has since won many awards and has been credited with originating a new form of reality TV. Fuller has been credited with creating the most valuable TV format in the world with a value of over $8billion made up of revenue from sponsors, merchandising, telephone, music sales, broadcast and advertising sources. Over 30 million viewers saw David Cook win the seventh season of American Idol in May 2008 and when Fuller re-launched the show in 2011 for its 10th season ratings climbed 20% for the finale event. 122.4million votes were cast, a record for a reality TV show. In 2005 Fuller, along with co-creator Nigel Lythgoe, launched So You Think You Can Dance on the Fox network in the USA. The show grew over four seasons to become a regular summer hit. In 2012 Simon Fuller's XIX Entertainment created a new international format with Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and Jamie King named Q'Viva! The Chosen, and described as a celebration of Latin culture that screened in 21 territories reaching over 30 million Spanish speaking <b>TV</b> <b>viewers.</b>|$|E
25|$|On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing {{the injured}} left ankle that {{he picked up}} a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0–1 {{friendly}} loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer. With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN. As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer <b>TV</b> <b>viewers</b> than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, the {{progression}} of digital broadcasting has been toward establishing a user-friendly TV watching environment through personalized broadcasting services.

In this paper, therefore, we propose a new real-time content filtering system for live broadcasts which {{can be applied to}} TV terminals such as the set-top box and personal video recorder. Based on the proposed filtering, the <b>TV</b> <b>viewer</b> can watch not only favorite broadcasts of a main channel, but also get desired scenes from live broadcasts of other channels simultaneously. The usefulness of the proposed broadcasting content filtering is verified with sport videos on a test-bed broadcasting system 1...|$|R

The creative team decided that their choices for major mysteries had not worked since season one; Thomas elaborated, [...] "One feeling is that the big mysteries keep away the casual <b>TV</b> <b>viewers,</b> and the other is the thing that has been the least successful since season one [...] the big mysteries." [...] Thomas also recalled that his major design for the first season that was because Lilly had been murdered, everyone had a stake in the solving of the mystery and that the crew were finding it impossible to keep the same amount of emotional involvement since the first season; Thomas thought that the new format would be a way of trying to return to a more emotionally driven format.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to compete with Twitter's {{leadership}} in TV, Facebook introduced a number of features in 2013 to drive conversation about TV including hashtags, verified profiles and embeddable posts.

In January 2014, Facebook announced a partnership with UK-based social TV analytics company SecondSync which saw the social network make its social TV available outside the company for the first time. Facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as TV. However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later.
