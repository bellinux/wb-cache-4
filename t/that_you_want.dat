It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna explained the lyrical meaning behind the song, saying [...] "The song is basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> you should make me your girl because I've got what you need".|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after Mitchell's trial, Galle and Mitchell split a $750,000 {{settlement}} in the civil suit. The nurses, who both live in Jal, New Mexico, were unable to find employment in nursing after being terminated from WCMH. After signing the settlement, Wiley reinforced his support of Arafiles, saying, [...] "He’s {{done a lot of}} good in this county.

The track incorporates synthpop and hip hop influences with [...] "hand claps" [...] and a [...] "pounding bass". It additionally displays sexually-suggestive lyrics, including the lines [...] "put me in a cage and lock me away/and I'll play the games <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me to play" [...] and [...] "anything you want you can make it yours".|$|E
500|$|Armando Pérez, who co-wrote {{the tracks}} [...] "Loca" [...] and [...] "Rabiosa", talked about Shakira's {{previous}} album She Wolf, saying [...] "on the last album {{they tried to}} Americanize Shakira by giving her the big producers. Not that it was necessarily a bad thing, but it’s just not her". Talking about his collaboration with Shakira, El Cata revealed that she told him [...] "You have something that makes me move". Cata responded by telling Shakira that [...] "it was the percussion" [...] and [...] "Those sounds <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> I have them in my studio.", {{which led to a}} recording session between the two. He appears as a featured artist on the Spanish version of [...] "Loca".|$|E

500|$|The {{entertainment}} news site Mandatory said Partridge was [...] "a fascinatingly layered and fully realised creation {{of years of}} storytelling and a fundamentally contemptible prick — he feels like a living, breathing person, but a living, breathing person <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to strangle." [...] The Telegraph credited Partridge with influencing [...] "awkward" [...] sitcoms such as The Inbetweeners, Nighty Night and Peep Show, and wrote: [...] "Never has one actor so completely inhabited a sitcom character. We believe Partridge is real, from his side-parted hair down to his tasseled sports-casual loafers." [...] In 2014, Guardian writer Stuart Heritage described Partridge as [...] "one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations {{of the last few}} decades." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars {{and noted that}} despite the episode being [...] "Funny stuff," [...] it was {{ultimately}} [...] "a little uneven overall." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. Despite calling the episode [...] "a likeable piece of work", the two explained that the story itself was fine, but that the episode's set piece did not work with the plot. Shearman and Pearson, however, ultimately concluded that the premise was [...] "such a well-meaning little bauble <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to applaud it for its intent if nothing else." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Homer and his {{children}} {{want to see the}} unveiling of a new Funtendo console called Zii Zu, which is a reference to Nintendo's Wii U console. As he and the children make their way through the crowded convention to get to the unveiling, the screen turns into a first-person shooter game through the eyes of Homer. He uses Frisbees and a fire extinguisher as weapons to get forward. According to Selman, the inspiration for this came from the fact that [...] "if you've been to E3, you know it's insane, it's super-crowded, it's super-loud, and walking through it feels like a video game, like a nightmarish first-person video game of bloggers and nerds. You just want to get the thing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to get to." ...|$|E

500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, Łukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> so much more. [...] You feel it in front of you and you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E
500|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled [...] "consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and {{just as long as}} you want me to come, I am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E
500|$|Musically, is an R {{song with}} reggae influence, {{reinforcing}} Rihanna's [...] "tropical reggae signature". According to the digital music sheet published at musicnotes.com, [...] "If It's Lovin' that You Want" [...] {{is written in}} the key of A-flat major and is set in common time with a moderate dance goove with a metronome of 98 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of G5. A sequel to the song entitled [...] "If It's Lovin' <b>That</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> – Part 2", which features rap vocals by Cory Gunz, was included as a bonus track on Rihanna's sophomore album, A Girl Like Me (2006). The song was written by Samuel Barnes, Scott LaRock, Makeba Riddick, Jean-Claude Oliver, Lawrence Parker and was produced by the latter two under their production name, Poke & Tone of Trackmasters." ...|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} John Lasseter {{explained that}} [...] "The challenge is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to make Rapunzel {{feel like a}} smart, clever, educated, healthy, fun human being" [...] {{despite the fact that}} the character has not ventured outside of her tower in 18 years. To avoid creating a [...] "princessy and aloof" [...] heroine, the animators decided to base Rapunzel's personality on actresses Reese Witherspoon, Natalie Portman, and Amy Poehler, which ultimately resulted in the character having a variety of [...] "quirky qualities" [...] that were used to [...] "shake up expectations of what a princess should be." [...] According to The New York Times, Rapunzel's personality made her a significant departure from traditional Disney heroines. Mandy Moore believes that Rapunzel is an atypical Disney princess because she is an independent character who [...] "can take care of herself", in addition to being largely oblivious to the fact that she is a princess.|$|E
500|$|Henn {{revealed}} that {{he was drawn to}} [...] "Mulan's story [...] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, [...] "We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not going to look realistic... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools that you have in the design to convey the believable emotions <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to get across." [...] In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as [...] "the emotional heart of the story". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{appraisal}} of Pacer has been mixed. Allmusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the album as [...] "exciting, gut-level rock & roll". The Rough Guide to Rock calls Pacer [...] "satisfyingly lo-fi". In Spin magazine, reviewer Joy Press {{writes that the}} album includes [...] "a half-dozen gems" [...] but that its overall [...] "foggy sound" [...] and [...] "indecipherable lyrics" [...] prevent the listener from fully embracing the work. Robert Christgau considers the album's songs to be [...] "definitely slight" [...] and [...] "uneven" [...] but praises the vocals, stating that [...] "speedy or dreamy, Kim Deal sounds so sane, so unpretentious, so goddamn nice <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> {{to take her home}} and give her a shampoo". In The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, critic Ira Robbins writes that [...] "Other than the fine title track and a few others, the performances are forced and lackluster; the production varies between flat and colorless." [...] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide similarly praises the title song while dismissing the rest of the album as [...] "forgettable".|$|E
6000|$|... "I have my beat {{outside to}} look after, sir," [...] the constable answered. [...] "If it wasn't <b>that</b> <b>you</b> seem respectable, I {{should begin to}} think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> {{me out of the}} way for a bit. Name and address, please." ...|$|R

500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes {{there are things that}} need to be done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist. He understands that even when you have friends that come back from the dead, not everything <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to happen is going to happen." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} {{two years}} on tour promoting Brown Sugar, D'Angelo found himself stuck with writer's block. On the setback, D'Angelo later stated [...] "The thing about writer's block is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to write so f---king bad, [...] the songs don't come out that way. They come from life. So you've got to live to write." [...] During this time, he generally released cover versions and remakes, including a cover-collaboration with Erykah Badu of the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell duet song [...] "Your Precious Love" [...] for the soundtrack to High School High (1996). D'Angelo also covered Prince's [...] "She's Always in My Hair" [...] for the Scream 2 soundtrack (1997), {{as well as the}} Ohio Players' [...] "Heaven Must Be Like This" [...] for the Down in the Delta soundtrack (1998). He also appeared on a duet, [...] "Nothing Even Matters", with Lauryn Hill for her debut solo album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). He also spent the time lifting weights, smoking weed, and making music.|$|E
500|$|The Two Towers {{received}} critical acclaim; film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes {{reported that}} 96 percent of critics were positive. CNN film critic Paul Clinton called The Two Towers an [...] "utter triumph", and writer Philip French of The Guardian {{noted in a}} review of the second film that [...] "these Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman remarked [...] "The Two Towers conjures an illusion of the gravity <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> from an emotionally charged storybook epic. Really, though, {{what it comes down to}} is superbly staged battle scenes and moral alliances forged in earnest yet purged of the wit and dynamic, bristly ego that define true on-screen personality." [...] The film was also listed on a number of critics' lists; Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics named The Two Towers 2002's third best film, while Central Ohio Film Critics named The Two Towers that year's fifth best film and Southeastern Film Critics ranked it the eighth.|$|E
