5|$|Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire is a {{pinball game}} {{developed}} by Jupiter, published by The Pokémon Company and distributed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. It was first revealed at E3 in 2003, {{and was released}} {{in the same year}} – on August 1, August 25, and November 14 in Japan, North America, and PAL regions respectively. The North American release was done to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the North American release of Pokémon Red and Blue. It is based on Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and is a sequel to Pokémon Pinball for the Game Boy Color. In some ways, it plays like a traditional pinball game, where the objective is to get a high score by keeping <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> as long as possible and hitting bumpers. In keeping with the theme of Pokémon, it features Pokémon collection, where while the players play pinball, they must also capture the eponymous creatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season the}} club surpassed {{the achievements of}} the previous season, finishing fourth in the league and again reaching the FA Cup final, this time facing Birmingham City. Conscious that early nerves had affected his team in 1955, in the dressing room he focussed on instilling each member of his team with confidence. This time it was Manchester City who scored an early goal, and with City leading in the second half Paul told his men to keep <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> as much as possible in order to tire out the Birmingham players. Then German goalkeeper Bert Trautmann badly hurt his neck in a collision with Peter Murphy. Paul instructed Roy Little to take Trautmann's place, but Trautmann insisted that he would keep playing. Then Manchester City held on for the victory, and Paul collected the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II. X-rays later revealed that Trautmann had played on with a broken neck. Paul took the match ball from the final as a souvenir, and gave it to his son.|$|E
25|$|Gottlieb's Humpty Dumpty, {{introduced}} in 1947, {{was the first}} game to add player-controlled flippers to keep <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> longer, adding a skill factor to the game. The low power flippers required three pairs around the playfield {{to get the ball}} to the top.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is <b>in</b> <b>play</b> players {{may play}} <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> contest <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> and goals may be scored. Players {{are liable to}} {{punishment}} for committing either fouls or misconduct. Substitutions may not occur whilst <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is <b>in</b> <b>play.</b>|$|R

25|$|If {{the time}} runs out while a team is {{preparing}} for a free-stroke or penalty, the strike should still be made but it must go into the goal by one shot to count as a goal. Similarly, a goal made via a corner stroke should be allowed, {{but it must be}} executed using only one shot in addition to the strike needed to put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} the ballgame are not known, but it was {{probably}} similar to volleyball, where {{the object is to}} keep <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play.</b> In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber, and weighed up to 4kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{judgment}} call involving an error {{occurs when the}} defense fails {{to put out a}} batter-runner who puts <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play.</b> If the out is not recorded and the official scorer believes that an [...] "ordinary effort" [...] by the defense would have resulted in an out, the defense is charged with an error, and the batter is not credited with a hit. Other common situations requiring a judgment call include unintentionally dropped foul balls that allow the batter to continue his at-bat, and poor throws to the next base when a runner attempts to advance.|$|E

500|$|A {{report in}} The Field stated: [...] "The {{result was a}} more easy victory for Mr Spencer Gore than had been expected.". Third-placed Heathcote said that Gore was the best {{player of the year}} and had a varied service with a lot of twist on it. Gore, {{according}} to Heathcote, was a player with an aptitude for many games and had a long reach and a strong and flexible wrist. His volleying style was novel at the time, a forceful shot instead of merely a pat back over the net. All the opponents who were defeated by Gore {{on his way to the}} title were real tennis players. His victory was therefore regarded as a win of the rackets style of play over the real tennis style, and of the offensive style of the volley player – who comes to the net to force the point, over the baseline player – who plays groundstrokes from the back of the court, intent on keeping <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play.</b> His volleying game was also successful because the height of the net at the post – 5ft (1.52 m) in contrast to the modern height of 3ft 6 in (1.07 m) – made it difficult for his opponents to pass him by driving the ball down the line. Gore indicated that the real tennis players had the tendency to play shots from corner to corner over the middle of the net and did so at such a height that made volleying easy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rules of}} the game are not known, but judging from its descendant, ulama, they were {{probably}} similar to racquetball, where the aim is to keep <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play.</b> [...] The stone ballcourt goals are a late addition to the game.|$|E
2500|$|Hugh McDermott, {{scouting}} for the Oklahoma Sooners, {{said the}} kicks from Eckhardt in the '23 Texas-Vandy game featured the best kicking {{he had ever}} seen. He recounted, [...] "Once Eckhardt put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> from his 15-yard line following a fair catch and punted 65 yards on the fly over the entire Vanderbilt team." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ball</b> remains <b>in</b> <b>play</b> from <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of each period {{to the end of}} that period, except when: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ball</b> becomes <b>in</b> <b>play</b> {{as soon as}} {{it enters}} the field of play and leaves the hands of the thrower.|$|R
5000|$|Lite Gumball - Lights the Gumball machine. The player must {{shoot the}} right orbit to load <b>the</b> current <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> into <b>the</b> gumball machine.|$|R
2500|$|When any {{of these}} sensors is activated, the game {{registers}} a [...] "tilt" [...] and locks out, disabling solenoids for the flippers and other playfield systems so that the ball can do nothing other than roll down the playfield directly to the drain. A tilt will usually result in loss of bonus points earned by the player during that ball; the game ends if it's the last ball and the player has no extra ball. Older games would immediately end <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> on a tilt. Modern games give tilt warnings before sacrificing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play.</b> The number of tilt warnings can be adjusted by the operator of the machine. Until recently most games also had a [...] "slam tilt" [...] switch which guarded against kicking or slamming the coin mechanism, or for overly aggressive behavior with the machine, which could give a false indication that a coin had been inserted, thereby giving a free game or credit. This feature was recently taken out by default in new Stern S.A.M System games, but can be added as an option. A slam tilt will typically end the current game for all players.|$|E
2500|$|Kramer {{went on to}} {{say that}} Riggs [...] "could keep <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play,</b> and he could find ways to control the bigger, more {{powerful}} opponent. [...] He could pin you back by hitting long, down the lines, and then he'd run you ragged with chips and drop shots. [...] He was outstanding with a volley from either side, and he could lob as well as any man.... he could also lob on the run. [...] He could disguise it, and he could hit winning overheads. [...] They weren't powerful, but they were always on target." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} three minutes of a half, the penalty for failure to place <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> within the 20-second play clock, known as [...] "time count" [...] (this foul is known as [...] "delay of game" [...] in American football), is {{dramatically}} different from during the first 27 minutes. Instead of the penalty being 5 yards with the down repeated, the base penalty (except during convert attempts) becomes loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards on third down with the down repeated. In addition, as noted previously, the referee can give possession to the defence for repeated deliberate time count violations on third down.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> bounces behind <b>the</b> short line, or {{passes the}} {{receiving}} line, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is <b>in</b> <b>play</b> and <b>the</b> opposing player(s) may play it.|$|R

2500|$|Captive balls: Sometimes a ball {{is allowed}} to move around only within a {{confined}} area. A typical application of this is having a short lane on the playfield with a narrow opening, inside which a captive ball is held. The player can strike this captive ball with <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play,</b> pushing it along the lane to activate a rollover switch or target. In games such as Theatre of Magic, captive balls sometimes have what's called a [...] "Newton Ball," [...] which is a stationary ball adjacent to a free ball in a small lane. The ball being played strikes the Newton ball which, in turn, transfers its momentum to the adjacent ball, which causes it to move.|$|E
2500|$|Pinball {{is a type}} of arcade game, {{in which}} points are scored by a player {{manipulating}} one or more steel balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine (or [...] "pinball table"). The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Many modern pinball machines include a story line where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story, usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. A drain is situated {{at the bottom of the}} play field, partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times. Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing (by earning [...] "extra balls" [...] and keeping <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> as long as possible) and to earn bonus games (known as [...] "replays").|$|E
2500|$|The {{roles of}} {{individual}} {{players in the}} batting order are strikingly similar. In both sports, the players {{near the top of}} the batting order are considered superior batters or batsmen. The initial batters or batsmen generally specialise in avoiding making outs/losing their wicket, while the third through fifth batters and batsmen are considered their team's best at providing runs. After that, the talent generally drops off, with the pitchers and bowlers generally being the worst at batting. Because outs are less important in baseball than in cricket, poorer batters are sometimes asked to attempt a [...] "sacrifice" [...] play in which they deliberately get themselves out in baseball to achieve a bigger team goal. This only occasionally happens in cricket, at the end of a limited-overs game, when a poorer batsman may sacrifice himself so that his partner will be on-strike for the next delivery. Also, since in baseball a batter who puts <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> does not get another at-bat until the entire batting order is cycled through, the opposing team may pitch around a skilled batter, deliberately walking him so that another batter comes to the plate. In cricket, a batsman remains at the pitch until he is out (or the team is all out, or his captain declares, or the set number of overs have been bowled), and the other team must bowl to him until he is out. The only way captains can negate the influence of superior batters similar to pitching around is to try to keep the more skilled batsman off-strike. This can be seen at the end of closely fought matches, where a captain might try and maximise the number of deliveries his bowlers can bowl at a non-specialist batsman. The exception is if the player is injured and has to leave the field for treatment: the next batsman in the order will then take his place. If the original batsman is able to continue later on, he can join the game again when one of his team's batsmen is out provided his injury time has expired or after 5 wickets have fallen, whichever comes first provided the rest of the team is not bowled out before either of these situations arise.|$|E

50|$|For {{the trick}} to work, the fielder (generally an infielder) must get <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is <b>in</b> <b>play,</b> and a runner must not realize that the fielder has <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When kickoffs {{and free}} kicks {{go out of}} bounds {{untouched}} {{in the field of}} play, the receivers have the option to put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> 30 yards from the spot of the kick, in addition to the two other options (putting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>play</b> at the out-of-bounds spot or re-kick after a five-yard penalty).|$|E

5000|$|In {{association}} football (soccer), {{the term}} [...] "dead ball" [...] {{refers to a}} situation when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is not <b>in</b> <b>play,</b> e.g. when play has not been restarted after <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{has gone out of}} bounds or a foul has been committed. It also applies before each kick-off, either at the start of each half or after a goal has been scored. <b>In</b> a dead <b>ball</b> situation, players can position <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> with their hands prior to restarting play. Furthermore, even though <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is not <b>in</b> <b>play,</b> <b>the</b> referee may still issue cautions or ejections (yellow or red cards) for any incident that occurs off <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Fouls, on <b>the</b> other hand, can occur only while <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is <b>in</b> <b>play.</b>|$|R
