40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} explored ethnic stereotypes, {{levels of}} blatant/subtle prejudice toward Africans and {{the relationships between}} these two dimensions in Italian university {{students with and without}} friends belonging to other ethnic groups. The ethnic traits and jobs choice (De Caroli & Sagone, 2007) and the Subtle and Blatant Prejudice Scale (Pettigrew & Meertens, 1995) were used. Results showed that most of the students attributed positive traits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Africans and negative traits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians,</b> and assigned prestigious-intellectual jobs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> and practical-manual jobs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Africans. University students with both low levels of blatant prejudice and high levels of subtle prejudice (Subtles) assigned more prestigious-intellectual jobs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italians</b> and practical-manual jobs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Africans than the others (Equalitarians). Friendship affected prejudice and, partially, stereotypes...|$|R

5|$|A few {{recent works}} {{have become a}} part of the modern repertoire, {{including}} scores and theatrical works by composers such as Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Franco Donatoni, and Sylvano Bussotti. These composers are not part of a distinct school or tradition, though they do share certain techniques and influences. By the 1970s, avant-garde classical music had become linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Italian</b> Communist Party, while a revival of popular interest continued into the next decade, with foundations, festivals and organization created to promote modern music. Near the end of the 20th century, government sponsorship of musical institutions began to decline, and several RAI choirs and city orchestras were closed.
