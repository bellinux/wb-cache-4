40|$|Background : Research {{has shown}} that the {{prevalence}} of unmarried cohabitation has increased in most Latin American countries and that childbearing within consensual union, traditionally confined to low-income groups, is becoming socially acceptable among highly educated women. Objective : We focus on the increasing importance of childbearing within consensual union for overall fertility. We measure <b>the</b> relative <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> births within marriage and births within consensual union to period fertility as a component of population change for 13 Latin American countries from 1980 to 2010. Methods : We use census data and the own-children method to estimate <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> marriage and consensual union to age-specific fertility rates, to cumulative fertility, and to the TFR. Results : In most Latin American countries <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> marriage to age-specific fertility rates has decreased over time, whereas <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> consensual union has increased steadily. In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> marriage to <b>the</b> TFR is still larger than <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> consensual union. In Ecuador and Uruguay they have become roughly similar. In Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> consensual union to the TFR is larger than that of marriage. Conclusions : In Latin America, fertility, as a component of population change, is less and less related to marriage and increasingly linked to consensual union instead. Comments : We found that not only <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> births within consensual union, but also <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> out-of-union births to overall fertility has been increasing over time.
