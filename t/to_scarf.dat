50|$|The {{shape of}} the shock wave is {{influenced}} by variation {{of the speed of}} sound with altitude, and the temperature and humidity of different atmospheric layers determines the appearance of the Wilson clouds. Condensation rings around or above the fireball are a commonly observed feature. Rings around the fireball may become stable, becoming rings around the rising stem. Higher-yield explosions cause intense updrafts, where air speeds can reach 300 miles per hour. The entrainment of higher-humidity air, combined with the associated drop in pressure and temperature, leads to the formation of skirts and bells around the stem. If the water droplets become sufficiently large, the cloud structure they form may become heavy enough to descend; in this way, a rising stem with a descending bell around it can be produced. Layering of humidity in the atmosphere, responsible for the appearance of the condensation rings as opposed to a spherical cloud, also influences the {{shape of the}} condensation artifacts along the stem of the mushroom cloud, as the updraft causes laminar flow. The same effect above the top of the cloud, where the expansion of the rising cloud pushes a layer of warm, humid, low-altitude air upwards into cold, high-altitude air, first causes the condensation of water vapour out of the air and then causes the resulting droplets to freeze, forming ice caps (or icecaps), similar in both appearance and mechanism of formation <b>to</b> <b>scarf</b> clouds.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} assess failure within the adhesive, a failure {{criterion}} is needed. The suitability of different failure criteria for adhesives in single lap joints was studied by Harris and Adams [33], with the conclusion that for toughened ductile adhesive like the one {{used in the present}} study, the maximum principal strain is the best suited criterion. Further work carried out by Broughton et al. [22] also showed that strain-based failure criteria give more accurate results than stress-based failure criteria for adhesively bonded joints. Additionally, this work showed that a maximum principal strain criterion was better suited <b>to</b> <b>scarf</b> joints, whereas a peak shear strain criterion was better suited to lap joints. The models analyzed in this study have the characteristics of lap joints, thus the peak shear strain is chosen as failure criterion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to modeling duration for LVCSR using SCARF, a toolkit for speech recognition with segmental conditional random fields. We utilize SCARF’s ability to integrate long-span, segment-level features to design and test duration models that help discriminate between correct and incorrect word hypotheses. We show that the duration distributions of correct and incorrect word hypotheses differ. Given a word hypothesis in the lattice and its duration, conditional length probabilities are integrated to the SCARF system as duration features. We evaluate three kinds of duration features on Broadcast News: word, pre- and post-pausal durations, and word span confusions. Adding the duration features <b>to</b> <b>SCARF</b> results in an up to 0. 3 % improvement over a state-of-the-art discriminatively trained baseline of 15. 3 % WER on a Broadcast News task.

40|$|Some {{extensions}} of the (third-class) Romanovski polynomials (also called Romanovski/pseudo-Jacobi polynomials), which appear in bound-state wavefunctions of rationally extended Scarf II and Rosen-Morse I potentials, are considered. For the former potentials, the generalized polynomials satisfy a finite orthogonality relation, while for the latter an infinite set of relations among polynomials with degree-dependent parameters is obtained. Both types of relations are counterparts of those known for conventional polynomials. In {{the absence of any}} direct information on the zeros of the Romanovski polynomials present in denominators, the regularity of the constructed potentials is checked by taking advantage of the disconjugacy properties of second-order differential equations of Schrödinger type.

It {{is devoted}} to the exact {{solutions}} of the Schrödinger equation with the hyperbolic Scarf potential (Scarf II) which finds various applications in physics ranging from soliton physics to electrodynamics with non-central potentials. In the current literature the exact solutions <b>to</b> <b>Scarf</b> II are written in terms of Jacobi polynomials of purely imaginary arguments and parameters that are complex conjugate to each other. The fact is that the above Jacobi polynomials are proportional to real orthogonal polynomials by the purely imaginary phase factor, (−i) n, much like the phase relationship between the hyperbolic–and the trigonometric functions, i. e. sin(ix) = i sinh(x). These real polynomials, to be referred to as the Romanovski polynomials, have been largely ignored by the standard mathematical textbooks on polynomials and mathematical methods of physics texts although they are required in exact solutions of several physics problems ranging from supersymmetric quantum mechanics and quark physics to random matrix theory.

Although number of researchers have studied on scarf repaired technique [1, 2], they are mostly layer-by-layer handlaid scarf repaired technique.

40|$|In {{tensile test}} setups strain gauges or {{extensometers}} are typically {{used to measure}} the strain. Strain gauges and extensometers provide average values over the size of the strain gauges or distance between the measurement points but no information for the remaining area of the speci-men. This is reasonable for monolithic isotropic materials with small deformations. However for anisotropic materials, like composites or bonded joints, the average values may not be sufficient. Important strain deviations may not be detected. The focus of the work presented are scarf repaired coupon and single lap shear specimens where the strain distribution along the bondline is highly uneven. This cannot be covered by single meas-uring points like strain gauges. With the digital image correlation (DIC) system ARAMIS 12 M by GOM it is possible to gain detailed strain information over the complete measurement area. The advantage of DIC measurements on coupon specimens is that there are free edges where the scarf and the adhesive layer are visible. In this paper the challenges with the right combination of lenses, test setup and the right surface treatment especially for small measurement areas are ana-lysed and discussed. The aim is to use the full resolution of 12 mega pixel for the measurement area around the bondline. This possibility in combination with a suitable surface treatment allows a detailed view on the adhesive layer. After the test the definition of system parameters are critical for reasonable results. The results allow for detecting strain peaks caused by 0 ° plies, see Figure 1, or flaws in the bondline. Comparisons to Finite Element simulations are shown and discussed. Addi-tionally <b>to</b> <b>scarf</b> joints, the examinations are extended to a conventional lap joint configuration.

40|$|Stable {{matchings}} {{were introduced}} in 1962 by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley to study the college admissions problem. The seminal work of Gale and Shapley has motivated hundreds of research papers and found applications {{in many areas of}} mathematics, computer science, economics, and even medicine. This thesis studies stable matchings in graphs and hypergraphs. We begin by introducing the work of Gale and Shapley. Their main contribution was the proof that every bipartite graph has a stable matching. Our discussion revolves around the Gale-Shapley algorithm and highlights some of the interesting properties of stable matchings in bipartite graphs. We then progress to non-bipartite graphs. Contrary to bipartite graphs, {{we may not be able}} to find a stable matching in a non-bipartite graph. Some of the work of Irving will be surveyed, including his extension of the Gale-Shapley algorithm. Irving's algorithm shows that many of the properties of bipartite stable matchings remain when the general case is examined. In 1991, Tan showed how to extend the fundamental theorem of Gale and Shapley to non-bipartite graphs. He proved that every graph contains a set of edges that is very similar to a stable matching. In the process, he found a characterization of graphs with stable matchings based on a modification of Irving's algorithm. Aharoni and Fleiner gave a non-constructive proof of Tan's Theorem in 2003. Their proof relies on a powerful topological result, due <b>to</b> <b>Scarf</b> in 1965. In fact, their result extends beyond graphs and shows that every hypergraph has a fractional stable matching. We show how their work provides new and simpler proofs to several of Tan's results. We then consider fractional stable matchings from a linear programming perspective. Vande Vate obtained the first formulation for complete bipartite graphs in 1989. Further, he showed that the extreme points of the solution set exactly correspond to stable matchings. Roth, Rothblum, and Vande Vate extended Vande Vate's work to arbitrary bipartite graphs. Abeledo and Rothblum further noticed that this new formulation can model fractional stable matchings in non-bipartite graphs in 1994. Remarkably, these formulations yield analogous results to those obtained from Gale-Shapley's and Irving's algorithms. Without the presence of an algorithm, the properties are obtained through clever applications of duality and complementary slackness. We will also discuss stable matchings in hypergraphs. However, the desirable properties that are present in graphs no longer hold. To rectify this problem, we introduce a new ``majority" stable matchings for 3 -uniform hypergraphs and show that, under this stronger definition, many properties extend beyond graphs. Once again, the linear programming tools of duality and complementary slackness are invaluable to our analysis. We will conclude with a discussion of two open problems relating to stable matchings in 3 -uniform hypergraphs...|$|E
