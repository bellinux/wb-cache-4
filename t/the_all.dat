5|$|After the {{kick-off}} {{there was}} soon a scrum ordered <b>The</b> <b>All</b> Blacks were repeatedly penalised by the referee whenever {{they had a}} scrum. The reason for this was <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation where they had only two front-rowers. The Welsh team used a three-man front row, and had studied <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks scrummaging technique. The Welsh countered <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation by setting their front row after <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks, and hence preventing <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks from gaining the loosehead. Consequently, every time <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks tried to hook the ball they were penalised, and this prompted their captain Gallaher to order his team not to contest the scrums, and to instead let the Welsh win the ball.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes, and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was for the players, not the spectators. The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks, and did not make them feel very welcome. They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks were not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E

France {{won the first}} Test in Toulouse and <b>the</b> <b>All</b> Blacks the second in Paris. France then reciprocated and toured New Zealand in 1979. This time, neutral referees were appointed for the first time. <b>The</b> <b>All</b> Blacks won the first Test 239 at Lancaster Park.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>All</b> Blacks back-line {{formation}} {{was also}} {{different from that}} in Britain.

The British press were also surprised to see All Blacks fullback Billy Wallace attacking so often—They had generally viewed the fullback as a defensive position. <b>The</b> <b>All</b> Blacks also thought that every player, whether a back or a forward, should make themselves available to take a pass in support of an attacking player. The teams they encountered had forwards that understood their main role of winning possession for their backs, but would not support them when attacking.|$|E
