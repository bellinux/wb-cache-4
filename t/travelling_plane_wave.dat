It is compared to the previous results in dimension 1, to the Cattaneo system, and to the limiting parabolic reaction-diffusion problem. 1. Introduction The classical model for reaction and spread is the scalar reaction diffusion equation in n dimensions, [14] u t Γ D = f(u) : (1) Here u = u(t; x) is a scalar function, D is the diffusion coefficient, Δ the n- dimensional Laplacian and f 2 C 1 (R; R) is a nonlinearity with f(0) = f(1) = 0, f(z) ? 0 for 0 ! z ! 1, and f 0 (0) ? 0. Diffusion and reaction lead to propagation {{in the form of}} travelling fronts u(t; x) = w(x 1 Γ ct) with determined shape w and speed c. Travelling front solutions are typical limiting solutions which describe propagation and pattern formation phenomena, [5]. For the reaction diffusion equation (1) there is a famil [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{theoretically}} analyze {{a discrete}} Schrödinger chain with hopping {{to the first}} and second neighbors, as can be realized with zigzag arrangements of optical waveguides or lattice sites for cold atoms. Already at moderate values, the second-neighbor hopping has a strong impact on the band structure, leading to {{the emergence of a new}} extremum located inside the band, accompanied by a van Hove singularity in the density of states. The energy band is then divided into a subcritical regime with the usual unique correspondence between wave number and energy of the travelling waves, and a supercritical regime, in which waves of different wave number are degenerate in energy. We study the consequences of these features in a scattering setup, introducing a defect that locally breaks the translational invariance. The notion of a local probability current is generalized beyond the nearest-neighbor approximation and bound states with energies outside the band are discussed. At subcritical energies inside the band, an evanescent mode coexists with the <b>travelling</b> <b>plane</b> <b>wave,</b> giving rise to resonance phenomena in scattering. At weak coupling to the defect, we identify a prototypical Fano-Feshbach resonance of tunable shape and provide analytical expressions for its profile parameters. At supercritical energies, we observe coupling of the degenerate travelling waves, leading to an intricate wave packet fragmentation dynamics. The corresponding branching ratios are analyzed.

40|$|As prior {{knowledge}} of Doppler frequency has been found useful in many applications of mobile communications, {{it is necessary to}} estimate the Doppler frequency at the mobile station (MS) based on the received fading signal. Rice et al [1] had derived Doppler frequency estimates using continuous-time received fading signals.

40|$|We {{consider}} incompressible flows {{between two}} transversely vibrating solid walls and construct an asymptotic expansion of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in the limit when both the {{amplitude of vibrations}} and {{the thickness of the}} Stokes layer are small and have the same order of magnitude. Our asymptotic expansion is valid up to the flow boundary. In particular, we derive equations and boundary conditions, for the averaged flow. In the leading order, the averaged flow is described by the stationary Navier-Stokes equations with an additional term which contains the leading-order Stokes drift velocity. In a slightly different context (for a flow induced by an oscillating conservative body force), the same equations had been derived earlier by Riley (2001). The general theory is applied to two particular examples of steady streaming induced by transverse vibrations of the walls in the form of standing and <b>travelling</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves.</b> In particular, in the case of waves travelling in the same direction, the induced flow is plane-parallel and the Lagrangian velocity profile can be computed analytically.

For the case of <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> on a rectangular panel with anechoic edge conditions, and for the case of standing waves on a rectangular panel with simply supported edge conditions, the equations resulting from one of the standard reductions from quadruple to double integrals are given. These double integral equations can be reduced to single integral equations, but the versions of these equations given in the literature did not always converge when used with adaptive integral routines and were sometimes slower than the double integral versions. This is because the terms in the integrands in the existing equations have singularities. Although these singularities cancel, they caused problems for the adaptive integral routines. This paper rewrites these equations in a form which removes the singularities and enables the integrals in these equations to be evaluated with adaptive integral routines...|$|R

In this paper, we show that the addition of similar spatial feedback terms {{can be used to}} stabilize such waves. This type of feedback is a generalization of the time-delay method of Pyragus (Phys. Letts.

40|$|Abstract. Reflection of <b>travelling</b> and {{evanescent}} <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> by a four-wave mixing phase-conjugator is {{studied in}} detail. No restrictions are {{imposed on the}} nonlinear interaction strength, the angle of incidence or the frequency mismatch between the pump-beams and the incoming waves. We only assume that the incident field is weak compared to the pump fields, which justifies a classical field description of the pumps. The wave-vectors, amplitudes and phases for the various waves are evaluated, without the slowly-varying amplitude approxi-mation. Familiar phase-matching resonances for certain values of the interaction length are recovered, and in addition strong resonances are found if the angle of incidence is finite and the incident light is not in perfect resonance with the pumps. The latter resonances appear at the transitions from a travelling to an evanescent wave. The significance of finite angles of incidence and evanescent waves for spectroscopic applications is pointed out. ...|$|R

40|$|Lamb {{waves are}} {{ultrasonic}} guided waves that propagate between two parallel free surfaces {{and their use}} for damage detection has been widely explored and demonstrated. Damage in materials/structures can be detected by analyzing {{the difference between the}} phase/group velocity and the loss of amplitude of Lamb waves on damaged and un-damaged specimens. The propagation characteristics of Lamb waves are described in the form of dispersion curves, which are plots of phase/group velocities versus the product of frequency-thickness generated by solving the Lamb wave equations. Lamb waves' dispersion behaviors for isotropic materials are well established in the literature; however, such is not the case for the laminated composites. The most common methods for solving the Lamb wave equations in composites consist of using laminated plate theory or 3 D linear elasticity by assuming an orthotropic and/or higher symmetry. This assumption may not be true, if the actuators and sensors in an orthotropic or transversely isotropic laminates are installed in a non-principle direction or the layup is symmetric but not balanced. This paper presents a full derivation of Lamb wave equations for n-layered monoclinic composite laminates based on linear 3 D elasticity by considering the displacement fields in all three directions using the partial wave technique in combination with the Global Matrix (GM) approach. In the partial wave technique, the principle of superposition of three upward and three downward <b>travelling</b> <b>plane</b> <b>waves</b> are assumed in order to satisfy the associated boundary conditions. The bounded upper and lower surfaces reflect the waves and the combination of these reflections going towards the upper or lower interfaces results in the propagating guided waves. The GM approach is used to assemble all the equations from each layer to form a global, unified matrix that describes the displacement and stress fields along the entire laminate associated with the wave propagation. A robust method for numerically solving the Lamb wave equations is also presented. The presented method was verified experimentally by analyzing the propagation of Lamb waves in two different composite panels constructed out of unidirectional carbon-fiber epoxy prepreg and fiber-metal laminate (GLARE 3 - 3 / 4). The panels were instrumented with lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric sensors, which were excited at different frequencies ranging from 20. kHz to 500. kHz to generate and acquire the waves. The waves were excited and gathered at three different propagation angles of 00, 450, and 900 for the carbon-fiber epoxy laminate panel and at six different angles of 00, 200, 450, 700 and 900 for the fiber-metal laminates (GLARE). The phase and group velocities of the fundamental symmetric (So) and anti-symmetric (Ao) Lamb waves were extracted by tracking the peaks of each individual wave phase and the wave envelope respectively using an in-house code developed in MATLAB. It was found that the presented 3 D linear elasticity model followed the experimental data closely for both symmetric and anti-symmetric Lamb modes. The analytical method presented in this paper was able to predict the Lamb wave dispersion for both the carbon-fiber epoxy laminate and the hybrid fiber-metal laminate proving the robustness and versatility of the solution method. 9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
