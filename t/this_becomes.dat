5|$|Gian Gastone was {{descended from}} both Cosimo the Elder and Lorenzo the Elder through the {{marriage}} between Maria Salviati, grandchild of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and Giovanni de' Medici, great-grandson of Lorenzo the Elder. <b>This</b> <b>becomes</b> clearer when one understands their common ancestor: Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, father to both Lorenzo the Elder and Cosimo de' Medici. Thus {{the kings of}} France from Louis XIII and on, are descended from the 'cadet' branch, confirming that Gian Gastone was not the last Medici.|$|E

His regime carries out brutal torture and grips the city in fear. He is later tormented by thunder strikes and magical, ghostly appearances of previously tortured subjects. As the black population revolts against his rule, he finds himself alone and deserted. In this state he commits suicide by shooting himself. His body is taken {{to be buried in}} a fortress on a mountain and <b>this</b> <b>becomes</b> his mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the {{reaction}} of the crew to the casting of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), and the subsequent changes made to The Girlie Show. <b>This</b> <b>becomes</b> evident when Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) changes the title of the show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, much to Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) dismay. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) struggles to keep the cast and crew happy, so together with Tracy, she throws a party on a yacht.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan, and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), her boss; and the distractions the writers of TGS face when writing sketches. <b>This</b> <b>becomes</b> evident when Liz's assistant, Cerie (Katrina Bowden), wears sexually suggestive clothing; and when Jack decides to join the writers for observation. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) learns that working for Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the main star of TGS, is more than he expected.|$|E

5|$|The full {{etymology}} is unknown. The oldest known {{usage of}} the word is in the 794 text Shin'yaku Kegonkyō Ongi Shiki. Other old sources include Nihon Ryōiki (810–824) and Wamyō Ruijushō (c. 934). These oldest sources are written in Man'yōgana which clearly identifies the historical spelling as ki1tune.

5|$|As all lens systems, natural {{vignetting}} (gradual {{reduction of}} an image's brightness {{from the center}} towards the periphery) is present due to Lambert's cosine law – <b>this</b> <b>becomes</b> more pronounced at shorter focal lengths. Wide open at 8mm, about 0.75 EVs of shading are apparent at the corners, while at 16mm only about 0.25 EV of shading is noticeable when comparing the corners to the center. For most of the focal length range of the lens, there is between a half stop and third stop of corner shading. Alternatively, stopping down to higher f-numbers lessens vignetting.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When <b>this</b> <b>becomes</b> severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the free flow of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E

After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. <b>This</b> <b>becomes</b> about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong drawer, but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him. He reveals that he wanted to pay as he has an inoperable brain tumour.|$|E
