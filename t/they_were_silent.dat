25|$|Musicians {{were free}} to join in, but such collaborations were often {{short-lived}} if the contributions were lacking the proper spirit: notable jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy sat in with the group but was quickly asked to stop playing. Observers were welcome, provided <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> and didn't disturb the proceedings. American saxophonist Ornette Coleman was asked to leave after he continually talked during one performance; Beatles member Paul McCartney once sat quietly through an early AMM session. When asked how he liked the music he said they went on too long.|$|E
500|$|On June 21, Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times criticized Jackson, stating, [...] "He {{may have}} lived a {{sheltered}} life, but {{there really is}} no excuse for using terms like 'Jew me' and 'kike' in a pop song, unless you make it clear you are denouncing such terms, and do so in an artful way." [...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises partially drowning them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed {{there was some kind of}} double standard in the music industry. [...] "While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in [...] "They Don't Care About Us", <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> on other racial slurs in the album. [...] The Notorious B.I.G. says [...] "nigga" [...] on [...] "This Time Around," [...] another song on the HIStory album, but it did not attract media attention, as well as, many years before, use in lyrics of word [...] "nigger" [...] by John Lennon.|$|E

Although the Luftwaffe showed him their factories and were open concerning their growing airpower, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> {{on the subject of}} rocketry. When Lindbergh told Goddard of this behavior, Goddard said, [...] "Yes, they must have plans for the rocket. When will our own people in Washington listen to reason?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Black {{critics in}} the 1930s wrote about the play and film The Green Pastures, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> on its {{animated}} parody. Weisenfeld speculates that this is because animated cartoons were not seen as significant at the time. Modern critics of Clean Pastures fault the film for its stereotypical depictions of black culture. Cultural studies scholar William Anthony Nericcio sees the film as representative of a pattern {{in the works of}} Friz Freleng, who also produced such stereotype-ridden films as Jungle Jitters, Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears, and the Speedy Gonzales cartoons. Lindvall and Fraser are more forgiving and call the cartoon [...] "playful", [...] "light", and [...] "mischievous".|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam left Ireland on 25 March, the Dublin streets {{silent and}} decked in mourning. Grattan said {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> and unhappy there [...] "Never {{was a time}} in which the opposition here were more completely backed by the nation, Protestant and Catholic united". The two letters to Lord Carlisle were published in Dublin and then in London (without Fitzwilliam's knowledge) in a pirated and a somewhat altered state under the title A Letter from a Venerated Nobleman, recently retired from this country, to the Earl of Carlisle: explaining the causes of that event. The publication shocked many of Fitzwilliam's friends and brought forth their condemnation. Fitzwilliam was unrepentant, writing to Thomas Grenville on 3 April that the Duke of Portland [...] "has been bewildered, and in his confusion has been led into irretrievable error; but that error is of a nature never, I fear, to be got over: he has been induced to abandon his principles, and give up his friend, his firm, his steady his staunch supporter. ... suffered himself to be the dupe of cunning and design, has been made the instrument of his own and my disgrace—a disgrace of a nature most gratifying to our common enemies. [...] to separate myself altogether from every sort of intercourse with the man with whom I have passed so many years of my life in the most intimate, cordial, unsuspecting friendship".|$|E
2500|$|Around {{this time}} the {{business}} affairs of the East India Company began to draw increased scrutiny in the House of Commons. [...] After receiving a report by a committee, which condemned the Mayor's Courts, the Crown issued a charter for a new judicial system in the Bengal Presidency. [...] The British Parliament consequently enacted the Regulating Act of 1773 under which the King-in-Council created a Supreme Court in the Presidency town, i.e. Fort William. [...] The tribunal consisted of one Chief Justice and three puisne judges; all four judges were to be chosen from barristers. The Supreme Court supplanted the Mayor's Court; however, it left the Court of Requests in place. [...] Under the charter, the Supreme Court, moreover, {{had the authority to}} exercise all types of jurisdiction in the region of Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha, with the only caveat that in situations where the disputed amount was in excess of Rs. 4,000, their judgment could be appealed to the Privy Council. [...] Both the Act and the charter said nothing about the relation between the judiciary (Supreme Court) and the executive branch (Governor-General); equally, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>silent</b> on the Adālats (both Diwāni and Nizāmat) created by Warren Hastings just the year before. [...] In the new Supreme Court, the civil and criminal cases alike were interpreted and prosecuted accorded to English law; in the Sadr Adālats, however, the judges and law-officers had no knowledge of English law, and were required only, by the Governor-General's order, [...] "to proceed according to equity, justice, and good conscience, unless Hindu or Muhammadan law was in point, or some Regulation expressly applied." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 24 February, Thiers arrived at the Tuileries and met with the King, who was in despair. He met also with Marshal Bugeaud, and learned that the army had only sixteen {{thousand}} men available; they were short of ammunition and exhausted. During the night, more barricades had appeared all over Paris. Thiers proposed withdrawing the army to Saint-Cloud, gathering his forces, and marching back into Paris with a full army (the strategy he followed in 1871 during the Paris Commune), but Marshal Bugeaud wanted to attack the barricades immediately; [...] he told the King that it would cost twenty thousand lives; [...] the King told Bugeaud that the price was too high, and called off the attack. The army columns began to disintegrate, as the soldiers joined the demonstrators. Thiers urged the King to flee to Saint-Cloud, but the King insisted on having his regular breakfast at 10:30a.m., and then put on the uniform of a Lieutenant General to review the four thousand regular soldiers and two legions of National Guards gathered in the courtyard of the Tuileries. As he rode by, the regular soldiers cheered the King, but the National Guardsmen called out [...] "Down the Ministers! Down with the system!" [...] and shook their weapons at the King. The King abruptly turned around rode back to Palace, where he sat in an armchair, head in his hands. [...] "Everything is lost," [...] he said to Theirs. [...] "I am overwhelmed," [...] Thiers responded coldly, [...] "I've known that for a long time." [...] His family urged him to remain and fight. The King turned to his marshals and generals and to Thiers and asked if there was any alternative, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>silent.</b> The King slowly wrote out and signed his act of abdication, changed from his uniform into civilian clothes, and left through the gardens of the Tuileries. A carriage took him out of Paris to Saint-Cloud, and soon afterwards he crossed the Channel to exile in England.|$|E
