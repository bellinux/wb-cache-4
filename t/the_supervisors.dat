His sanctuary is the most venerated site in Bayt Jibrin, located just northwest of it. Until the present day, al-Dari's sanctuary has been a place of local Muslim pilgrimage. Other Islamic holy sites in the village include Maqam (shrine) for a local shaykh named Mahmud and a tomb for a shaykha (female religious figure) named Ameina.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2003, the Stellamare, a Dutch-owned ship, capsized at the port, killing three Russian crewmembers. The {{ship was}} hauling General Electric {{generators}} when it overturned. The United States Coast Guard determined that poor communication resulting from <b>the</b> <b>supervisors</b> speaking Dutch while the crew spoke Russian, with English {{being used as}} a relay, was a contributing factor to mismanagement of ballast tanks. In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper. This in turn led to investigations of employee theft which resulted in the arrest of an operations manager and a maintenance foreman for larceny. In 2008 the port received two awards from the Railway Industrial Clearance Association. One award was for customer satisfaction and the other for being the most improved port in the United States for handling heavy lift cargo.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal per$ormance {{evaluation}} scheme of a supervisor who monitors a worker {{in a setting}} where the worker can collude with <b>the</b> <b>supervisor.</b> We study <b>the</b> setting where <b>the</b> <b>supervisor’s</b> incentive problem results from collusion, not from work aversion. In the owner-supervisor-worker structure, <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> monitors <b>the</b> worker’s effort and reports to the owner. The owner evaluates the worker based on <b>the</b> <b>supervisor’s</b> report and imposes less risk on the worker, saving the risk premium to him. To prevent collusion between <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> and <b>the</b> worker, the owner must hold <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> responsible for <b>the</b> worker’s peiformance, paying risk premium to <b>the</b> <b>supervisor.</b> Examples show that the owner prefers the owner-supervisor-worker structure to the owner-worker structure when the worker is very risk averse relative to the su-pervisor. Examples also show that if <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> and <b>the</b> worker can make side transfers for risk sharing {{as well as for}} collusion, the owner might prefer the owner-supervisor-worker structure only when the super-visor’s risk aversion is neither too great nor too small. When the super-visor is close to risk neutral, either his limited liability or high reservation utility makes it too costly to hire him. The subcontracting structure where <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> is delegated to contract with the worker is shown to be pe~ormance quivalent to the owner-supervisor-worker structure.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} collusion {{between a}} supervisor and an agent within a Principal-Supervisor-Agent model. Other papers {{consider the possibility}} of collusion after <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> has exerted costly effort to obtain hard ("verifiable") evidence regarding the agent's actions, information which, if reported {{would result in the}} agent being fined with a certain probability. That is, collusion occurs because <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> may accept a bribe in exchange for hiding the information he has obtained. This paper allows <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> and <b>the</b> agent to enter into a collusive contract either before or after <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> has exerted effort to find verifiable information regarding the agent's actions. The former type of collusion, which occurs after <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> has exerted effort, entails ex-post corruption, while the latter, which occurs before <b>the</b> <b>supervisor</b> has exerted effort, entails preemptive corruption. This paper shows that although raising <b>the</b> <b>supervisor's</b> reward discourages ex-post corruption, it can simultaneously encourage preemptive corruption. Hence, raising <b>the</b> <b>supervisor's</b> reward will not always discourage collusion. This result further implies that though privatizing law enforcement can always be used to eliminate ex-post corruption, it cannot be used to eliminate preemptive corruption. Furthermore, when compared to ex-post collusion, an equilibrium without corruption is always socially preferred. However, when compared to preemptive collusion, an equilibrium without corruption may not always be socially preferred. Bribery Collusion Corruption Moral hazard Crime prevention...|$|R

Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model.
