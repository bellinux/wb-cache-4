25|$|People can {{be trained}} to have their {{suspicion}} aroused if the message does not contain any specific personal information. Phishing attempts in early 2006, however, used personalized information, which makes it unsafe {{to assume that the}} presence of personal information alone guarantees that a message is legitimate. Furthermore, another recent study concluded in part that the presence of personal information does not significantly affect the success rate of phishing attacks, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not pay attention to such details.|$|E

2500|$|King, {{who also}} {{competed in the}} Virginia Slims of Houston during the same week, won in {{straight}} sets, 6–4, 6–3, 6–3. In the first set, she fell behind 3–2 when Riggs broke her serve. [...] In a 2015 interview, she said <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not remember that she was initially behind in the first set, and it looked bad {{for her in the}} early going. At this point, King realized that she [...] "had to win" [...] given the importance of the match, and broke right back and again in the tenth game to close out the set. She had learned from Court's loss and was ready for Riggs' game. Rather than playing her own usual aggressive game, King mostly stayed at the baseline, easily handling Riggs's lobs and soft shots, making him cover the entire court as she ran him from side to side and beat him at his own defensive style of play. After quickly failing from the baseline, where he had intended to play, Riggs dropped his comedic effect and showed a more serious demeanor, as he was forced to change to a serve-and-volley game.|$|E
60|$|There is, perhaps, {{this much}} truth in that, <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> need a certain {{stimulus}} to exertion {{and a certain}} standard of achievement to do their best, {{but to say that}} this is provided by private ownership and can only be provided by private ownership is an altogether different thing. Is the British Telephone Service, for example, kept as efficient as it is--which isn't very much, by the bye, in the way of efficiency--by the protests of the shareholders or of the subscribers? Does the grocer's errand-boy loiter any less than his brother who carries the Post Office telegrams? In the matter of the public milk supply, again, would not an intelligently critical public anxious for its milk good and early be a far more formidable master than a speculative proprietor in the back room of a creamery? And when one comes to large business organizations managed by officials and owned by dispersed shareholders, the contrast is all to the advantage of the community.|$|E

Capitalism seems different because people are in theory free to work for themselves or for others as they choose. Yet most workers have as little control over their lives as feudal serfs’. Some later Marxist theorists (e.g. Eric Wolf) have applied this label to include non-European societies, grouping feudalism together with Imperial Chinese and pre-Columbian Incan societies as 'tributary'.|$|R

Hence, {{the objective of}} this research was to evaluate the consuming habits relating to DF on people from different countries, as well as their knowledge about the fibre rich foods and their attitudes towards food labelling. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was undertaken on a non-probabilistic sample of 6010 participants from 10 countries. Descriptive statistics and inferential tests were done using SPSS software considering a level of significance of 5 %. Results: The results suggested that the ingestion of fibre rich foods like fruit, vegetables and cereals, was low and far from the recommended amounts. It was also concluded <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not pay the desired level of attention to food labelling and nutritional information. Furthermore, the level of knowledge about dietary fibre was generally not satisfactory. Conclusion: In view of these findings it becomes important to develop actions to better inform the population and to make them better {{aware of the importance of}} dietary fibre in their habitual diet...|$|R
