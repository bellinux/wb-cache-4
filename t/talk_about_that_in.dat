40|$|ABSTRACT This {{paper is}} on the {{justification}} of (PC), the epistemic principle defended by M. Huemer in his Phenomenal Conservatism theory. Put in a straightforward way, we can (and should) ask: what reasons are there for thinking that (PC) is true, that is, for thinking that appearances justify beliefs? This question corresponds - to use L. BonJour’s vocabulary - to the demand for a “metajustification”. The pursuit of this metajustification can take different directions, depending on the general conception or nature of epistemic justification {{we are working with}} and on who is supposed to satisfy the demand. Unfortunately, all of these directions seem to lead (PC) to a dead end. In other words, the apparently fair and even essential demand for a metajustification of (PC) cannot be met by the theory, at least in a satisfactory way. If we are right about that, it will remain the difficult question whether Phenomenal Conservatism is the only one (or even the right one!) to be blamed for this failure. We will briefly <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the conclusion...|$|E

The problem with this situation is that when people purchase a software product by paying money they {{are more concerned about}} its performance. People report to the companies if the product they purchased does not work as expected. It is not the same in the case of free products. People tend to switch to some other free product produced by different company which does the same job. The notion of this project is to solve this problem. Under such a circumstance, people may not send a report to the company but people <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the social networks. In this project, {{we are going to make}} use of this kind of posts or tweets to help the companies by informing them about the fault in their free products so that their reputation will never go down.

40|$|My work {{is based}} on a text {{analysis}} of media production of the female offender. I found it interesting how women were presented as victims rather than perpetrators. The media have in recent years grown tremendously and this also impacts on people and what is important. The notion of how a woman should be and how a female offender should be is extreme. The material for my work is articles found on the Internet in daily newspapers websites. From the analysis it has been revealed that there are certain stereotypes and preconceptions of female offenders. It shows that there are descriptions about the behavior and appearance which is considered remarkable in these women. The theory that I relate to my work are Yvonne Hirdman's thoughts on gender. She <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the society it is the man that is the norm and woman stands as the opposite. Together with the concept of gender Hirdman <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> gender contract. Clearly, one can see that the contract has been different from time to time, but thoughts about how women and men persists. If there should be any change then maybe we need to start using other terms than, say, only perpetrator in the case of female offenders. It can not be forgotten that women are primarily individuals...|$|R

Eventually, the two friends find themselves trapped {{in the middle of}} a countryside road by police units on one side and gangsters on the other, pointing their guns at each other. The stand-off finally erupts into a big shoot-out while the two make a desperate escape through the corn field. After that, Martin buys a pink Cadillac of the same model as the one which Elvis Presley presented to his mother. His wish is to give the same present to his own mother. As he fulfills the wish, they get ambushed by police near Martin's mother's house. Martin pretends to have a seizure and falls on the ground. He is taken to the hospital in an ambulance with Rudi sitting by his side. En route, Martin and Rudi hijack the vehicle to continue their quest. On the way to the ocean they stop by a brothel, where Rudi wants to fulfil his wish to have sex with two women at the same time. By coincidence, the brothel is owned by the boss whose money they had found in the car they have stolen at the beginning of the journey. They are seen by the two gangsters who were after them throughout their journey. The gangsters take Rudi and Martin to their boss who asks them for money they should return. Martin says that the money was spent and sent to various people which drives the criminal boss insane. Enraged, the boss points a gun at them ready to shoot, but Curtiz, the most influential criminal to whom the money was meant to be delivered, comes in. After a short talk he says “Then you better run, before you run out of time”. The capo goes on <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> heaven everybody would be <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the ocean. Curtiz spares their lives and lets them go.|$|R
