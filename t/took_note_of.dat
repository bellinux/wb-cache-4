5|$|In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, {{he spent}} {{a week in the}} {{religious}} class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain <b>took</b> <b>note</b> <b>of</b> his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills. He also attended Sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart.|$|E

The bank, which held many assets of the Oregon Common School Fund, failed during Hobbs' time there. Ben Olcott, who was the Secretary of State and a member of the State Land Board, was charged with protecting the Common School Fund, and was involved in negotiating with the failing bank over the State's assets. He <b>took</b> <b>note</b> <b>of</b> Hobbs' strong loyalty to her employer.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer and}} former MP Matthew Parris {{described}} Thorpe {{as one of}} the more dashing among the new MPs elected in 1959. Thorpe's chief political interest lay in the field of human rights, and his speeches criticising apartheid in South Africa attracted the attention of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who <b>took</b> <b>note</b> <b>of</b> this rising Liberal star. Thorpe was briefly considered as best man at the 1960 wedding of his Eton contemporary Antony Armstrong-Jones to Princess Margaret, but was rejected when vetting checks indicated that he might have homosexual tendencies. The security agency MI5, which routinely keeps records on all members of parliament, added this information to Thorpe's file.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, {{he finally}} sailed into Piraeus where {{the crowd had}} gathered, {{desiring}} to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear till he saw his cousin and others {{of his friends and}} acquaintance, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero's welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen in {{the fact that he had}} returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies <b>took</b> <b>note</b> <b>of</b> this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{of other}} leagues <b>took</b> <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the {{financial}} boon that followed SEC expansion to twelve teams. Atlantic Coast Conference representatives began discussing expansion to twelve {{schools in the}} first years of the new century, who began publicly pursuing the possibility of expansion anew in 2003. On May 13, 2003, representatives voted in favor of extending invitations to three schools. The only certain school was the University of Miami, while the other two spots were still being debated. Initially, the league favored admitting Miami, Syracuse University, and Boston College. After a month of debate, however, the ACC elected to extend formal invitations to Miami, Boston College, and Virginia Tech, which joined after initially being overlooked. This came years after these schools were considered for ACC membership in the early 1990s but nothing had ever came to fruition. Pittsburgh and Syracuse would also eventually join the ACC after rejections in 1990 and 2003, becoming members in 2013.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving in}} Congress, Jennings's health {{continued}} to decline {{as he struggled}} with alcohol addiction and suffered from severe rheumatism. In 1827 ceiling plaster from Jennings's Washington D.C. boarding room fell on his head, severely injuring him, and ill health limited his ability to visit his constituents, but he continued to remain a popular politician in Indiana. In the congressional election of 1826, Jennings ran unopposed. He won reelection in 1828, soundly defeating his opponent, Indiana's lieutenant governor, John H. Thompson. Jennings did not publicly favor a presidential candidate and won the Second District seat with support from voters who favored Jackson and Adams. During Jennings's final term in office House journals show that he introduced no legislation, was frequently not present to vote on matters, and only once delivered a speech. Jennings's friends, led by Senator John Tipton, <b>took</b> <b>note</b> <b>of</b> his situation and took action to block Jennings's reelection bid when his drinking became a political liability. John Carr, anti-Jackson man, opposed Jennings in a six-way race for the congressional seat and won the election. Tipton had arranged for others to enter the race and divide Jennings's supporters. Jennings left office on March 3, 1831.|$|E

Their goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, defended Alpay in his article in the English newspaper, The Times.|$|E
25|$|Like many accordionists of this era, Serry <b>took</b> <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the {{limitations}} {{imposed by the}} Stradella bass system during performances of classical music. In an effort to circumvent these limitations, he designed and developed a working model of a free-bass system for the accordion during this decade. It incorporated dual keyboards for the soloist's left hand while incorporating two sets of reeds which were tuned in octaves. This gave the soloist access {{to a range of}} tones which exceeded three and one-half octaves.|$|E

In church polity, some advocated for separation from all other Christians, in favor of autonomous gathered churches. These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church.|$|E

25|$|John Zorn <b>took</b> <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the {{emphasis}} on speed and dissonance that was becoming prevalent in punk rock, and incorporated this into free jazz {{with the release of}} the Spy vs. Spy album in 1986, a collection of Ornette Coleman tunes done in the contemporary thrashcore style. In the same year, Sonny Sharrock, Peter Brötzmann, Bill Laswell, and Ronald Shannon Jackson recorded the first album under the name Last Exit (free jazz band), a similarly aggressive blend of thrash and free jazz. These developments are the origins of jazzcore, the fusion of free jazz with hardcore punk.|$|E
