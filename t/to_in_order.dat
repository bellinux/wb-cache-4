5|$|Admiral Hipper hove <b>to</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> {{to rescue}} her man {{overboard}} and Glowworms survivors. The German sailor was not found, but 40 British sailors were recovered, although at least six later died of their wounds. Lieutenant Ramsay, the senior surviving officer, told his rescuers that neither the helm nor the emergency rudder were manned when the ships collided so the destroyer's turn towards Hipper was probably accidental. German accounts only mention four torpedoes fired by Glowworm, but British accounts say all ten were fired. This was confirmed by photographic evidence taken after the collision showing all of her torpedo tubes empty.|$|E

5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell <b>to</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to {{what they would do}} for their daughters. When they walk away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing whatever she had <b>to</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, Chomsky's minimalist {{framework}} on language structure led to sophisticated probing techniques for investigating languages. These probing techniques analyzed negative data over prescriptive grammars, {{and because of}} Chomsky's proposed Extended Projection Principle in 1986, probing techniques showed where specifiers of a sentence had moved <b>to</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to fulfill the EPP. This allowed syntacticians to hypothesize that lexical items with complex syntactic features (such as ditransitive, inchoative, and causative verbs), could select their own specifier element within a syntax tree construction. (For more on probing techniques, see Suci, G., Gammon, P., & Gamlin, P. (1979)).|$|E
