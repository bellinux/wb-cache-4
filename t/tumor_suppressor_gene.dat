Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|In 10–20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade3 (the highest histologic grade), {{mutations}} {{are found}} in a <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene,</b> commonly p53 or PTEN. In 20% of endometrial hyperplasias and 50% of endometrioid cancers, PTEN suffers a loss-of-function mutation or a null mutation, making it less effective or completely ineffective. Loss of PTEN function leads to up-regulation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which causes cell growth. The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer. When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed, the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive. P53 mutations and chromosome instability are associated with serous carcinomas, which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas. Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma.|$|E

5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E

40|$|Promoter hypermethylation of <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> {{seems to}} be an early event in breast {{carcinogenesis}} and is potentially reversible. This makes methylation a possible therapeutic target, a marker for treatment response and/or a prognostic factor. Methylation status of 40 <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> was compared between 53 primary breast tumors and their corresponding metastases to brain, lung, liver, or skin. In paired analyses, a significant decrease in methylation values was seen in distant metastases compared to their primaries in 21 / 40 individual <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Furthermore, primary <b>tumors</b> that metastasized to the liver clustered together, in line with the finding that primary breast carcinomas that metastasized to the brain, skin, or lung, showed higher methylation values in up to 27. 5 % of <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> than primary carcinomas that metastasized to the liver. Conversion in methylation status of several genes from the primary tumor to the metastasis had prognostic value, and methylation status of some genes in the metastases predicted survival after onset of metastases. Methylation levels for most of the analyzed <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> were lower in distant metastases compared to their primaries, pointing to the dynamic aspect of methylation of these <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> during cancer progression.

25|$|Usually, oncogenes are dominant, as {{they contain}} gain-of-function mutations, while mutated tumor {{suppressors}} are recessive, as they contain loss-of-function mutations. Each cell has {{two copies of}} the same gene, one from each parent, and under most cases gain of function mutations in just one copy of a particular proto-oncogene {{is enough to make}} that gene a true oncogene. On the other hand, loss of function mutations need to happen in both copies of a <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> to render that gene completely non-functional.

40|$|Cancer is {{a genetic}} disease; tumor cells differ from their normal {{progenitors}} by genetic alterations that affect growth-regulatory genes. There exist 2 classes of such cancer genes: the oncogenes, which function as positive growth regulators, and the <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> which function as negative growth regulators. Oncogenes are widely conserved among diverse {{forms of life}} and are active in transmitting growth signals from the cell periphery to the cell nucleus. These signaling functions can be disturbed by many types of genetic change; {{the result of an}} altered growth signal is often cancer. <b>Tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> have an attenuating effect on cell growth that is lost as a result of inactivating mutations or deletion of the gene; in DNA virus-transformed cells, it is abrogated by neutralization of the <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> protein through a viral <b>gene</b> product. <b>Tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> were first recognized in inherited cancers; defects in a <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> transmitted through the germ line can lead to increased tumor incidence in the offspring. <b>Tumor</b> <b>suppressors</b> also play important roles in nonheritable cancer, however; many tumors in humans show defects in <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Most cancers harbor multiple genetic changes in oncogenes as well as <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> Oncogenes induce aberrant growth through a gain in function; <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> contribute to oncogenesis through a loss of function.

25|$|Mutations of tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes that}} occur in germline cells are passed along to offspring, and increase the likelihood for cancer diagnoses in subsequent generations. Members of these families have increased incidence and decreased latency of multiple tumors. The tumor types are typical {{for each type of}} <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> mutation, with some mutations causing particular cancers, and other mutations causing others. The mode of inheritance of mutant tumor suppressors is that an affected member inherits a defective copy from one parent, and a normal copy from the other. For instance, individuals who inherit one mutant p53 allele (and are therefore heterozygous for mutated p53) can develop melanomas and pancreatic cancer, known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Other inherited <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> syndromes include Rb mutations, linked to retinoblastoma, and APC gene mutations, linked to adenopolyposis colon cancer. Adenopolyposis colon cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in colon while young, leading to colon cancer at a relatively early age.

25|$|A <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene,</b> or anti-oncogene, is a {{gene that}} protects a cell from one step {{on the path to}} cancer.

This occurs through miR-569 inhibition of TP53INP1, a <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene.</b> In comparison to normal tissues and less malignant tumors, TP53INP1 occurs at lower levels in more invasive cancers, presumably {{in part due to}} the role played by miR-569.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} issue related to {{human gene therapy}} is safety, particularly for the gene therapy of non-fatal diseases such as OA.

There will be always a chance of integrating into a <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>gene</b> or an oncogene, leading to virulent transformation of the cell. In general, gene transfer to humans is considered as a safe therapeutic method, despite recent events that have provided examples of random adverse events.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Carcinogenesis {{involves}} the inactivation or inhibition of genes that function as <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressors.</b> Deletions, mutations, or epigenetic silencing of <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> {{can lead to}} altered growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. DNA methylation and histone modifications are important epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation and play essential roles both independently and cooperatively in tumor initiation and progression. Realization that many <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes</b> are silenced by epigenetic mechanisms has stimulated discovery of novel <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes.</b> One of the most useful of these approaches is an epigenetic reactivation screening strategy that combines treatment of cancer cells in vitro with DNA methyltransferase and/or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, followed by global gene expression analysis using microarrays, to identify upregulated genes. This approach is most effective when complemented by microarray analyses to identify genes repressed in primary tumors. Recently, using cancer cell lines treated with a DNA methylation inhibitor and/or a HDAC inhibitor in conjunction with cDNA microarray analysis, candidate <b>tumor</b> <b>suppressor</b> <b>genes,</b> which are subject to epigenetic silencing, {{have been identified in}} endometrial, colorectal, esophageal, and pancreatic can-cers.
