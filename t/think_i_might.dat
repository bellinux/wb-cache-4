500|$|Tina's {{cover of}} [...] "My Funny Valentine" [...] stirred mixed {{emotions}} in Gonzalez. She criticized the ending: [...] "When she started sobbing, it got weird. Then weirder. Then downright uncomfortable." [...] However, {{she liked the}} earlier part of the performance, and wrote, [...] "It was Ã¼bersweet when Tina started getting choked up during her song, because let's face it, it happens. You can love someone so much it hurts. If she would have continued the song with a mild lump in her throat, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have gotten choked up with her." ...|$|E
500|$|Evancho {{appeared}} in the feature film The Company You Keep, a 2013 political thriller. She played Isabel, the eleven-year-old daughter of a widowed attorney turned fugitive, played by Robert Redford, who also directed the film. Jon Weisman wrote that Evancho [...] "showed she's more than a singing prodigy with her earnest sweetness". Redford cast Evancho only days before filming began. Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't think I want to act full-time. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> like {{to do something with}} a Disney special or make a movie once in a while that would give me enough time to sing and record, but that's about it." ...|$|E
500|$|He remains {{interested}} {{in history and}} {{said in an interview}} with The Observer that [...] "I can see myself in a few years' time joining the National Trust and going round the odd castle. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> find that restful as the anger of middle-age sets in." [...] In his interview on Parkinson he stated that if he could go back in time to do one thing, it would be to go to the building of Stonehenge, to ask them [...] "why they were bothering". He is a cricket and snooker fan, and also plays the occasional game of squash and tennis. He is a user of Twitter, and does not drive. He is an agnostic.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. Jeeves {{is a great}} {{believer in}} the moral effect of clothes. He <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be emboldened in a {{striking}} costume like this. He said a Pirate Chief {{would be just as}} good. In fact, a Pirate Chief was his first suggestion, but I objected to the boots." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, mademoiselle. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>might.</b> <b>I</b> will <b>think</b> it over. Of {{course there}} are difficulties, but I do not see why it should not succeed." ...|$|R
500|$|Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings {{used the}} St. Johns as a {{backdrop}} in her books South Moon Under and The Yearling, and several short stories. In 1933 she took a boat trip along the St. Johns with a friend. In the upper basin, she remarked on the difficulty of determining direction due to the river's ambiguous flow, and wrote in a chapter titled [...] "Hyacinth Drift" [...] in her memoir Cross Creek {{that she had the}} best luck in watching the way the hyacinths floated. Rawlings wrote, [...] "If I could have, to hold forever, one brief place and time of beauty, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> choose the night on that high lonely bank above the St. Johns River." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lennon told Hit Parader in 1972 that [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] was {{primarily}} written by McCartney: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have helped {{with some of}} the lyrics. Yes, I did. But it was mainly Paul's tune." [...] Lennon also told Playboy in 1980: [...] " [...] 'Paperback Writer' is son of 'Day Tripper', but it is Paul's song." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{improvements}} to governance still left {{plenty of room}} for profiteering. As Mark Twain wrote while working for his brother, the secretary of Nevada, [...] "The government of my country snubs honest simplicity, but fondles artistic villainy, and I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have developed into a very capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two." [...] "Territorial rings", corrupt associations of local politicians and business owners buttressed with federal patronage, embezzled from Indian tribes and local citizens, especially in the Dakota and New Mexico territories.|$|E
6000|$|... "A pity," [...] said Godwin, as {{they dragged}} his horse away. [...] "Had they left us alone <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> brother, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have saved you a {{moonlight}} duel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{exceptions}} to every rule," [...] Lord Keith said, [...] "and as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> overstep the line. Could he pass?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> do better," [...] said Amos. [...] "We might bait a trap {{for them}} there. Where is this powder {{of which you}} spoke?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Robert Long {{was arrested}} on November 16, 1984, and charged with the sexual battery and {{kidnapping}} of Lisa McVey. Long signed a formal Miranda waiver, and consented to questioning. After the detectives procured a confession for the McVey case, their questioning focused {{on a series of}} unsolved sexual battery homicides pending in the area. As the detectives began to question Long about the murders, he replied, [...] "I'd rather not answer that." [...] The detectives continued the interrogation, and handed Long photographs of the various murder victims. At this point, Long stated, [...] "The complexion of things sure have changed since you came back into the room. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> need an attorney." [...] No attorney was provided, and Long eventually confessed to eight murders in Hillsborough County, and one murder in Pasco County.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{that would}} be great, wouldn't it! But hones', Nell, do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{have a chance to}} land the assistant's job?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dolly {{turned her}} glance to him tenderly, then withdrew it in haste. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>MIGHT,</b> in time," [...] she {{answered}} very slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... "My father <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{have been}} a little more careful, but my mother says she thinks it is Mr. Sanderson's fault that he let me get such an amount of money in cash and carry it on such a lonely road. But dad is all right, and in his last letter he said he could let Mr. Sanderson have a {{thousand}} dollars if that would help matters out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And to <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{have killed}} him!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Cookie, you're a white boy. You'll do. We're {{going to like}} you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{come down}} here to confer with you," [...] he declared, {{as they reached the}} door. [...] "I don't believe I want any more of their company. What's the use? As you say, I've started wrong with them, and I don't see any {{prospect}} of getting right; and, besides, I like the rangers better. Landon <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> work into the service. I wonder if I could? It would give me something to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! I did not {{say that}} I had done with everybody,' said Anne; 'but, perhaps, {{whatever}} I might <b>think,</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not have presumed--' ...|$|E
60|$|TOPPING. If you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> risk it, Miss, I'd like to slip {{round to}} my dentist. [He lays {{a finger on}} his cheek].|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{as well as}} I ought; but"--lowering {{his voice}} for her ear alone, he added, [...] "under proper {{instruction}} I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> learn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's the question. <b>I</b> believe papa <b>thinks</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{be lifted}} {{to the sofa}} now--and oh! how I long for it--but then Mr. Ward does not approve of my sitting up, even as I am doing now, and wants to keep me flat. Papa thinks that of no use, and likely to hurt my general health, and I believe {{the end of it}} will be that he will ask Sir Matthew Fleet's opinion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{was just}} thinking. Mamma <b>thinks</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> go to college. If I went {{it would be}} nice if we went to two places that were near each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, father," [...] she said, [...] "at least tell me {{that you}} believe me. Though you may <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> love to all extremes, surely, having known me so many years, you cannot <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> would lie even for my love's sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Mary; 'I {{should like}} it better afterwards. Do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> do one copy for you? Or {{would it not}} suit Lord Ormersfield?' ...|$|E
60|$|CHLOE. Well, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to}} stop it. Will you slip {{round to}} Dawker's--it's not five minutes--and ask him to come and see me.|$|E
6000|$|He did {{the inquiry}} all the honours--visibly weighed its {{importance}} and weighed his response. [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have been showing {{you that a}} little more handsomely?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A day of {{sunshine}} beryl-bright And windless; yea, <b>think</b> as <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> [...] <b>I</b> could not say, Even to within years' measure, when One {{would be at}} my side who then [...] Was far away.|$|R

6000|$|I did {{get that}} further five hundred of course, for M. Charles Saurez was {{punctual}} to the minute, and M. Geoffroy {{was there with}} the police to apprehend him. But to <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have had twenty thousand--! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{tell you}} this,' he said. 'We were {{entrapped}} by the Arabs, and our only chance of escape entailed {{the death of}} one of us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{take him}} some picture books to look at, William? There {{are some of}} the Holy Land. There couldn't be {{anything}} wrong in that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are most}} kind," [...] said Sybil, [...] "but if I {{could get back}} to the town through Mowbray Park, I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> do {{something}} for my father!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} ready {{to pack up and}} follow you any day, Merton. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> assist you a little; at all events I shall try, and go about among the women and listen to what they say while you are {{listening}} to the men." ...|$|R
