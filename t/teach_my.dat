[...] Smith credited Swiss theologian Karl Barth for helping him eventually decide to fight apartheid. [...] In 1963, Barth {{asked him if he}} was really free to preach the Gospel in South Africa. [...] Barth asked him the question three times, concluding with [...] "Will you be free to preach the Gospel even if the government in your country tells you that you are preaching against the whole system?" [...] Smith found that [...] "I could not really answer the question truthfully. I thought I was free, and yet I was not sure."

40|$|Teaching is {{a complex}} process, as it {{involves}} not only knowledge about a topic, but also a number of social, presentation and communication skills. Due to the interactive nature of these skills, they are primarily acquired and matured through experience and feedback.

40|$|Motivated by Parker Palmer’s {{call for}} {{teachers}} to understand the self who teaches, I recently completed a transformative research journey that revealed and reconceptualised deeply sedimented dimensions of <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity. I am a university based science teacher educator from Indonesia, and recently participated in a 3 -year longitudinal co-teaching project in lower secondary schools in Western Australia. Conducting co-teaching and narrative research stimulated me to think deeply about and reflect critically on <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity. I came to understand the powerful role of culture, religion, and personal experiences in transformative learning and sustainability education in shaping <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity. As the research involved critical reflection on my professional praxis, I adopted a multi-paradigmatic research approach with three focus paradigms - interpretivism, criticalism, and postmodernism - and adopted critical auto/ethnography as my research methodology. I applied multiple genres within arts-based research, including poetic reflections (poems), stories, dialogues within narrative, and metaphors. My five research quality standards were critical reflexivity, praxis, representation, trustworthiness and authenticity, and crystallisation. I discovered that <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity is not fixed and that the journey in revealing <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity is endless. I revealed and reconceptualised <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity from four main perspectives. I {{came to understand that}} I am a product of cultural hybridity resulting from interactions of very different cultures, including Javanese, Bimanese, Indonesian and Australian. As I was growing up Islam became my way of life and shaped my values, beliefs and actions in all aspects of my life; I discovered religion as a hegemonic power in <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity. <b>My</b> postgraduate journey embedded three aspects of transformative learning in <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity: (1) constructivism, (2) empowering teacher-student relationships, and (3) dialectical thinking. I came to realise the power of sustainability education in shaping <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity, through <b>my</b> core life values of religion and childhood education. These values have found expression in <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> practice via ‘Green Chemistry’. This doctoral research was an empowering journey that enriched my personal and professional life by enabling me to examine and develop core values, beliefs, and practices that form <b>my</b> <b>teaching</b> identity. I hope that <b>my</b> newly transformed <b>teaching</b> identity enables me to further develop my professional practice as a science teacher educator who has a passion to empower the agency of her student teachers and to empower her readers to reflect on their own identities, both personally and professionally...|$|R
