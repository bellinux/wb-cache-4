Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins <b>to</b> <b>improve,</b> <b>and</b> a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E

5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066AD, {{the land}} in the East Riding was granted to {{followers}} of the new Norman king and ecclesiastical institutions. When some of the northern earls rebelled, William retaliated with the Harrying of the North which laid waste many East Riding villages. The land was then distributed among powerful barons, such as the Count of Aumale in Holderness and the Percy family in the Wolds and the Vale of York. These lay lords and ecclesiastical institutions, including the monasteries, continued <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>and</b> drain their holdings throughout the Middle Ages to maximise the rents they could charge for them.|$|E
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>and</b> maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters {{initially}} predicted {{wind shear}} from an upper level low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days. However, the depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near the circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear, {{and the system}} intensified into Tropical Storm Chris six hours after developing. The convection gradually consolidated over the system, and by late on the 1st Chris reached winds of 60mph (95km/h) while passing 50miles (80km) north of the northern Leeward Islands. The structure of Chris continued <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>and</b> become more symmetrical, and an upper level eye feature developed early on August 2. Outflow improved in all quadrants, as well, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h) shortly thereafter while located 120miles (195km) east of St. Thomas. Despite initial predictions of Chris intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure forced it west-northwestward, upper level shear dissipated the well-defined inner core of the storm, and Chris started to weaken.|$|E

5|$|If the {{agreements}} at Montmirail had been followed up, {{the acts of}} homage could potentially have confirmed Louis's position as king, while undermining the legitimacy of any rebellious barons within Henry's territories {{and the potential for}} an alliance between them and Louis. In practice, however, Louis perceived himself to have gained a temporary advantage, and immediately after the conference he began to encourage tensions between Henry's sons. Meanwhile, Henry's position in the south of France continued <b>to</b> <b>improve,</b> <b>and</b> by 1173 he had agreed to an alliance with Humbert, the Count of Savoy, which betrothed Henry's son John and Humbert's daughter Alicia. Henry's daughter Eleanor was married to Alfonso VIII of Castile in 1170, enlisting an additional ally in the south. In February 1173, Raymond finally gave in and publicly gave homage for Toulouse to Henry and his heirs.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Washington {{traveled}} to Barbados with Lawrence, who {{was suffering from}} tuberculosis, {{with the hope that}} the climate would be beneficial to Lawrence's health. Washington contracted smallpox during the trip, which left his face slightly scarred but immunized him against future exposures to the dreaded disease. Lawrence's health failed <b>to</b> <b>improve,</b> <b>and</b> he returned to Mount Vernon where he died in the summer of 1752. Lawrence's position as Adjutant General (militia leader) of Virginia was divided into four district offices after his death. Washington was appointed by Governor Dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in February 1753, with the rank of major in the Virginia militia. During this period, Washington became a Freemason while in Fredericksburg, although his involvement was minimal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Clydesdale blood {{was added to}} the Irish draught breed in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>and</b> reinvigorate that declining breed. However, these efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to lower leg defaults. The Clydesdale was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} Gypsy Vanner horse, developed in Great Britain. The Clydesdale, along with other draught breeds, was also used to create the Australian Draught Horse. In the early 20th century, they were often crossed with Dales ponies, creating mid-sized draught horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery.|$|E

To produce more athletes and <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>and</b> raise the standard of sports in the state after Sabah became part of Malaysia, the Sabah State Sports Council was established in 1972. In addition, the Sabah Sports and Cultural Board Sports was created on 1 September 1976 before being frozen in December 1978 {{for more than two years}} until 1 January 1981 due to specific reasons.
