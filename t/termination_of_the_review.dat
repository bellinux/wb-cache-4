40|$|<b>The</b> {{contractile}} cycle <b>of</b> striated muscles, skeletal and cardiac, {{is controlled}} by a cytosolic [Ca 2 +] transient that requires rapid movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ion through channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). A functional signature of these channels is their closure after a stereotyped time lapse of Ca 2 + release. In cardiac muscle there is abundant evidence that <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> release is mediated by depletion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ca 2 + store, even if the linkage mechanism remains unknown. By contrast, in skeletal muscle <b>the</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> release <b>termination</b> are not understood. This article reviews measurements <b>of</b> store depletion, <b>the</b> experimental evidence for dependence of Ca 2 + release on the [Ca 2 +] level inside the SR, as well as tests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecular nature <b>of</b> putative intra-store Ca 2 + sensors. Because Ca 2 + sparks exhibit the basic release termination mechanism, much attention is dedicated to <b>the</b> studies <b>of</b> store depletion caused by sparks and its relationship with <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> sparks. <b>The</b> <b>review</b> notes <b>the</b> striking differences in volume, content and buffering power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stores in cardiac vs. skeletal muscle, differences that explain why functional depletion is much greater for cardiac than skeletal muscle stores. Because in skeletal muscle store depletion is minimal and reduction in store [Ca 2 +] {{does not appear to}} greatly inhibit Ca 2 + release, it is concluded that decrease in free SR [Ca 2 +] does not mediate physiological <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> Ca 2 + release in this type of muscle. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apparent absence <b>of</b> store depletion and its putative channel closing effect, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> Ca 2 + sparks is faster and more robust in skeletal than cardiac muscle. A gating role of a hypothetical "proximate store" constituted by polymers of calsequestrin and associated proteins is invoked in an attempt to preserve a role for store depletion and unify mechanisms in both types of striated muscle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To prove <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> Java Bytecode (JBC) automatically, we {{transform}} JBC to finite termination graphs {{which represent}} all possible runs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program. Afterwards, the graph {{can be translated}} into “simple ” formalisms like term rewriting and existing tools {{can be used to}} prove <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resulting term rewrite system (TRS). In this paper we show that termination graphs indeed capture <b>the</b> semantics <b>of</b> JBC correctly. Hence, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TRS resulting from the termination graph implies <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original JBC program. ...|$|R
40|$|RESUME <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} {{is to provide}} a general {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purpose, functions and principles governing the right to unilaterally terminate a contract under Czech law. <b>The</b> main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis provides overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Civil Code regarding <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> contract, describing <b>the</b> conditions for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract, limitations on contractual freedom to agree upon grounds for <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract, prerequisites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract and the legal consequences to the rights and obligations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contractual parties following successful <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract. The thesis differentiates between the following generally applicable grounds for <b>the</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract: (i) a material breach of contract; (ii) a breach of contract (whether material or immaterial) constituting delay within <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Civil Code, (iii) fulfilment of specific obligation with defects and (iv) anticipatory breach of contract. Each ground for termination is analysed in detail and <b>the</b> overlaps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific grounds for termination is identified. The thesis further introduces selected interpretation difficulties connected with the new Civil Code and suggests possible solutions to these issues, taking into account <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provisions [...] ...|$|R

To prove <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> context-sensitive rewriting, several methods have been proposed in the literature which transform context-sensitive rewrite systems into ordinary rewrite systems such that <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transformed ordinary system implies <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original context-sensitive system.
