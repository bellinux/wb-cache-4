5|$|Aristagoras {{had been}} {{approached}} by exiled Naxian aristocrats, who were seeking {{to return to their}} island. Seeing an opportunity to bolster his position in Miletus, Aristagoras sought the help of his overlord, the Persian king Darius <b>the</b> <b>Great,</b> <b>and</b> the local satrap, Artaphernes to conquer Naxos. Consenting to the expedition, the Persians assembled a force of 200 triremes under the command of Megabates.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{perhaps because}} of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>and</b> {{definitive}} works from Cairano, the Sanmicheli left Brescia, never to return.

5|$|In 59BC, when he {{was four}} years old, his father died. His mother married a former {{governor}} of Syria, Lucius Marcius Philippus.

Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother, Julia, the sister of Julius Caesar.|$|E

Theoderic also named Eutharic his presumptive heir.|$|E

5|$|According {{to modern}} genealogies {{the father of}} Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was {{a son of a}} {{previous}} ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>and</b> his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Another possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Louis V, the son of Hugh <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>and</b> {{grandson}} of Robert I, Hugh Capet, was elected by the nobility as king of France. The Capetian Dynasty, the male-line descendants of Hugh Capet, ruled France continuously from 987 to 1792 and again from 1814 to 1848. They were direct descendants of the Robertian kings. The cadet branches of the dynasty which ruled after 1328, however, are generally given the specific branch names of Valois and Bourbon.|$|E

5|$|Another {{surviving}} {{work for}} the period is Justin's epitome of Pompeius Trogus's Philippic History.

These surviving histories are complemented by fragments of other histories, including Theopompus's 58-volume history of Philip (which was the source for much of Trogus's Philippic History) and by contemporary epigraphic sources.|$|E
