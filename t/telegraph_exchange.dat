Upon receiving this news, the troopships began transferring the New Zealand soldiers into launches and shuttling them to shore. Government buildings, including the post office and <b>telegraph</b> <b>exchange,</b> were seized by early evening and a party dispatched to the wireless station, in the hills several kilometres away. By the time the New Zealanders arrived, close to midnight, the German operators had sabotaged much of the equipment rendering it inoperative.

50|$|At first, the {{benefits}} of a telephone exchange were not exploited. Instead telephones were leased in pairs to a subscriber, who had to arrange for a telegraph contractor to construct a line between them, for example between a home and a shop.

The first ones were in Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, MinskNovosibirsk, Kuybyshev. Later more of them were established. Some of them were reorganized into independent institutes (1973: Leningrad, Kiev, Novosibirsk, 1978: Tbilisi, Minsk, Kuybyshev). After {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union they went into various post-Soviet States.

50|$|Nagrom was {{a town in}} King County, Washington. A logging company town, Nagrom {{was located}} in the Green River Watershed between Kanaskat, Washington and Lester, Washington. The town was built by the Morgan Lumber Company and named after Elmer G. Morgan, the company founder and owner ('Nagrom' is simply 'Morgan' spelled backward). The site was chosen for its access to timber, and {{suitability}} to build a sawmill and mill pond. In 1910, Morgan petitioned the Northern Pacific Railway, which operated the rail line out of Puget Sound and up over Stampede Pass to build a spur into the small town. The railway balked, but Morgan persisted and eventually the railway relented. The spur into town was built in 1911. A Post office was established that same year, along with a telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>exchange.</b>|$|E

He organized the Columbia News Service, operating out of Studio Nine in New York, and produced three news broadcasts per day. Creating the radio news service was the suggestion of General Mills, which agreed to pay half the cost. The Dow-Jones ticker service was purchased, along with a subscription to an international news agency in London, the <b>Exchange</b> <b>Telegraph.</b> Bureaus were set up in New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago and Los Angeles, and those bureau managers hired part-time correspondents to cover every U.S. city {{with a population of}} 50,000 or more. Before long White was receiving inquiries from small newspapers about whether they could transcribe CBS radio reports and use them in print; and he found a few instances of newspapers doing just that, without attribution.|$|R
40|$|The editor {{asked to}} me write a short paper for the inaugural {{issue of the}} journal. I {{thought that it would}} be most fitting to write on the truly {{fundamental}} transformation of financial markets brought by the most important network of the last fifty years, the Internet. Technology always had an impact on financial markets. Often, {{as in the case of}} the telegraph, it was the use of new technology in the financial realm that necessitated the installation of the new network. Moreover, frequently, the introduction of new technology had tremendous and sometimes unexpected effects on the structure of financial markets. For example, many historians explain the eventual primacy of the New York Stock Exchange over the Philadelphia Stock Exchange on the liquidity New York attracted from orders collected over the telegraph. In the absence of the <b>telegraph,</b> both <b>exchanges</b> could survive as equals. But once the telegraph was installed, it led to the supremacy of one of the two. In another example, in recent years, another technological change, the availability of mathematical formulas for the pricing of options, spurred the mushrooming of the derivatives markets. Thus, a new global network is expected to have an impact on financial markets. In fact, the Internet, now in its eighth year as a commercial network, already has had an impact, and is expected to have a truly transforming influence on financial markets as it matures...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Exchange</b> <b>Telegraph</b> Co. Ltd. (also {{known as}} EXTEL) {{was created in}} March 1872 {{specifically}} to distribute financial and business information from the London Stock Exchange and other commercial markets direct to subscribers. The company established ticker tape telegraph machines in offices, gentlemen's clubs, banks etc. and provided a continuous stream of commercial information to them.It introduced a parliamentary service in 1876, a general news service in 1879 and a legal service in 1891. The business was so successful that by 1906 they had opened ten other branches outside London.The company continued to grow and improve, becoming increasingly more efficient. It added a faster financial service in 1907 and began operating a worldwide news service in 1913, with a separate sports service included in the 1930s.Over the course of its history, Extel (the name coming into common use for the company in the 1950s) grew {{into one of the}} leading news agencies, provider of financial information and associated businesses. Among the many notable achievement were 'Extel Cards', the very first corporate snapshots/tear-sheets with brief data on profit and loss, employees, business activities and executive management.

40|$|In a pulse-tracer experiment, a {{layer of}} tracer {{particles}} {{is added to the}} sediment-water interface, and the down-mixing of these particles is followed over a short time scale. Here, we compare different models (biodiffusion, telegraph, CTRW) to analyse the resulting tracer depth profiles. The biodiffusion model is widely applied, but has two problems associated: (1) infinite propagation speed: the infinitely fast propagation of tracer to depth, and (2) infinitely short waiting times: mixing events follow each other infinitely fast. We show that the problem of waiting times is far more relevant to tracer studies than the problem of propagation speed. The key issue in pulse-tracer experiments is that models should explicitly account for a finite waiting time between mixing events. The telegraph equation has a finite propagation speed, but it still assumes infinitely short waiting times, and hence, it does not form a suitable alternative to the biodiffusion model. Therefore, we advance the continuous-time random walk (CTRW), which explicitly accounts for finite waiting times between mixing events, as a suitable description of bioturbation. CTRW models are able to cope with lateral spatial heterogeneity in reworking, which is a crucial feature of bioturbation at short time scales. We finally show how existing bioturbation models (biodiffusion model, <b>telegraph</b> equation, non-local <b>exchange</b> model) can be considered as special cases of the CTRW model. Accordingly, the CTRW model should not be seen as a new bioturbation model but as a generalization of existing models. ...|$|R
