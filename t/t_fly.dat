5000|$|The Absent Minded Professor: Professor Ned Brainard (Fred MacMurray) makes a Model <b>T</b> <b>fly</b> using flubber. His flying car {{also appears}} in the sequel, Son of Flubber, and in the 1997 remake, Flubber, {{starring}} Robin Williams.|$|E
50|$|Looking for backers, he bounces his Flubber {{ball for}} an audience, but his {{investment}} pitch proves so long-winded {{that most of}} the crowd has left before they notice that the ball bounced higher on its second bounce than on its first. For a more successful demonstration, he makes his Model <b>T</b> <b>fly</b> by bombarding Flubber with radioactive particles. Other adventures and misadventures result as Flubber is used on the bottoms of basketball players' shoes (in a crucial game) giving them tremendous jumping ability; Brainard (at a school dance) making him an accomplished dancer, and the scheming businessman Alonzo Hawk, who switches cars on the professor, with a car containing a squirrel and pigeons. Hawk then must be tackled by a full football team to bring him down after Brainard tricks him into testing Flubber on the bottom of his shoes. The Professor retrieves the old Model T from the warehouse, and Hawk is arrested for having a gun in his possession, when the car crashes into a police car. Eventually, Brainard shows his discovery to the government, after being scared by a missile in flight, and also wins back Miss Carlisle, culminating in a wedding at last.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of the different types of fly ash on the compressive strength properties of sintered briquettes. Thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out. The chemical composition and physical properties of the materials used were determined. Particle size distribution and microstructure elemental analyses of the materials used were carried out by a particle size analyzer (Mastersizer) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM-EDS). Following the characterization of the materials, briquettes were prepared by sintering at different temperatures. Compressive strength test results of the briquette samples indicated that briquettes with a compressive strength value of 47. 45 [*]N/mm 2 can be produced. The results obtained exceed the Turkish standard (TS EN 771 - 1) requirements (9. 8 – 23. 54 [*]N/mm 2). SEM-EDS results showed that briquette samples made with Tunçbilek (<b>T)</b> <b>fly</b> ash had a higher percentage of the glassy phase than the other briquette samples. Due to this microstructure, it results in higher compressive strength value...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} twenty-first century, Saudi Arabia {{is a global}} {{economic}} power that stands as an equal among {{the other members of}} the most powerful economic organizations, including as the Group of Twenty and The World Trade Organization. As a result of this economic status and of Saudi Arabia never having been colonized, recent Saudi novels (especially those published after 2001) can usefully be read postmodern, rather than as postcolonial—the usual paradigm in readings of contemporary Arab novels. To establish a reference point, a comparative approach that engages Saudi and American postmodern novels is applied in this dissertation through the critical lens of Fredric Jameson’s theory of postmodernism. I rely on the postmodern features which are listed in M. Keith Booker’s Monsters, Mushroom Clouds, and The Cold War: American Science Fiction and The Roots of Postmodernism, 1946 - 1964. Girls of Riyadh by Rajā al-Sani 2 ̆ 7, Throwing Sparks by Abdo Khal, and Super Sad True Love Story by Gary Shteyngart share postmodern features such as schizophrenia, fragmentation, and suspicion toward grand narratives, which demonstrate instability of personality. Weak historical thinking permeates The Dove 2 ̆ 7 s Necklace by Raja Alem, Life on Hold by Fahd al-Atiq, and No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy. The resulting effect of late capitalism, a weak utopian imagination, shapes the outcomes of Where Pigeons Don 2 ̆ 7 <b>t</b> <b>Fly</b> by Yousef al-Mohaimeed, Days of Ignorance by Laila al-Johani, and City of Glass by Paul Auster. Although the project of modernization has not yet been fully completed in Saudi Arabia, the expression of postmodern characteristics is clear in twenty-first century Saudi novels, as might be expected due to Saudi Arabia’s economic positioning in the late capitalist model...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{heavy metal}} lead {{has been shown}} to be {{associated}} with a genotoxic risk. Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism commonly utilized in genetic toxicology testing. The endosymbionts — Wolbachia are now very common in both wild populations and laboratory stocks of Drosophila. Wolbachia may induce resistance to pathogenic viruses, filarial nematodes and Plasmodium in fruit fly and mosquito hosts. However the effect of Wolbachia infection on the resistance of their hosts to heavy metal is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Manipulating the lead content in the diet of Drosophila melanogaster, we found that lead consumption had no different effects on developmental time between Wolbachia-infected (Dmel wMel) and –uninfected (Dmel <b>T)</b> <b>flies.</b> While in Pb-contaminated medium, significantly reduced amount of pupae and adults of Dmel wMel were emerged, and Dmel wMel adults had significantly shorter longevity than that of Dmel <b>T</b> <b>flies.</b> Lead infusion in diet resulted in significantly decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in Dmel <b>T</b> <b>flies</b> (P, 0. 05), but not in Dmel wMel flies. Correspondingly, lead cultures induced a 10. 8 fold increase in malonaldehyde (MDA) contents in Dmel T larvae (P, 0. 05). While in Dmel wMel larvae, it resulted in only a 1. 3 fold increase. By quantitative RT-PCR, we showed that lead infused medium caused significantly increased expression level of relish and CecA 2 genes in Dmel <b>T</b> <b>flies</b> (P, 0. 01). Lead cultures did not change dramatically the expression of these genes in Dmel wMel flies...|$|R

5000|$|The 12Mc was {{an early}} example {{of an attempt to}} solve the problem of falling engine power with {{increasing}} altitude; it was [...] "undercharged", running lean at sea level and only developing its maximum power at 2,000 m (6,490 ft). A final 12M variant, the 12Mdsh run in 1932, addressed this problem differently; it was the first Hispano-Suiza engine to be supercharged, blown by a Rateau turbine. It produced 477 kW (640 hp) at 2,250 rpm at an altitude 2,950 m (9,678 ft). <b>Test</b> <b>flown</b> in a Dewoitine D.32, it maintained power up to 5,500 m (18,000 ft).
