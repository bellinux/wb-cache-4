50|$|The {{cerebral}} palsy sport classification {{system is designed}} for people with several types of paralysis and movement including quadriplegia, <b>triplegia,</b> diplegia, hemiplegia, monoplegia, spasticity, athetosis, and ataxia. Quadriplegia impacts the whole body, including the head, torso and all the limbs. <b>Triplegia</b> impacts {{three of the four}} limbs. Diplegia is when there is greater functional use of the lower limbs than the upper limbs. Hemiplegia, is a type of paralysis that effects one side of the body. Monoplegia is a condition that impacts only one limb. Spasticity limits muscle movement as a result of tightness in muscle.|$|E
50|$|Spastic diplegia {{accounts}} for about 22% of all diagnoses of cerebral palsy, and together with spastic quadriplegia and spastic <b>triplegia</b> make up the broad classification spastic cerebral palsy, which {{accounts for}} 70% of all cerebral palsy diagnoses.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} is {{commonly associated with}} cerebral palsy, although conditions such as stroke {{can also lead to}} it. <b>Triplegia</b> has also been found to be due to an increase in intracranial pressure associated with hydrocephalus resulting from traumatic brain injury.|$|E
50|$|In a case {{reported}} only {{due to its}} rarity, <b>triplegia</b> {{was reported}} following a tonsillectomy (surgical removal of the tonsils). An eight-year-old male patient was sent to Willard Parker Hospital on August 12, 1929 and {{had been diagnosed with}} poliomyelitis. After an unrelated, and routine, tonsillectomy there was complete flaccid paralysis and loss of feeling in both the legs, right arm, and muscles in the trunk.|$|E
50|$|Spastic quadriplegia, while {{affecting}} {{all four}} limbs {{more or less}} equally, can still present {{parts of the body}} as stiffer than others, such as one arm being tighter than another arm, and so forth. Spastic <b>triplegia,</b> meanwhile, involves three limbs (such as one arm and two legs, or one leg and two arms, etc.); spastic diplegia affects two limbs (commonly just the legs), spastic hemiplegia affects one or another entire side of the body (left or right); and spastic monoplegia involves a single limb.|$|E
50|$|Spastic {{hemiplegia}} (one side being affected). Generally, {{injury to}} muscle-nerves {{controlled by the}} brain's left side will cause a right body deficit, and vice versa. Typically, people that have spastic hemiplegia are the most ambulatory, although they generally have dynamic equinus on the affected side and are primarily prescribed ankle-foot orthoses to prevent said equinus.11Spastic diplegia (the lower extremities are affected with little to no upper-body spasticity). The {{most common form of}} the spastic forms. Most people with spastic diplegia are fully ambulatory and have a scissors gait. Flexed knees and hips to varying degrees are common. Hip problems, dislocations, and in three-quarters of spastic diplegics, also strabismus (crossed eyes), can be present as well. In addition, these individuals are often nearsighted. The intelligence of a person with spastic diplegia is unaffected by the condition.Spastic tetraplegia (all four limbs affected equally). People with spastic quadriplegia are the least {{likely to be able to}} walk, or if they can, to want to walk, because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs on one side of the body and impairs normal movement.Occasionally, terms such as monoplegia, paraplegia, <b>triplegia,</b> and pentaplegia may also be used to refer to specific manifestations of the spasticity.|$|E
30|$|Orthopaedic {{surgeons}} {{continue to}} regard topographical classification as {{important because it}} focuses on the limb segments affected by the neurological deficits and by the hypertonia [2]. The preferred classification in Europe is unilateral and bilateral CP [22]; in North America and Australia, the terms hemiplegia, diplegia, <b>triplegia</b> and quadriplegia remain in use [2].|$|E
40|$|We {{collected}} 30 {{cases of}} vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) from 4081 cases of acute flaccid palsies cases notified from 1989 to 1995 to the Brazilian Ministry of Health. There were 30 VAPP cases with 56 % of {{children younger than}} 1 year old, 56. 7 % of female. 46 % of cases were reported in the Northeast. Ten P 2 vaccine virus, 8 P 3 and 2 P 1 and associations amongst them were isolated. The clinical pattern in 60 days was: monoplegia (16), paraplegia (6), tetraplegia (5), hemiplegia (2) and <b>triplegia</b> (1). There was no strong relationship between fever, {{before or after the}} prodrome period, or the use of intramuscular medication to morbidity. CONCLUSION: if the anti-poliomyelitis strategy adopted in Brazil has lead to the eradication of the poliomyelitis with wild virus infection, the existence of a minimum risk of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis is a matter of concern because there will be a permanent neurological deficit...|$|E
40|$|Each year, the Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics publishes more papers {{dealing with}} {{orthopaedic}} issues {{of children with}} cerebral palsy (CP) than any other medical journal. However, it can sometimes {{be difficult for the}} reader to understand the defining features of the study population. Different authors use different terms, and the definitions of the terms are imprecise. CP is traditionally classified by motor type and topographical distribution. A classification based on motor type might include the terms spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, hypotonic, and mixed. The most commonly used terms in classifications of topographical distribution are hemiplegia, diplegia, and quadriplegia, but the terms monoplegia, paraplegia, <b>triplegia,</b> double hemiplegia and tetraplegia are also used. The terms vary considerably, but more importantly classifications by motor type and topography 4 are known to be unreliable. What can contributors to JPO do to improve communication? The answer is to add a simple, valid, and reliable classification of gross motor function in their clinical research. For some time, orthopaedic surgeons have recognized that the incidence of certain musculoskeletal problems and the success rate of reconstructive surgery in CP are related to severity. For example, 2 many studies suggest that the incidence of spastic hip disease is directly related to functional severity. Other studies report...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to offer a typology of disabled tennis players who practice the sport activity in a wheelchair. First, some brief references concerning physical disability are included, an expression whose meaning includes wheelchair tennis players, which is defi ned as an individual who, as a consequence ofa congenital or acquired defi ciency, is impeded of accomplishing, with normality, the basic forms of movement. The three situations dealt with in the text, which come to describe the points mentioned in the “Introduction”, comprise, respectively, of a classifi cation of the physical disabilities which are linked to the different sequelae presented (neurological, myopathic, orthopedic and rheumatic), a summary of the types of marrow injuries (with an indication of the muscle groups involved and the movements affected), and the different situations that demonstrate sequelae caused by marrow injuries, varying in function of number and class of the extremities affected (from monoplegia to quadriplegia, via paraplegia, <b>triplegia,</b> hemiplegia and diplegia). The thematic nucleus of this work is a description of the several categories of tennis players in wheelchairs which should establish in function of their limitations; namely: paraplegic sportsmen, tetraplegic, players with cerebral paralysis, athletes with spina bifida, players with poliomyelitis and players with amputated lower limbs. Examples are used to illustrate,the points, complementing the theoretical references. RESUMO O presente artigo tem o objetivo de oferecer uma tipologia de jogadores portadores de defi ci��ncia física que praticam a atividade desportiva do tênis em cadeira de rodas. Incluem-se a princípio, umas breves referências concernentes ao defi ciente físico, expressões cujo referente signifi cativo inclui o jogador de tênis em cadeira de rodas, que fi ca defi nido como aquele indivíduo que, como conseqüência de uma defi ciência congênita ou adquirida, se vê impedido para realizar com normalidade as formas básicas do movimento. Os três quadros incorporados ao texto, que vêm a descrever os aspetos pontuais considerados na “Introdução”, compõem, respectivamente, uma classifi cação das defi ciências físicas que atendem as distintas seqüelas que estão presentes (neurológicas, miopáticas, ortopédicas e reumatológicas), um resumo dos tipos de lesões medulares (com indicação dos grupos musculares envolvidos e os movimentos afetados), e os diferentesquadros que mostram as seqüelas ocasionadas por uma lesão medular, os quais variam em função do número e a classe das extremidades afetadas (desde a monoplegia até a quadriplegia, passando pela paraplegia, a <b>triplegia,</b> a hemiplegia e a diplegia). O núcleo temático deste trabalho vem constituído pela descrição das diversas categorias de jogadores de tênis em cadeira de rodas que devem se estabelecer em função de suas limitações, a saber: desportistas paraplégicos, tetraplégicos, jogadores com paralisia cerebral, atletas de espinha bífi da, jogadores com poliomielite e jogadores com amputação de membros inferiores.

40|$|A {{prospective}} study {{was carried out}} to identify predictors of independent walking in 31 children with either spastic diplegia or <b>triplegia,</b> observed {{from the age of}} 9 to 18 months (mean, 11 months) and followed for a mean period of 30 months (range, 24 to 36 months). Mean age at most recent examination was 41 months (range, 36 to 54 months). We used an 18 -item scheme to chart the acquisition, from the prone position, of prelocomotor, sitting, and locomotor skills. Examinations were conducted every 6 months and videotaped according to a standardized procedure. At latest assessment 18 (58 %) of the 31 children had achieved walking, 7 (23 %) independently and 11 (35 %) with assistance; 13 (42 %) did not achieve walking. Ambulatory status was related to developmental quotient and visual acuity: all the children who became independent walkers had normal visual acuity and in 86 % of cases a normal general development quotient. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the number of gross motor skills achieved and the rate of achievement before 2 years of age and ambulatory status at 3 to 5 years of age. Ability to put weight on the hands while prone and to roll from supine to prone position by 18 months of age were significantly related to independent walking, while ability to sit without support was predictive only at around 24 months of age...|$|E
40|$|Sjögren-Larsson {{syndrome}} (SLS) {{is a rare}} neurocutane­ous disease {{showing an}} autosomal recessive transmis­sion {{due to a lack}} of fatty acid aldehyde dehydrogenase. Spastic diplegia or <b>triplegia,</b> mental retardation and con­genital lamellar ichthyosis are the major findings of the disease. The syndrome may be accompanied by various eye and teeth features, skeletal system anomaly, speak­ing defects, hypertelorism and epilepsy. A 9 -month male patient has been hospitalized for convulsion and flaking on body. The patient history showed that flaking skin thickening and peeling was started at the birth, and he suffered a right-side focused seizure when he was three month-old and he was treated with phenobarbital and car­bamazepine upon the epilepsy diagnosis. Wide ichthyo­sis, hypertelorism and bilateral simian line were observed in the physical examination. Bilateral punctuate lesions in cornea, pigment epithelial atrophy in the right eye and esotropia in the left eye have been determined during the eye examination. An epiteliform anomaly has been ob­served in the left hemisphere by electroencephalography. In brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an increase in cerebral-cerebellar brain parenchyma and T 1 -T 2 relax­ation time and in the signal in corpus callosum (delayed myelination) have been determined. With the observa­tion of the white matter in centrum semi oval using brain MRI spectroscopy, signs of a sphingolipid peak at 1. 3 ppm have been observed. An SLS diagnosis has been proposed upon clinical and laboratory observations. We want to emphasize on the fact that in epilepsy cases with ichthyosis, SLS should be considered...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{development}} of postural control in the prone position in children with spastic diplegia and <b>triplegia,</b> and determine the influence of clinical characteristics, visual acuity and cognitive performance on that development. We also analysed the relation between these early motor achievements in the prone position and the subsequent acquisition of motor competence in the sitting position. We followed 24 diplegic and triplegic children from before age 2 years (mean age 12 months) to mean age 41 months, videorecording motor behaviour every six months and abstracting acquisitions in alignment and balance using a standardised procedure. We confirm a developmental sequence of all the acquired movements in the prone position. 83. 3 % of the children completed the uprighting sequence in the sagittal plane, acquired good balance, and ability to rotate the head and trunk. 70. 8 % of the children (all but one of the diplegic children and none among triplegic children) acquired symmetric posture in the frontal plane and 83. 3 % reduced leg hyperextension. Development was not uniform, and at 12 - 18 months two groups began to emerge: diplegic children who rapidly achieved all or most of the steps in the sequence and had a favourable prognosis for subsequent motor development; and triplegic children who achieved these steps at a much slower rate or in some cases not at all and had a less favourable prognosis for future development. Diplegic children with normal visual acuity, and general quotient GQ> 70 did better than triplegic children with compromised visual acuity and GQ< 70. Acquisition of the full uprighting sequence in the prone position before the age of two related to the later acquisition of autonomous sitting...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital anomaly whose etiology {{has not yet been}} elucidated. It is characterized by the triad of vascular malformations, cutaneous hemangiomas and overgrowth of bone and soft tissue adjacent. Pain is a common symptom and can be triggered in the following situations: venous disease, scoliosis by the different members and hemangiomas that affect the body surface, the deep planes or viscera. Case report: A female patient, 17, sent from the SARAH Hospital - Fortaleza to the Institute of Clinic Pain José Frota diagnosed with cerebral palsy type <b>triplegia</b> on right eye and anophthalmia featuring an expansive process of vascular origin extending to the paraspinal region, surpassing sciatic foramen and affecting posterior muscles of the left thigh and leg. There are signs of involvement of the sciatic nerve and deep femoral vessels. He was diagnosed with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. She had continuous pain in shock and burning, EVA 10, extending from the lower back, groin and left leg region. The source of hospital treatment consisted of gabapentin 180 mg 12 / 12 h, codeine 10 mg 12 / 12 h, ibuprofen 300 mg 12 / 12 h, codeine/paracetamol 30 mg 12 / 12 h and morphine oral 10 mg while in pain, but without pain relief. She also used paroxetine 20 mg daily, due to depression. The painful condition prevented sleep, caused irritation and worsened {{the quality of life of}} the patient. She continued treatment with gabapentin 300 mg 12 / 12 h, dipyrone 500 mg 12 / 12 h, Methadone 5 mg 12 / 12 h and reassessed two weeks showing significant improvement in pain symptoms and sleep, EVA 2. Conclusion: Pain is a symptom commonly described in the clinical picture of patients with this syndrome. The treatment of this disease is still a challenge. The malformations great gifts made it not always possible embolization or painkillers locks. The therapeutic results with strong opioid were satisfactory and have improved the quality of life of the patient...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{intensive}} care units (NICU) were started in Queen Mary Hospital and Tsan Yuk Hospital in 1980. Children who were {{discharged from the}} units were followed by paediatricians. The Child Assessment Centre at the Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital {{was set up in}} 1986. Before 1992 the Centre received the majority of referrals for low birth weight who were high risk infants. In 1993, a low birth weight registry was set up and infants with birth weigh < 1. 5 kg were referred. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the neurodevelopmental outcome of all premature infants (< 3 weeks gestation) referred to the Child Assessment Centre; (2) to review the outcome of low birth weight (< 1. 5 kg) seen in 1993 and 1994; (3) to identify perinatal risk factors; (4) to review any changes in the pattern of cerebral palsy. All premature infants were seen at the Centre between 1987 and 1996. The Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale was used for the first assessment. A General Quotient (GQ) score (scores of children under 2 years were corrected for prematurity RA) above 85 was considered normal, 70 - 85 as mild delay, 50 - 70 as moderate delay and below 50 as severe delay. Neurological examination was performed at first assessment and subsequent followup. At age 5 years, the children were assessed with the Hong Kong Wechsler Intellegence Scale for Children. A free field distraction test with visual enhancement was used to screen for hearing impairment. Tympangrams, audiograms and brainstem auditory evoked potentials were recorded for those with suspected hearing loss. Stycar mounted ball and 100 s and 1000 s were use for distant vision and near vision screening. The Cardiff Acuity Test, retinoscopy and VEP were used to assess children with suspected visual impairments. Cortical blindness, severe myopia, amblyopia are visual impairment. Statistical analysis was applied to identify perinatal risk factors for cerebral palsy. Mental handicap was divided into two main groups to evaluate outcome. Limited intelligence, mild mental retardation and mild delay were classified as minor mental handicap. Moderate and severe mental retardation, moderate and severe delay were classified under major mental handicap. There were 229 girls and 299 boys. Mean birth weight was 1. 46 ± 0. 58 kg (SD). Mean gestation period was 30 ± 3 weeks. The mean age of first assessment at the Centre was 20 ± 10 months with a mean GQ of 87 ± 24. 7 using RA. Among 60 children with cerebral palsy, 35 (58 %) had diplegia, nine (15 %) had hemiplegia, nine had <b>triplegia,</b> and seven had quadriplegia. Mental function showed 12 % minor mental handicap and 8 % major mental handicap. Visual impairment was found in 24 (4. 5 %). Sensorineural hearing loss was found in 18 (3. 4 %) and 23 (4. 3 %) had epilepsy. Periventricular or intraventricular haemorrhage and the need for mechanical ventilation contributed to significant risk (P< 0. 001) of developing cerebral palsy. Such haemorrhage was found in 128 (24 %) children; 74 (14 %) were grade 1 & 2, 54 (10 %) were grade 3 & 4. Only one child developed cerebral palsy from those with grade 1 & 2, while 24 of those with grade 3 & 4 haemorrhage did. Before 1992 the overall handicap rate for cerebral palsy was 12. 5 %. From 1993 - 1994 the handicap rate for cerebral palsy was 9 % and infants < 1. 5 kg who were born in Queen Mary and Tsan Yuk Hospitals had a physical handicap rate of 8. 5 %. The premature infants seen at the Child Assessment Centre before 1992 were high risk infants referred for assessment. This group of children had a minor mental handicap rate of 12 % and 8 % for major handicap. The rate of cerebral palsy has declined over the last 3 years, from 12. 5 % to 9 %. This could be due to a better referral system or to improvement in neonatal care. Grade 3 & 4 intraventricular haemorrhage and a history of mechanical ventilation were identified as major risk factors for developing cerebral palsy...|$|E
