6000|$|At {{the morning}} {{announced}} for Madame de Bernstein's departure, all the numerous domestics of Castlewood crowded about {{the doors and}} passages, some to have a last glimpse of her ladyship's men and the fascinating Gumbo, some to take leave of her ladyship's maid, all to waylay the Baroness and her nephew for parting fees, which it was the custom of that day largely to distribute among household servants. One and the other gave liberal gratuities to the liveried society, to the gentlemen in black and ruffles, and to the swarm of female attendants. Castlewood was {{the home of the}} Baroness's youth; and as for her honest Harry, who had not only lived at free charges in the house, but had won horses and money--or promises of money--from his cousin and the unlucky chaplain, he was naturally of a generous turn, and felt that at this moment he ought not to stint his benevolent disposition. [...] "My mother, I know," [...] he thought, [...] "will wish me to be liberal to all the retainers of the Esmond family." [...] So he scattered about his gold pieces to right and left, and {{as if he had been}} as rich as Gumbo announced him to be. There was no one who came near him but had a share in his bounty. From the major-domo to the shoeblack, Mr. Harry had a peace-offering for them all. To the grim housekeeper in her still-room, to the feeble old porter in his lodge, he distributed some token of his remembrance. When a man is in love with one woman in a family, it is astonishing how fond he becomes of every person connected with it. He ingratiates himself with the maids; he is bland with the butler; he interests himself about the footman; he runs on errands for the daughters; he gives advice and lends money to the young son at college; he pats little dogs which he would kick otherwise; he smiles at old stories which would make him break out in yawns, were they uttered by any one but papa; he drinks sweet port wine for which he would curse the steward and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>committee</b> of a club; he bears even with the cantankerous old maiden aunt; he beats time when darling little Fanny performs her piece on the piano; and smiles when wicked, lively little Bobby upsets the coffee over his shirt.|$|E

His character was known to Mr. Hastings: it was recorded long before, when he was turned out of another office. [...] "During my long residence," [...] says he, [...] "in this country, {{this is the first}} time I heard of the character of Gunga Govind Sing being infamous. No information I have received, though I have heard many people speak ill of him, ever pointed to any particular act of infamy committed by Gunga Govind Sing. I have no intimate knowledge of Gunga Govind Sing. What I understand of his character has been from Europeans as well as natives." [...] After,--"He had many enemies at the time he was proposed to be employed in the Company's service, and not one advocate among the natives who had immediate access to myself. I think, therefore, if his character had been such as has been described, the knowledge of it could hardly have failed to have been ascertained to me by the specific facts. I have heard him loaded, as I have many others, with general reproaches, but have never heard any one express a doubt of his abilities." [...] Now, if anything in the world should induce you to put the whole trust of the revenues of Bengal, both above and below, into the hands of a single man, and to delegate to him the whole jurisdiction of the country, it must be that he either was, or at least was reputed to be, a man of integrity. Mr. Hastings does not pretend that he is reputed to be a man of integrity. He knew that he was not able to contradict the charge brought against him, and that he had been turned out of office by his colleagues, for reasons assigned upon record, and approved by the Directors, for malversation in office. He had, indeed, crept again into the Calcutta Committee; and they were upon the point of turning him out for malversation, when Mr. Hastings saved them the trouble by turning out <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Committee,</b> consisting of a president and five members. So that in all times, in all characters, in all places, he stood as a man of a bad character and evil repute, though supposed to be a man of great abilities.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the death}} of Congressman Charlie Norwood (R-GA) in February, 2007, Simpson has become a leading {{advocate}} of the American Dental Association (ADA) in Congress, in part because his profession is dentistry.

The bill is formally called H.R. 1671: Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, with the purpose to understand and address the oral health problems associated with methamphetamine. The bill's goals are to expand and intensify the Department of Health and Human Services, make grants available to educate 12- to 17-year-olds about methmouth, and to promote a series of education activities for all dentists to learn about substance use disorders {{and their relationship to}} oral health and the provision of dental care.

Because both parties have, over time, valued their ability to block the president's judicial nominees, keeping alive the Thurmond Rule has proved convenient for both parties at different times." [...] Glenn Kessler and Aaron Blake of the Washington Post note that senators of both political parties - such as Mitch McConnell and Pat Leahy - frequently flip-flop on the issue of judicial nominations in presidential election years, alternately invoking the Thurmond Rule and denying its validity, depending on which party controls the Senate and the White House. For example, in 2004, when George W. Bush was president, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah dismissed the rule, saying [...] "Strom Thurmond unilaterally on his own ... when he was chairman could say whatever he wanted to, but that didn't bind <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>committee,</b> and it doesn't bind me." [...] Conversely, in 2008, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California had invoked the [...] "rule" [...] in saying that the Senate should not act on any judicial appointments made by Bush in his last year in office, and in response, a Bush White House spokeswoman said that the [...] "only thing clear about the so-called 'Thurmond Rule' is that there is no such defined rule." [...] Kessler concludes that [...] "both parties can be viewed as hypocritical, situational and prone to flip-flopping, depending on which party holds the presidency and/or the Senate." ...|$|E

50|$|The idea of renovating and {{restoring}} {{the ground floor}} of the church’s refectory to convert it into a historical mini-museum was one of the major projects of the Betis Town Fiesta Committee 2007. The Committee which was spearheaded by comité de festejo president Florentino Torres saw the need of a specific place which will serve as an exhibition room where the collections of Betis Church’s artifacts, important historical data, old photographs and memorabilia, antique valuable pieces of the old families of the town and other significant documents pertaining to the celebration of its annual fiestas and traditions in the past and of the present will be showcased. The goal is to ignite awareness, interest and sense of pride among the townspeople especially the new generation Betisenos. After several considerations and consensus among the committee’s member, it was decided that the refectory of the church will be converted into a museum.The whole refectory which housed several precious art pieces of the church remained undeveloped for several years since its renovation in the early 20th century; after it was accidentally burned down in 1908. Since then, it has become a storage room for baptismal and wedding records of the church and it was where the valuable 17th century relief wood sculpture of “Matamoros” was hanged on one of the brick posts of the ground floor; the two “Sagrada Familia” oil paintings believed to have been painted by Simón Flores Y de la Rosa which are still found on the south-side of the wall at the second floor; the “Monstrance of Santiago de Galicia” and the few remaining mural paintings of the original ceiling painter of Betis, Macario Ligón Y Nulud. Today, through the support and generosity of the Betis people and the burning passion of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>Committee</b> of 2007 to relive the crowning glory of the past, the ground floor is now transformed into “Museo Ning Betis”.|$|E
