5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E

5000|$|In 1942, at age 19, Jacquet soloed on the Hampton Orchestra's {{recording}} of [...] "Flying Home", one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>times</b> a honking tenor sax was heard on record. The record became a hit. The song immediately became the climax for the live shows and Jacquet became exhausted {{from having to}} [...] "bring down the house" [...] every night. The solo was built to weave {{in and out of}} the arrangement and continued to be played by every saxophone player who followed Jacquet in the band, notably Arnett Cobb and Dexter Gordon, who achieved almost as much fame as Jacquet in playing it. It is one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few jazz solos to have been memorized and played <b>very</b> much <b>the</b> same way by everyone who played the song. He quit the Hampton band in 1943 and joined Cab Calloway's Orchestra. Jacquet appeared with Cab Calloway's band in Lena Horne's movie Stormy Weather. In the earlier years of Jacquet's career, his brother Linton Jacquet managed him on the chitlin circuit Linton's daughter Brenda Jacquet-Ross sang in jazz venues in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1990s to early 2000s, with a band called the Mondo Players.|$|R

40|$|ENGLISH: The {{long-lasting}} episcopate of Aganone (837 - 867), {{a learned}} Frankish bishop strictly {{connected to the}} imperial court and {{to some of the}} most important intellectual of his time, represented a real turning point in Bergamo's history during Early Middle Ages, both in political and social fields, and for a whole regarding cultural expressions. The paper aims at pointing out the connections between the process of the definitive strengthening of Carolingian power in town and the innovations verifiable in the local literacy, which since <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>times</b> of Aganone is characterized by a sudden and uniform adherence to the Caroline minuscule canon, so overcoming the graphic particularism and the cursive writing tendencies of the previous period. The hypothesis that Aganone's and his entourage's installation in Bergamo coincided with the formation of a graphic 'school' (or, at least, with the strong affirmation of an unitary cultural trend) seems to be confirmed by the appearance, in the subscriptions, of notae tachigraphicae and other special chancellery signs, which from bishop's curia will spread later on also among notaries and other outstanding laymen, as a distinctive mark of urban élites...|$|R
40|$|I {{remember}} I {{was quite}} shocked when, one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>times</b> I {{went to the}} MTG, Perfecto Herrera suggested that I work on the automatic identification of versions of musical pieces. I had played versions (both amateur and professionally) since I was 13 but, although being familiar with many MIR tasks, I {{had never thought of}} version identification before. Furthermore, how could they (the MTG people) know that I played song versions? I don’t think I had told them anything about this aspect [...] . Before that meeting with Perfe, I had discussed a few research topics with Xavier Serra and, after he gave me feedback on a number of research proposals I had, I decided to submit one related to the exploitation of the temporal information of music descriptors for music similarity. Therefore, when Perfe suggested the topic of version identification I initially thought that such a suggestion was not related to my proposal at all. However, subsequent meetings with Emilia Gómez and Pedro Cano made me realize that I was wrong, up to the point that if now I had to talk about the work in this thesis I would probabl...|$|R

40|$|The mining {{industry}} produces {{huge amounts of}} waste under the form of mineral sludge, like mature fine tailings issues from the production of bituminous sands. These residues are hard to dry, in relation with their large clay content. This paper gives {{the result of a}} study of filtration under pressure of a sludge containing silt and clay by nonwoven geotextiles (GTX) : 8 different geotextiles were tested with the same sludge containing a high amount of clay. Then 8 different sludge compositions with variable amounts of silt and clay were filtered with a given GTX. The D 50 of the sludge ranged between 3 and 55 µm and the clay content between 0 and 38 %. Results obtained indicate that the sludge can be filtered with GTX chosen based on their opening size. GTX only impact the filtration in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>times</b> when they retain the biggest particles leading to the formation of a filter cake. <b>The</b> filter cake <b>very</b> quickly becomes <b>the</b> filtering element. The GTX function is then reduced to support of the filter cake. The final drying out of the reached during the tests is controlled by the sludge composition and totally independent of the GTX used. L'industrie minière produit d'énormes quantités de déchets sous forme de boue minérale, comme les résidus fins matures issus de l'exploitation des sables bitumineux. Ces boues sont difficiles à assécher de par leur forte argilosité et leur stockage reste complexe à gérer pour des raisons pratiques, économiques et environnementales. Des recherches sont donc initiées pour étudier la possibilité d'utiliser des produits géosynthétiques, et en particulier leur fonction de filtration, pour favoriser l'assèchement de ces boues minières...|$|R

40|$|Classical {{statistics}} and many data mining methods rely on “statistical significance” as a sole criterion for evaluating alternative hypotheses. It is very useful {{to find out}} the significant difference existing between the samples as well as the population or between two samples. But in this paper, the researchers try to apply the concepts of fuzzy group testing of hypothesis problem between multi group of samples of same size or different, through comparing the parameters like mean, standard deviation, and so forth. Hence we can compare multigroups such that they have the significant difference in their mean or standard deviation or other parameters through the fuzzy group testing of multihypotheses. The authors introduced and investigated <b>the</b> concepts <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> through fuzzy analysis that can decide which group(s) or samples can be taken for further investigation and either H 0 is rejected or accepted and hence the next discussion provides the properties of group of samples which may result in the optimized solution for the problem...|$|R

The original 52 H&J theatrical shorts were combined with Gandy Goose, Dinky Duck and Little Roquefort cartoons and repackaged for television. Dick Van Dyke was the original host of the show. The cartoons were later syndicated as The Heckle and Jeckle Cartoon Show, which was broadcast until 1971. A new component added to the '71 show was Possible Possum, a backwoods character whose catchphrase was, [...] "It's possi-boo!" [...] Looking like a relative of Muskie Muskrat from Deputy Dawg, his friends included Billy B'ar, a dim-witted bruin, Macon Mouse, a rodent in a coonskin cap, and Owlawishus Owl, whose windy voice was reminiscent of the Mighty Heroes' Tornado Man. The General, a pipe smoking human friend, ran a store where the crew hung out, and each episode concluded with a short song from Possible.
