25|$|In practice, {{the risk}} of contaminated-{{matching}} {{is much greater than}} matching a distant relative, such as contamination of a sample from nearby objects, or from left-over cells transferred from a prior test. The risk is greater for matching the most common person in the samples: Everything collected from, or in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are typically tested {{in order to ensure that}} they stayed clean, when prepared during the same period as the actual <b>test</b> <b>samples.</b> Unexpected matches (or variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of contamination for the actual <b>test</b> <b>samples.</b> In a relationship test, the full DNA profiles should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person was not actually matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.|$|E

The basic idea of sparse representation-based classification (SRC) method is as follows.

Because the <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> only has bigger coefficients corresponding to some sample category in the aforementioned dictionary representation, the <b>test</b> <b>sample</b> is usually sparse in {{the representation of the}} overcomplete dictionary.

The Panel Test Facility (PTF) uses a unique semielliptic nozzle for testing panel sections. Powered by a 20-MW arc heater, the PTF can perform tests on samples for up to 20 minutes. The Turbulent Flow Duct provides supersonic, turbulent high temperature air flows over flat surfaces. The TFD is powered by a 20-MW Hüls arc heater and can <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> [...] in size. The Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF) has similar characteristics to the IHF arc heater, offering a wide range of operating conditions, samples sizes and extended test times.

A 5-arm model support system allows the user to maximize testing efficiency. The AHF can be configured with either a Hüls or segmented arc heater, up to 20-MW. 1 MW is enough power to supply 750 homes.|$|E
