It was read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. No further action was taken before the 110th Congress adjourned, and the bill died.|$|E

25|$|A {{ballpoint pen}} is a writing {{instrument}} with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber {{is filled with}} a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The first ballpoint pen {{is the creation of}} American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a roller ball <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>up</b> his leather hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the ballpoint pen, it wasn't a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up. Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888. However, it wasn't until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor László Bíró offered an improved version of the ballpoint pen that left paper smudge-free.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach <b>to</b> automated <b>marking</b> <b>up</b> of texts with emotional labels.

A cor-pus of example texts previously annotated by human eval-uators is mined for an initial assignment of emotional fea-tures to words. This results in a List of Emotional Words (LEW) which becomes a useful resource for later automated <b>mark</b> <b>up.</b> An algorithm for the automated <b>mark</b> <b>up</b> of text is proposed. This algorithm employs for the actual assignment of emotional features {{a combination of the}} LEW resource, the ANEW word list, and WordNet for knowledge-based ex-pansion of words not occurring in either. The algorithm for automated <b>mark</b> <b>up</b> is tested against texts from the original samples used for feature extraction to test its correctness and against new text samples to test its coverage. The results and additional techniques and solutions that may be employed to improve the results are discussed...|$|R
