5|$|Given <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of {{contemporaneous}} attestations for Menkauhor, modern Egyptologists {{consider his}} reign {{to have been}} perhaps {{eight or nine years}} long, as indicated by the much later historical sources.|$|E
5|$|Verner's {{arguments}} {{together with}} <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of artefacts attributable to Shepseskare have now convinced many Egyptologists, such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung, that Shepseskare's reign was indeed ephemeral.|$|E
5|$|Civil War tokens are token coins {{that were}} privately minted and {{distributed}} in the United States between 1861 and 1864. They were used mainly in the Northeast and Midwest. The widespread use of the tokens {{was a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of government-issued cents during the Civil War.|$|E
3000|$|As “normal” markets reflect {{relative}} <b>scarcities</b> in prices, <b>the</b> <b>scarcities</b> {{in labor}} markets {{can be seen}} as artefacts of the educational system, license requirements, arrangements of social closure, etc.|$|R

5000|$|According to legend, {{during the}} siege of Bilbao, Carlist general Tomás de Zumalacárregui created the [...] "tortilla de patatas" [...] as an easy, fast and nutritious dish to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>scarcities</b> of <b>the</b> Carlist army. Although it remains unknown whether this is true, it appears the tortilla started to spread during the early Carlist wars.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that human {{resources}} are a pillar of any research and innovation policy, the Medium Term Plan 2011–2015 did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies {{in science and engineering}}. <b>The</b> <b>scarcity</b> of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.|$|E
5|$|In view of <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> {{of sources}} {{concerning}} Shepseskare, nothing {{is known for}} certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely {{a member of the}} royal family, although the possibility that he was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.|$|E
5|$|The {{most urgent}} problem facing the new Emperor was <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of {{resources}} {{left in the}} imperial treasury. Basiliscus was forced to raise heavy taxes, and to revert {{to the practice of}} auctioning the offices, obviously causing a diffuse discontent in the population. He also extorted money from the church, {{with the help of the}} Prefect Epinicus, Verina's long-time favourite.|$|E

30|$|L. Bao and S. Liao's paper {{addresses}} <b>the</b> spectrum <b>scarcity</b> problem {{caused by}} the unbalanced utilization of radio frequency bands in {{the current state of}} wireless spectrum allocations. The paper presents a spectrum-access scheduling to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency in heterogeneous wireless systems. Their simulation results show that spectrum-access scheduling is a feasible and promising approach to handling <b>the</b> spectrum <b>scarcity</b> problem.|$|R

5|$|The {{proposed}} {{capture of}} Triton may explain several {{features of the}} Neptunian system, including the extremely eccentric orbit of Neptune's moon Nereid and <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of moons {{as compared to the}} other giant planets. Triton's initially eccentric orbit would have intersected orbits of irregular moons and disrupted those of smaller regular moons, dispersing them through gravitational interactions.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scarcity</b> of labour and {{abundance}} of land induced a high marginal product of labour. European immigrants (chiefly Italians, Spaniards, French and Germans), tempted {{by the high}} wages, arrived in droves. The government subsidized European immigration {{for a short time}} in the late 1880s, but immigrants arrived in massive numbers even with no subsidy.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of {{inhabitants}} in the Rhondda {{prior to}} industrialisation, {{there are few}} residents of note before the valleys became a coal mining area. The earliest individuals {{to come to the}} fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found {{a way out of the}} Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E

50|$|The {{numbers of}} creameries {{increased}} substantially by 1900, {{and by the}} eve of World War I, the country counted nearly 800 plants. In spite of <b>the</b> <b>scarcities,</b> political unrest and violent incidents, the World War I era had been a prosperous period for farmers. The crisis in the country's agricultural market following the war led to {{a large number of}} creameries to shut down.|$|R
5|$|In the post-apocalyptic environment, {{ammunition}} is a {{rare and}} essential commodity. Pre-apocalypse, military-grade ammunition is used as currency. Players can avoid consuming all the valuable currency by using lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is scavenging. The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and other items. The military-grade ammunition {{can be used to}} purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. Weapon attachments, such as scopes and silencers, which improve weapon efficiency, can be purchased with these bullets.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{research}} on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, {{partly because of the}} variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospels.|$|E
5|$|More than 500 Birmingham {{players have}} {{appeared}} in such matches but failed to reach the 25-match milestone. In the early days, <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of nationally organised competitive football meant players could spend many years with the club while making few such outings. Brothers Fred, Tommy and Arthur James, who was the club captain from 1878 to 1885, were founder members of Small Heath Alliance but made only 24 appearances between them.|$|E

5|$|NYU {{students}} also compete in club and intramural sports, including badminton, baseball, basketball, crew, cycling, equestrianism, ice hockey, lacrosse, martial arts, rugby, softball, squash, tennis, triathlon, and ultimate. The Coles Sports and Recreation Center {{serves as the}} home base of several of NYU's intercollegiate athletic teams. Many of NYU's varsity teams play their games at various facilities and fields throughout Manhattan because of <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of space for playing fields near campus. In 2002, NYU opened the Palladium Athletic Facility as the second on-campus recreational facility.|$|E
5|$|Owing to <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of {{artefacts}} and inscriptions {{relating to}} Menkauhor's reign, {{few of his}} activities are known. Menkauhor sent an expedition to Sinai to exploit the mines of turquoise and copper in the Wadi Maghareh. The expedition is evidenced by a damaged rock inscription showing Menkauhor's titulary {{which is one of}} the few attestations dating to his lifetime. The mines of Sinai had been exploited since the Third Dynasty (2686 BC–2613 BC), and both Menkauhor's predecessor Nyuserre Ini and successor Djedkare Isesi sent expeditions to the Wadi Maghareh.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, {{when there were}} only two major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, is not well understood, largely due to <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of {{appropriate}} fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, Dwyer {{released}} an untitled EP {{under the name}} ///▲▲▲\\\ on the American label Disaro Records, which was limited to run of fifty hand-numbered CD-Rs.

5|$|The Boers {{enclosed}} Ladysmith on 2 November, {{beginning a}} 118-day siege. The King's, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Llewelyn Mellor, became {{assigned to the}} north-eastern defensive sector under Colonel Knox, a disciplinarian who instituted a programme of fortification development in his area. Construction of the defences occurred mostly at night, although rain, oppressive heat, and cold limited the opportunity to rest. On 6 January, the King's mounted infantry helped repulse a Boer attempt to penetrate the southern perimeter. By late January, <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of supplies had become particularly acute. Disease pervaded while the town resorted to consuming the garrison's horses and mules.|$|E
5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an {{environmental}} movement {{that calls for}} all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that {{a decrease in the}} human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{forms of}} the glyphs are {{standardized}} contours of living organisms and geometric designs about one centimeter high. The wooden tablets are irregular in shape and, in many instances, fluted (tablets B, E, G, H, O, Q, and possibly T), with the glyphs carved in shallow channels running {{the length of the}} tablets, {{as can be seen in}} the image of tablet G at right. It is thought that irregular and often blemished pieces of wood were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to <b>the</b> <b>scarcity</b> of wood on the island.|$|E
