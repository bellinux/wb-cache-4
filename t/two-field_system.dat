50|$|From {{the end of}} the Middle Ages {{until the}} 20th century, Europe's farmers practised three-field rotation, {{dividing}} available lands into three parts. One section was planted in the autumn with rye or winter wheat, followed by spring oats or barley; the second section grew crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third field was left fallow. The three fields were rotated in this manner so that every three years, a field would rest and be fallow. Under the <b>two-field</b> <b>system,</b> if one has a total of 600 acre of fertile land, one would only plant 300 acres. Under the new three-field rotation system, one would plant (and therefore harvest) 400 acres. But the additional crops had a more significant effect than mere quantitative productivity. Since the spring crops were mostly legumes, they increased the overall nutrition of the people of Northern Europe.|$|E

50|$|As the 10th century came around, Europe {{began to}} {{flourish}} again. Technological advancements came about such as crop rotation, which developed from a <b>two-field</b> <b>system</b> to a three-field system. This meant {{that instead of}} leaving half of their fields alone to regain nutrients over the year, serf farmers left a third. Additionally, {{the application of the}} moldboard plow in the 9th century helped cultivation. With Vikings beginning to settle down (a prime example {{can be seen in the}} Duchy of Normandy), their long-term effects began to be felt. Additionally, trade began start again, the population grew, and urban as well as agricultural expansion occurred. Merchants and craftsmen reappeared, and cathedral-based schools began to spread. In England, the gradual unification of the small Anglo-Saxon kingdoms into the Kingdom of England was completed in 927 by King Æthelstan. King Otto I of Germany was crowned as the first legitimate Holy Roman Emperor in 962 by the Pope, this time establishing the Holy Roman Empire. This basically comprised the same state as the Kingdom of Germany, only with some extra holdings such as northern Italy.|$|E

After setting up a completely general formalism using the mass basis, which naturally accommodates the notion of light and heavy modes, we study in detail the simple case of two successive turns in <b>two-field</b> <b>system.</b> We find the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation receives corrections that exhibit oscillatory features sinusoidal in the logarithm of the comoving wavenumber without slow-roll suppression.

Numerical results of the fully non-linear second-order model are in very good agreement with the theoretically predicted distances.

40|$|A disformal {{coupling}} {{between two}} scalar fields is {{considered in the}} context of cosmological inflation. The coupling introduces novel derivative interactions mixing the kinetic terms of the fields but without introducing superluminal or unstable propagation of the two scalar fluctuation modes. Though the typical effect of the disformal coupling is to inhibit one of the fields from inflating the universe, the energy density of the other field can drive viable near Sitter -inflation in the presence of nontrivial disformal dynamics, in particular when one assumes exponential instead of power-law form for the couplings. The linear perturbation equations are written for the <b>two-field</b> <b>system,</b> its canonical degrees of freedom are quantised, their spectra are derived and the inflationary predictions are reported for numerically solved exponential models.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} phase field model for proppant-filled {{fractures}} in a poroelastic medium. The formulation of the coupled system involves four unknowns; displacements, phase field, pressure, and proppant concentration. The <b>two-field</b> displacement phase-field <b>system</b> is solved fully-coupled and accounts for crack irreversibility. This solution is than coupled to the pressure equation via a fixed-stress iteration. The pressure is obtained by using a diffraction equation where the phase-field variable serves as an indicator function that distinguishes between the fracture and the reservoir. The transport of the proppant in the fracture is modeled by using a power-law fluid system. The numerical discretization in space is based on Galerkin finite elements for displacements and phase-field, and an enriched Galerkin method is applied for the pressure equation {{in order to obtain}} local mass conservation. The concentration is solved with cell-centered finite elements. Nonlinear equations are treated with Newton's method. Our developments are substantiated with several numerical examples in two and three dimensions...|$|R
50|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the open}} field system had {{initially}} used a <b>two-field</b> crop rotation <b>system</b> where one field was left fallow or turned into pasture {{for a time}} to try to recover some of its plant nutrients. Later they employed a three-year, three field crop rotation routine, with a different crop in each of two fields, e.g. oats, rye, wheat, and barley with the second field growing a legume like peas or beans, and the third field fallow. Normally from 10-30% of the arable land in a three crop rotation system is fallow. Each field was rotated into a different crop nearly every year. Over the following two centuries, the regular planting of legumes such as peas and beans in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the fertility of some croplands. The planting of legumes helped to increase plant growth in the empty field due to the bacteria on legume roots' ability to fix nitrogen (N2) from the air into the soil {{in a form that}} plants could use. Other crops that were occasionally grown were flax and members of the mustard family.|$|R
40|$|For a {{prescribed}} porosity, the coupled magma/mantle flow equations can be formulated as a <b>two-field</b> <b>system</b> of equations with velocity and pressure as unknowns. Previous work {{has shown that}} while optimal preconditioners for the two-field formulation can be obtained, the construction of preconditioners that are uniform with respect to model parameters is difficult. This limits the applicability of two-field preconditioners in certain regimes of practical interest. We address this issue by reformulating the governing equations as a three-field problem, which removes a term that was problematic in the two-field formulation in favour of an additional equation for a pressure-like field. For the three-field problem, we develop and analyse new preconditioners and we show numerically that they are optimal in terms of problem size and less sensitive to model parameters, compared to the two-field preconditioner. This extends the applicability of optimal preconditioners for coupled mantle/magma dynamics into parameter regimes of physical interest.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{properties of}} a model of dark energy in which two scalar fields are coupled by a non-canonical kinetic term are studied. We show that overall {{the addition of the}} coupling has only minor effects on the dynamics of the <b>two-field</b> <b>system</b> for both potentials studied, even preserving many of the features of the assisted quintessence scenario. The coupling of the kinetic terms enlarges the regions of stability of the critical points. When the potential is of an additive form, we find the kinetic coupling has an interesting effect on the dynamics of the fields as they approach the inflationary attractor, with the result that the combined equation of state of the scalar fields can approach - 1 during the transition from a matter dominated universe to the recent period of acceleration.

40|$|A vertex centred Jameson–Schmidt–Turkel (JST) {{finite volume}} {{algorithm}} was recently {{introduced by the}} authors (Aguirre et al., 2014 [1]) {{in the context of}} fast solid isothermal dynamics. The spatial discretisation scheme was constructed upon a Lagrangian two-field mixed (linear momentum and the deformation gradient) formulation presented as a system of conservation laws [2], [3] and [4]. In this paper, the formulation is further enhanced by introducing a novel upwind vertex centred finite volume algorithm with three key novelties. First, a conservation law for the volume map is incorporated into the existing <b>two-field</b> <b>system</b> to extend the range of applications towards the incompressibility limit (Gil et al., 2014 [5]). Second, the use of a linearised Riemann solver and reconstruction limiters is derived for the stabilisation of the scheme together with an efficient edge-based implementation. Third, the treatment of thermo-mechanical processes through a Mie–Grüneisen equation of state is incorporated in the proposed formulation. For completeness, the study of the eigenvalue structure of the resulting system of conservation laws is carried out to demonstrate hyperbolicity and obtain the correct time step bounds for non-isothermal processes. A series of numerical examples are presented in order to assess the robustness of the proposed methodology. The overall scheme shows excellent behaviour in shock and bending dominated nearly incompressible scenarios without spurious pressure oscillations, yielding second order of convergence for both velocities and stresses...|$|E
40|$|We study {{dynamics}} of entropy perturbations in the two-field assisted dark energy model. Based on the scenario of assisted dark energy, {{in which one}} scalar field is subdominant compared with {{the other in the}} early epoch, we show that the entropy perturbations in this <b>two-field</b> <b>system</b> tend to be constant on large scales in the early epoch and hence survive until the present era for a generic evolution of both fields during the radiation and matter eras. This behaviour of the entropy perturbations is preserved even when the fields are coupled via kinetic interaction. Since, for assisted dark energy, the subdominant field in the early epoch becomes dominant at late time, the entropy perturbations can significantly influence the {{dynamics of}} density perturbations in the universe. Assuming correlations between the entropy and curvature perturbations, the entropy perturbations can enhance the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect if the signs of the contributions from entropy perturbations and curvature perturbations are opposite after the matter era, otherwise the ISW contribution is suppressed. For canonical scalar field the effect of entropy perturbations on ISW effect is small because the initial value of the entropy perturbations estimated during inflation cannot be sufficiently large. However, in the case of k-essence, the initial value of the entropy perturbations can be large enough to affect the ISW effect to leave a significant imprint on the CMB power spectrum.

40|$|The {{existence}} of {{dark energy in}} the universe is hypothesized to explain the accelerated expansion of today’s universe and the inflationary expansion of very early universe; accelerated expansion of today’s universe is proved by observational data gathered from ground-based and space telescopes, from type Ia supernovas; and inflation of the early universe is assumed to solve issues of the Big Bang theory, for instance, flatness problem, and isotropy and homogeneity of the universe in large scale. There are different models of dark energy; the first and simplest one, is cosmological constant (or vaccum energy), that is constant {{all the time and}} space; the others are quintessential models which are dynamics, evolving and they can be inhomogeneous. In this thesis, two different quintessential models of dark energy, scalar field and non-metric quintessence, have been studied. Chapter one of this thesis is a brief review of general relativity and cosmology; in this chapter the need for a field which provides negative pressure and accelerates the expansion of our universe is discussed. Chapter two, is the study of the equations of motion of scalar field with exponential potential. In this chapter I’ve studied the equilibrium points of the phase plots found from the dynamics of dimensionless variables of the scalar field. Then I’ve solved the equations of the evolution of a universe, filled with scalar field and background fluids, numerically. Plots of the evolution of density parameters found from this model show that this model with exponential potential, is not consistent with our universe. In chapter three, equations of motion of a <b>two-field</b> <b>system</b> (scalar matter field with a power-law potential and graviscalar field), are derived from the lagrangian defining non-metric quintessence. I’ve found the phase plots of the system, and solved the equations of the evolution of a universe, filled with this two-field and background fluids (dark matter, baryonic matter and radiation), numerically. plots of the evolution of density parameters, are very compatible with the real picture {{of the history of the}} universe; and today’s values of density parameters and Hubble parameter, age of the universe and the size of particle horizon, found from this model, are very close to their measured values (and sometimes the same as measured values). Although this model is very compatible with our universe, it doesn’t explain inflation; and <b>two-field</b> <b>system</b> is in fact one scalar matter field. In order to explain the inflation of the early universe, I decided to define a hybrid potential of scalar matter field, that is discussed very briefly in chapter four. Hybrid potential is a combination of exponential (gaussian) and power-law potential; its exponential part dominates early universe and it can explain inflation, and power-law part of the hybrid potential is a good alternative for dark energy. The plots found from the numerical solution of the system of equations of dimensionless variables, are very compatible with the real history of our universe; and today’s values of density parameters of dark energy, dark matter, baryonic matter, and Hubble parameter, and the age and size of our universe, found from this model, are very close to (and some times the same as) measured values. I found more compatible answers assuming that radiation dominates our universe at a very early stage and later on, exponential potential dominates and causes rapid expansion of the early universe...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{transformation}} process currently taking place in the energy production sector, energy gained from renewable power sources shall replace the present mixture, which mostly relies on fossil burnings. Therefore, in the future most of the energy shall be gained by harvesting power from sun, wind or water, geothermal heat or biomass. In case of converting energy from wind into electrical power wind turbines are used in general, while hydropower turbines are the state-of-the-art machinery to derive energy from running water. In order to convert the potential energy from running water as well water wheels pose the method of choice. Turbines in air or water represent mechanically a <b>two-field</b> <b>system,</b> in which the structure of the turbine is surrounded by a streaming fluid. Due to the elasticity of the rotor blades the stresses of the fluid onto the structure deform the blades, which in return yield a time-dependent flow domain. Therefore turbines in a streaming fluid represent a typical example of fluid-structure interaction. Furthermore, in case of water wheels the surrounding air as third field and additional fluid phase comes into play introducing a free surface. In this contribution the governing equations of incompressible fluid flow are presented using primal variables and discretised via the space-time finite element method [3]. The discretised model equations of the fluid are stabilised using an SUPG/PSPG approach. Shape and test functions are continuous within the space-time slabs, while across the space- time slabs the shape and test functions are continuous only in space, but discontinuous in time yielding a time-discontinuous Galerkin approach. Due to the moving rotor blades a mesh moving technique needs to be incorporated into the computational set-up. Considering the occurring large but regular displacements of the flow boundary arising from the rotating rotor blades the shear-slip mesh update method (SSMUM) [1] as discontinuous mesh moving technique is applied. In case of water wheels the free surface is described implicitly via a Level-Set function [2] yielding a single fluid phase with almost discontinuous density and viscosity. The verification and validation of the developed numerical scheme is carried out with the help of computing classical benchmark problems as well as via a comparison to existing experimental data...|$|E
