40|$|ABSTRACT Integrity {{maintenance}} {{methods have}} been defined for preventing updates from violating integrity constraints. Depending on the update, the full check for constraint satisfaction is reduced <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> certain instances of some relevant constraints only. In {{the first part of}} the paper new ideas are proposed for enhancing the efficiency of such a method. The second part is devoted <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> constraint satisfiability, i. e., whether a database exists in which all constraints are simultaneously satisfied. A satisfiability checking method is presented that employs integrity maintenance techniques. Simple Prolog programs are given that serve both as specifications as well as a basis for an efficient implementation. ...|$|R
