R Aurigae, with a period of 457.5 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 13.9 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 6.7. UV Aurigae, with a period of 394.4 days, ranges in magnitude from a minimum of 10.6 <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 7.4.

5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E

This sweep of awards in major categories at Cannes was extremely rare, and some critics felt the jury was too generous {{to the exclusion of}} other worthy entries. Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films, Cannes decided after the 1991 festival to limit each movie <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of two awards.|$|E
5|$|During December 1965, more {{submarine}} activity occurred 0.9km (0.56mi) {{southwest of}} Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, {{and over the}} following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> size of 70m (230ft) in height, covering an area of , during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.|$|E

A captive male sired offspring at age 19. In the wild, sea otters live <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> age of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10–15 years for males and 15–20 years for females.

Sea otters in the wild often develop worn teeth, which may account for their apparently shorter lifespans.|$|E
5|$|France also {{committed}} military {{assets to}} the coalition; in October 1990, eight Jaguar A aircraft {{along with several}} Dassault Mirage F1CR reconnaissance aircraft {{were sent to the}} Middle East, with the Mirages, which had more advanced avionics, acting as guides for the Jaguars. Owing to obsolete navigational systems being unable to provide the accuracy required, both French and British Jaguars were quickly modified with GPS receivers, RAF Tornadoes also required adaption to a lesser extent. The French Jaguar force in Saudi Arabia built up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>maximum</b> of 28 aircraft, which carried out 615 combat sorties, with one Jaguar damaged by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile. Typical targets were Iraqi armoured units, Scud missile sites, and naval vessels.|$|E
