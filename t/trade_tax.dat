He was a long-time {{proponent of the}} flat tax. He also defended the use of anti-Communist contra forces in Central America, supported the gold standard, spoke for civil rights legislation, opposed abortion, {{and was the first}} lawmaker to popularize enterprise zones, which he supported to foster entrepreneurship and job creation and expand homeownership among public housing tenants. During his career, he sometimes sounded like a liberal Democrat: he supported affirmative action and rights for illegal immigrants. [...] The New York Times described Kemp as the most proactive combatant in the war on poverty since Robert Kennedy. He differed from Rockefeller Republicans and earlier combatants such as Lyndon Johnson by supporting incentive-based systems instead of traditional social programs. For his commitment to inner city concerns from within the Republican party, David Gergen heralded him as a [...] "courageous voice in the wilderness." [...] Although he was liberal on many social issues and supported civil liberties for homosexuals, he opposed certain gay rights such as the right to teach in schools.

40|$|In {{the classic}} {{analysis}} of smuggling importers choose the optimal mix {{of legal and}} illegal <b>trade,</b> given <b>trade</b> <b>taxes</b> and the technology of detection. This paper introduces an inconvertible currency in the framework, so that illegal trade is valued at a rate higher than the (fixed) official exchange rate. Sections 1 and 2 show how the smuggling ratio and the domestic price markup for the import and export good are simultaneously determined. With balanced legal and illegal trade, changes in the (long-run) black market premium are a weighted average of changes in <b>trade</b> <b>taxes,</b> whereas changes in the smuggling ratios depend on the ratio of <b>trade</b> <b>taxes.</b> Thus, an import tariff and an export subsidy rising {{at the same rate}} would keep smuggling ratios constant but imply a rising black market premium (section 3 and 4). To determine the quantity of exports and imports, a model of the economy is presented in section 5, featuring the production of exports and non-traded goods and the consumption of imports and non-traded goods, as well as a government confiscating the amounts of traded goods unsuccessfully smuggled. Then export production may fall, and welfare may rise, if <b>trade</b> <b>taxes</b> {{have a negative effect on}} the relative price of exports and imports stronger than the positive effect on smuggled exports and imports, which is always welfare-reducing. Section 6 introduces the short-run determination of the black market premium via portfolio balance. In this case, rising rade taxes may be associated with a premium rising even faster if there is unreported capital flight and conversely. ...|$|R
