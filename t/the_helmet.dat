5|$|On 7 October 2010, <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> {{was sold}} at Christie's for £2.3million (US$3.6million) to an {{undisclosed}} private buyer. Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery in Carlisle sought to purchase <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> {{with the support}} of the British Museum but was outbid. <b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> has so far been publicly displayed twice, once in a 2012 exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, and again at Tullie House in 2013–14.|$|E
5|$|The United States, Canada and Germany, {{together}} with two unnamed teams, lodged a protest with officials following Williams' successful {{first day of}} competition. The protest alleged that her helmet was illegal, as ridges in it might give her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. In accordance with competition rules, the jury of officials inspected <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> and rejected the protest. Their grounds for doing so were that the ridges in <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> were not a separate piece affixed to <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> expressly banned by FIBT rules, but rather {{an integral part of}} <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> which made <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> legal. A second protest, filed jointly by the US and Canada on the 19th, was also rejected.|$|E
5|$|A valve ejected due to {{incompatible}} thread (metric valve in imperial cylinder) injured commercial diver by {{impact on}} the back of <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> during preparations for a dive. Cylinder had been under pressure for several days following hydrostatic testing, and no particular triggering event was identified. Diver was knocked down and bruised but protected from serious injury by <b>the</b> <b>helmet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After {{leaving the}} Dodgers, Rickey {{was offered the}} {{position}} of general manager for the Pittsburgh Pirates. During the 1953 season, the Pirates became {{the first team to}} permanently adopt batting helmets on both offense and defense. These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass [...] "miner's cap". This was the mandate of Rickey, who also owned stock in the company producing <b>the</b> <b>helmets.</b> Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear <b>the</b> <b>helmets</b> both at bat and in <b>the</b> field. <b>The</b> <b>helmets</b> became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of helmets on defense, partly because of their awkwardly heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded <b>the</b> <b>helmets</b> on defense, <b>the</b> trend disappeared from the game.|$|R
50|$|Only three Roman helmets with a {{covering}} over the face {{have been found}} in Britain. Prior to the 2010 discovery of <b>the</b> Crosby Garrett <b>Helmet</b> and <b>the</b> 1905 discovery of <b>the</b> Newstead <b>Helmet</b> this helmet was described as <b>the</b> highest quality <b>helmet</b> found. <b>The</b> Ribchester <b>helmet</b> was found corroded but, like <b>the</b> Newstead <b>helmet,</b> largely complete, whereas <b>the</b> Crosby Garret <b>helmet</b> was found in 67 fragments.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Hadfield steel used in <b>the</b> British Brodie <b>helmet,</b> <b>the</b> Germans used a harder martensitic silicon/nickel steel. As a result, and also due to <b>the</b> <b>helmet's</b> form, <b>the</b> Stahlhelm had to be formed in heated dies at a greater unit cost than <b>the</b> British <b>helmet,</b> which could be formed in one piece.|$|R
5|$|Although it {{was found}} {{shattered}} into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded, <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design. It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes. It would {{have been used by}} a Roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle. The identity of the owner is not known but <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It is possible that <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the conquest of Britain.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the only}} Roman helmet ever found in Britain that still has most of its silver-gilt plating attached. <b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> would {{originally}} have had two cheekpieces attached via holes in front of its ear guards. It has a prominent browguard, the shape of {{which is similar to}} that of the 3rd-century Guisborough Helmet, discovered in 1864 near Guisborough in Redcar and Cleveland. The rear of <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> bowl descended to form a neckguard.|$|E
5|$|Leicester County Council {{was able}} to raise £1 million to buy the entire hoard and pay for the {{conservation}} of <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> with the assistance of donations from the Heritage Lottery Fund (which gave a £650,000 grant), the Art Fund and other trusts and charities. <b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> was valued at £300,000; {{under the terms of the}} Treasure Act, Ken Wallace and the landowner were each awarded £150,000.|$|E

5|$|The finder {{discovered}} <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> and visor buried {{together some}} 25cm (10in) below the surface, {{at a site}} located on a ledge {{at the lower end}} of the settlement. It had been placed onto two stone slabs at the bottom of a hole which had been back-filled with soil. A stone cap had been laid on top. <b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> was found in 33 large fragments and 34 small fragments and had apparently been folded before burial. The visor was mostly intact and had been placed face down. The griffin had become detached and was found with <b>the</b> <b>helmet.</b> No other artefacts were found at the time, but the subsequent Tullie House/PAS excavations at the findspot discovered a number of copper and iron objects, a bead and two Roman coins dating to 330–337. The coins were found within the artificial stone feature in which <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> had been deposited and may have been buried at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher, in {{conjunction}} with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon helmet. In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact. <b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> keeps the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett Helmet is {{a copper}} alloy Roman cavalry helmet {{dating from the}} late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. It was found by an unnamed metal detectorist near Crosby Garrett in Cumbria, England, in May 2010. Later {{investigations}} found that a Romano-British farming settlement had occupied the site where <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> was discovered, which was located {{a few miles away}} from a Roman road and a Roman army fort. It is possible that the owner of <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> was a local inhabitant who had served with the Roman cavalry.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Revolution <b>helmet</b> was {{conceived}} {{in an attempt}} {{to reduce the risk of}} head injuries such as concussions. What research has been done on <b>the</b> <b>helmet's</b> efficacy so far has been inconclusive.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{construction}} {{principle is}} found <b>the</b> Northern ridge <b>helmets,</b> a group, which includes Scandinavian Vendel Era helmets and Anglo-Saxon <b>helmets,</b> like <b>the</b> Coppergate <b>Helmet</b> or <b>the</b> Pioneer <b>Helmet.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. <b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, and at some point <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens {{faced the}} Patriots in week {{six of the}} 2010 season. The Patriots ended up winning 23–20 in overtime; the game caused {{controversy}} from a hit to <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> of tight end Todd Heap by Patriots safety Brandon Meriweather.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> {{was put on}} {{permanent}} {{public display}} {{at the end of}} January 2012 at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough, nine miles from the site where the hoard was found, alongside other objects found at Hallaton.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1953 season, the Pirates {{became the}} first team to {{permanently}} adopt batting helmets on both offense and defense. These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass [...] "miner's cap". This was the mandate of general manager Branch Rickey, who also owned stock in the company producing <b>the</b> <b>helmets.</b> Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear <b>the</b> <b>helmets</b> both at bat and in <b>the</b> field. <b>The</b> <b>helmets</b> became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of <b>helmets</b> in <b>the</b> field, partly because of their awkward and heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded <b>the</b> <b>helmets</b> on defense, <b>the</b> trend disappeared from the game. In 2014, Major League Baseball allowed pitchers to choose to wear a padded hat that aims to combine the added safety of a <b>helmet</b> with <b>the</b> comfort of a baseball cap. The cap would prove widely unpopular, with only Alex Torres of the New York Mets choosing to wear it.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> was too fragile to be {{excavated}} in situ so it {{was removed}} within a block of earth held together with plaster of Paris. It {{was taken to the}} British Museum in London for conservation, which took nine years of work by conservator Marilyn Hockey and her colleagues Fleur Shearman and Duygu Çamurcuoğlu. Corrosion and the effects of time had shattered <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> into thousands of pieces, most of which were smaller than the nail on a person's little finger. The reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in January 2012.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the find}} was {{reported}} under the Portable Antiquities Scheme, {{it was not}} declared treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act because single items of non-precious metal {{are not covered by}} the act. The finder and landowner were thus free to dispose of <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> as they saw fit. The discovery was publicly announced by Christie's in mid-September 2010; <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> was the centrepiece of its 7 October auction catalogue, featuring on the cover and six more pages. Its value was put at £200,000 – £300,000 ($309,200 – $463,800). The Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery launched an appeal with the aim of purchasing <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> and making it the focus of a new Roman frontier gallery due to open in 2011. The campaign immediately attracted numerous donations, including £50,000 from an anonymous overseas benefactor who offered the sum if a matching sum could be raised by the public (it was); a £1 million offer from the National Heritage Memorial Fund; a £300,000 pledge from the Headley Trust and the Monument Trust; £200,000 from the Art Fund; and £75,000 from the J Paul Getty Jr Charitable Trust. By the time of the auction three and a half weeks after the campaign had been launched, the museum had raised enough money to support a bid of up to £1.7 million. Behind the scenes, efforts were made to persuade the finder and landowner to agree a private sale with the museum, but these approaches failed.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> PASGT <b>helmet</b> was {{developed}} after the Vietnam War in 1975 and replaced <b>the</b> steel M1 <b>helmet</b> in U.S. military service during the 1980s. It first saw use in combat in 1983 during Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada, and became standard {{issue for the}} U.S. military in 1985, and completely replaced <b>the</b> M1 <b>helmet</b> for frontline troops {{by the end of}} the decade. Soldiers stationed in Alaska were some of the last to receive <b>the</b> <b>helmets,</b> some not getting the PASGT until 1988.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> SPECTRA <b>helmet</b> or CGF Gallet Combat <b>Helmet</b> is <b>the</b> {{ballistic}} <b>helmet</b> in use [...] in the French military, and {{the armies}} of several other countries. Built by CGF Gallet (producer of <b>the</b> F1 <b>helmet</b> for firemen), it weighs 1.4 kg, is available in three sizes, and is made from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene Spectra fibers, produced under license from Honeywell. <b>The</b> SPECTRA <b>helmet</b> can stop shell fragments of 1.1 g travelling at 680 m/s, an 80% improvement over <b>the</b> Modèle 1978 <b>helmet</b> it replaced.|$|R
2500|$|Whatever its Anglo-Saxon or Scandinavian origins, <b>the</b> Sutton Hoo <b>helmet</b> is {{descended from}} <b>the</b> Roman <b>helmets</b> of <b>the</b> {{fourth and fifth}} century Constantinian workshops. Numerous examples, such as <b>the</b> <b>helmets</b> from Deurne, Concești, Augsburg-Pfersee, and Augst, and the Berkasovo 1 and 2 and Intercisa 2 and 4 <b>helmets,</b> suggest <b>the</b> Roman stock to be the {{progenitors}} for the prominent crest on <b>the</b> Sutton Hoo <b>helmet.</b> <b>The</b> Berkasovo 1 and Budapest helmets further demonstrate [...] "encrustation with precious or semi-precious stones," [...] a possible origin for the Sutton Hoo garnets.|$|R
5|$|The Gevninge helmet {{fragment}} is {{what remains}} of a Danish helmet from the Viking Age or end of the Nordic Iron Age. Made of gilded bronze, it consists of a stylised eyebrow above an oval with eyelashes, and originally formed the right eyepiece of <b>the</b> <b>helmet.</b> Three holes {{on the top and}} {{on the bottom of the}} fragment would have once held it in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of a shield, a crest, and a motto, together with a helmet. The shield contains an eagle, symbolic of the heavenly vision, with a cross on its breast to indicate Christianity as {{the inspiration for the}} university's vision. The chief of the shield bears an open book, a common symbol of learning, with a maple leaf on each side, signifying that McMaster's charter was granted by the Province of Ontario. <b>The</b> <b>helmet,</b> above the shield, has the open visor and forward-facing style typically used by universities. The mantling surrounding the shield and helmet represents the cloak worn over a knight's armour as protection from the sun. The crest, located above <b>the</b> <b>helmet,</b> is a stag and oak tree, which serves as a tribute to the Canadian Senator, William McMaster, who also used a stag and oak on his insignias. The motto is located above the crest, as is common in Scottish heraldry.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>helmet</b> and visor {{were cast}} from an alloy {{consisting}} {{of an average}} of 82% copper, 10% zinc and 8% tin. This alloy was probably derived from melted-down scrap brass with a low zinc content, with which some tin had been added {{to improve the quality}} of the casting. Some of the fragments show traces of a white metal coating, indicating that the visor would originally have been tinned to give the appearance of silver. The griffin was cast separately from a different alloy consisting of 68% copper, 4% zinc, 18% tin and 10% lead. The visor would originally have been a silver hue and <b>the</b> <b>helmet</b> would have had a coppery yellow appearance. The helmet's creation can be dated to the late 2nd or early 3rd century from the use of a particular type of decorated rivet as well as some of its design features, such as its pierced eyes.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{evidence}} that several early National Football League teams wore <b>the</b> winged <b>helmet.</b> <b>The</b> New York Giants wore {{an early version}} of <b>the</b> winged <b>helmet</b> in 1930-1931. <b>The</b> Chicago Bears used <b>the</b> winged <b>helmet</b> in 1931 and 1932. The Frankford Yellow Jackets wore <b>the</b> winged <b>helmet</b> in 1931 before the franchise folded due to the Great Depression. The Yellow Jackets successors, the Philadelphia Eagles, used the Yellow Jackets old uniforms (including <b>the</b> winged <b>helmets)</b> for their first two seasons in the NFL, and would later use replicas as a throwback uniform during the 2007 season. The short-lived Cincinnati Reds also used a winged <b>helmet</b> in 1933. <b>The</b> Pittsburgh Pirates (now the Pittsburgh Steelers) wore <b>the</b> winged <b>helmet</b> in 1935 and 1936. Finally, the Giants would wear <b>the</b> winged <b>helmet</b> again from 1937 to 1947, making them the last NFL team to wear <b>the</b> winged <b>helmet</b> on a regular basis as well as the last NFL team to wear them in any occasion until the Eagles wore the Yellow Jackets throwbacks in 2007. As well, the British Columbia Lions of the CFL used a winged helmet in 1960 and 1961.|$|R
50|$|Before the season, {{the team}} changed from white helmets and powder blue jerseys—which it had had since its {{inception}} in 1960—to royal blue helmets and jerseys. Players' uniform numbers were also removed from <b>the</b> <b>helmets.</b> <b>The</b> royal blue would remain through 1984, when <b>the</b> <b>helmets</b> and jerseys became a darker shade of blue; that blue became even darker in 1988. The Chargers switched back permanently to modified white helmets in 2007.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Attic <b>helmet</b> {{was similar}} to <b>the</b> Chalcidian <b>helmet</b> but lacked a nose guard. Although in Greece itself its use was not as {{widespread}} as the Corinthian or Phrygian types, <b>the</b> Attic <b>helmet</b> became very popular in Italy, where most examples have been found. Many Italian peoples used variations of <b>the</b> attic <b>helmet,</b> but archaeologically it has been especially prominent in Samnite and Lucanian burials and their associated art (frescos etc.).|$|R
