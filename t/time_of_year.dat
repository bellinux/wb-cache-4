5|$|The sunniest <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> {{tends to}} be between May and August. The {{south-western}} coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually. Wales' sunniest town is Tenby, Pembrokeshire. The dullest <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> {{tends to be}} between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually.|$|E
5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections {{from the rear of}} aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} colonies {{of up to}} 5000 birds. Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur at any <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food.|$|E
5|$|Mistle thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together in late summer, and groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds; {{it is not uncommon for}} up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Most lionesses {{will have}} {{reproduced}} {{by the time}} they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at any specific <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> and the females are polyestrous. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.|$|E

5|$|Public {{severe weather}} outlooks (PWO) are issued when a {{significant}} or widespread outbreak is expected, especially for tornadoes. From November to March, {{it can also}} be issued for any threat of significant tornadoes in the nighttime hours, noting the lower awareness and greater danger of tornadoes at that <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tasmanian forms {{have been}} shown to be frost {{tolerant}} at any <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> which might explain some of their success in spreading and growing in different habitats around the island. This attribute might have allowed them to survive cold periods in Tasmania in the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The 1953 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active season on record. The season officially began on May 15 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the central northern Pacific. They ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data prior to that time on Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable as most east Pacific storms are of no threat to land.|$|E
50|$|Recreational {{fishing in}} the lake and in the outlet stream is {{permitted}} at certain <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> Animals in the area include marmots.|$|R

5|$|The dial of the Zytglogge's {{astronomical clock}} is {{built in the}} form of an astrolabe. It is backed by a stereographically {{projected}} planisphere divided into three zones: the black night sky, the deep blue zone of dawn and the light blue day sky. The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the horizon, dawn, the tropics and the temporal hours, which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{classified}} as a supercell following further analysis of its erratic nature and extreme attributes. During the event, the Bureau of Meteorology was constantly surprised by the frequent changes in direction, {{as well as the}} severity of the hail and the duration of the storm. The event was also unique as the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> and general conditions in the region were not seen as conducive for extreme storm cell formation.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{are most}} common in spring and least common in winter, but tornadoes can occur any <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> that {{favorable}} conditions occur. Spring and fall experience peaks of activity as those are the seasons when stronger winds, wind shear, and atmospheric instability are present. Tornadoes are focused in the right front quadrant of landfalling tropical cyclones, which tend {{to occur in the}} late summer and autumn. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of eyewall mesovortices, which persist until landfall.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other snakes, Naja nigricollis can {{be either}} nocturnal or diurnal {{depending}} on the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> geographic location, and average daytime temperature. This adaptability allows the snake to better regulate its body temperature and {{to gain access to}} the most abundant food sources of a particular area. It feeds primarily on small rodents, such as small rats and mice, birds, and fishes, but will also eat lizards, eggs, and other snakes.|$|E
5|$|According to a NASA document, Laika {{was placed}} in the capsule of the {{satellite}} on 31 October 1957—three days {{before the start of the}} mission. At that <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
50|$|Biscogniauxia nummularia (beech tarcrust) is an ascomycete primary {{pathogen}} of beech trees, causing strip-canker {{and wood}} rot. It {{can be found}} at all <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> and is not edible.|$|R
50|$|Planned burning {{is carried}} out by the Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning at certain <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> to reduce fuel levels in parks and {{reserves}} throughout the state.|$|R
50|$|At all <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> {{there seem}} to be more males than females of this species. Pregnant females were found between May and July and the average size of litter was three.|$|R
5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} dwarf sphaeros, {{little is known}} about the ecology and {{behaviour}} of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. Because of its high surface-area-to-volume ratio that results from its diminutive size, the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss, so it has been studied to understand how it survives in its semi-arid habitat. Unlike desert-dwelling lizards, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats. From size differences alone, it loses water 70% faster than the larger and sympatric big-scaled least gecko. It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment, by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> with the highest precipitation, and by reducing activity during the driest parts of the day.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
