5|$|Conspiracy theorists {{concerned}} with surveillance abuse believe that <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> is being {{implemented by the}} cult of intelligence {{at the core of}} the surveillance-industrial complex through mass surveillance and the use of Social Security numbers, the bar-coding of retail goods with Universal Product Code markings, and, most recently, RFID tagging by microchip implants.|$|E
5|$|Paradoxically, {{since the}} first decade of the 21st century, New World Order conspiracism is {{increasingly}} being embraced and propagandized by New Age occultists, who are people bored by rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge—such as alternative medicine, astrology, quantum mysticism, spiritualism, and theosophy. Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as the makers of documentary films like Esoteric Agenda, claim that globalists who plot on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> are simply misusing occultism for Machiavellian ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> for the purpose of taking advantage of the growing 2012 phenomenon, which has its origins in the fringe Mayanist theories of New Age writers José Argüelles, Terence McKenna, and Daniel Pinchbeck.|$|E

5|$|American {{televangelist}} Pat Robertson, {{with his}} 1991 best-selling book <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order,</b> {{became the most}} prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history.

5|$|Conspiracy theorists {{generally}} {{speculate that}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> is being implemented gradually, citing {{the formation of}} the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002; and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones.|$|E

5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics. Historically, Freemasonry has attracted criticism—and suppression—from both the politically far right (e.g., Nazi Germany) and the far left (e.g. the former Communist states in Eastern Europe).|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a {{right to keep and}} bear arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA will be used for the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> from pacifist dissidents.|$|E

Adams made his in-ring debut on the February 19 episode of Thunder in a tag team match with nWo teammate Curt Hennig against Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart, with the match resulting in a double disqualification.

5|$|An {{increasingly}} popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists {{is that the}} hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, {{will be the next}} milestone in the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order.</b> The theory holds that a group of shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States {{are in the process of}} being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Mike Rotunda, who portrayed Schyster, and Ted DiBiase {{continue}} to be close friends in real life, and they have reunited on several occasions following the disbanding of Money Inc. In 1994, DiBiase formed the Million Dollar Corporation, a stable of heel wrestlers. Schyster {{was one of the}} first wrestlers to join the group and remained in the stable until leaving the WWF in 1995. In 1996, DiBiase and Rotunda (the latter as V.K. Wallstreet) were briefly together again in World Championship Wrestling as members of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} theories about a New World Order {{is that a}} secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported {{to be part of}} a cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the events}} of the Onslaught saga, the gamma-spawned powerhouse, the Hulk and his human alter ego, Banner, are split into two {{separate}} entities: Hulk now draws upon energy derived from Franklin Richards' pocket universe. Apocalypse recruits the Hulk to become his Horseman, War, with intentions of using the Hulk's nexus-energy to overcome the Celestials. To test this newest recruit, Apocalypse set War against <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order,</b> a shadow cabinet organization that intends to conquer the planet. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> in turn set the Juggernaut and the Absorbing Man against War, but both are easily defeated. Hulk comes to his senses after injuring his friend, Rick Jones. Despite this apparent setback, the incident was still a victory for Apocalypse as it was a successful testing of newly understood Celestial technology. Apocalypse activates the self-destruct mechanism on the sword of War, which <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> had obtained, destroying their headquarters.|$|E
