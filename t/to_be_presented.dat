After the opening of Danville's Community Arts Center in 2004, Ernst Crown-Weber, a local businessman, renamed the event Constitution Square 5K Run for the Arts and began {{organizing}} {{it as a way}} to raise money for the center. A local artist, Alison Craig, designs original awards <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> to the winners.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, {{he was promoted to}} Master Sergeant, and evacuated to the United States, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> with the Medal of Honor for his actions. Originally, Kouma had been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, but that award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor.|$|E

5|$|The National Hockey League honoured Smythe's {{contribution}} to the game by introducing the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1965, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> to the Most Valuable Player in the Stanley Cup playoffs. After his death, the trophy was renamed the Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy. The league also named one of its four divisions, the Smythe Division, after him prior to the 1974–75 season.|$|E
40|$|A-theoretic presentness is {{commonly}} regarded as non-solipsist and non-relative. The non-solipsism of a non-relative, A-theoretic presentness requires {{at least two}} space-like separated things <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> simpliciter together – this co-presentness further implies the global, non-relative, non-conventional simultaneity of them. Yet, this implication clashes with the general view {{that there is no}} global, non-relative, non-conventional simultaneity in Minkowski space-time. In order to resolve this conflict, this paper explores the possibility that the non-solipsism of a non-relative, A-theoretic presentness does not require at least two space-like separated things <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> simpliciter together. This can be done by holding exclusive disjunctivism –that mutually space-like separated things <b>are</b> <b>present</b> simpliciter exclusively disjunctively, and each one of them gets <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> simpliciter in a non-successive way (just like mutually time-like related things <b>are</b> <b>present</b> simpliciter exclusively disjunctively, and each one of them gets <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> simpliciter, but in a successive way) ...|$|R
25|$|For {{overriding}} political reasons, Queen Elizabeth neither {{wished to}} accuse Queen Mary of murder nor acquit {{her of the}} same, so the conference {{was intended as a}} political show. Queen Mary was refused the right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present,</b> though her accusers, including Moray, <b>were</b> permitted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present.</b>|$|R

Pieter Weening also gave the first pink jersey <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> {{to him on the}} podium to Weylandt's {{surviving}} family, and stage 11 winner John Gadret stated that he had had Weylandt in his thoughts as he crossed the line and dedicated his win to him, even though the two were not well acquainted.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highest}} award for valour of the United Kingdom, the Victoria Cross {{is always the}} first award <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> at an {{investiture}}, even before knighthoods, as was shown at the investiture of Private Johnson Beharry, who received his medal before General Sir Mike Jackson received his knighthood. Owing to its status, the VC is always the first decoration worn {{in a row of}} medals and it is the first set of post-nominal letters used to indicate any decoration or order. Similar acts of extreme valour that do not take place {{in the face of the}} enemy are honoured with the George Cross, which has equal precedence but is awarded second because the GC is newer.|$|E

A hetter (rabbinic permit) is generally given by a rabbi for a one time entry for the Kohen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> at his wife's delivery.|$|R
5|$|As {{was common}} {{practice}} with upper-class {{children of the}} time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing would lead the Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away. The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Before her {{presentation}} to Charles, Isabeau visited Hainaut {{for about a}} month, staying with her granduncle Duke Albert I, ruler of some of Bavaria-Straubing and Count of Holland. Albert's wife, Margaret of Brieg, replaced Isabeau's Bavarian style of dress, deemed unsuitable as French courtly attire, and taught her etiquette suitable to the French court. She learned quickly, suggestive of an intelligent and quick-witted character. On 13July 1385 she traveled to Amiens <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> to Charles.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{began working}} on the story in 2004, {{which was based on}} fantasies of {{escaping}} from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> in Disney Digital 3-D.|$|E

5|$|During the women's class F35/36 discus competition, {{an error}} in scoring caused the wrong medals <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented.</b> In this {{combined}} class event, final standings were determined based on a points calculation. The calculation converted distances thrown into points, {{to account for the}} different functional impairments of the participating athletes. Due to {{an error in}} the scoring system, the gold medal in the event was originally awarded to Ukrainian athlete Mariia Pomazan. When the mistake was discovered, the recalculated points showed that Chinese athlete Wu Qing had finished first, with Pomazan in second place. A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian Federation under president Boris Yeltsin retained a modified award by Law of the Russian Federation № 2553-1 March 20, 1992. Article 71 of the Constitution of Russia permits titles, orders and medals <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> by the government, and Article 89 gives the Russian president power to create state awards. This is the highest honour that can be presented by the Russian president to a citizen.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, George, Prince Regent (later George IV), {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a commemorative medal <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> to the victorious generals and national leaders of the Battle of Waterloo. That triumph the previous year had defeated Napoleon and brought peace to Europe after almost two decades. The medal was to be given in gold to the heads of state and in silver to the victorious generals. Others to be honoured would receive the medal in bronze. The usual procedure for the time was followed: the Royal Academy were asked to submit a design. They proposed work by one of their members, John Flaxman.|$|E

The Royal Academy proposed work by John Flaxman, {{one of its}} members, but Pistrucci, whose responsibility it was to engrave the dies, refused to copy another's work, and brought forth designs of his own. The Prince Regent and William Wellesley-Pole, Master of the Mint were impressed by Pistrucci's models, and he gained the commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, when General Zhukov was {{promoted}} to commander of the Kiev Military District in the Ukrainian SSR, Bagramyan wrote a letter asking to serve under his command. Zhukov agreed, and in December asked for his help writing a paper <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> to the commanders of the Soviet Military Districts. Bagramyan's paper, Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation, apparently impressed Zhukov, as he promoted Bagramyan to become the head of Operations for the Soviet 12th Army based in Ukraine. Within three months however, Bagramyan, then a colonel, was appointed {{deputy chief of staff}} of the Southwestern Front, headquartered in Kiev.|$|E
5|$|Richard Swinefield, Cantilupe's {{successor}} as Bishop of Hereford, {{wrote to}} Pope Nicholas IV {{in a letter}} dated 19 April 1290 proposing the bishop for canonisation, {{but it was not}} until 1307 that an investigation into Cantilupe's saintliness was initiated by Pope Clement V. For the canonisation process to succeed, convincing evidence of miracles that Cantilupe had performed since his death had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>presented,</b> one of which was that William Cragh had been brought back from the dead by the bishop's intercession. Three papal commissioners were appointed to conduct the inquiry: William de Testa, a papal tax collector in England, Ralph Baldock, Bishop of London, and William Durand the Younger, Bishop of Mende.|$|E
