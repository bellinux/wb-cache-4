[...] This quotation has been critiqued by Efraim Karsh for misrepresenting Herzl's purpose.

40|$|The Republic of Moldova, {{situated}} in a classic European borderland, remains an alleged site of ungovernability given protracted economic and political crises following its independence from Soviet rule, subsequent conflict and emigration, {{and the rise of}} the European Union (EU). In charting the growth of geopolitical projects like the EU 2 ̆ 7 s Border Assistance Mission, national projects governing citizenship legislation, and biopolitical restrictions undergirding migration controls, I show how the country emerges in discourses of 2 ̆ 2 risk management 2 ̆ 2 for some and social 2 ̆ 2 catastrophe 2 ̆ 2 for others. As a study of the macro-geopolitics seen in EU external relations and the national regulation of borders, I ask how sovereignty and territoriality are understood, formally and informally, to reproduce what I label a 2 ̆ 2 paradigmatic periphery 2 ̆ 2. I argue that in this case, governance projects have failed to coalesce as intended but have still rendered new bundles of territorial sovereignty evident in the formal and informal understandings of border and migration control. Via attention to legal and informal use of new categories of people like 2 ̆ 2 <b>tolerated</b> <b>persons</b> 2 ̆ 2 and old ones like 2 ̆ 2 Bessarabian 2 ̆ 2, this dissertation shows the future of both EU and Moldovan sovereignty seen from the top-down and the bottom-up. Using mixed methods including census data, public surveys, and my own comparative focus groups in the borderlands to triangulate formal and popular understandings of geopolitical risks and national crises, I explain how variegated sovereignty, as the power to exclude or enter an area, is actually territorialized in the minds and lives of citizens and those who try to govern them using various legal devices and spatial arrangement...|$|R
5000|$|In his novel, Herzl {{wrote about}} an electoral {{campaign}} in the new state. He directed his wrath against the nationalist party, which wished to make the Jews a privileged class in Israel. Herzl regarded that as a betrayal of Zion, for Zion was identical to him with humanitarianism and tolerance—and that this was true in politics as well as religion. Herzl wrote:"Matters of faith were {{once and for all}} excluded from public influence ... Whether anyone sought religious devotion in the synagogue, in the church, in the mosque, in the art museum, or in a philharmonic concert, did not concern society. That was his own private affair."Altneuland was written both for Jews and non-Jews: Herzl wanted to win over non-Jewish opinion for Zionism. When he was still thinking of Argentina as a possible venue for massive Jewish immigration, he wrote in his diary: [...] "When we occupy the land, we shall bring immediate benefits to the state that receives us.

60|$|The {{sight of}} a Huguenot was so great a treat to the old woman in her {{isolated}} life, that her tongue ran thus freely while Berenger sat, scarce daring to speak or breathe in the strange boding atmosphere of the palace, where the nurse and surgeon moved as <b>tolerated,</b> privileged <b>persons,</b> in virtue {{of the necessity of}} the one to the King--of the other to all the world. After all brief interval Pare returned and beckoned to Berenger, who followed him across a large state-bedroom to a much smaller one, which he entered from under a heavy blue velvet curtain, and found himself in an atmosphere heavy with warmth and perfume, and strangely oppressed besides. On one side of the large fire sat the young Queen, faded, wan, and with all animation or energy departed, only gazing with a silent, wistful intentness at her husband. He was opposite to her in a pillowed chair, his feet on a stool, with a deadly white, padded, puffy cheek, and his great black eyes, always prominent, now with a glassy look, and strained wide, as though always gazing after some horrible sight. 'Madame la Comtesse stood in her old, wooden, automaton fashion behind the Queen; otherwise, no one was present save Pare, who, as he held up the curtain, stood back to let M. de Ribaumont advance. He stood still, however, merely bowing low, awaiting an invitation to come forward, and trying to repress the startled tear called up by the very shock of pity at the mournful aspect of the young King and Queen.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the {{relationship}} between the domestic (Political Liberalism) and the international (Law of Peoples) theories of John Rawls, paying special attention to the concepts of tolerance and human rights. In Political Liberalism, Rawls argues that we are to <b>tolerate</b> <b>persons,</b> and groups of persons, within a liberal society as long as they adhere to comprehensive doctrines that affirm democratic essentials. In The Law of Peoples, however, he claims that we should tolerate a certain kind of illiberal states, labeled decent hierarchical societies, granted they meet certain conditions. Most notably, they observe what Rawls refers to as universal human rights. Drawing on some of Rawls's critics (Pogge, Tan, Tesón), I attempt to show that there are important differences between tolerating an illiberal doctrine within the borders of a liberal state, and tolerating illiberal states as such, and that Rawls is incorrect in viewing the two cases as analogous (at least with regard to tolerance). Tolerating the kind of illiberal states defined in The Law of Peoples will put unreasonable burdens on the shoulders of dissenters in these societies. As it turns out, Rawls's universal human rights are not very extensive. Most strikingly, the freedom of speech is lacking from his list. This raises the question of how we are to conceive the moral significance of human beings if we legitimate the hardships invoked on persons that oppose the dominating doctrine within decent hierarchical societies. On this background, I challenge the moral conception of the person that Rawls applies, and present a wider such conception, claiming that all individuals ought to be secured a richer list of human rights, containing minimally the freedom of speech. Further, I argue that Rawls's answer to how we are to understand individual freedom and equality seems to imply that liberal and decent hierarchical societies are equal, in moral terms, and that no case is made for liberalism. This argument, if successful, implies at least two things: a) the argument can be seen {{as part of a broader}} attack against cultural relativism in the human rights debate, and, more specifically, b) the argument will challenge the credibility of Rawls's conclusions. To put it another way: If my argument is sound, I see no way that Rawls's position lies within the confines of liberal tolerance. My conclusion is that the notion of tolerance that Rawls relies on is self-defeating in that it allows for a limitation of human rights on the part of members of hierarchical societies (most notably its dissenters) that seems unacceptable, at least to committed liberals. Tolerance as interpreted by Rawls, seems to rest on a moral conception of the person that implies that individuals are not free and equal in a wide, liberal sense. The extent of their freedom parallels (at best) the limited notion of universal human rights. Freedom and equality in Political Liberalism is seen as contingent on a preexisting fact of democracy. Members of other societies are not free and equal because their society is not democratic. Therefore, Rawls's liberal contractual argument seems to have a restricted scope. Due to this, it seems that the theory is more likely to legitimate regression in liberal societies, than improvement in hierarchical ones. This being said, I have no problems seeing that Rawls has a major point when he stresses the importance of understanding among peoples. The problem is that mutual understanding and respect, on his view, implies tolerating decent hierarchical societies in which human beings are deprived of rights that we ourselves value. The question is whether or not Rawls's goal overrides a liberal aim of achieving freedom and equality for all...|$|R
60|$|After {{this piece}} of {{nautical}} gallantry, the glass began to circulate. The captain. Sir George Templemore--as the false baronet was still called in the cabin, and believed to be by all but those who belonged to the coterie of Eve--and Mr. Dodge, indulged freely, though the first was too careful of the reputation of his ship, to forget {{that he was on}} the American coast in November. The others partook more sparingly, though even they submitted in a slight degree to the influence of good cheer, {{and for the first time}} since their escape, the laugh was heard in the cabin as was wont before to be the case. An hour of such indulgence produced again some of the freedom and ease which mark the associations of a ship, after the ice is fairly broken, and even Mr. Dodge began to be <b>tolerated.</b> This <b>person,</b> notwithstanding his conduct on the occasion of the battle, had contrived to maintain his ground with the spurious baronet, by dint of assiduity and flattery, while the others had rather felt pity than aversion, on account of his abject cowardice. The gentlemen did not mention his desertion at the critical moment, (though Mr. Dodge never forgave those who witnessed it,) for they looked upon his conduct as the result of a natural and unconquerable infirmity, that rendered him as much the subject of compassion as of reproach. Encouraged by this forbearance, and mistaking its motives, he had begun to hope his absence had not been detected in the confusion of the fight, and he had even carried his audacity so far, as to make an attempt to persuade Mr. Sharp that he had actually been one of those who went in the launch of the Dane, to bring down the other boat and raft to the reef, after the ship had been recaptured. It is true, in this attempt, he had met with a cold repulse, but it was so gentlemanlike and distant, that he had still hopes of succeeding in persuading the other to believe what he affirmed; by way of doing which, he endeavoured all he could to believe it himself. So much confusion existed in his own faculties during the fray, that Mr. Dodge was fain to fancy others also might not have been able to distinguish things very accurately.|$|R
