50|$|<b>TACTIC's</b> data {{management}} strategy {{is rooted in}} its flexible data model, which makes no assumptions about structure or file type. Instead, the <b>TACTIC</b> framework adapts to any type of file, including audio, video, graphic and enterprise content. Data models can either be built in <b>TACTIC</b> or <b>TACTIC</b> can be mapped onto a pre-existing data model. This capability allows <b>TACTIC</b> to provide an updated web interface for legacy systems with critical data.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{transformation}} <b>tactic</b> that provides general tabulation of func-tional algorithms. This tabulation <b>tactic</b> can be applied to dependency graphs in which variable size cuts can be defined. The <b>tactic</b> can be considered a generalization of the tupling <b>tactic</b> proposed by other authors. Tables are dynamically created and their sizes determined at execution time. The <b>tactic</b> is greatly simplified by the use of the data type array present in the functional language Haskell. According {{to the size of the}} tables used, two forms of tabulation are distinguished, respectively named total and partial tabulation. Some signi-ficative examples are developed using the <b>tactic,</b> including dynamic programming problems. Finally, we apply the loop inversion <b>tactic</b> to the partially tabulated algorithms to show that, in many cases, these algorithms can be transformed into tail recursive versions, similar to their imperative counterparts...|$|R
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry <b>tactics</b> and changes in weaponry. However, because such <b>tactics</b> left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E
5|$|Captain Claire Lee Chennault, senior {{instructor}} in fighter <b>tactics</b> at ACTS, was a vocal Air Corps officer who challenged the bomber mafia {{for more than}} a decade; he was forced into early retirement in 1937, leaving the precision bombing advocates unopposed.

5000|$|<b>TACTIC</b> deploys several {{technologies}} to manage its file systems: strict file naming conventions, check-in/out or gatekeeper/librarian function, and versioning. First <b>TACTIC</b> breaks {{up all the}} business entities into assets. In the <b>TACTIC</b> world, a user works on assets, or more specifically on {{some part of the}} process in the workflow that produces assets. Assets are organized into [...] "types of searchable assets", or [...] "sTypes" [...] in <b>TACTIC</b> terminology. This configuration provides a space or sandbox for a user to do his or her work. The sandbox is generally a freeform area designated by <b>TACTIC</b> where a user can create and manage his or her files.|$|R
5|$|In <b>Tactics</b> Advance, turn-based {{tactical}} battles {{take place}} on a three-dimensional isometric field. The player takes the role of Marche, a clan leader; he must organize the clan's members and advance their status through missions that are offered in pubs. The player competes against the computer's team in turn-based play, although unlike Final Fantasy <b>Tactics</b> characters execute their actions instantly.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Akito Inoue, {{an assistant professor at}} the International University of Japan, Inoue mentions that Final Fantasy <b>Tactics</b> was made because of how casual gamers are usually put off by games with branching storylines found in Matsuno's other titles such as <b>Tactics</b> Ogre.|$|E
5|$|Just as the armour {{and weapons}} {{of the late}} army were {{fundamentally}} {{similar to those of}} earlier eras, so the army's <b>tactics</b> were based on traditional principles. The key elements of systematic scouting, marching formation, battle array, fortified camping, and siegecraft were all followed intact in the late period. This section examines aspects of late <b>tactics</b> that differed significantly from <b>tactics</b> of the Principate.|$|E
40|$|When animals forage in groups, {{individuals}} can search for food themselves (producer <b>tactic)</b> {{or they can}} search for and join other individuals that have located food (scrounger <b>tactic).</b> The scrounger <b>tactic</b> may provide greater antipredator benefits than the producer <b>tactic</b> because "scroungers" hop with their heads up and tend to occupy central positions in a group, whereas "producers" hop with their heads down and tend to occupy edge positions. We tested whether increasing an individual's vulnerability to predation (using wing-loading manipulations) causes an increased preference for the scrounger <b>tactic</b> in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Wing-loading manipulations were effective at increasing focal individuals' perception of vulnerability to predation; treatment individuals increased their total time allocated to vigilance, whereas control individuals did not. Treatment individuals also increased {{their use of the}} scrounger <b>tactic</b> (proportion of hops with head up) and scrounged a greater proportion of patches, whereas control individuals exhibited no changes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the scrounger <b>tactic</b> confers greater antipredator benefits than the producer <b>tactic,</b> although whether antipredator benefits are achieved through differences in head orientation, spatial position, or both, remains unclear. Our finding that individuals adjust their use of the scrounger <b>tactic</b> according to changes in their phenotype provides evidence for phenotype-limited allocation strategies in producer [...] scrounger games.

5|$|Once it {{was clear}} that U.S. {{territory}} was not in danger of being attacked by enemy air units, Saville's expertise in air defense was not needed. In March 1943, he was made director of tactical development at the Army Air Forces School of Applied <b>Tactics</b> (AAFSAT) at Orlando, Florida, where he reorganized the Army Air Forces Board by July 2, 1943. Saville's structure put tactical and strategic development on equal footing, and tied together the efforts of the Chief of Air Staff for Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC), the Proving Ground Command and the School of Applied <b>Tactics.</b> Saville charged the AAFSAT with developing air defense doctrines and <b>tactics,</b> and with the testing of air defense equipment and methods.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} these games has been {{primarily}} composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto, who also composed the main-series game set in Ivalice, Final Fantasy XII. Masaharu Iwata shared compositional duties {{with him for}} Tactics; Sakimoto composed 47tracks for the game while Iwata composed the other 24. Sakimoto composed {{almost all of the}} music for <b>Tactics</b> Advance, while Uematsu contributed the main theme and Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso composed additional battle tracks. Both games have a soundtrack album, while <b>Tactics</b> Advance inspired an arranged album. Sakimoto again was the composer for <b>Tactics</b> A2: Grimoire of the Rift, though this time he was supported by composers from his studio Basiscape, and it too sparked a soundtrack album release. He also scored Revenant Wings, though it primarily consisted of arrangements of his previous work and has not been released as a separate album, and his work on <b>Tactics</b> was used as the score for the spinoff series Crystal Defenders.|$|E

5|$|This {{short-sighted}} belief had a detrimental {{impact on}} the tactical effectiveness of RAF Fighter Command until the summer, 1940. With German bombers perceived as the only prey, AOC Fighter Command Hugh Dowding and his planners devised a system and <b>tactics</b> which used unwieldy and tight fighter formations to bring the RAF fighters into combat with bombers, followed by set-piece <b>tactics</b> for the engagement. Because the bomber's return fire was considered so dangerous, fighter pilots were trained to open fire at long range, 300 to 400 yards, then break away without closing to short-range. These <b>tactics,</b> practised so thoroughly over the years, proved totally useless in the battle situation facing them over Britain in 1940.|$|E

The emphasis is on proof reuse. Examples of proof reuse are proof by analogy and reconstruction of partial proofs as part of recovering from errors in definitions or in proof strategies. Our reuse operations involve solving higherorder unification problems, and their effectiveness relies on a proof-generalization step that is done after a <b>tactic</b> is applied. The prototype is implemented in Prolog...|$|R
