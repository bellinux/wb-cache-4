5|$|Artillery, supplies, {{and troops}} were all being {{evacuated}} {{across the river}} at this time {{but it was not}} going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came. A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that <b>there</b> <b>did</b> not seem to be any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Quickly, the Austrians {{acquired}} {{control of}} all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of the}} abutment of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced to the other side, across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is some confusion about why they stopped. Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself, as Moreau seemed to think. Regardless, the troops <b>there</b> <b>did</b> not burn the bridge, but started plundering and drinking. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E

5|$|The mid-to-late 1970s saw {{a decline}} in Celtic's European achievements, with first-round exits in the European Cup against Olympiacos in 1974 and in the UEFA Cup against Wisła Kraków in 1976. In between these very brief campaigns, Celtic reached the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners' Cup in season 1975–76, but disappointingly were knocked out by East German side Sachsenring Zwickau, whose play was unimpressive despite winning the tie. The tie is best remembered for the bizarre {{situation}} where young Roy Aitken had to be 'adopted' by Celtic {{to be allowed to}} enter East Germany to play the away leg. At only 17 years old, the authorities <b>there</b> <b>did</b> not consider him to be an adult. Celtic's last European campaign under Jock Stein was again very short, a second round exit against Wacker Innsbruck in the 1977–78 European Cup.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rivière des Prairies is {{much smaller}} than the Saint Lawrence, bridge {{construction}} <b>there</b> <b>did</b> not begin until the 1840s—when rapid construction began on three wooden toll bridges to what is now Laval, one of which, Pont des Saints-Anges, collapsed in the 1880s and was never rebuilt. The existence of regular ferry services across the river is attested from 1813, but these ferries were discontinued when the bridges opened. The first railroad across the river was opened in 1876, and the Bordeaux Railway Bridge is the oldest fixed link to Laval that is still standing. (Another bridge across Rivière des Mille Îles, which was part of the same line, collapsed in 1882 but was immediately rebuilt.) The highway construction boom of the 1960s and 1970s led to the construction of four new freeway bridges across the river, and the upgrading of the existing Pie IX Bridge to freeway standards.|$|E
5|$|Freshly {{relocated}} from Sacramento, the San Antonio Texans {{finally found}} {{success on the}} field in 1995 playing in the brand new Alamodome. The Alamodome offered two advantages over other U.S. facilities - it was a multi-purpose facility with retractable seating that could accommodate a full size CFL field, also, it was an indoor, air-conditioned facility which meant the teams playing <b>there</b> <b>did</b> not {{have to deal with}} the summer heat. The team continued to be bankrolled by the enthusiastic Fred Anderson. Archer, entering his fifth year as Anderson's quarterback, led the second best offence in the league; he nevertheless suffered an injury late in the season, prompting the team to hire 45-year-old Joe Ferguson (whom Stephenson had coached as a member of the Buffalo Bills) out of retirement to serve as a backup. They finished 12–6 and finally made the playoffs. In the first round they trounced Birmingham, 51–9, before falling to the Baltimore Stallions, 21–11, in the South Division final. Team attendance was around the same level Anderson had previously seen in Sacramento.|$|E

5|$|On 8 June 1999, Kouao took Climbié {{to a local}} GP surgery. The {{practice}} nurse <b>there</b> <b>did</b> {{not carry}} out a physical examination as she was not reported to have any current health problems. By the middle of June 1999, Victoria was spending the majority of her days at the Brent home of Priscilla Cameron, an unregistered childminder, who Kouao met at {{her job at the}} hospital. There is no evidence that Climbié was treated badly during her time with Cameron. On several occasions, Cameron observed small cuts to Climbié's fingers. When questioned by Cameron, Kouao said that they were caused by razor blades that Climbié played with. Kouao and Victoria met Ackah on the street on or around 14 June 1999. In what may have been early signs of deliberate physical harm, Ackah noted a scar on Climbié's cheek, which Kouao said was caused by a fall on an escalator. On 17 June 1999, in response to what she had seen three days earlier, Ackah visited Kouao and Climbié's home, and thought that the accommodation was unsuitable.|$|E
5|$|Refinement of sulfidic {{zinc ores}} {{produces}} {{large volumes of}} sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations <b>there</b> <b>did</b> not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E
25|$|By some accounts, Taxila was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} earliest (or the earliest) universities in the world.

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>did</b> {{not appear}} {{on the part of}} Napoleon any eagerness to resume the {{movement}} of the Imperial Guard towards the lower extremity of Ligny, but rather an anxiety to await calmly the most favourable moment for his projected attack. Doubtless he had discovered the march of the remaining battalions of Colonel Langbn's Brigade, from Sombreffe towards Saint-Amand, as a further reinforcement to the Prussian right, and calculated upon paralysing the attack which Blücher was evidently preparing against the French left flank, by executing a sudden and vigorous assault on the Prussian centre, with a preponderating mass of fresh troops.|$|E
25|$|In 1843, Catholic missionaries chose Dunwich as {{the site}} for the first Catholic mission to Australian Aborigines. The sand islands of Quandamooka did not support {{pasturage}} suitable for sheep and cattle, and thus <b>there</b> <b>did</b> not occur conversion of large tracts of land into farms and pastoral properties and the subsequent widespread annihilation and displacement of Aboriginal people. The very existence of the quarantine station on Stradbroke Island from 1850 to the 1870s led to the official discouragement of pastoralism or wider settlement for fear of spreading disease. Another reason for discouraging settlement was to reduce the likelihood of incoming vessels to the bay evading customs duty.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the tachi would be paired with a tantō and later the uchigatana would be paired with another shorter uchigatana. With {{the advent of the}} katana, the wakizashi {{eventually}} was chosen by samurai as the short sword over the tantō. Kanzan Satō in his book The Japanese sword notes that <b>there</b> <b>did</b> not seem to be any particular need for the wakizashi and suggests that the wakizashi may have become more popular than the tantō due to the wakizashi being more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the katana at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the wakizashi inside.|$|E

25|$|On June 24th, 2017, a 14-year-old {{girl from}} Greenwood, Delaware fell {{approximately}} 25 feet from her gondola, striking a tree before {{falling to the}} ground. The girl had slipped under the chair's safety bar while the ride was in motion. The ride was stopped when park visitors alerted the operators to the incident, while other visitors gathered underneath the girl to prepare to catch her. She ultimately fell into the group of visitors below her, with an unidentified 47-year-old man receiving a back injury from the attempt. The passenger received no serious injuries, and {{was taken to a}} local hospital. Park officials stated <b>there</b> <b>did</b> {{not appear to be a}} malfunction of the ride, but closed the ride pending review.|$|E
25|$|Around 30 que {{have survived}} {{to the present}} day. Most {{of them are in}} Sichuan; a few in Henan and Shandong. According to Ann Paludan, this {{distribution}} may be explained by two reasons. First, there may have been more stone que produced in these regions in the first place, due to the ready availability of stone and the tradition of stone-working craft; meanwhile elsewhere wooden que were built, which have not survived. Second, Sichuan has more remote, hard to access areas, which is exactly where many of the Han Dynasty que have managed to survive. The locations around the imperial capitals, where the Eastern Han imperial mausolea were located, saw more intensive level of destruction over the almost 2000 years that have elapsed since that era, and the que constructed <b>there</b> <b>did</b> not have a chance to survive.|$|E
25|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{ruled out}} producing a re-engined {{version of its}} 737 {{to compete with the}} Airbus A320neo family launch planned for 2015, believing airlines would be looking towards the Boeing Y1 and a 30% fuel saving, instead of paying 10% more for fuel efficiency gains of only a few percent. Industry sources believe that the 737's design makes re-engining considerably more expensive for Boeing than it was for the Airbus A320. However, <b>there</b> <b>did</b> prove to be considerable demand. Southwest Airlines, who use the 737 for their entire fleet (680 in service or on order), said they were not prepared to wait 20 years or more for a new 737 model and threatened to convert to Airbus. Boeing eventually bowed to airline pressure and in 2011 approved the 737 MAX project, scheduled for first delivery in 2017.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} few years, the cities of St. Gallen, Schaffhausen, Basel, Bienne, Mulhouse, and finally Bern (in 1528) all {{followed}} the example set by Zürich. Their subject territories were converted to Protestantism by decree. In Basel, reformer Johannes Oecolampadius was active, in St. Gallen, the Reformation was adopted by mayor Joachim Vadian. In Glarus, Appenzell, and in the Grisons, which all three had a more republican structure, individual communes decided for or against the Reformation. In the French-speaking parts, reformers like William Farel had been preaching the new faith under Bernese protection since the 1520s, but only in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived <b>there,</b> <b>did</b> the city of Geneva convert to Protestantism. The same year, Bern conquered the hitherto Savoyard Vaud and also instituted Protestantism there.|$|E
25|$|Rodriguez {{played his}} first rehab {{assignment}} game on July 2, 2013 with the Yankees Class-A Low affiliate, the Charleston RiverDogs. He continued his rehabilitation and {{played for the}} Yankees Triple-A team, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders on July 18. Two days prior to his scheduled promotion to the major league roster, Rodriguez sustained a new injury, as an MRI later revealed a Grade 1 quad strain, delaying his return and forcing him to continue rehabilitating in the minor leagues. Rodriguez independently sought a second opinion on his quad strain on July 24 with a doctor who stated that <b>there</b> <b>did</b> {{not appear to be}} an injury; the Yankees were incensed by his decision, saying that he violated league rules for seeking a second opinion without the team's permission.
