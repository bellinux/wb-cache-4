The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E

Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E

25|$|Eusauporoda {{are also}} {{hypothesized}} {{to have a}} semi-digitigrade foot posturem demonstrated by footprint evidence. Paleontologist Jeffrey Wilson explains that eusauropods differ from theropods and prosauropods that have digitigrade pes where their heel and metatarsals are lifted off of the ground. Eusauropods show asymmetry in their metatarsal shaft diameters where metatarsal I is broader than the others, suggesting that their weight was mostly assumed by their inner feet. According to Steven Salisbury and Jay Nair, basal eusauropods retain four pedal unguals but reduce their phalangeal number in their fourth digit to three units. The metatarsus in eusauropods {{is less than a}} quarter of their tibial length, unlike sauropod outgroups <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> hindlimbs and metatarsus that are almost half of their tibial length.|$|E
25|$|There is {{biological}} {{variation in}} the human species—with traits such as blood type, cranial features, eye color, hair color and type, height and build, and skin color varying across the globe. Human body types vary substantially. The typical height of an adult human is between , although this varies significantly depending, among other things, on sex and ethnic origin. Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns, especially as an influence in childhood. Adult height for each sex in a particular ethnic group approximately follows a normal distribution. Those aspects of genetic variation that give clues to human evolutionary history, or are relevant to medical research, have received particular attention. For example, the genes that allow adult humans to digest lactose are present in high frequencies in populations <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> histories of cattle domestication, suggesting natural selection having favored that gene in populations that depend on cow milk. Some hereditary diseases such as sickle cell anemia are frequent in populations where malaria has been endemic throughout history—it is believed that the same gene gives increased resistance to malaria {{among those who are}} unaffected carriers of the gene. Similarly, populations that have for a long time inhabited specific climates, such as arctic or tropical regions or high altitudes, tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for conserving energy in those environments—short stature and stocky build in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities at high altitudes. Similarly, skin color varies clinally with darker skin around the equator—where the added protection from the sun's ultraviolet radiation is thought to give an evolutionary advantage—and lighter skin tones closer to the poles.|$|E

500|$|The Representation of the People Act 1832 (known informally as the 1832 Reform Act, Great Reform Act or First Reform Act to {{distinguish}} it from subsequent Reform Acts) was an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom (indexed as 2 & 3 Will. IV c. 45) that introduced wide-ranging changes to the electoral system of England and Wales. According to its preamble, the Act was designed to [...] "take effectual Measures for correcting divers Abuses <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> prevailed in the Choice of Members {{to serve in the}} Commons House of Parliament". Before the reform, most members nominally represented boroughs. The number of electors in a borough varied widely, from a dozen or so up to 12,000. Frequently the selection of MPs was effectively controlled by one powerful patron: for example Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk controlled eleven boroughs. Criteria for qualification for the franchise varied greatly among boroughs, from the requirement to own land, to merely living in a house with a hearth sufficient to boil a pot.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, {{changes at}} the Norris Geyser Basin {{resulted}} in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New fumaroles were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and {{they could no longer}} erupt normally. This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts. On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004. In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome— areas <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> been known to show significant changes in their ground movement— had risen at a rate of [...] per year from mid–2004 through 2006. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate. These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region. Experts responded to the conjecture by informing the public that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future. However, these changes demonstrate the dynamic nature of the Yellowstone hydrothermal system.|$|E

She's {{one of those}} gifted artists that people look up to, that people emulate, {{that people want to}} believe in... there's not that many superstars that stand the test of time." [...] Sarah Rodman of the Boston Herald remarked: [...] "For every hand-fluttering, overwrought, melisma addict out there aping Mariah's dog calls, there's an equal number trying to match Jackson's bubbling grooves and fancy footwork, including Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Destiny's Child." [...] Music critic Gene Stout commented she [...] "has so broadly influenced a younger generation of performers, from Jennifer Lopez... to Britney Spears, who has copied so many of Jackson's dance moves." [...] 'N Sync and Usher have credited her for teaching them how to develop stage show into theatrical performance. Kesha, Beyoncé, Toni Braxton, Aaliyah, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Crystal Kay, Kelly Rowland, Rihanna, and Brazilian singer Kelly Key have all named her an inspiration, while others such as Rozonda [...] "Chilli" [...] Thomas of TLC, Cassie, Nicki Minaj, Keri Hilson, and DJ/singer Havana Brown, have all expressed desire to emulate her. Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote: [...] "Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by—and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped—the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> been hallmarks of her performance style." [...] Adrienne Trier-Bieniek stated [...] "scholars trace the origins of pleasure as a Black feminist commitment within popular culture to Janet Jackson" [...] who inspired the feminist perspective found in many pop stars careers. Those who are considered to have followed in her footsteps have been referred to as [...] "Janet-come-lately's." [...] Other artists who have drawn comparison to her include Mýa, Brandy, Tatyana Ali, Christina Milian, Lady Gaga, Namie Amuro, and BoA. Sociologist Shayne Lee commented that [...] "s Janet enters the twilight of her reign as erotic Queen of Pop, Beyoncé emerges as her likely successor." [...] Joan Morgan of Essence magazine remarked: [...] "Jackson's Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 and janet. established the singer-dancer imprimatur standard in pop culture we now take for granted. So when you're thinking of asking Miss Jackson, 'What have you done for me lately?' remember that Britney, Ciara and Beyoncé live in the house that Janet built." ...|$|E
