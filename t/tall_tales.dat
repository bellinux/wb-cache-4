5|$|Folklorists see the jackalope {{as one of}} a {{group of}} fabled creatures common to American culture since Colonial days. These appear in <b>tall</b> <b>tales</b> about hodags, giant turtles, Bigfoot, and many other mysterious beasts and in novels like Moby-Dick. The tales lend {{themselves}} to comic hoaxing by entrepreneurs who seek attention for their products, their persons, or their towns.|$|E
5|$|The drop bear is an {{imaginary}} creature in contemporary Australian folklore featuring a predatory, carnivorous {{version of the}} koala. This hoax animal is commonly spoken about in <b>tall</b> <b>tales</b> designed to scare tourists. While koalas are typically docile herbivores, drop bears are described as unusually large and vicious marsupials that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} how the young adult Bengali science fiction (SF) of Premendra Mitra (1904 – 88) presents an alternative model of colonial science and history which is routed through {{the genre of}} the <b>tall</b> <b>tale.</b> Mitra’s works are located within {{the history of science}} fiction writings in Bengal and the article proposes that his tales can be analysed as instances of “historical catachresis” – a stretching of historical time and place. It examines the <b>tall</b> <b>tale</b> as an attempt to reformulate the national-regional binary of earlier Bengali SF into a cosmopolitan world-space by constructing an ethics of writing that operates within the dual framework of the <b>tall</b> <b>tale’s</b> “non-believability” and the positivist-scientific thrust of SF. The article concludes that the genre of SF, when blended with that of the <b>tall</b> <b>tale,</b> inaugurates the reclaiming of a postcolonial narrative space by recognizing the “other” within a framework of ethics...|$|R
5|$|The jackalope {{is subject}} to many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims {{embedded}} in <b>tall</b> <b>tales</b> about its habits. Jackalopes {{are said to be}} so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored. Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk, but The New York Times questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk. One of the ways to catch a jackalope is to entice it with whiskey, the jackalope's beverage of choice.|$|E
5|$|Like John Filson, Timothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky (1833) {{became one}} of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint greatly embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington. In Flint's book, Boone fought hand-to-paw with a bear, escaped from Indians by {{swinging}} on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these <b>tall</b> <b>tales</b> were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bodenwerder, Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg, {{the real-life}} Münchhausen {{fought for the}} Russian Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739. Upon {{retiring}} in 1760, he became a minor celebrity within German aristocratic circles for telling outrageous <b>tall</b> <b>tales</b> based on his military career. After hearing some of Münchhausen's stories, Raspe adapted them anonymously into literary form, first in German as ephemeral magazine pieces and then in English as the 1785 book, which {{was first published in}} Oxford by a bookseller named Smith. The book was soon translated into other European languages, including a German version expanded by the poet Gottfried August Bürger. The real-life Münchhausen was deeply upset at the development of a fictional character bearing his name, and threatened legal proceedings against the book's publisher. Perhaps fearing a libel suit, Raspe never acknowledged his authorship of the work, which was only established posthumously.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated <b>tall</b> <b>tales,</b> which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
5|$|The Thirteen Colonies of the {{original}} United States were all former English possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of {{the original}} material. American-Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more melodies in major. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and <b>tall</b> <b>tales,</b> and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks, and murder. Legendary heroes like Joe Magarac, John Henry, and Jesse James are part of many songs. Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style. Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models. Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history, such as {{the music of the}} Amish, the Harmony Society, and the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|Gambrinus is {{sometimes}} erroneously called a patron saint, {{but he is}} neither a saint nor a tutelary deity. In one legendary tradition, he is beer's inventor or envoy.

Gambrinus stories use folklore motifs common to European folktales, such as the trial by ordeal. Some, of course, imagine Gambrinus {{as a man who}} has an enormous capacity for drinking beer.|$|E
