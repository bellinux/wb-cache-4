These attacks aims at disrupting the victim’s service by commanding a massive number of compromised sources to send useless data towards the victim. The distributed nature of these attacks usually makes mitigation a time consuming process, {{and the risk of}} collateral damage is high. In this thesis I propose amethod for detecting and identifying the sources of DDoS attacks based on research in the field of network traffic measurement and source IP address monitoring. The method consists of two parts; a network traffic collector and a <b>traffic</b> profile <b>analyser,</b> where the first part is responsible for creating traffic profiles representing the network pattern over certain time periods, and the second part responsible for the analysis. A novelty in this thesis is the usage of learning automata for tracking the behaviour of source- IP addresses and subnets. I have shown that when using a specific reinforcement algorithm for the learning automata, the proposed method is able to correctly identifyand distinguish sources participating in distributed {{denial of service}} attacks and sources generating normal traffic. It has also been shown that this algorithm is robust against attacks based on IP spoofing. Due {{to the fact that the}} method is tracking both source IP addresses as well as their subnets, more efficient filtering rules can be created based on subnets instead of multiple IP addresses...|$|R

In this paper, we describe {{the development of a}} conceptual simulation model of the e-mail system, which is based on the use of personality trait dimensions to model the e-mail traffic behavior of e-mail users. This conceptual simulation model is being used as a first step for further development in simulating criminal and terrorist communication behavior. We also describe the development of an e-mail <b>traffic</b> <b>analyser</b> system, which uses a decision tree to search for interesting e-mail traffic behavioral patterns, and uses social network and time-series visualisation to provide the details of the interesting traffic patterns. We demonstrate that the personality trait based e-mail system model is useful as a tool for generating e-mail traffic behavioral patterns and that decision trees are useful for finding interesting patterns in the email traffic data...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{introduction}} of network filters and chokes such as firewalls in existing operational network is often problematic, due to considerations {{that need to}} be made to minimise the interruption of existent legitimate traffic. This often necessitates the time consuming manual analysis of network traffic {{over a period of time}} in order to generate and vet the rule bases to minimise disruption of legitimate flows. To improve upon this, a system facilitating network traffic analysis and firewall rule set generation is proposed. The system shall be capable to deal with the ever increasing traffic volumes and help to provide and maintain high uptimes. A high level overview of the design of the components is presented. Additions to the system are scoring metrics which may assist the administrator to optimise the rule sets for the most efficient matching of flows, based on traffic volume, frequency or packet count. A third party package-Firewall Builder- is used to target the resultant rule sets to a number of different firewall and network Filtering platforms.

40|$|Proper traffic {{analysis}} {{is crucial for}} the development of network systems, services and protocols. Traffic analysis equipment is often based on costly dedicated hardware, and uses proprietary software for traffic generation and analysis. The recent advances in open source packet processing, with the potential of generating and receiving packets using a regular Linux computer at 10 Gb/s speed, opens up very interesting possibilities in terms of implementing a {{traffic analysis}} system based on open-source Linux. The pktgen software package for Linux is a popular tool in the networking community for generating traffic loads for network experiments. Pktgen is a high-speed packet generator, running in the Linux kernel very close to the hardware, thereby making it possible to generate packets with very little processing overhead. The packet generation can be controlled through a user interface with respect to packet size, IP and MAC addresses, port numbers, inter-packet delay, and so on. Pktgen was originally designed with the main goal of generating packets at very high rate. However, when it comes to support for traffic analysis, pktgen has several limitations. One of the most important characteristics of a packet generator is the ability to generate traffic at a specified rate. Pktgen can only do this indirectly, by inserting delays between packets. Moreover, the timer granularity prevents precise control of the transmission rate, something which severely reduces pktgen’s usefulness as an analysis tool. Furthermore, pktgen lacks support for receives ide analysis and statistics generation. This is a key issue in order to convert pktgen into a useful network analyser tool. In this paper, improvements to pktgen are proposed, designed, implemented and evaluated, with the goal of evolving pktgen into a complete and efficient network analysis tool. The rate control is significantly improved, increasing the resolution and improving the usability by making it possible to specify exactly the sending rate. A receive-side tool is designed and implemented with support for measurement of number of packets, throughput, inter-arrival time, jitter and latency. The design of the receiver takes advantage of SMP systems and new features on modern network cards, in particular support for multiple receive queues and CPU scheduling. This makes it possible to use multiple CPUs to parallelize the work, improving the overall capacity of the <b>traffic</b> <b>analyser.</b> A significant part of the work has been spent on investigating low-level details of Linux networking. From this work we draw some general conclusions related to high speed packet processing in SMP systems. In particular, we study how the packet processing capacity per CPUdepends on the number of CPUs. This work consists of minimal set of kernel patches to pktgen...|$|E
