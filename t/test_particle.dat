5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a <b>test</b> <b>particle.</b> For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E
5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens. Notably, in order to deflect a <b>test</b> <b>particle</b> from its geodesic path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a geodesic, which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards push of external forces. These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E
25|$|The <b>test</b> <b>{{particle}}</b> is not {{drawn to}} the bottom stream because of a velocity-dependent force that serves to repel a particle that {{is moving in the}} same direction as the bottom stream. This velocity-dependent gravitational effect is gravitomagnetism.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>test</b> <b>particles</b> in a vacuum {{solution}} or electrovacuum solution, this turns out to imply {{that in addition to}} the tidal acceleration experienced by small clouds of <b>test</b> <b>particles</b> (spinning or not), spinning <b>test</b> <b>particles</b> may experience additional accelerations due to spin-spin forces.|$|R

In view of the corresponding effective potentials, we have discussed all the possible orbits in detail for different values of energy and angular momentum of the incoming <b>test</b> <b>particles.</b> The periods for one complete revolution of circular orbits and the advance of perihelion of the planetary orbit have also been investigated in greater detail for massive <b>test</b> <b>particles.</b> We have also discussed the time period of unstable circular motion and cone of avoidance of massless <b>test</b> <b>particles</b> in detail.

25|$|Tests of the Lense–Thirring precession, {{consisting}} of small secular precessions of {{the orbit of}} a <b>test</b> <b>particle</b> in motion around a central rotating mass, for example, a planet or a star, have been performed with the LAGEOS satellites, but many aspects of them remain controversial. The same effect may have been detected in the data of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, a former probe in orbit around Mars; also such a test raised a debate. First attempts to detect the Sun's Lense–Thirring effect on the perihelia of the inner planets have been recently reported as well. Frame dragging would cause the orbital plane of stars orbiting near a supermassive black hole to precess about the black hole spin axis. This effect should be detectable {{within the next few}} years via astrometric monitoring of stars at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. By comparing the rate of orbital precession of two stars on different orbits, it is possible in principle to test the no-hair theorems of general relativity.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} map a body's {{gravitational}} influence, {{it is useful}} to think about what physicists call probe or test particles: particles that are influenced by gravity, but are so small and light that we can neglect their own gravitational effect. In the absence of gravity and other external forces, a <b>test</b> <b>particle</b> moves along a straight line at a constant speed. In the language of spacetime, this is equivalent to saying that such test particles move along straight world lines in spacetime. In the presence of gravity, spacetime is non-Euclidean, or curved, and in curved spacetime straight world lines may not exist. Instead, test particles move along lines called geodesics, which are [...] "as straight as possible", that is, they follow the shortest path between starting and ending points, taking the curvature into consideration.|$|E

The <b>test</b> <b>particle</b> has a velocity of +v, and the bottom stream has a velocity of +2v. Since the physical situation has not changed, only the frame in which things are observed, the <b>test</b> <b>particle</b> should not be attracted towards either stream. But {{it is not at all}} clear that the forces exerted on the <b>test</b> <b>particle</b> are equal. (1) Since the bottom stream is moving faster than the top, each particle in the bottom stream has a larger mass energy than a particle in the top. (2) Because of Lorentz contraction, there are more particles per unit length in the bottom stream than in the top stream. (3) Another contribution to the active gravitational mass of the bottom stream comes from an additional pressure term which, at this point, we do not have sufficient background to discuss. All of these effects together would seemingly demand that the <b>test</b> <b>particle</b> be drawn towards the bottom stream.|$|E

40|$|The orbital {{distributions}} of currently observed extrasolar giant planets allow marginally stable orbits for hypothetical, terrestrial planets. In this paper, we propose {{that many of}} these systems may not have additional planets on these "stable" orbits, since past dynamical instability among giant planets could have removed them. We numerically investigate the effects of early evolution of multiple giant planets on the orbital stability of the inner, sub-Neptune-like planets which are modeled as <b>test</b> <b>particles,</b> and determine their dynamically unstable region. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} majority of such <b>test</b> <b>particles</b> are ejected out of the system as a result of close encounters with giant planets. Here, we show that secular perturbations from giant planets can remove <b>test</b> <b>particles</b> at least down to 10 times smaller than their minimum pericenter distance. Our results indicate that, unless the dynamical instability among giant planets is either absent or quiet like planet-planet collisions, most <b>test</b> <b>particles</b> down to ~ 0. 1 AU within the orbits of giant planets at a few AU may be gone. In fact, out of ~ 30 % of survived <b>test</b> <b>particles,</b> about three quarters belong to the planet-planet collision cases. We find a good agreement between our numerical results and the secular theory, and present a semi-analytical formula which estimates the dynamically unstable region of the <b>test</b> <b>particles</b> just from the evolution of giant planets. Finally, our numerical results agree well with the observations, and also predict the existence of hot rocky planets in eccentric giant planet systems.
