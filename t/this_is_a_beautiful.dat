2500|$|According to {{an ancient}} legend of the Greshams, {{the founder of the}} family, Roger de Gresham, was a {{foundling}} abandoned as a new-born baby in long grass in North Norfolk in the 13th century and found there by a woman whose attention was drawn to the child by a grasshopper. Although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> story, {{it is more likely that}} the grasshopper is simply an heraldic rebus on the name Gresham, with gres being a Middle English form of grass (Old English grœs).|$|E

6000|$|Two {{things in}} this city have struck me singularly, as peculiarly German: one was a long-legged stork, which I saw {{standing}} on a chimney top, reminding me of the oft-mentioned [...] "dear white stork" [...] of German stories. Why don't storks do so in America, I wonder? Another thing was, waking suddenly {{in the middle of}} the night, and hearing the hymn of the watchman as he announced the hour. I think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> custom.|$|E

"Gentlemen," [...] said Gussie, [...] "I mean {{ladies and}} gentlemen and, of course, boys, what a {{beautiful}} world <b>this</b> <b>is.</b> <b>A</b> <b>beautiful</b> world, full of happiness on every side. Let {{me tell you a}} little story. Two Irishmen, Pat and Mike, were walking along Broadway, and one said to the other, 'Begorrah, the race is not always to the swift,' and the other replied, 'Faith and begob, education is a drawing out, not a putting in.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Not that I am unhappy, mind you. I {{have found}} the words already--placid and inert, that is what I am.

60|$|Wednesday, September 13th.--There was a frost {{the night}} before last, {{according}} to George Prescott; but no effects of it were visible in our garden. Last night, however, there was another, which has nipped {{the leaves of the}} winter-squashes and cucumbers, but seems to have done no other damage. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> morning, and promises {{to be one of those}} heavenly days that render autumn, after all, the most delightful season of the year. We mean to make a voyage on the river this afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have not}} yet been twenty yards from our house and barn; but I begin to {{perceive}} that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> place. The scenery is of a mild and placid character, with nothing bold in its aspect; but I think its beauties will grow upon us, and make us love it the more, the longer we live here. There is a brook, so near the house that we shall be able to hear its ripple in the summer evenings, [...] . but, for agricultural purposes, it has been made to flow in a straight and rectangular fashion, which does it infinite damage as a picturesque object.

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> {{and very}} fertile valley, about twenty {{miles long and}} five or six broad; a bright cold stream called the Fourche de Glace, or Ice River, runs through it. Its {{sheltered}} situation, embosomed in mountains, renders it good pasturaging ground in the winter time; when the elk come down to it in great numbers, driven {{out of the mountains}} by the snow. The Indians then resort to it to hunt. They likewise come to it in the summer time to dig the camash root, of which it produces immense quantities. When this plant is in blossom, the whole valley is tinted by its blue flowers, and looks like the ocean when overcast by a cloud.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is strange}} that George having to stop so {{short a time}} in England, I should not have seen him for nearly two days. He has been to Haslam's and does not {{encourage}} me to follow his example. He had given promise to dine with the same party to-morrow, but has sent an excuse which I am glad of, as we shall have a pleasant party with us to-morrow. We expect Charles here to-day. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> day. I hope you will not quarrel with it if I call it an American one. The sun comes upon the snow and makes a prettier candy than we have on twelfth-night cakes. George is busy this morning in making copies of my verses. He is making one now of an [...] "Ode to the Nightingale," [...] which is like reading {{an account of the}} Black Hole at Calcutta on an iceberg.|$|E
60|$|His {{name was}} John, {{and he had}} a pigtail five feet long--all real hair and no silk braided, and he kept an hotel by the way and fed us with a chicken, into whose {{innocent}} flesh onions and strange vegetables had been forced. Till then we had feared Chinamen, especially when they brought food, but now we will eat anything at their hands. The conclusion of the meal was a half-guinea pineapple and a siesta. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> thing which we of India--but I am of India no more--do not understand. You lie down and wait for time to pass. You are not in the least wearied--and you would not go to sleep. You are filled with a divine drowsiness--quite different from the heavy sodden slumber of a hot-weather Sunday, or the businesslike repose of a Europe morning. Now I begin to despise novelists who write about siestas in cold climates. I know what the real thing means.|$|E
6000|$|The next morning, the Absolute Fool {{came back}} to the inn, and seeing the Princess, said: [...] "I rode until after night-fall, searching for the Prince, before it {{occurred}} to me that, even if I should find him, I would not know him in the dark. As soon as I thought of that, I rode straight to the nearest house, and slept until daybreak, when I remembered that I was to report to you this morning. But as I have heard no news of the Prince, and as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful,</b> clear day, I think it would be extremely foolish to remain idly here, where there is nothing of interest going on, and when a single hour's delay may cause you to miss the object of your search. The Prince may be in one place this morning, and there is no knowing where he will be in the afternoon. While the Gryphoness is searching, we should search also. We can return before sunset, and we will leave word here as to the direction we have taken, so that when she returns, she can quickly overtake us. It is my opinion that not a moment should be lost. I will be your guide. I know this country well." ...|$|E

In 1865 Rev. Fr. Jerome Paul Carvallo repaired this church and made additions to the Sanctuary.|$|R
50|$|Wiesbaden has a {{long history}} as a spa town. The Romans already knew of the thermal springs of Wiesbaden. The name of the city is derived from Wisibada, the bathing place in the meadows. In 1810, the first spa house was built by Christian Zais. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> but {{relatively}} modest building with a columned portico, including Doric and Ionic features, in classical style. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe praised the building on one of his many visits. During the 19th century, the benefits of the spa attracted the upper classes. The number of spa visitors, 20,000 in 1840, had increased tenfold by 1910.|$|R
