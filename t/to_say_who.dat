When he was offered $25,000 to {{demonstrate}} his beam to the Radio World Fair at Madison Square Garden, he again refused and claimed, without foundation, {{that he was not}} permitted to demonstrate it outside England.

25|$|PGA Tour players {{compete for}} two {{player of the}} year awards. The PGA Player of the Year award dates back to 1948 and is awarded by the PGA of America. Since 1982 the winner has been {{selected}} using a points system with points awarded for wins, money list position and scoring average. The PGA Tour Player of the Year award, also known as the Jack Nicklaus Trophy, is administered by the PGA Tour and was introduced in 1990; the recipient is selected by the tour players by ballot, although the results are not released other than <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> has won. More often than not the same player wins both awards; in fact, as seen in the table below, the PGA and PGA Tour Players of the Year have been the same every year from 1992 through 2016. The Rookie of the Year award was also introduced in 1990. Players are eligible in their first season of PGA Tour membership if they competed in less than seven events from any prior season. Several of the winners had a good deal of international success before their PGA Tour rookie season, and some have been in their thirties when they won the award. In March 2012, a new award, the PGA Tour Courage Award, was introduced in replacement of the defunct Comeback Player of the Year award.|$|E

500|$|The maids also deliver {{their version}} of {{narrative}} justice on Odysseus and Telemachus, who ordered and carried out their execution, and on Penelope who was complicit in their killing. The maids {{do not have the}} same sanctioned voice as Penelope and are relegated to unauthoritative genres, though their persistence eventually leads to more valued cultural forms. Their testimony, contrasted with Penelope's excuses while condemning Helen, demonstrates the tendency of judicial processes to not act upon the whole truth. When compared with the historical record, dominated by the stories in the Odyssey, the conclusion, as one academic states, is that the concepts of justice and penalties are established by [...] "who has the power <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> is punished, whose ideas count", and that [...] "justice is underwritten by social inequalities and inequitable power dynamics".|$|E
500|$|On February 22, 1866, Washington's Birthday, Johnson gave {{an impromptu}} speech to {{supporters}} who had {{marched to the}} White House and called for an address {{in honor of the}} first president. In his hour-long speech, he instead referred to himself over 200 times. More damagingly, he also spoke of [...] "men... still opposed to the Union" [...] to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the South. When called upon by the crowd <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> they were, Johnson named Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, and abolitionist Wendell Phillips, and accused them of plotting his assassination. Republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war, while one Democratic ally estimated Johnson's speech cost the party 200,000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections.|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} half of the war, {{political}} opposition within the Royalist senior leadership against Rupert continued to grow. Rupert's personality during the war had made him both friends and enemies. He enjoyed a [...] "frank and generous disposition", showed a [...] "quickness of... intellect", was prepared to face grave dangers, and could be thorough and patient when necessary. However, he lacked the social gifts of a courtier, and his humour could turn into a [...] "sardonic wit and a contemptuous manner": with a hasty temper, he was too quick <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> he respected, and who he disliked. The result was that, while Rupert could inspire great loyalty in some, especially his men, he also made many enemies at the Royal court. When he took Bristol, he also slighted the Marquess of Hertford, the lethargic but politically significant Royalist leader of the South-West. Most critically, Rupert fell out with George Digby, a favourite of both the King and the Queen. Digby was a classic courtier and Rupert fell to arguing with him repeatedly in meetings. The result was that towards the end of the war Rupert's position at court was increasingly undermined by his enemies.|$|E

[...] Giving evidence in December 2011, Morgan, who bragged in a newspaper column for the Daily Mail in 2006 about hearing the message, refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> had played him the recorded message of the call, saying he was protecting a source. Mills told the inquiry that Morgan was [...] "a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years and would have relished telling the inquiry if I had played a personal voicemail message to him."

500|$|After {{returning}} to the studio in Spain in late January, Björk decided that producer Nellee Hooper, who had produced both Debut and Post, would not return, as Björk stated that they had [...] "both stopped surprising each other". Björk had intended to produce the album alone, but she abandoned the idea and [...] sought out a group of close collaborators including Dravs, Howie B, Guy Sigsworth and LFO's Mark Bell. Howie B had worked with Björk previously on Debut and Post and Sigsworth had played harpsichord on Post. The American hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan almost contributed {{to the production of}} Homogenic, but were unable due to their production on the album Wu-Tang Forever, which had taken longer than planned. Most of the melodies on the album were created by Björk, who then composed string sections on a Casio keyboard and brought them to programmers who would add suitable rhythmic patterns. Björk desired to have Mark Bell contribute to her albums Debut and Post, only finding him available for Homogenic. Mark Bell was credited {{for the majority of the}} album's production, including the songs [...] "Pluto", [...] "Alarm Call", and the bass line in [...] "Jóga". Björk stated about her collaboration with Bell that she [...] "trusts and respects what [...] does for me. If I were <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> has influenced me most it would be Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and Mark Bell". Other unorthodox methods of recording were used during the production, including Björk wanting to record outside on the porch and using non-professionals to help with production, such as Rebecca Storey, who was hired as a babysitter but added to the production staff after showing interest in the equipment.|$|E

I can’t vote for either of those two people." [...] He suggested that he may vote for a third-party candidate, or write-in his wife's name, saying she would be [...] "an ideal president". When pressed on who of Trump and Clinton was more qualified to be President, Romney quoted P. J. O'Rourke: [...] "Hillary Clinton is wrong on every issue, but she's wrong within the normal parameters." [...] He considered voting for the Libertarian ticket of former Republican Governors Gary Johnson and William Weld, saying that he would [...] "get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he's someone who I could end up voting for", adding that [...] "if Bill Weld were {{at the top of the}} ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president." [...] In September he called for Johnson to be included in the presidential debates and in October it emerged that Independent candidate Evan McMullin was using an email list of 2.5 million Romney supporters to raise money. McMullin's chief strategist said that it was purchased from Romney for President and that [...] "we'll let other folks discuss what that may mean and certainly never speak for [...] ". A spokeswoman for Romney said that the list had been [...] "rented by several political candidates in the presidential primary, and by countless other political and commercial users in the time since the 2012 campaign" [...] and Romney made no public comment on McMullin's candidacy. Romney and his wife cast early ballots in Utah, but he declined <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> he voted for.|$|E

2500|$|At E3, a non-playable demo was shown. Following the mediocre {{critical}} reaction to Fellowship, Surreal {{had built a}} new game engine from scratch. Additionally, the rigidly linear gameplay from Fellowship was replaced {{with a mixture of}} both linear and non-linear levels. Vivendi also announced that a secret playable character could be unlocked in the game, but only if the player performed very specific actions. They refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> the character was, however, saying only [...] "The secret character is not Gandalf, it's actually cooler than him." [...] The demo featured a level set in Fangorn Forest, with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli fighting a group of Uruk-hai and orcs. In total, apart from the secret character, the game was to feature six playable characters; Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Boromir (in a flashback level), Sam and Gollum. Another new feature in the game was that the player-character often switched mid-level, adhering to the main point-of-view of the given moment in the novel. Multiplayer co-op was also available, and online multiplayer was said to be in the works. The character models were not the same as those used in The Fellowship, with considerably more detail for each character. In July, Vivendi revealed that Treebeard had been added as a playable character.|$|E
2500|$|Georgia, {{and some}} Western diplomats in Tbilisi later {{questioned}} Grist's objectivity.

[...] OSCE Deputy Spokeswoman Virginie Coulloudon told the journalists that the organization's monitors make [...] "patrol reports" [...] from the ground [...] "on a daily basis." [...] Coulloudon also said that [...] "the OSCE is not in a capacity <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> started the war and what happened before the night of [...] 7-8."

The eyewitness accounts are also consistent with a report issued on 5 August 2008, by a tripartite monitoring group, which included Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) observers and representatives of Russian peacekeepers in the region. The report, signed by the commander of Russian peacekeepers, General Marat Kulakhmetov, said there was evidence of attacks against ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia. The report also stated that South Ossetian separatists were using heavy weapons against the Georgian villages, which was prohibited by a 1992 cease-fire agreement.|$|E

2500|$|The Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands Governments denied {{knowledge}} of his whereabouts, but on 10 October he was secretly flown aboard a Papua New Guinea Defence Force aircraft to Solomon Islands where he was arrested by officers of RAMSI on his arrival in Munda, Western Province. When he left PNG, Moti was in breach of the bail conditions imposed by Madam Justice Catherine Davani of the PNG National Court, and had failed to appear at a PNG court hearing on 30 September. [...] The PNG Government declined <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>who</b> in the PNG Defence Force or Government had given the order to fly Moti out. In response, the Australian Government immediately cancelled planned visits by the PNG Prime Minister, Grand Chief the Right Honourable Sir Michael Somare, and Defence Minister Martin Aini, and postponed the annual Australia-PNG Ministerial Forum, and called for {{an investigation into the}} flight and prosecution of whoever was responsible. A PNG Defence Force Board of Inquiry into the escape has since recommended that Sir Michael Somare and a number of his advisers be charged with offences in relation to the escape, including breaching PNG's constitution. Somare has sought to suppress the Inquiry's report, challenging the Inquiry's standing in PNG's National Court. As yet the Court has not ruled on the validity of Somare's challenge to the public release of the Commission of Inquiry's findings. with the presiding judge likening Somare's attempts to suppress the findings of the report as a scandal on par with Watergate.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the position taken by the Karaites {{in regards to the}} authority of the Talmud, Orthodox Judaism counters first {{that the majority of the}} Oral Law codified in the Mishnah and Talmud are the legal rulings of the last Sanhedrin, a body of 71 elders that made up the highest court of jurisprudence in ancient Israel, and that not all of the Oral Law are literally [...] "Laws given to Moses on Mount Sinai". The decisions made by this High Court must be upheld, per se the Law of Moses (Deuteronomy 17), this gives their legal rulings divine authority. Karaites reject the authority of this Sanhedrin that developed during the second Temple period partly because it was an admixture of different people and not just priests and levites as mandated by the Torah. The Sanhedrin also took legal authority away from the descendants of Zadok who served as priests in the Temple in Jerusalem. This is essentially the same view held by the Sadducees and Boethusians during the second Temple period. Secondly Rabbinic Judaism points to the innumerable examples of biblical commandments that are either too ambiguous or documented in such a concise fashion that proper adherence could not be enforced on a national scale without the further legislation provided by the Talmud. Karaites respond that the Torah itself states [...] "this law I am commanding you is not too hard for you, neither is it far off. It is not in the heavens, <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>who</b> shall ascend into the heavens and bring it to us, and cause us to understand it, that we do it?"
