5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E

Comments surfaced that were made by Baldwin, raising the possibility of a 9/11 conspiracy theory of a controlled demolition stating, [...] "I don't know whether there was any kind of an inside apparatus involved in <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>not...</b> If there's duplicity involved in some kind of conspiracy, then let's find out who it is and prosecute whoever's involved." ...|$|E

In a 2005 interview with Kerrang, he reflected on his self-destructive past: [...] "There was a persona that had run its course. I {{needed to get}} my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I {{took a couple of}} years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened." [...] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is [...] "pretty happy". Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, With Teeth (2005), reached number one on the Billboard 200.|$|E

2500|$|Stokowski was {{selected}} {{over the other}} applicants, and took up his conducting duties in late 1909. That was also the year of his official conducting debut in Paris with the Colonne Orchestra on 12 May 1909, when Stokowski accompanied his bride to be, the pianist Olga Samaroff, in Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. Stokowski's conducting debut in London took place the following week on 18 May with the New Symphony Orchestra at Queen's Hall. His engagement as new permanent conductor in Cincinnati was a great success. He introduced the concept of [...] "pops concerts" [...] and, starting with his first season, he began championing the work of living composers. His concerts included performances of music by Richard Strauss, Sibelius, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, Glazunov, Saint-SaÃ«ns and many others. He conducted the American premieres of new works by such composers as Elgar, whose 2nd Symphony was first presented there on 24 November 1911. He was to maintain his advocacy of contemporary music {{to the end of}} his career. However, in early 1912, Stokowski became frustrated with the politics of the orchestra's Board of Directors, and submitted his resignation. There was some dispute over whether to accept <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> but, on 12 April 1912, the board decided to do so.|$|E

60|$|We adored Aunt Olivia; she {{was pretty}} and merry and kind; and, above all, she had {{mastered}} to perfection the rare art of letting children alone.

He did not know if he was grateful for <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> but saw that she knew what he felt. If Mrs. Featherstone guessed, she made no sign; she treated him with the graciousness one would expect from a well-bred hostess, but went no further.|$|E

[...] "How do you think I am going to take you on?" [...] They took on hands at the works; and Lapham put it as if Corey were a hand coming to him for employment.

Jasper did not find it hard to talk to her now; it seemed as if he were talking to his dream Alice, and it came strangely natural to him. He did not talk volubly, but Alice thought what he did say was worth while. His words lingered in her memory and made music. She always found his flowers under the pine, and she always wore some of them, but she did not know if he noticed <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E
60|$|Another {{point was}} settled. Alexis {{had worked in}} earnest for eight months, and had {{convinced}} himself that the marble works were not his vocation, though he had acquitted himself well enough to induce Mr. White to offer him {{a share in the}} business, and he would have accepted it if needful. He had, however, made up his mind to endeavour to obtain a scholarship at Oxford, and Captain Henderson promised that whether successful in <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> he should be enabled to keep his terms there. Mr. White could not understand how a man could prefer being a poor curate to being a rich quarrymaster, but his wife and the two sisters had influence enough to prevent him from being offended, and this was the easier, because Theodore had tastes and abilities that made it likely that he would be thoroughly available at the works.|$|E
