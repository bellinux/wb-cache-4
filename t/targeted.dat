5|$|Nils Melzer {{presents}} an historical, legal and moral examination of <b>targeted</b> killing. The author observes that after September 11, the Western world grew {{more supportive of}} <b>targeted</b> killing than ever before. The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned <b>targeted</b> killing is perceived in other countries. He defines <b>targeted</b> killing as the premeditated selection of an individual person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes {{all areas of the}} topic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Targeted</b> Killing in International Law is a {{book about}} the {{legality}} of <b>targeted</b> killing, written by Nils Melzer. It was first published by Oxford University Press in May 2008. The book explores the history of <b>targeted</b> killing as a government strategy by multiple countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany; for both military and law enforcement purposes. Melzer argues that directly after the September 11 attacks in the United States, perceptions of the tactic became more positive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Targeted</b> Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} by Andrew Altman.

25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their <b>targeting</b> scheme(s). A <b>targeting</b> scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset <b>targets.</b> A <b>target</b> is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath <b>targets</b> include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point <b>targeting),</b> tidal volume (dual <b>targeting)</b> and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo <b>targeting).</b> Examples of between-breath <b>targets</b> and <b>targeting</b> schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive <b>targeting),</b> percent minute ventilation (for optimal <b>targeting)</b> and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent <b>targeting,</b> e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The <b>targeting</b> scheme (or combination of <b>targeting</b> schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic <b>targeting</b> schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A <b>targeting</b> scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A <b>targeting</b> scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A <b>targeting</b> scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A <b>targeting</b> scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A <b>targeting</b> scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one <b>target</b> (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another <b>target</b> (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A <b>targeting</b> scheme that automatically adjusts the <b>targets</b> of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A <b>targeting</b> scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|R
