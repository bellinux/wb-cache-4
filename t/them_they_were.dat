5|$|During the Battle of the Alps, 154 French {{soldiers}} were {{captured by the}} Italians. These prisoners were forgotten during the armistice negotiations, and the final agreement {{makes no mention of}} <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> held at the POW camp in Fonte d'Amore in Sulmona, along with 600 Greeks and 200 Britons, treated, by all accounts, in accordance with the laws of war. Their fate is unknown after Italy's armistice with the Allies, when they presumably came under German control.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{concerns}} for secrecy kept the military designation of the Katyushas from being {{known by the}} soldiers who operated <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> called by code names such as Kostikov guns, after {{the head of the}} RNII, the Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute, and finally classed as Guards Mortars. The name BM-13 was only allowed into secret documents in 1942, and remained classified until after the war.|$|E
5|$|The Germans rapidly {{realised}} that Pećanac's Chetniks, whose numbers {{had grown}} to 8,000, were inefficient and unreliable, and even the Nedić government had no confidence in <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> completely disbanded by March 1943.

He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who appeared to have been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2010 Winter Olympics, 117 medals (40 gold, 38 silver, and 39 bronze) {{have been}} awarded to 105 lugers (53 in the singles and 52 in the doubles) {{representing}} nine National Olympic Committees (NOC). German lugers—representing the Unified Team of Germany (1964), West Germany (1968–1988), East Germany (1968–1988), and Germany (1992–2010)—have dominated this sport, collecting {{a total of}} 70 medals (27 gold, 22 silver, and 21 bronze). There were seven occasions when a single NOC filled the podium with its athletes and in all of <b>them</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> German. After the Vancouver Games, Germany is the current medal-leading NOC in the sport with 31 medals (13 gold, 10 silver, and 8 bronze), surpassing East Germany's 29 medals.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E

5|$|In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman {{were both}} wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena {{with members of}} the Know-Nothing Party {{following}} a debate. Cleburne was shot in the back, turned around and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street and then left. After the two recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to all charges brought against <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi.

5|$|It was {{considered}} {{more likely that}} Germany might employ such weapons against the United Kingdom, so four officers from the European Theater of Operations United States Army (ETOUSA) were summoned to Chicago where {{they were given a}} top secret briefing by the Manhattan District's Chicago area engineer, Major Arthur V. Peterson. They were told about possible forms such an attack might take, and what the effects and symptoms of them were, and they were given survey instruments and shown how to use <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> enjoined to tell other officers in the theater to report unexplained fogging of film or illnesses with symptoms corresponding to the effects of radiation sickness.|$|E
5|$|Jeremiah Fisher {{constructed}} two row houses, {{joined by}} a common wall and constructed of brick laid in a Flemish bond, near the city square in 1817. These houses lay on Second Street and face west onto Constitution Square. Fisher owned and rented these houses until 1850, but after he sold <b>them</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> used as tenements until at least the 1940s. The Wilderness Trace Art League and Boyle County Historical Society Museum occupied the row houses, before the park's purchase by the county. It now houses the Danville-Boyle County Chamber of Commerce, the Arts Commission of Danville-Boyle County, and the communications department of the Danville Boyle-County Economic Development Partnership.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany, {{supported}} by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, {{with the ultimate}} goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.|$|E
5|$|Sevastopol {{began her}} sea trials on 16 October 1899, and was {{commissioned}} after their conclusion into the Imperial Russian Navy. She {{and her sister}} ships were transferred to Port Arthur, which was then the port of the First Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet. In September 1900, Popov radios were installed on Sevastopol and her sister Poltava, the first Russian battleships to have <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> also painted white, {{the same color as}} the other ships in the First Pacific Squadron. She then left for Port Arthur and arrived at on 13 April 1901. As Russia was not at war with any Far East countries at that time, Sevastopol stayed in port, inactive.|$|E
5|$|The act {{provided}} for {{a maximum of}} 40,000 medals, to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint, from design models prepared by the Norse-American Centennial Commission.

That section permitted medals of a national character to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint, but forbade Mint personnel from making dies for private medals, and was enacted after Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Franklin Peale had for some years run a private medals business on Mint premises, prior to his firing in 1854.|$|E

5|$|Armed Serbs burnt Croat-owned {{houses in}} the village of Cerovljani, just to the north of Hrvatska Dubica, on 13 September and once more on 21 September. Three days later, the gunmen {{returned}} and after some shooting, three civilians were found dead and four more houses were torched in the village. The same day, the Catholic church bell tower was shot at using rocket-propelled grenades. In October, the armed Serbs gathered ten out of eleven remaining Cerovljani residents in the village's community centre, telling <b>them</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{to take part in a}} meeting. Instead, they were detained for the night and shipped away the next day to the Krečane area next to the village of Baćin, just to the west of Hrvatska Dubica and killed there. Approximately 30 elderly civilians remained in Baćin after SAO Krajina forces captured the village. All of them were taken to Krečane and killed in October as well, except for three men who were detained and killed in Hrvatska Dubica.|$|E

They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit <b>them.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
