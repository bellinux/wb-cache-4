5000|$|While {{the window}} for {{learning}} a second language never completely closes, certain linguistic aspects {{appear to be more}} affected by the age of the learner than others. For example, adult second-language learners nearly always retain an immediately identifiable foreign accent, including some who display perfect grammar. A possible explanation for why this foreign accent remains is that pronunciation, or phonology, is susceptible to the critical period. The pronunciation of speech sounds relies on neuromuscular function. Adults learning a new language are unlikely to attain a convincing native accent since they are past the prime age of learning new neuromuscular functions, and therefore pronunciations. Writers have suggested a younger critical age for learning phonology than for morphemes and syntax. [...] reports that there is no critical period for learning vocabulary in a second language because vocabulary is learned consciously using declarative memory. The attrition of procedural memory with age results in the increased use of declarative memory to learn new languages, which is an entirely different process from L1 (first language) learning. The plasticity of procedural memory is argued to decline after the age of 5. The attrition of procedural memory plasticity inhibits the ability of an L2 user to speak their second language automatically. It can still <b>take</b> <b>conscious</b> effort even if they are exposed to the second language as early as age 3. This effort is observed by measuring brain activity. L2-users that are exposed to their second language at an early age and are everyday users show lower levels of brain activity when using their L1 than when using their L2. This suggests that additional resources are recruited when speaking their L2 and it is therefore a more strenuous process.|$|E

40|$|Cultural landscapes - {{artifacts}} that display the combined work {{of man and}} nature - exist in time. Therefore their evaluation, analysis and interpretation must take place {{within the context of}} conscious or unconscious understandings of time/space relationships. Landscape architecture professionals are often wary of the preservation of historic landscapes, sensing that a living landscape cannot be frozen in time. Heritage conservationists, working within structures initially designed to serve the built environment, sometimes question the validity of a dynamic landscape as a heritage resource. Divergent developmental histories led these two disciplines to internalize distinctive understandings of the meaning of time, giving rise in the process to conflicting yet potentially complementary conservation metrics. A discussion of these separate histories and resulting concepts of time will provide a starting point for an interdisciplinary discussion about a shared resource viewed through two contrasting temporal lenses. Case studies, examined in the context of frameworks devised by the National Park Service (NPS) for the analysis of cultural resources, suggest ways to expand the existing methodology to <b>take</b> <b>conscious</b> advantage of both of these views of time. The insights of landscape architecture offer a richer, more comprehensive view of an important heritage resource, while existing NPS structures offer a recognized means of validation and support for the conservation of cultural landscapes...|$|E
40|$|The dislocated {{mind is a}} {{condition}} common to us all: it speaks about the innate ability {{of the human mind}} to <b>take</b> <b>conscious</b> leave of its body in dwelling in the past of memory and in contemplating the future. The effects of dislocation are minimized in children: having a limited quantity of memory, the young conscious mind spends much of its time at the instant of perception, highly aware of the fleeting sensuality of its bodily experiences, and in intense absorption of the feeling associated with perception. As memory accumulates, so does the wandering of conscious thought increase, so much so that rarely, if ever, can the conscious mind perceive as it did in childhood. Mostly, in our over-dependence on the knowledge of the past, we neglect the knowledge that our senses still provide. Sensual knowledge, however, does not merely refer to the raw, perceived information that is then assimilated by our logic, it concerns a profound relationship which our minds share with our bodies; for {{at the heart of this}} dislocated mind itself is a particular condition which relates the metaphor of poetry to the creation of architecture.

These allow agents to communicate with the environment and <b>take</b> <b>conscious</b> decisions base on these foot marks. Two types of pheromones was used: repellents and attractants. The repellents are released by the agents when they are in search mode and indicate to other agents, areas that have already been explored. On the other hand, attractant pheromones are released once the agent or has reached the goal or hit a sector where this pheromone is found, this in order to communicate the path to the target. The algorithm is based on the theory of cellular automata to determine the states and decisions of the agents according to the state of their immediate environment.

According to Krashen's theory, the only thing that can lead to fluency in the language is language [...] "acquisition". Language [...] "learning" [...] can only be used as a way to consciously edit speech or writing, and it is never the cause of spontaneous, unrehearsed speech or writing.|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: Life skills {{involve a}} big class of socio-psychological and {{interpersonal}} skills which help {{a person to}} <b>take</b> <b>conscious</b> decisions, communicate effectively and improve self-management skills. Preparing a plan for all the above mentioned programs, need awareness about life skills level of different groups such as students in universities. Present study was aimed to reveal the predictors of life skills level of Students in Zahedan University of Medical Sciences in southeast of Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional {{study carried out on}} 380 medical students of Zahedan in 2015. The subjects were selected using stratified random sampling method. The data were collected using reliable Life Skill Dimensions Score questionnaire. The data were analyzed in Stata. 12 software using ANOVA, Independent t-test and multiple linear regression with Hosmer-Lemshow method. Results: The mean of total score regarding life skills score was 280. 8 ± 45. 8. The linear regression analysis indicated that gender (β= 11. 15, 95 CI: 5. 03 - 17. 27), socioeconomic status (β= 6. 78, 95 CI: 1. 76 - 11. 8) and average grades (β= 15. 3, 95 CI: 9. 11 - 21. 49) were associated with life skills score. However, the life skills score was not associated with the age, semester, residential area, smoking, marital status and school of education (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: The level of life skills scores of medical students in southeast of Iran is low in all dimensions especially in communication skills. Thus, promoting life skills in university students is too important. However, the life skills training programs should be implemented with respect to socioeconomic status, gender and average grade and male students with low socioeconomic status and average have priority...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{subordination}} of midwifery by medicine and nursing in the 19 th and 20 th centuries the standard approach to childbirth {{has been dominated by}} rationality. This approach proceeds by creating dichotomies and then prioritising one half of the dichotomy whilst rejecting the opposite term. Rationality itself is prioritised, for example, by contrasting it with the rejected opposite: irrationality. Expert clinical practice is, however, increasingly identified as being inclusive of more than merely rational ways of knowing and behaving. This paper is based on a post-structural study concerning changes to women 2 ̆ 7 s embodied sense of self during childbearing. We expose the limitations of pure rationality in the context of childbirth and use the concept of safety to exemplify the limitations that pure rationality imposes. The paper draws on philosophical and spiritual theory to present an analysis of ideas about mind, body, soul and spirit. The standard rational/irrational dichotomy is critiqued and contrasted with the embodied reality of nonrational experiences that are individual, contextual and ‘in-the-moment’. Nonrational experiences are identified to be inclusive of power and knowledge that are both rational and nonrational. This revised conceptualisation provides a theoretical basis that allows for and promotes more possibilities and thus more holistic ways of knowing in midwifery. Our thesis is that midwives and women need to <b>take</b> <b>conscious</b> account of nonrational knowledge and power during the childbearing year. We argue that pure rational thinking limits possibilities by excluding the midwife 2 ̆ 7 s embodied ways of knowing along with the ways of knowing embodied by the woman. The inclusion of women 2 ̆ 7 s and midwives’ nonrational ways of knowing in childbearing situations opens us up to knowledge and power that provides for a more complete, and therefore a more optimal, decision-making process...|$|E

Therefore over the course of human history we were forced to develop other emergent qualities in order to survive, giv-ing us more conscious choice and power over our envi-ronment, other peoples, and ourselves: 1. technology 2. reflexive consciousness 3. social structure These emergent qualities helped free human beings from the vagaries of weather and climate and threats from predators.

There are certain ground qualities that were present at the beginnings of our social evolution- natural living, belonging, vitality, community, equality. Over the span of human history certain emergent qualities have developed to give us greater power in the world- technology, social organization, rational thinking. However, in developing these qualities we have suppressed the ground qualities, at the expense of our health and wholeness and now leading to a profound crisis. The next step in social evolution is to <b>take</b> <b>conscious</b> charge of our future by integrating the ground qualities with the emergent qualities.
