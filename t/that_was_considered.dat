5|$|Several {{sites were}} {{proposed}} {{as the main}} Expo grounds. One location <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> was Mount Royal Park, {{to the north of}} the downtown core. But it was Drapeau's idea to create new islands in the St. Lawrence river, and to enlarge the existing Saint Helen's Island. The choice overcame opposition from Montreal's surrounding municipalities, and also prevented land speculation.|$|E

5|$|By 494 BC the Persian {{army and}} navy had regrouped, {{and they made}} {{straight}} for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea, but was defeated decisively at the Battle of Lade, after the Samians had defected. Miletus was then besieged, captured, and its population was enslaved. This double defeat effectively ended the revolt, and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result. The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them, before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> to be both just and fair.|$|E
5|$|Design of the FR-1 {{began in}} 1943 to a {{proposal}} instigated by Admiral John S. McCain, Sr. for a mixed-powered fighter because early jet engines had sluggish acceleration <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> unsafe and unsuitable for carrier operations. Ryan received {{a contract for}} three XFR-1 prototypes and one static test airframe on 11 February 1943 with the first two prototypes delivered in 14 months. Another contract was placed for 100 aircraft on 2 December 1943 and a later contract on 31 January 1945 increased the total of FR-1s on order to 700.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mobilisation}} a number of militia infantry battalions were called out to carry out guard duties upon infrastructure <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> important to the war effort, such as munitions factories, communications facilities, ammunition dumps and transportation centres. 500 men from the Kennedy Regiment were sent to Thursday Island from Townsville to garrison the island in response to a possible threat from German forces in the Pacific. Additionally, militia troops were used to establish and guard internment camps and garrison artillery and engineer units from the militia were also mobilised to assist the regular units that were manning coastal defences.|$|E

5|$|Initially, geneticists {{assumed that}} the {{junction}} would adopt a parallel rather than antiparallel conformation, because that would place the homologous duplexes in closer alignment to each other. Chemical analysis in the 1980s showed that the junction actually preferred the antiparallel conformation, a finding <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> controversial, and Robin Holliday himself initially doubted the findings. The antiparallel structure later became widely accepted due to X-ray crystallography data on in vitro molecules, although as of 2004 the implications for the in vivo structure remained unclear, especially {{the structure of the}} junctions is often altered by proteins bound to it.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{in areas}} where the new wages were applied, {{factories}} would struggle to recruit workers for important tasks because the reform had given a low pay grade to a task <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> to require a lower level of skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low pay grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable to recruit workers to operate them.|$|E
5|$|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences {{has invited}} the film {{industries}} of various countries {{to submit their}} best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956.

5|$|The Presidio La Bahía {{was moved}} from the Guadalupe River to Goliad on the San Antonio River in 1749. Within five years, a new mission for the Karankawa tribes, Nuestra Señora del Rosario de los Cuhanes, was built {{upstream}} of the presidio. This mission survived for many years. Despite the new missions and presidios, Texas {{was one of the}} least populated provinces on the northern frontier of New Spain. By 1760, almost 1,200Hispanic people lived in Texas, with half in San Antonio, 350 at Los Adaes, and 260 at La Bahía. Other Spaniards lived in what is now the El Paso area, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> part of New Mexico and not part of Texas.|$|E
5|$|The West Coast Express was an {{ice hockey}} line that {{played for the}} National Hockey League's (NHL) Vancouver Canucks from 2002 to 2006. Named after Vancouver's {{commuter}} rail service, the line consisted of Markus Naslund at left wing, Brendan Morrison at centre, and Todd Bertuzzi playing right wing. The West Coast Express was a high scoring line <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> {{to be one of}} the best lines in hockey during its tenure.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{series of}} Kashimashi was {{produced}} by Studio Hibari and directed by Nobuaki Nakanishi. The series aired on TV Tokyo in Japan from January 11 to March 29, 2006, ending with twelve regular episodes. The episodes were released on seven DVD compilations released between April 26 and October 27, 2006, each containing two episodes. An original video animation (OVA) episode was released with the final DVD which changed the ending from the original television broadcast. There was a small additional portion during the bra shopping scene in episode two <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> adult enough to be censored out of the television broadcast, but which {{was included in the}} DVD release. Bandai Visual released a DVD box set of Kashimashi in Japan on June 25, 2010.|$|E

5|$|Tallon's {{little left}} finger swelled {{up after the}} Third Test and he {{exacerbated}} the injury during a tour match against Middlesex, ruling {{him out of the}} Fourth Test at Headingley, which Australia won to secure the series. He returned for the Fifth Test at The Oval, taking three catches, including an acrobatic catch of Len Hutton down the leg side <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> the catch of the season. He scored 31 as Australia sealed the series 40 with an innings win. When the last match of the tour against Scotland in Aberdeen became safe, with Australia in an unassailable position, Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket-keeping pads and try his luck at bowling leg spin. Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first-class cricket, where he delivered 301 balls, the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match.|$|E
5|$|The Expendables 2 {{contains}} approximately 1,547 {{digital effect}} shots. The main effects studio was Worldwide FX (WWFX), which produced 1,186 of the shots, and a further 800 shots which were discarded {{in response to}} changes to the film's story. Several other studios, including El Ranchito, Malditochrome, Tata Elxsi, Reliance Mediaworks, and , also produced effects shots for the film through WWFX. Digital effect pre-production began in July 2011 and was completed one year later. WWFX's primary facility is situated in Sofia, allowing them to have constant access to the production, and model assets of the sets before their practical versions were built; this enabled WWFX to raise issues relating to the designs early and develop an optimised construction plan. Anything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> to potentially need a computer generated double was photographed and digitally modeled {{even if it was}} not scheduled to appear in the film, which later served useful as the film's story was adjusted, requiring WWFX to rebuild entire scenes.|$|E
5|$|The drop in air {{delivery}} to Korea caused Major General Earle E. Partridge, commanding the Far East Air Forces, to complain on August 10 that the Army was not fully using the airlift's 200 tonne daily capacity. That day, Eighth Army ordered curtailment of delivery by the Red Ball Express and {{increased use of}} the airlift to its maximum capacity. The reason given for this action was a sudden apprehension that the port of Pusan could not process the flow of water-borne supplies in a timely manner. The next day, upon Partridge's suggestion, two 2½-ton trucks were airlifted in a C-119 from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan to Taegu. The Air Force planned to airlift two trucks daily in this manner. As a result, on August 12, Eighth Army ordered the Red Ball Express be discontinued August 15 except on Tuesday and Friday of each week when it would carry cargo <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> too difficult for the planes to handle. Under this arrangement airlift tonnage greatly increased. On August 16, transport planes carried 324tonnes of cargo and 595 passengers; on August 19, 160tonnes of cargo and 381 passengers; on 28 August, 398tonnes of cargo and 343 passengers; and, on August 29, 326tonnes of cargo and 347 passengers.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{felt the}} animation did not exhibit a distinct style envisioned for the show. At {{the time there}} were only a few choices for animation style. Usually, they would follow the style of either Disney, Warner Bros., or Hanna-Barbera. Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons had a universe that was bendy and the characters seemed to be made of rubber. The producers wanted a realistic environment in which the characters and objects could not do anything that was not possible in the real world. One example of AKOM's early work <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>considered</b> by the producers to be too cartoonish was that the doors throughout in the episode were animated with the same rubber effect that they wanted to avoid. The style of Hanna-Barbera featured the use of cartoon sounds, which they did not want either.|$|E
