And for many of us he is the face of {{contemporary}} folk music—few are as smart, as literate and as poetic as Paul. He has spun his story songs for nearly twenty years now, and has eleven studio recordings (with an additional two early recordings on cassette—now available on CD) to his credit. I cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> artist on the acoustic music scene who is better-loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitaker {{played a}} serene, pigeon-raising, bushido-following, mob hit man in , a 1999 film written and {{directed}} by Jim Jarmusch. Many consider this to have been a [...] "definitive role" [...] for Whitaker. In a manner similar to his preparation for Bird, he again immersed himself in his character's world—he studied Eastern philosophy and meditated for long hours [...] "to hone his inner spiritual hitman." [...] Jarmusch has told interviewers that he developed the title character with Whitaker in mind; The New York Times review of the film observed that [...] "t's hard to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> actor who could play a cold-blooded killer with such warmth and humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} Let Me In with Let the Right One In, horror website Bloody Disgusting wrote, [...] "Ultimately, if the Swedish {{version is}} near perfection, Matt Reeves's version achieves complete supremacy. Masterpiece is an overused word, but it's hard to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> so powerful. Let Me In {{is the new}} standard for vampire movies." [...] Acclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote [...] "Let Me In is a genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last 20 years." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film [...] "is more than a respectful remake; 'Let Me In' is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1977, Yoshiki and Toshi {{formed a}} band called Dynamite in their {{hometown}} of Tateyama, Chiba, {{when they were}} just 11 years old. Dynamite {{changed its name to}} Noise in 1978, while they were still in high school. In 1982, Noise disbanded and Yoshiki and Toshi formed a new band, they named it X while they tried to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> name, but the name stuck. X began to actively perform in the Tokyo area in 1985 with a frequently changing lineup. They originally attempted to pitch in with Japan's underground punk movement, but the band did not fit in with it as they were considered too commercial and flamboyant. Their first single, [...] "I'll Kill You" [...] was released on Dada Records in June and the band contributed [...] "Break the Darkness" [...] to the sampler Heavy Metal Force III in November, which also featured a song by Saver Tiger. In November 1985 bassist Taiji (ex:Dementia) joined X, though he left the group shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|The Lancastrian {{regime was}} founded and legitimised by formal lying {{that was both}} public and official. This has been {{described}} as [...] "a series of unconstitutional actions" [...] based [...] "upon three major acts of perjury". The historian K.B. McFarlane found it hard [...] "to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> moment of comparable importance in medieval English political history when the supply of information was so effectively manipulated as it was by Henry IV on this occasion". The Lancastrians patronised poets for panegyric purposes for years before Henry IV ascended the throne, including Geoffrey Chaucer who dedicated The Book of the Duchess to Blanche of Lancaster around 1368. In 1400, poets in the pay of Henry IV were directed to propaganda purposes. John Gower based his Cronica Tripertita on the official Lancastrian accounts of the usurpation:"The Record and Process of the Deposition of Richard II" [...] from 1399. Gower also produced a number of further favourable works including [...] "In praise of peace" [...] which was dedicated to Henry IV.|$|E
500|$|The Return of the King {{continued}} the series' critical success, with Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 95 {{percent of the}} critics were positive. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times believed the film {{to be the best}} of the three, as it [...] "certifies the Ring trilogy as a work of bold ambition at a time of cinematic timidity." [...] Entertainment Weekly film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum was equally praiseworthy of the final chapter. She explained, [...] "I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> film trilogy that ends in such glory, or another monumental work of sustained storytelling that surges ahead with so much inventiveness and ardor. The conclusion of Peter Jackson's masterwork is passionate and literate, detailed and expansive, and it's conceived with a risk-taking flair for old-fashioned movie magic at its most precious, a rarity now that CGI prowess has fallen into the hands of run-of-the-mill studio ring-chasers." [...] The Guardians Peter Bradshaw wrote, [...] "With enormous energy and a passionately exacting eye for detail, Jackson has made the regressive-romantic legend live again. He has given the Tolkien myth a turbo-charged rush into the 21st century." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams writes that, unlike Lennon and McCartney on their 1970 solo albums, [...] "Harrison {{concentrated}} on pure joyous melodies – {{the kind of}} songs that had made the group so loved", and he says of [...] "Awaiting on You All": [...] "Spector repaid Harrison for his benediction on the Ike and Tina Turner album cover by {{turning it into a}} virtual remake of 'River Deep – Mountain High'." [...] Mark Ribowsky, another Spector biographer, writes of the producer's contribution to this and other songs on All Things Must Pass: [...] "Phil's rhythmically pounding basses and drum feels sutured George's sentimentality with cheerful energy and made Indian asceticism into dance music." [...] Simon Leng describes [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] as a [...] "hot gospel stomper" [...] and [...] "the most successful example of Spector's work on the album". Writing for NME Originals in 2005, Adrian Thrills named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] and [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as examples of [...] "a tendency to over-egg the mix" [...] on the otherwise [...] "magnificent" [...] All Things Must Pass, adding: [...] "it is hard to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> big rock album on which the tambourine is shaken quite so relentlessly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chatwin's admiration was effusive: [...] "By common consent, {{the art of}} the {{drop-out}} {{generation is}} a mess -- and the art of Donald Evans is the antithesis of mess. [...] Nor is it niggling. [...] Nor is it precious. [...] Yet I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> artist who expressed more succinctly and beautifully the best aspirations of those years: [...] the flight from war and the machine; the asceticism; the nomadic restlessness; the yearning for sensual cloud-cuckoo-lands; the retreat from public into private obsessions, from the big and noisy to the small and still." ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{in spring}} 1948, actors were filmed on large soundstages mouthing to a {{playback}} {{of the dialogue}} soundtrack. Disney had previously used live-action reference on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, and Fantasia, {{but as part of}} an effort to keep the production cost down, the footage was used to check the plot, timing, and movement of the characters before animating it. The footage was then edited frame-by-frame onto large Photoshat sheets to duplicate, in which the animators found too restrictive as they were not allowed to imagine anything that the live actors did not present since that kind of experimentation might necessitate changes and cost more money. Additionally, the animators were instructed to draw from a certain directorial perspective to avoid difficult shots and angles. Frank Thomas explained, [...] "Anytime you'd <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> way of staging the scene, they'd say: 'We can't get the camera up there'! Well, you could get the animation camera up there! So you had to go with what worked well in live action." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Noise disbanded in 1982, Yoshiki and Toshi {{formed a}} new band, which they named X while {{they tried to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> name, but the name stuck. In 1986, Yoshiki founded his own {{independent}} record label, Extasy Records, in order to distribute the band's music. On December 26, 1987, the band participated in an audition held by CBS/Sony {{which led to a}} recording contract in August of the following year. The band's breakthrough came in 1989 with the release of their second, and major debut, album Blue Blood, which reached number six on the Oricon chart and charted for more than 100 weeks. [...] In 1990, the band received the [...] "Grand Prix New Artist of the Year" [...] award at the 4th Japan Gold Disc Awards. In 1991 they released their hit million-selling album Jealousy, and were the first Japanese metal band to perform in Japan's largest indoor concert venue, the Tokyo Dome. The following year they announced the renaming of the band to X Japan in order to launch an international career with an American album release, however, this ultimately did not happen.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Melinda Henneberger {{responded that}} [...] "we didn’t write more {{because the only}} {{abortion}} story most outlets ever cover in the news pages is every single threat or perceived threat to abortion rights. In fact, that is so fixed a view of what constitutes coverage of that issue that it’s genuinely hard, I think, for many journalists to see a story outside that paradigm as news. That’s {{not so much a}} conscious decision as a reflex, but the effect is one-sided coverage". Explaining why some of her colleagues did not report on the story, Henneberger wrote, [...] "One colleague viewed Gosnell’s alleged atrocities as a local crime story, though I can’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> mass murder, with hundreds of victims, that we ever saw that way. Another said it was just too lurid, though that didn’t keep us from covering Jeffrey Dahmer, or that aspiring cannibal at the NYPD." [...] Writing for Bloomberg View, Jeffrey Goldberg said that this story [...] "upsets a particular narrative about the reality of certain types of abortion, and that reality isn’t something some pro-choice absolutists want to discuss".|$|E
2500|$|The Scream {{was hailed}} as [...] "the best debut album of the year" [...] by Sounds. Critic Peter Silverton gave the album 5 stars out of 5, and the paper listed it at No. 2 in its end-of-year best album list. Record Mirror also {{published}} a 5-star review, saying: The Scream [...] "points to the future, real music for the new age. [...] It is vital, it's moving. It's a ... landmark." [...] Chris Westwood praised the cohesion between the words and the music: [...] "The album's lyrical frame of mind is perfectly reflected {{in the work of}} [...] McKay. [...] Severin and [...] Morris; constantly shifting, restless, controlled agression, they are as essential as Siouxsie." [...] Melody Maker described the sound as [...] "strong, abrasive, visceral and constantly inventive, with a thrust that makes the spaces equal partners to the notes", with the critic comparing the album's textures to that of Wire and Pere Ubu. ZigZag qualified it as a [...] "magnificent record", with reviewer Kris Needs writing: [...] "I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> group who could have made an LP so uncompromising, powerful and disturbing, yet so captivating and enjoyable [...] It is certainly a special classic to join milestones like [...] Diamond Dogs, Roxy 's first and [...] Berlin. This is music of such strength and vision that you just can't not be moved by the time they swing into the final climactic passage of 'Switch', the closing track." [...] Needs qualified the sound as [...] "huge, sometimes awe-inspiring" [...] and commented that drummer Morris created [...] "one of the best drum sounds I've ever heard – the deep echo and floor-shuddering mix accentuating his muted Glitter Band stomp". Critic Adam Sweeting began his review by saying, [...] "This is a chilling, intense masterpiece". Sweeting then noted that the musicians [...] "have perfected a group sound which is powerful but streamlined", adding that [...] "the words and music combine to produce coolly dazzling images".|$|E
