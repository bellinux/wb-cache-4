5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} authorities at Bombay. The report was released on 11 September 1944 and concluded that <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> subsequent explosion on Fort Stikine was an accident. Sabotage was ruled out. The death toll was given as 231 service and port personnel killed, with 476 injured. Civilian casualties were in excess of 500 killed, with 2,408 treated in hospital.|$|E
5|$|The queue {{before the}} Harry Potter {{refurbishment}} was set as a ruined castle where <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>and</b> Ice dragons lived.

5|$|Yusef {{continues}} to manipulate Zainab, {{to the point}} of becoming violent with her. Yusef then tries to encourage Zainab to move to Pakistan, and recruits Amira to manipulate Syed with the same idea.

Upon discovering that the restaurant doesn't belong to Yusef, he reveals to Afia that Yusef started the fire involving Zainab. Afia then tells Yusef she knows he started <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> threatens to tell Zainab if he does not do so first. Yusef admits to Zainab that he started <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> kicks him out of the house, she later forgives Yusef however. Yusef and Zainab then marry.|$|E
5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{spell of}} hot and dry weather through mid-1666, what later {{became known as}} the Great Fire of London started on 2 September 1666 in a bakehouse on Pudding Lane. Fanned by a strong easterly wind and fed by {{stockpiles}} of wood and fuel that had been prepared for the coming colder months, the fire eventually consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including St Paul's Cathedral. Charles and his brother James joined and directed the fire-fighting effort. The public blamed Catholic conspirators for <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>and</b> one Frenchman, Robert Hubert, was hanged {{on the basis of a}} false confession even though he had no hand in starting the fire.|$|E

5|$|Around the 1990s, {{the station}} was modernized. After water shorted out old wires in the station, on March 11, 1999, a major fire {{occurred}} originating in an equipment room on the station's lower level. A 1930s-era relay room, which controlled the interlocking north of the station, was destroyed in the fire. The station was closed for several months, with G service suspended south of Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets and F trains simply bypassing the station at a lower-than-normal operating speed. Signals and switches at the station were replaced and modernized after <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>and</b> again in Fall 2008 when the relay room was rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under {{charter to}} the Uranium Line, caught {{fire in a}} gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire for about two hours, but, realizing the {{severity}} of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of Volturno had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. The westbound Kroonland, already beyond Volturnos location, turned east to aid the burning liner. In the meantime, several of Volturnos lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results: all those aboard the lifeboats were killed as the boats capsized or were smashed by the hull of the heaving ship.|$|E

5|$|Government Ambulance Service – Operating {{separately}} from (although alongside) <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> police {{service of the}} area, these ambulances are funded by local or national government. In some countries, these only tend {{to be found in}} big cities, whereas in countries such as the United Kingdom almost all emergency ambulances are part of a nationwide system under the National Health Service. In Canada ambulance services are normally operated by local municipalities or provincial health agencies as a separate entity from fire or police services.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>and</b> both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E
5|$|In another story, {{based on}} an old folktale-motif, and echoing a similar theme, Demeter was searching for her daughter, Persephone, having taken {{the form of an}} old woman called Doso, and {{received}} a hospitable welcome from Celeus, the King of Eleusis in Attica. As a gift to Celeus, because of his hospitality, Demeter planned to make his son Demophon a god, but she was unable to complete the ritual because his mother Metanira walked in and saw her son in <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> screamed in fright, which angered Demeter, who lamented that foolish mortals do not understand the concept and ritual.|$|E

He served in the U.S. Navy in World War I and worked as a {{bodyguard}} for Samuel Gompers, the labor leader. He joined the New York City Fire Department in April 1922, but found that boring. Having taken both <b>the</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>and</b> Police Department examinations, in January of the following year he joined the New York City Police Department.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two and a}} {{half months}} later, though, the MTA stated that it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems with the security and fire alarm systems were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E
