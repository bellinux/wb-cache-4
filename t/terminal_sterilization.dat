FDA recommendations on sterility of biomaterials are very strict: a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10 – 6 must be guaranteed for biomaterials {{to be used in}} human implants. In the present work, we have explored the potential of supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) in the presence of H 2 O 2 as a low-temperature sterilization process for thermoset materials and their bioactive surfaces. Different conditions allowing for <b>terminal</b> <b>sterilization</b> have been screened and a treatment time–amount of H 2 O 2 relationship proposed.

40|$|Problems {{associated}} with, and {{new strategies}} for, inactivating resistant organisms like Bacillus canaveralius (found at Kennedy Space Center during {{a survey of}} three NASA cleanrooms) have been defined. Identifying the particular component of the spore that allows its heightened resistance can guide the development of sterilization procedures that are targeted to the specific molecules responsible for resistance, while avoiding using unduly harsh methods that jeopardize equipment. The key element of spore resistance is a multilayered protein shell that encases the spore called the spore coat. The coat of the best-studied spore-forming microbe, B. subtilis, consists of at least 45 proteins, {{most of which are}} poorly characterized. Several protective roles for the coat are well characterized including resistance to desiccation, large toxic molecules, ortho-phthalaldehyde, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. One important long-term specific goal is an improved sterilization procedure that will enable NASA to meet planetary protection requirements without a <b>terminal</b> heat <b>sterilization</b> step. This would support the implementation of planetary protection policies for life-detection missions. Typically, hospitals and government agencies use biological indicators to ensure the quality control of sterilization processes.

40|$|For several decades, {{a dose of}} 25 kGy of gamma {{irradiation}} {{has been}} recommended for <b>terminal</b> <b>sterilization</b> of medical products, including bone allografts. Practically, {{the application of a}} given gamma dose varies from tissue bank to tissue bank. While many banks use 25 kGy, some have adopted a higher dose, while some choose lower doses, and others do not use irradiation for <b>terminal</b> <b>sterilization.</b> A revolution in quality control in the tissue banking industry has occurred in line with development of quality assurance standards. These have resulted in significant reductions in the risk of contamination by microorganisms of final graft products. In light of these developments, there is sufficient rationale to re-establish a new standard dose, sufficient enough to sterilize allograft bone, while minimizing the adverse effects of gamma radiation on tissue properties. Using valid modifications, several authors have applied ISO standards to establish a radiation dose for bone allografts that is specific to systems employed in bone banking.

Sterility can be achieved through both <b>terminal</b> <b>sterilization</b> which ensures the Sterility Assurance Level of 10 - 6 level or Probability of Non-Sterile Unit of less than 10 - 6 and aseptic processing which ensures the equivalent of 10 - 3. The Sterility Assurance Levels (SAL) is the statistical probability of a microorganism surviving during the process (Mosely, 2008). Sterilization science continues to pursue {{the most effective means}} of sustaining this regulatory requirement. This is driven in large part by the evolution of sensitive combination products that cannot tolerate the harsh conditions of <b>terminal</b> <b>sterilization.</b> Division 1 and Division 2 are divisions of Company X, a biotechnology company that specializes in the manufacturing of implantable combination drug and medical devices for use in ophthalmic, cardiac, and vascular care and intervention. Trends in sterilization sciences directly impact Company X across all divisions. Observing these trends and influences enables the company to proactively adapt to changes that impact both existing as well as future products. The project investigated the cost of development, validation, and implementation of different sterilization models. The aim of the project was to also provide metrics to be applied as a measurement tool. The metric can be used in making knowledge based decisions on the most cost effective and time efficient sterilization modality for next generation of combination drug device products that meets Regulatory requirements for Sterility Assurance Level. The project closely examined the different <b>terminal</b> <b>sterilization</b> modalities adopted by Division 1 and Division 2, which includes Ethylene Oxide (EO) and Radiation (E-Beam) sterilization, as well as Aseptic processing methods for sensitive implantable combination drug and device. An analysis was performed using Company X combination drug and device products as models to represent the different sterilization modalities. A series of interviews and tours were completed to gather data, analyze, and compare the sterilization validation and production cost. The following sterilization cost evaluation metrics was developed, Production Sterilization Distribution Time, Sterilization Process Time, Sterilization Cost per Unit, Annual Sterilization Capacity, and Sterilization Method Revalidation Cost and an analysis was performed using these metric and measurements. The analysis showed significant differences between the three sterilization modalities. The overall results indicated that the E-beam Radiation sterilization method provided the lowest Production Sterilization Distribution Time, Sterilization Process Time, Sterilization Cost per Unit, Sterilization Method Revalidation Cost, and Labor Cost. E-beam Radiation also provided the highest Annual Sterilization Capacity when compared to Ethylene Oxide and Aseptic Processing methods. The approach and metrics developed in this project have application in investigation of cost effectiveness of other sterilization methods. Further research can use the developed metrics to evaluate sterilization methods for a range of Sterility Assurance Levels (SAL) that are deemed safe and on site sterilization models such as Hydrogen Peroxide (H 2 O 2) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2), that offer similar if not the same advantages as on site E-Beam.

Irradiation following treatment with peracetic acid was compared to peracetic acid treatment alone and the stability of grafts following long-term storage assessed. Irradiation did not affect total collagen content or biocompatibility (determined using a contact cytotoxicity assay) of the grafts, but slightly increased the amount of denatured collagen in and decreased the thermal denaturation temperature of the tissue in a dose dependant fashion. Biomechanical properties of the grafts were altered by irradiation (reduced ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus, increased failure strain), but remained superior to reported properties of the native human ACL. Long term storage at 4 °C had no negative effects on the grafts.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that conven-tional polyethylene liners cross-linked by sterilization with {{gamma radiation}} in air had better in vivo wear performance than non-cross-linked liners sterilized with gas plasma. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the wear rates {{in a series of}} hips treated with a Duraloc 100 cup, a 28 -mm femoral head, and an Enduron liner that had been sterilized with either gamma radiation (sixty-one hips followed for a mean of 5. 2 years) or gas plasma (sixty-three hips followed for a mean of 3. 9 years). The irradiated liners had been stored with access to ambient oxygen for an average of 1. 0 year (range, 0. 05 to 5. 72 years) prior to implantation. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the effect of the sterilization method on the wear rate while accounting for the possible influence of other factors, including liner geometry, femoral head material, patient gender, cup abduc-tion angle, and age at surgery. Results: The polyethylene liners that had been sterilized with gamma radiation in air had a significantly lower wear rate than did the gas-plasma-sterilized liners (0. 097 compared with 0. 19 mm/yr, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Extracellular {{matrices}} {{derived from}} animal tissues for human tissue repairs are processed by various methods of physical, chemical, or enzymatic decellularization, viral inactivation, and <b>terminal</b> <b>sterilization.</b> The mechanisms {{of action in}} tissue repair vary among bioscaffolds and are suggested {{to be associated with}} process-induced extracellular matrix modifications. We compared three non-cross-linked, commercially available extracellular matrix scaffolds (Strattice, Veritas, and XenMatrix), and correlated extracellular matrix alterations to in vivo biological responses upon implantation in non-human primates. Structural evaluation showed significant differences in retaining native tissue extracellular matrix histology and ultrastructural features among bioscaffolds. Tissue processing may cause both the condensation of collagen fibers and fragmentation or separation of collagen bundles. Calorimetric analysis showed significant differences in the stability of bioscaffolds. The intrinsic denaturation temperature was measured to be 51 °C, 38 °C, and 44 °C for Strattice, Veritas, and XenMatrix, respectively, demonstrating more extracellular matrix modifications in the Veritas and XenMatrix scaffolds. Consequently, the susceptibility to collagenase degradation was increased in Veritas and XenMatrix when compared to their respective source tissues. Using a non-human primate model, three bioscaffolds were found to elicit different biological responses, have distinct mechanisms of action, and yield various outcomes of tissue repair. Strattice permitted cell repopulation and was remodeled over 6 months. Veritas was unstable at body temperature, resulting in rapid absorption with moderate inflammation. XenMatrix caused severe inflammation and sustained immune reactions. This study demonstrates that extracellular matrix alterations significantly affect biological responses in soft tissue repair and regeneration.

Manufacturing of kits requires an aseptic facility which need to be well designed and maintained according to cGMP, since mostly kits can not be terminally sterilized. Radiopharmaceuticals as pharmaceuticals containing radionuclide is assumed to have an autosterilization property, but correlation between radioactivity and capability of killing microorganisms has to be studied so far. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of radioactivity on the autosterilization process of radiopharmaceuticals. The study was carried out by adding Tc- 99 m of various radioactivity into non-sterile tetrofosmin kits, then the samples were tested for sterility. Sterile tetrofosmin kit and non-sterile kit with no Tc- 99 m added will be used as a negative control and positive control respectively. The sterility was tested using standard direct inoculation method, by inoculating samples in culture media for both bacteria and fungi and observing qualitatively within 14 days.

40|$|Viscous poly(ortho ester) (POE), a {{promising}} polymer for controlled release {{is being investigated}} as an injectable drug delivery system for peptides, for antiproliferative agents after glaucoma filtering surgery and for antibiotics {{in the treatment of}} periodontitis. Due to the chemical lability of POE, the strategies for obtaining a sterile product are limited to aseptic processing and <b>terminal</b> <b>sterilization</b> using high energy radiation. In {{the first part of the}} present investigation, we used electron-paramagnetic-resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to evaluate radical formation and radical-induced polymer degradation after irradiation treatment. Due to the viscous nature of POE, radicals were only found at low temperatures or by using the method of ‘spin-trapping’. Several radical species could be distinguished by a variation of the microwave power and the differences of the thermal stability of the radicals. The incorporation of 5 -fluorouracil accelerates the degradation of the polymer. In the second part, we have compared the effects of the two commonly applied methods for irradiation sterilization (i. e. gamma and beta rays) on POE and on POE with incorporated 5 -fluorouracil and compared these methods to aseptically prepared devices. In addition, we have checked the possibility of preventing radical-induced degradation using two different protecting agents: α-tocopherol at a concentration of 0. 1 % (w/w) and sterilization under nitrogen monoxide. The weight and number average molecular weight of POE decreased drastically after irradiation treatment and subsequent to irradiation, an accelerated degradation was observed. Generally it was found that higher molecular weight polymers are more affected and that gamma irradiation leads to more degradation than beta treatment. Also, the addition of protecting agents did not significantly prevent polymer degradation. Therefore, we have concluded that irradiation sterilization of POE is not a viable process and aseptic preparation is preferred. Without sterilization POE is stable for about 1 year when kept as monodoses at low temperatures...|$|E

To understand all of the factors that might contribute to delamination, a statistical design of experiments was implemented to describe this loss of chemical integrity for glass vials. Phase I of this study focused on the effects of thermal exposure (prior to product filling) on the surface chemistry of glass vials. Even though such temperatures are below the glass transition temperature for the glass, and parenteral compounds are injected directly into the body, data must be collected to show that the glass was not phase separating. Phase II of these studies examined the combined effects of thermal exposure, glass chemistry, and exposure to pharmaceutically relevant molecules on glass delamination. A variety of tools was used to examine the glass and the solution contained in the vial including: scanning electron microscopy and dynamic secondary ion mass spectroscopy for the glass; and visual examination, pH measurements, laser particle counting, and inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry for the analysis of the solution. The combined results of phase I and II showed depyrogenation does not {{play a significant role in}} delamination. <b>Terminal</b> <b>sterilization,</b> glass chemistry, and solution chemistry are the key factors in {{the generation}} of glass flakes.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Bone allografts carry {{a risk of}} infection, so <b>terminal</b> <b>sterilization</b> by gamma {{irradiation}} at 25 kGy is recommended; but is deleterious to bone quality. Contemporary bone banking significantly reduces initial allograft bioburden, {{questioning the}} need to sterilize at 25 kGy. METHODS:We inoculated allograft bone with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus pumilus, then exposed them to gamma irradiation at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 kGy. Mechanical and biological properties of allografts were also assessed. Our aim was to determine an optimal dose that achieves sterility assurance while minimizing deleterious effects on allograft tissue. RESULTS: 20 - 25 kGy eliminated both organisms at concentrations from 101 to 103 CFU, while 10 - 15 kGy sterilized bone samples to a bioburden concentration of 102 CFU. Irradiation did not generate pro-inflammatory bone surfaces, as evidenced by macrophage activation, nor did it affect attachment or proliferation of osteoblasts. At doses = 10 kGy, the toughness of cortical bone was reduced (P< 0. 05), and attachment and fusion of osteoclasts onto irradiated bone declined at 20 and 25 kGy (P< 0. 05). There was no change in collagen cross-links, but a significant dose-response increase in denatured collagen (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS:Our mechanical and cell biological data converge on 15 kGy as a threshold for radiation sterilization of bone allografts. Between 5 and 15 kGy, bone banks can undertake validation that provides allografts with an acceptable sterility assurance level, improving their strength and biocompatibility significantly. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:The application of radiation sterilization doses between 5 and 15 kGy will improve bone allograft mechanical performance and promote integration, while retaining sterility assurance levels. Improved quality of allograft bone will promote superior clinical outcomes. Griffith Health, School of Medical ScienceFull Tex...|$|E

40|$|The common {{sterilization}} {{techniques are}} based on physical processes that involve, for example, the use of autoclaves or systems to radiation such as γ-rays that can cause a structural change of the polymer treated. Therefore, the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) is an excellent alternative, as it does not induce any variation of biomaterials treated (Perrut M., 2012). It's a good candidate because is readily available at low cost, non-toxic and non-flammable, it has an easily accessible critical point (7. 38 MPa and 304. 2 K) and excellent transport properties and wettability (White A. et al., 2005). We report {{the development of a}} supercritical CO 2 based process capable of sterilization of PLLA [poly(L-lactic acid) ] scaffolds {{that can be used for}} tissue engineering applications. The PLLA scaffolds were contaminated by the gram negative bacterium E. coli or environmental microorganisms: the amount of bacteria in each scaffold was determinated by colony-forming unit (CFU). Than they were subjected to different (for temperature or pressure values) supercritical CO 2 processes. A good sterilization was obtain with a pressure of 150 bar for only 15 minutes of treatment at 37 °C. The process does not alter crystallinity and melting temperatures of the scaffolds, as demonstrated by DSC analysis (differential scanning calorimetry) of the scaffolds treated and not. Therefore, the treatment does not significantly alter the properties of the sample. The CO 2 treatment does not intact the biocompatibility of the scaffolds as demonstrated by MTS assay (viability assay) of SK-HEP- 1 tumour cells growth on the surface and the internal pores of the scaffolds. These results suggest that the scCO 2 can be used as a perfect method of sterilization for PLLA scaffolds for their possible use for tissue engineering applications. 	Michel Perrut, 2012 Sterilization and virus inactivation by supercritical fluids.

40|$|Microencapsulation of {{medicines}} in modern polymeric biomaterials plays {{a crucial role}} in success of long-term injectable depots, drug-eluting stents, tissue engineering scaffolds, and blood-circulating nanoparticles. Until now, drugs are most commonly dissolved in organic solvent, which has several disadvantages. Described here is a new microencapsulation paradigm based on the polymer’s own natural “self-healing” capacity to microencapsulate biomacromolecules in aqueous media without use of organic solvents. Self-healing microencapsulation (SM) was shown to reproducibly produce poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles with high peptide and protein loadings of 1 - 10 % (w/w), that was dependent on porous SM-microparticle excipients (e. g. MgCO 3 and trehalose), manufacturing parameters, protein loading solution concentration, and overall porosity. Confocal microscopy of microspheres loaded with fluorescently-labeled BSA showed loaded protein concentrated in submicron domains throughout the microparticle. A model therapeutic peptide, leuprolide acetate, was encapsulated successfully via the self-healing microencapsulation technique. Controlled release over 30 and 60 days for both proteins and the peptide was demonstrated. Self-healing microencapsulation of a model protein lysozyme showed virtually no aggregation or enzymatic activity loss when high amounts of sucrose were loaded in conjunction with the protein, which is currently not possible with traditional encapsulation methods due to the resulting high initial burst release and low encapsulation efficiencies. Self-healing encapsulated BSA showed virtually no acid-induced aggregation (< 2 %) after 30 d of release indicating the ability to successfully neutralize acid PLGA using the new encapsulation approach. The self-healing polymer process was strongly affected by different Hofmeister salts, known for their ability to influence interfacial tension. These data were consistent with the hypothesis that the polymer self-healing is driven in part by the high interfacial tension between the hydrophobic polymer and water which causes a minimization of interfacial area. Protein in microspheres loaded via self-healing microencapsulation was not exposed to the numerous destabilizing processes normally associated with protein-loaded microsphere manufacturing. <b>Terminal</b> <b>sterilization</b> of PLGA microspheres without concerns of protein stability is now theoretically possible. The new paradigm opens the door to improved compatibility with large biotechnology-derived drugs, potentially lower manufacturing cost, the ability to create new biomaterial architectures, and more practical use among other scientists and clinicians...|$|E
