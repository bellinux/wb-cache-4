5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye.

The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} the mortality rates by age, sex, race, blood type, primary diagnosis, treatment and transplantation history of 8432 patients in Canada for whom {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD) was diagnosed between 1981 and 1986. Significant differences in the probability of dying were found between those with and without diabetes mellitus, between <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> received a renal transplant and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not, between white and nonwhite patients and between various age groups. The mortality rates of the ESRD patients were {{at least three times}} higher than those of the general Canadian population. Primary diagnosis and treatment were significantly associated with the risk of dying among the ESRD patients. For <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> received a transplant, the length of time spent waiting for a transplant was positively associated with the risk of death from ESRD. Patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> received peritoneal dialysis before transplantation had a higher risk of death than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> received either hemodialysis (risk ratio 1. 3) or transplantation (risk ratio 3. 2) as the first treatment.
