5000|$|Some <b>tea</b> <b>cosies</b> are hand-knitted, {{resembling}} woollen hats, {{some even}} feature a [...] "bobble" [...] (pom-pom) on top, which may {{also serve as}} a handle to remove or lift the <b>tea</b> <b>cosy.</b> Sometimes, if the tea is served in a restaurant or in a hotel, the teapot is <b>covered</b> with a <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> that has a metal exterior to protect the inner fabric of the cosy from wear and tear and also to further improve the insulation of the teapot. A special <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> is the so-called tea lugger, which enables the hot teapot to be carried around easily.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the history}} of the <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> may begin when tea was {{introduced}} to Britain in the 1660s, the first documented use of a <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> in Britain was in 1867. It is probably the Duchess of Bedford who, by establishing the activity of afternoon tea in 1840, would have brought the popularity of the <b>tea</b> <b>cosy.</b> Afternoon <b>tea</b> was the time for networking and keeping up to date with aristocracy gossip and topical news. With all the chatter at teatime the teapot would get cold, which would have at times cut short some tea parties. And so, the <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> came about. <b>Tea</b> <b>cosies</b> then flourished during the late 19th century, where they appeared in many households across Britain, motivated by the obsession of decorating and covering objects characteristic of the Victorian era.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> (American English: <b>tea</b> cozy) or tea warmer is a {{cover for}} a teapot, {{traditionally}} made of cloth. It insulates a teapot, keeping the contents warm. Their use predates the invention of vacuum bottles {{as a means of}} keeping hot liquids hot. <b>Tea</b> <b>cosies</b> may have padded inserts that can be removed and washed.|$|R
5000|$|To keep teapots hot after tea {{is first}} brewed, early English {{households}} employed the <b>tea</b> <b>cosy,</b> a padded fabric covering, {{much like a}} hat, that slips over the tea pot. Often decorated with lace or log cabin motifs in the early 1900s, the modern <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> has come back into fashion with the resurgence of loose leaf tea ateliers.|$|R

50|$|Tea making {{techniques}} {{vary from}} home to home, and person to person, but tea is typically made from loose tea leaves and steeped {{for a couple of}} minutes before serving. A teapot and <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> may be used, if time permits, or tea may be steeped directly in the kettle off the heat. After steeping, the tea is poured into cups through a strainer. Milk may be added before or after the tea, but sugar is typically offered separately so that each individual may add sugar according to his or her own taste. Teabags are usually reserved for when time constraints do not enable one to prepare tea from loose tea leaves.|$|R
50|$|When the Second World War began, he {{returned}} home on a Belgian ship which struck a sea mine and sank {{off the coast of}} Great Britain, Troughton escaping in a lifeboat. In 1940, he joined the Royal Navy and was commissioned as a lieutenant with the RNVR, being first employed on East Coast Convoy duty from February to August 1941, and then with Coastal Forces' Motor Gun Boats based at Great Yarmouth from November 1942 to 1945. During his service with the M.G.B.'s, he was on one occasion involved in an action against Kriegsmarine E-boats which resulted in one of the enemy craft being destroyed by ramming, whilst Troughton's boat and another destroyed two more with their gunfire. His decorations included the 1939-45 Star, and Atlantic Star, and he was mentioned in dispatches. He used to wear a <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> on his head in cold weather in the North Sea.|$|R
5000|$|... (voiced by S. Scott Bullock) is Lu's father, and the Governor of the Island.

He is then apt to start crying. He has been the island's Governor for many years.

50|$|A teapot is {{a vessel}} used for {{steeping}} tea leaves or an herbal mix in boiling or near-boiling water, and for serving the resulting infusion {{which is called}} tea. Dry tea is available either in tea bags or as loose tea, in which case a tea infuser or tea strainer may be of some assistance, either to hold the leaves as they steep or to catch the leaves inside the teapot when the tea is poured. Teapots usually have an opening with a lid at their top, where the dry tea and hot water are added, a handle for holding by hand and a spout through which the tea is served. Some teapots have a strainer built-in on the inner edge of the spout. A small air hole in the lid is often created to stop the spout from dripping and splashing when tea is poured. In modern times, a thermal <b>cover</b> called a <b>tea</b> <b>cosy</b> {{may be used to}} enhance the steeping process or to prevent the contents of the teapot from cooling too rapidly.|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} the {{exhibition}} is taken {{from one of the}} most famous quotes from 19 th century English interior designer, poet and socialist William Morris. The exhibition consists in two works: Two Squares and The Morris Kitsch Archive. The first, Two Squares, reproduces from El Lissitzky’s Of Two Squares 1920. This short picture book for children tells the story about two squares, one red, one black that transform the world. Each Lissitzky image is painted over a different William Morris wallpaper, constructing a dialogue between Lissitzky’s revolutionary narrative and Morris’ utopian visions of fecundity. The second, Morris Kitsch Archive, is a collection of over 450 images of domestic objects to which Morris patterns have been applied, including bags, clothes, cushions, mugs, sofas, stationary, <b>tea</b> <b>cosies</b> and tools. The archive illustrates how Morris designs have been appropriated for a mass consumer society, a development that has made Morris design widely available at the expense of the qualities and values inherent to his original project. The two works face each other across the gallery, suggesting two alternate histories, one a possibility, the other a reality...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{popularity of}} the pincushion dolls continued into the early 20th century, and some styles reflect Art Deco or similar 20th-century styles. The most collectable examples are from pre-World War II Dresden and Meissen, which may sell for around $500 US when the condition is perfect. More common designs in imperfect condition sell for less than $25 US. Similar dolls were produced to top the covers of tissue boxes, jewelry boxes, or <b>tea</b> pot <b>cosies.</b> Some uncommon examples are nude and have a risque style.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to offer a {{critical}} analysis of representations of gender violence and resistance to such violence in selected novels by Zimbabwean women writers. A great deal of scholarship on Zimbabwean women writers focuses on well-known authors such as Yvonne Vera and Tsitsi Dangarembga. Even here, the critical emphasis tends to be on the representation of women’s suffering under patriarchy and their status as victims. Although the exposure of gendered suffering is important, these studies often fail to take into consideration the female characters’ agency and survival strategies, including how they go about rebuilding lives and identities in the aftermath of violence. This thesis argues that the fictional texts of other, lesser known Zimbabwean authors are similarly worthy of critical scrutiny, yielding as they can important insights into female characters’ resistance to gender violence. The current study analyses Zimbabwean women writers’ literary contributions to discourses on gender-based violence and explores how female characters have embraced the concept of agency to recreate their identities and to introduce a new gender ethos into the contexts of lives that are often shaped by severe restrictions and oppression. Violence is a phenomenon that is always shaped by specific cultural, ideological and socio-economic forces. As the study shows, characters’ identities are constituted by the complex intersections of a number of markers of difference, including their gender, race and class. This study thus regards identity as intersectional and takes all these factors into consideration in its analysis of the representations of violence and resistance in the selected texts. The study also aims to determine whether these literary representations offer any solutions to the difficulties of characters affected by or living with violence. The works critiqued are Lillian Masitera’s The Trail (2000), Valerie Tagwira’s The Uncertainty of Hope (2006), Virginia Phiri’s Highway Queen (2010) and Violet Masilo’s The African <b>Tea</b> <b>Cosy</b> (2010).
