5|$|The {{interiors}} of most Norfolk churches contain much pre-Reformation graffiti, {{unless they have}} been heavily limewashed or resurfaced. The churches of the Glaven ports in general, and Blakeney in particular, conform to this pattern. St Nicholas has an extensive array of prayers, merchant's marks and other symbols, but is notable for {{the large number of}} depictions of ships, at least 30, heavily concentrated in the nave towards the eastern end of the south aisle. There is a side altar there of unknown dedication, and an empty niche that would have once held the image of a saint. The pillars were painted red in the Middle Ages, and ship images scratched into the soft, chalky stone would have been much more conspicuous <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b> It is likely that the images, mostly of smaller ships, were created as votive offerings by the seafaring inhabitants of the port. The carving of ship graffiti in religious buildings is a tradition in ports going back to the Bronze Age, and has been found across Europe.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{a sudden}} decline in sea level, {{intermittent}} periods of ocean-bottom hyperoxia and anoxia (high-oxygen and low- or zero-oxygen conditions) {{may have caused}} the 13C/12C ratio fluctuations in the Early Triassic; and global anoxia may {{have been responsible for}} the end-Permian blip. The continents of the end-Permian and early Triassic were more clustered in the tropics <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> and large tropical rivers would have dumped sediment into smaller, partially enclosed ocean basins at low latitudes. Such conditions favor oxic and anoxic episodes; oxic/anoxic conditions would result in a rapid release/burial, respectively, of large amounts of organic carbon, which has a low 13C/12C ratio because biochemical processes use the lighter isotopes more. That or another organic-based reason may have been responsible for both that and a late Proterozoic/Cambrian pattern of fluctuating 13C/12C ratios.|$|E

The floor-cloth deadened his footsteps as he moved in that direction through the obscurity, which was broken only by the faintest reflected night-light from without.|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska as a whole, and Interior Alaska in particular, was sparsely settled. The 1960 United States Census {{recorded}} just 226,127 people as residents of Alaska, {{making it the}} least-populated state in the United States at that time. Interior Alaska contained about 28,000 residents, and promoters suggested that the dam's benefits would vastly outweigh the costs to the few residents who would be displaced. An unnamed Gruening staffer once said the area to be flooded by the dam was worthless, containing [...] "not more than ten flush toilets. Search the whole world {{and it would be}} difficult to find an equivalent area with so little to be lost through flooding." [...] In a 1963 letter responding to a Sports Illustrated article about the dam, Gruening wrote, As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they could not but be better off <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now.</b> Their villages are flooded intermittently by the Yukon. Their habitations are miserable and their livelihood a bare subsistence supplemented by relief.

500|$|The Romans' {{part in the}} {{clearances}} of {{the once}} extensive Caledonian forest remains a matter of debate. That these forests were once considerably more extensive <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> is not in dispute, but the timing and causes of the reduction are. The 16th-century writer Hector Boece believed that the woods in Roman times stretched north from Stirling into Atholl and Lochaber and was inhabited by white bulls with [...] "crisp and curland mane, like feirs lionis". Later historians such as P. F. Tytler and W. F. Skene followed suit as did the 20th-century naturalist Frank Fraser Darling. Modern techniques, including palynology and dendrochronology suggest a more complex picture. Changing post-glacial climates may have allowed for a maximum forest cover between 4000 and 3000 and deforestation of the Southern uplands, caused both climatically and anthropogenically, was well underway {{by the time the}} legions arrived. Extensive analyses of Black Loch in Fife suggest that arable land spread at the expense of forest from about 2000 until the 1st-century Roman advance. Thereafter, there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for a period of five centuries, suggesting the invasions had a very negative impact on the native population. The situation outside the Roman-held areas is harder to assess, but the long-term influence of Rome may not have been substantial.|$|E
2500|$|The {{need for}} stable orbits rules out stars with systems of planets that contain large planets with orbits {{close to the}} host star (called [...] "hot Jupiters"). It is {{believed}} that hot Jupiters formed much further from their parent stars <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> (see planetary migration), and have migrated inwards to their current orbits. In the process, they would have catastrophically disrupted the orbits of any planets in the habitable zone. To exacerbate matters, Hot Jupiters are much more common orbiting F and G class stars.|$|E
2500|$|The same claim {{has been}} made for a version in the Vernon collection. The Vernon Mona Lisa is {{particularly}} interesting because it was originally part of the collection at the Louvre. Another version, dating from c. 1616, was given in c. 1790 to Joshua Reynolds by the Duke of Leeds {{in exchange for a}} Reynolds self-portrait. Reynolds thought it to be the real painting and the French one a copy, which has now been disproved. It is, however, useful in that it was copied when the original's colors were far brighter <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> and so it gives some sense of the original's appearance 'as new'.

5000|$|The main {{criticism}} of many purely phonemic reform proposals is that written {{language is not}} a purely phonemic analog of the spoken word. While reformers might argue that the units of understanding are phonemes, critics argue that the basic units are words. Some of the most phonemic spelling reform proposals might re-spell closely related words less alike <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> spelled <b>now,</b> such as electric, electricity and electrician, or (with full vowel reform) photo, photograph and photography.

2500|$|Photographers find perp walks {{their second}} most-dreaded {{assignment}} after {{going to the}} home of someone who has recently died to ask for a picture. They must wait a long time for a period of a few seconds in which they will be competing with a potentially large group of other photographers and television crews. This presents the possibility that they can be trampled beneath the group, as depicted in the 1994 film The Paper, and the difficulty of photographing a defendant who may be looking downward to keep his face from view. Marty Lederhandler, an Associated Press photographer who worked for {{the last half of the}} 20th century and shot the perp walks of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, as well as David Berkowitz, describes the perp walk as [...] "it's, 'He'll be out in 10 minutes.'

2500|$|Blackburne was {{regularly}} {{one of the}} world's {{top five}} players from 1871 to 1889, although Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker and, during his brief prime, Johannes Zukertort were clearly better players; and he remained in the top 20 until 1902, when he was 61 years old. His best results were in international tournaments. Although tournaments were much less frequent then <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>now,</b> Blackburne played in nearly one strong tournament per year from 1870 to 1899; in particular he competed regularly in the German Chess Championship, which was an open tournament. In the 1870s and 1880s he was almost always a high prize-winner. His best results were 1st equal with Steinitz at Vienna 1873, where the commentators nicknamed Blackburne [...] "the Black Death" [...] (Steinitz won the play-off); 1st in London 1876 with a score of 10/11, ahead of Zukertort; and 1st in Berlin 1881, 3 points ahead of Zukertort. He also achieved 2nd place in: a strong mini-tournament in London 1872 (behind Steinitz but ahead of Zukertort), George Alcock MacDonnell and De Vere; shared 2nd place at Hamburg 1885 (with Siegbert Tarrasch, James Mason, Berthold Englisch and Max Weiss; behind Isidor Gunsberg; ahead of George Henry Mackenzie and five others); shared 2nd place at Frankfurt 1887 (with Weiss; behind Mackenzie; ahead of Curt von Bardeleben, Tarrasch and several others). His worst result from this 20-year period was 6th place in the 1882 Vienna [...] "super-tournament", the one occasion on which all his major rivals placed ahead of him.|$|E
