5|$|During the Iron Age, a Celtic {{language}} and culture emerged in Ireland. How and when the island of Ireland became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts {{being one of the}} more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. Today, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one school of thought on how this occurred in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Chilean {{angelshark}} (Squatina armata) of {{the southeastern}} Pacific was synonymized with this species by Kato, Springer and Wagner in 1967, but was later tentatively recognized as a separate species again by Leonard Compagno. The taxonomic status of angel sharks in the southeastern Pacific – whether they are S. californica, S. armata, or if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one Squatina species in the region – remains unresolved. The angel sharks inhabiting the Gulf of California may also represent a different species, as they mature at a much smaller size than those {{from the rest of}} their range.|$|E

5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea, {{also known}} as the giant fossa, is an extinct species of {{carnivore}} from Madagascar in the family Eupleridae, which is most closely related to the mongooses and includes all Malagasy carnivorans. It was first described in 1902, and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative, the living fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox). C.spelea is larger than the fossa, but otherwise similar. The two have not always been accepted as distinct species. When and how the larger form became extinct is unknown; there is some anecdotal evidence, including reports of very large fossas, that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one surviving species.|$|E
5|$|For {{surfaces}} in higher dimensions, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one definition of curvature, including extrinsic (embedding-dependent) {{measures such as}} the mean curvature and intrinsic measures such as the Gaussian curvature and Ricci curvature. Correspondingly, {{there are several ways}} of defining geometric flows based on curvature, including the mean curvature flow (in which the normal speed of an embedded surface is its mean curvature), the Ricci flow (an intrinsic flow on the metric of a space based on its Ricci curvature) and the Willmore flow (the gradient flow for an energy functional combining the mean curvature and Gaussian curvature). The curve-shortening flow is a special case of the mean curvature flow for one-dimensional curves.|$|E
5|$|The Chancellor is {{the highest}} officer and the {{ceremonial}} head of the university. The office was created in 1874 and first filled in 1877, although it was only enshrined in law in 1882 after its amendment into the Royal Charter of 1841. The responsibilities of the chancellor includes presiding over convocations, conferring degrees, chairing the annual meetings of the Council and is an ex officio, voting member of the Board of Trustees. A person is elected {{to the office of}} chancellor on a three-year term by the Council unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one candidate, in which case an election is conducted among Queen's graduates.|$|E

5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate the cloud shape. Cirrus is {{indicated}} by a couple hooks, cumulus are indicated by a mound shape, with cumulonimbus indicated with an upside down trapezoid {{on top of the}} cumulus symbol to indicate its anvil. When <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one cloud type present per level, the cloud type with the highest priority is included. Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether or not a weather front has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E
