Before The Rock made his entrance, Angle and Triple H fought at ringside, with Triple H delivering a Pedigree on Angle on the commentator's announce table, which broke prematurely, resulting in Angle being Kayfabe injured. After the incident, The Rock made his entrance down to the ring. He wrestled Triple H as Angle was attended by EMTs, who transported Angle backstage. Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley then {{came down to the}} ring and attempted to interfere by hitting The Rock with the WWF Championship belt.

Angle returned to the ring midway through the match, alongside McMahon, and attacked Triple H. As Triple H recuperated, Angle called McMahon to give him a sledgehammer, but Angle and Triple H brawled over the sledgehammer, resulting in Triple H accidentally hitting McMahon. This situation allowed The Rock to <b>throw</b> <b>Angle</b> over the top rope onto ringside and deliver a People's Elbow on Triple H into a pinfall to win the match and retain the WWF Championship.|$|E

50|$|The circular-throw {{vibrating}} screen generates a rotating acceleration vector {{and the screen}} must maintain a steep <b>throwing</b> <b>angle</b> to prevent transportation along the screen deck. The deck is commonly constructed to have an angle {{within the range of}} 10° to 18°, in order to develop adequate particle movement. An Increase of deck angle speeds particle motion with proportional relationship to particle size. This decreases residence time and size stratification along the mesh screen. However, if the angle is greater than 20°, efficiency decreases due to reduction of effective mesh area. Effect of deck angle on efficiency is also influenced by particle density. In mining the optimal inclination angle is about 15°. Exceptions are the dewatering screens at 3° to 5° and steep screens at 20° to 40°.|$|R

The match began with Angle and Lesnar facing each other, before attacking the Big Show. Big Show <b>threw</b> <b>Angle</b> outside {{the ring and}} chokeslammed Lesnar. He covered Lesnar but didn't score a pinfall. The Big Show {{controlled}} the match early on before Lesnar shoulder blocked and went for an F5 but Big Show countered. Angle returned to the ring with trash can lids and both he and Lesnar used them against Big Show. The Big Show tried to chokeslam both men simultaneously, but Angle and Lesnar teamed up to chokeslam Big Show. Later in the match, Angle began to bleed. Big Show placed Lesnar on the top turnbuckle and climbed up to punch Lesnar, but Angle distracted both men {{and went down to}} the mat, with Big Show still above him, allowing Lesnar to powerbomb and cover Big Show. Angle broke the cover by hitting Lesnar with a chair to the back, following with a chair shot to the head, bloodying Lesnar, too. Angle and Big Show proceeded to fight outside the ring, and Angle Angle Slammed Big Show on the Spanish announcers' table. Afterward, Lesnar and Angle fought each other back inside the ring, and Lesnar <b>threw</b> <b>Angle</b> to the outside again. The Big Show returned to the ring and chokeslammed Lesnar and Angle simultaneously, and covered both men but couldn't score a pinfall.

As Angle was outside, Guerrero loosened his ring boot. As Angle returned to the ring, he tried to apply the hold again. This time, Guerrero pushed Angle off with his other foot, allowing him to break free from Angle's hold.

The optimal throwing conditions are determined numerically by maximising the expected number of successful shots given the error pattern inherent to the player. This approach is fully quantified by the model presented and suggests a reliable way for individual free throw improvement.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} estimate the trajectory and the flight distance of thrown pigeon clays. The basic principle is to measure {{the beginning of the}} flight with a camera system in order to forecast the further flight down to the ground impact. The demand of such advanced measuring methods arises from sporting clays competition regulations, where the launching machines have to be adjusted towards specific <b>throwing</b> <b>angles</b> and ranges. The presented method uses a wide-baseline stereo camera system (32 m camera distance) to measure the 3 D clay disc positions, and the flight parameters are then identified by aerodynamic and kinematic considerations. This allows to estimate the whole path and the throwing distance, especially without a need to measure the ground impact itself. Applying this method to sporting clays facilities, the launching machines can be adjusted easier and more precisely, being advantageous especially for competitions. Additionally, it becomes possible to obtain the theoretical throwing distance on small sports areas bounded by nets or walls where a ground impact is not measurable...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{calculate}} the expansion law and chemical enrichment of a supershell powered by the energetic feedback of a typical Galactic OB association at various galactocentric radii. We study then the orbits of the fragments created when the supershell breaks out and we compare their kinetic and chemical properties with the available observations of high - and intermediate - velocity clouds. We use the Kompaneets (1960) approximation for the evolution of the superbubble driven by sequential supernova explosions and we compute the abundances of oxygen and iron residing in the thin cold supershell. We assume that supershells are fragmented by means of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and we follow the orbit of the clouds either ballistically or by means of a hybrid model considering viscous interaction between the clouds and the extra-planar gas. Given the self-similarity of the Kompaneets solutions, clouds are always formed ~ 448 pc above the plane. If the initial metallicity is solar, the pollution from dying stars of the OB association has a negligible effect on the chemical composition of the clouds. The maximum height reached by the clouds above the plane seldom exceeds 2 kpc and when averaging over different <b>throwing</b> <b>angles,</b> the landing coordinate differs from the throwing coordinate ~ 1 kpc at most. The range of heights and [O/Fe] ratios spun by our clouds suggest us that the high velocity clouds cannot have a Galactic origin, whereas intermediate velocity clouds have kinematic properties similar to our modeled clouds but overabundance observed for the [O/Fe] ratios which can be reproduced only with initial metallicities which are too low compared for those of the Galaxy disk.

40|$|Context: Sequential {{supernova}} explosions create supershells {{which can}} break out a stratified medium, producing bipolar outflows. The gas of the supershells can fragment into clouds which eventually fall toward the disk producing so-called galactic fountains. Aims: The {{aim of this}} paper is to calculate the expansion law and chemical enrichment of a supershell powered by the energetic feedback of a typical Galactic OB association at various galactocentric radii. We study the orbits of the fragments created when the supershell breaks out and we compare their kinetic and chemical properties with the available observations of high - and intermediate - velocity clouds. Methods: We use the Kompaneets (1960, Soviet Phys. Dokl., 5, 46) approximation for the evolution of the superbubble driven by sequential supernova explosions and we compute the abundances of oxygen and iron residing in the thin cold supershell. We assume that supershells are fragmented by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and we follow the orbit of the clouds either ballistically or by means of a hybrid model considering viscous interaction between the clouds and the extra-planar gas.
