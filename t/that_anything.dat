5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E
5|$|Later, in Boston, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{investigate}} {{the disappearance of}} Dr. Craig Horning, an archaeologist from a local history museum, after a security guard discovers {{a large amount of}} blood in Horning's lab. They interview both the curator, Dr. Lewton, and graduate student Mona Wustner. They also visit a reclusive Bilac. After closing, Lewton is killed by the jaguar spirit after his car doesn't start. During an investigation of the crime scene, Scully comes across rat corpses in the engine compartment of Lewton's vehicle. Mona denies <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> unusual has happened in the museum.|$|E
5|$|The first {{station was}} a {{temporary}} terminus for the GWR {{on the west}} side of Bishop's Bridge Road, opened on 4 June 1838. The first GWR service from London to Taplow, near Maidenhead, ran from Paddington in 1838. After the main station opened, this became the site of the goods depot. Brunel did not consider <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> less than a grand terminus dedicated to the GWR would be acceptable, and consequently this was approved in February 1853.|$|E

5|$|The 33-seat Saab 340B {{airplane}} {{used for}} Crossair Flight LX498 had been leased to Crossair from Moldavian Airlines since 1 October 1999. The plane {{was scheduled to}} depart from Zurich Airport on Monday, 10 January 2000, at around 6:00p.m. and arrive at Dresden Airport a few hours later. The cold, drizzly weather was normal for the area, there were no indications <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> {{was wrong with the}} aircraft, and, although this particular aircraft had 24,000 flying hours since its November 1990 delivery, this type of airplane had a very good safety record. Captain Pavel Gruzin, 41, had 8,100 hours of flying time, with 1,900 in the Saab 340 type. Co-pilot Rastislav Kolesár, 35, had about 1,800 total hours, with 1,100 hours in the Saab 340 type. The plane was carrying no unusual payload such as freight or mail and the plane was not due for its next regular maintenance check for another 21 days, on 31 January 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, Amy, and Rory enjoy {{a picnic}} in New York's Central Park in 2012, with the Doctor {{reading from a}} pulp novel about a 1930s detective named Melody Malone.

Meanwhile, Rory goes to get coffee and is {{sent back to the}} 1930s by a cherub Weeping Angel. There, he meets River Song, who is playing the part of Melody Malone. In the present, the Doctor and Amy are shocked to find Rory written into the book. Amy insists on reading ahead, but the Doctor warns her <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> she reads will be destined to happen. Instead, they attempt to take the TARDIS back to the 1930s, finding the time machine struggling to make the journey.|$|E
