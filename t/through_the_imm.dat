A probabilistic approach is taken since exact (deterministic) results would not appropriately reflect the uncertainty in <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> inputs. Once <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> was conceptualized, a plan was needed to rigorously assess input information, framework and code, and output results of <b>the</b> <b>IMM,</b> and ensure that end user requests and requirements were considered during all stages of model development and implementation.

40|$|The Integrated Medical Model (IMM) helps {{capture and}} use {{organizational}} knowledge across the space medicine, training, operations, engineering, and research domains. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> uses this domain {{knowledge in the}} context of a mission and crew profile to forecast crew health and mission success risks. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> is most helpful in comparing the risk of two or more mission profiles, not as a tool for predicting absolute risk. The process of building <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> adheres to Probability Risk Assessment (PRA) techniques described in NASA Procedural Requirement (NPR) 8705. 5, and uses current evidence-based information to establish a defensible position for making decisions that help ensure crew health and mission success. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> quantitatively describes <b>the</b> following input parameters: 1) medical conditions and likelihood, 2) mission duration, 3) vehicle environment, 4) crew attributes (e. g. age, sex), 5) crew activities (e. g. EVA's, Lunar excursions), 6) diagnosis and treatment protocols (e. g. medical equipment, consumables pharmaceuticals), and 7) Crew Medical Officer (CMO) training effectiveness. It is worth reiterating that <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> uses <b>the</b> data sets above as inputs. Many other risk management efforts stop at determining only likelihood. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> is unique in that it models not only likelihood, but risk mitigations, as well as subsequent clinical outcomes based on those mitigations. Once the mathematical relationships among the above parameters are established, <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> uses a Monte Carlo simulation technique (a random sampling of the inputs as described by their statistical distribution) to determine the probable outcomes.

40|$|Introduction: The Integrated Medical Model (IMM) Project {{represents}} {{one aspect of}} NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) to quantitatively assess medical risks to astronauts for existing operational missions as well as missions associated with future exploration and commercial space flight ventures. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> takes a probabilistic approach to assessing the likelihood and specific outcomes of one hundred medical conditions within the envelope of accepted space flight standards of care over a selectable range of mission capabilities. A specially developed Integrated Medical Evidence Database (iMED) maintains evidence-based, organizational knowledge {{across a variety of}} data sources. Since becoming operational in 2011, version 3. 0 of <b>the</b> <b>IMM,</b> <b>the</b> supporting iMED, and the expertise of <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> project team have contributed {{to a wide range of}} decision and informational processes for the space medical and human research community. This presentation provides an overview of <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> conceptual architecture and range of application through examples of actual space flight community questions posed to <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> project. Methods: Figure 1 [see document] illustrates <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> modeling system and scenario process. As illustrated, <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> computational architecture is based on Probabilistic Risk Assessment techniques. Nineteen assumptions and limitations define <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> application domain. Scenario definitions include crew medical attributes and mission specific details. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> forecasts probabilities of loss of crew life (LOCL), evacuation (EVAC), quality time lost during the mission, number of medical resources utilized and the number and type of medical events by combining scenario information with in-flight, analog, and terrestrial medical information stored in the iMED. In addition, the metrics provide the integrated information necessary to estimate optimized in-flight medical kit contents under constraints of mass and volume or acceptable level of mission risk. Results and Conclusions: Historically, IMM simulations support Science and Technology planning, Exploration mission planning, and ISS program operations by supplying simulation support, iMED data information, and subject matter expertise to Crew Health and Safety and the HRP.

Further, they are a very strong set of instruments, in that the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> and MM variable for each mail month is quite high, reflecting the fact that <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> and MM are identical {{in the vast majority of}} cases.

40|$|Introduction The Integrated Medical Model (IMM) is a {{decision}} support tool that is useful to space flight mission managers and medical system designers in assessing risks and optimizing medical systems. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> employs an evidence-based, probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) approach within the operational constraints of space flight. Methods Stochastic computational methods are used to forecast probability distributions of medical events, crew health metrics, medical resource utilization, and probability estimates of medical evacuation and loss of crew life. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> can also optimize medical kits within the constraints of mass and volume for specified missions. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> was used to forecast medical evacuation and loss of crew life probabilities, as well as crew health metrics for a near-earth asteroid (NEA) mission. An optimized medical kit for this mission was proposed based on <b>the</b> <b>IMM</b> simulation. Discussion <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> can provide information to the space program regarding medical risks, including crew medical impairment, medical evacuation and loss of crew life. This information is valuable to mission managers and the space medicine community in assessing risk and developing mitigation strategies. Exploration missions such as NEA missions will have significant mass and volume constraints applied to the medical system. Appropriate allocation of medical resources will be critical to mission success. <b>The</b> <b>IMM</b> capability of optimizing medical systems based on specific crew and mission profiles will be advantageous to medical system designers.
