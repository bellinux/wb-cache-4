40|$|Publisher's description] Processing Instruction is an {{approach}} to grammar instruction for second language learning, contrasting with <b>traditional</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> in its focus on structured input rather than learners' output. This book compares student assessment after <b>traditional</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> and after Processing Instruction to assess the positive benefits of this method of second language teaching. Rather than examining sentence-level tasks, the study looks at the relative effectiveness of Processing Instruction on discourse-level linguistic ability. Case studies using empirical data from second language learners of Japanese, Italian and English are used to highlight the benefits to the learner of this method of enhanced input. This monograph will {{be of interest to}} postgraduates and academics researching second language acquisition and applied linguistics...|$|E
40|$|Processing Instruction (PI) is an {{approach}} to grammar instruction for second language learning. It derives {{its name from the}} fact that the instruction (both the explicit explanation as well as the practices) attempt to influence, alter, and/or improve the way learners process input. PI contrasts with <b>traditional</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> in many ways, most principally in its focus on input whereas <b>traditional</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> focuses on learners' output. The greatest contribution of PI to both theory and practice is the concept of "structured input", a form of comprehensible input that has been manipulated to maximize learners' benefit of exposure to input. This volume focuses on a new issue for PI, the role of technology in language learning. It examines empirically the differential effects of delivering PI in classrooms with an instructor and students interacting (with each other and with the instructor) versus on computers to students working individually. It also contributes to the growing body of research on the effects of PI on different languages as well as different linguistic items: preterite/imperfect aspectual contrast and negative informal commands in Spanish, the subjunctive of doubt and opinion in Italian, and the subjunctive of doubt in French. Further research contributions are made by comparing PI with other types of instruction, specifically, with meaning-oriented output instruction...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate about}} the {{effectiveness}} of <b>traditional</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> has been ongoing for many decades now. <b>Traditional</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> involves memorization of grammatical rules and practice exercise drills. As early as 1936, the Curriculum Commission of the National Council of Teachers of English stated that “‘all teaching of grammar separate from the manipulation of sentences [should] be discontinued…since every scientific attempt to prove that knowledge of grammar is useful has failed’” (Weaver, Teaching 9). So why is grammar still being taught in the same way-through traditional direct instruction-in many schools? It is because some parents, administrators, politicians, researchers, and teachers wholeheartedly believe that students will learn grammar best through direct instruction, lectures, textbooks, and worksheets of practice exercises, with grammar totally removed from a relevant context. Conversely, other researchers and teachers believe that students learn grammar best by situating grammar instruction in the context of reading and writing, and these researchers and teachers have controlled studies and a body of literature on their side. Immersing students in authentic reading and writing activities, using mini-lessons to teach grammatical concepts, and showing applied grammatical concepts in real life leads to better student writing. Teachers must also focus on the individual writing needs of their students and stop seeing grammar instruction as a hunt for errors. Many prominent teachers in the field of English have designed effective lesson plans that teach grammar in this way. Students will be more motivated to write and will become better writers if grammar is taught in an incorporated setting...|$|E

The hypothesis was that if the classroom activities were anchored in traditional grammar teaching methodology, the CALL environment would prove as comprehensive as the conventional classroom, thus stimulating and yielding positive results. By means of grammar-based teaching and communicative learning the grammar item 'meaning of modal verbs' was taught. Based on a quasi-experiment and the principles of a repeated measures research design, the performance of 50 students at two English language departments was alternatively measured in both the conventional and the experimental classroom settings in several subsequent instances.

40|$|Language teachers’ {{agency to}} their belief {{system has been}} widely {{reported}} to influence classroom teaching practices. Whilst the bulk of research has dealt with second language learner teachers’ beliefs, {{few studies have been}} conducted on how and why tenured EFL teachers activate their beliefs within a context of strictly controlled curriculum and imposed language teacher education programmes and what influence this may have on their teaching practice. Specifically, when EFL teachers adapt the imposed communicative language teaching approach (CLA) in teaching grammar, tensions are bound to arise and influence their decisions regarding implementation of the proposed curriculum. The study addressed this gap and contributed more broadly to our understanding of how attention to teachers’ beliefs and self-initiated models of professional development such as reflection could aid the effectiveness of top-down policies. This paper aimed at exploring the interplay between EFL teachers’ beliefs about grammar teaching and their reported practices in public schools in Saudi Arabia, and the extent of influence of teacher education programmes in informing such beliefs. The investigation utilized semi-structured interviews with four EFL Saudi teachers.

However, in subsurface areas of writing and revising, including organization and presentation, audience awareness, and style and appropriateness, the experimental group did not perform significantly better than the control group. Analysis of the data from pre- and posttest scores on the written English Expression Placement Test revealed that the experimental group made no greater gains in formal rule acquisition. The use of computers during the revising process did not prove beneficial to rule acquisition; and therefore, some doubt exists as to whether the new revising processes could be transferable to revising when computers are not available...|$|R

The participating schools were using a <b>traditional</b> <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> in which grammar lessons were predominately taught using worksheets and were presented separately from other reading and writing activities. This was termed Discrete Grammar Instruction (DGI). The researchers introduced a contextualized grammar instruction approach, termed Embedded Grammar Instruction (EGI), which taught grammar within authentic contexts of reading and writing. Students in grades three through eight were assigned to either the EGI group (N = 164) or the DGI group (N = 156). Two subtests of the Test of Written Language- Third Edition (Hammill 2 ̆ 6 Larsen, 1996) were given at pre- and posttest: Sentence Combining, which is a measure of grammatical complexity, and Contextual Conventions, which is a measure of written conventions (i. e., punctuation and capitalization). Following six weeks of instruction, the EGI group outperformed the DGI group on sentence combining ability, but no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in use of contextual conventions.

40|$|Does {{instruction}} make a difference? Is {{there an}} effective pedagogical intervention to <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction?</b> In {{the last fifty}} years, scholars have debated to what extent <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> makes a difference in acquisition of morphological and syntactic aspects of language (VanPatten and Benati, 2015; Benati, Laval, Arche, 2013). Theory and research around the role of <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> {{seem to indicate that}} <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> might have a beneficial role in speeding up the rate of acquisition of formal properties of language. Despite the fact that language learners bring to the task of acquisition a variety of mechanisms that override instructional efforts, a type of instruction that is both input oriented and meaning-based might have a facilitative role in second language acquisition (Nassanji and Fotos, 2011; Benati, 2014). In this paper, research findings on a number of pedagogical interventions (e. g., input flood, textual enhancement, structured input, structured output tasks) will be reviewed. Although, the findings are not completely conclusive on whether these instructional interventions have an impact on acquisition, it is clear that we have witnessed to a shift in the field from the original question “Does instruction make a difference?” to the more specific question “Does manipulating input make a difference?” Is there an effective pedagogical intervention to <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction?</b> The answer to this question is that there is not one particular type of instructional intervention better than others. However, it must be emphasised that effective types of <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> share common and essential ingredients: (i) input plays a key role; (ii) input is manipulated so to facilitate input processing and grammar acquisition; (iii) <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> should focus on both form and meaning; (iv) output grammar practice should follow input <b>grammar</b> practice. <b>Grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> should be less about the teaching of rules and more about exposure to form.

This descriptive case study explored both students’ and teachers’ perceptions with regards to aspects such as student motivation, their attitudes and their beliefs on <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> in their ESL classrooms. The study was conducted in a boarding junior college, Maktab Rendah Sains MARA (MRSM) located in Pahang. The sample involved 203 Form Four students and 8 TESL teachers teaching at the upper secondary level. Data was collected using two questionnaires (Student Questionnaire and Teacher Questionnaire) and semi structured interviews. The interviews were conducted with twenty randomly selected students from ten Form Four ESL classes and all eight TESL teachers in this junior college. The findings of the study indicated that these Form Four students were both instrumentally and integratively motivated to learn grammar in order to improve their language proficiency. Besides, both students and teachers displayed positive attitudes towards <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction</b> in the ESL classroom and they also held strong beliefs about it. However, there existed a mismatch between the students’ and the teachers’ attitudes towards explicit and implicit approaches of <b>grammar</b> <b>instruction,</b> and their beliefs about them.
