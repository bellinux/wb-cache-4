5|$|But {{theories}} of either complete independence of or complete {{dependence on the}} synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the one hand, elements such as distinctive Johannine language, <b>the</b> <b>lengthy</b> discourses, and the prologue on the Logos, are clearly unique to John; on the other, John clearly shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.|$|E

She was laid down on 30 October 1861 by Laird's at its shipyard in Birkenhead. The ship was launched on 27 March 1865, commissioned in June 1868 for sea trials and completed on 19 December. <b>The</b> <b>lengthy</b> delay in completion was due to frequent changes in design details, and experiments with her armament and with her sailing rig. The ship cost a total of £483,003.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} section in {{spirited}} 3/8 time, the predominant mood is of joyous exaltation reflecting the text from Isaiah. The structure of the choral material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two homophonic episodes; here a homophonic episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by <b>the</b> <b>lengthy</b> orchestral sinfonia, the final section ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} on all British mainline journeys {{to change}} engines at convenient locations to avoid <b>the</b> <b>lengthy</b> process of re-coaling. The Coronation locomotives were therefore strategically stationed at key points between London and Glasgow {{and they would}} be assigned to the shed at that location. The chosen locations were at London (Camden shed), Crewe (Crewe North), Carlisle (Upperby) and Glasgow (Polmadie). It was only in the latter days of steam that the mix of shed assignments became more fluid.|$|E

5|$|Nojpetén fell to a Spanish {{assault on}} 13 March 1697, more than 150 {{years after the}} conquest {{of the rest of}} the Yucatán Peninsula and more than 160 years after the conquest of the Guatemalan Highlands. <b>The</b> <b>lengthy</b> delay in conquering the Petén region was due to a {{combination}} of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants. During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from Belize. <b>The</b> <b>lengthy</b> indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to develop an understanding of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the period of almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by European-dominated territories. This understanding distinguished the conquest of Petén from the 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and Incas. In contrast, the Spanish had a very poor understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages whose kingdom was protected by Satan from the Christianising efforts of the Spanish Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. From the time that Hernán Cortés crossed Petén in the early 16th century, the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the Aj Kan Ek) was the overlord of the entire central Petén region.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Vuelta {{included}} nine summit finishes, none {{of which}} had previously {{been used in the}} race. Unusually, the principal difficulties of the race came in the first two weeks, including all nine summit finishes. It was therefore expected that the climbers would need to attack early in the race, in order to build up a significant lead ahead of <b>the</b> <b>lengthy</b> time trial on Stage 17. The race organisers also hoped to encourage sprinters to take part by including seven fairly flat stages.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lengthy</b> {{individual}} {{time trial}} featured a climb {{in the middle}} of it, but no KOM points were on offer. The course was technical and featured several turnarounds. It was the same course that was raced four times in stage eight, except that the finish line was not situated at the same place. Midway through the stage, the riders took on the difficulty of the day, the -long Liebewill. There were other small climbs to pepper the course.|$|E

5|$|Tubenoses have smaller egg {{clutches}} {{and much}} {{longer and more}} variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling swifts in these developmental factors. Tubenoses and swifts have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. In the particular case of the storm petrel, it has a body temperature perhaps 3°C lower than other small birds, and this may also contribute to <b>the</b> <b>lengthy</b> incubation.|$|E

5|$|Development {{continued}} through late 2002, with targeted release dates of December in Japan and early 2003 in North America. During the final stages, two planned dungeons that fell behind schedule were cut {{and replaced with}} a quest to recover Triforce pieces around the Great Sea. Elements of these dungeons were recycled for later Zelda games. On October 15, 2002, Nintendo revealed the game's official Japanese subtitle, Kaze no Takuto (Wind Baton), to emphasize the role of wind in the game. The company announced the official English version, The Wind Waker, on December 2, 2002. In {{the gap between the}} Japanese and North American releases, the designers reworked some troublesome segments, notably shortening <b>the</b> <b>lengthy</b> Triforce quest.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and <b>the</b> <b>lengthy</b> telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E
