25|$|Early {{theories}} placed Huron {{origin in}} the St. Lawrence Valley, with some arguing for a presence near Montreal and other St. Lawrence Iroquoian peoples. Wendat is an Iroquoian language.

25|$|There is no {{reliable}} worldwide database listing all cave diving fatalities.

Prior to the Kosovo War, there was a thriving music industry in Kosovo, which reached new heights in recent years. The Kosovar music industry was home to many famous musicians, including the famous Nexhmije Pagarusha, Ismet Peja and the romantic, more elaborate Qamili i Vogël of Gjakova. The Macedonian band Vëllezërit Aliu became well- known for the traditional vocal duets accompanied by drum box, electric bass, synthesizer and clarinet or saxophone.

25|$|In 2011, {{with most}} of the former Kai Tak area still abandoned, ideas were floated to develop the area for {{commercial}} property, citing shortages of office space and rising property costs. In June 2013, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal was opened on the tip of the former runway. Two public housing estates opened on the northeast area of the site in 2013, providing over 13,000 new rental flats. As of August 2014, the checkerboard remains visible, though with strong natural overgrowth obscuring much of its facade. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said for much of the Kai Tak apron area. A few new buildings have been erected on the north eastern part of the apron creating the Kai Ching Estate.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the study}} of {{classics}} has not declined as fast elsewhere in Europe. In 2009, a review of Meeting the Challenge, a collection of conference papers about the teaching of Latin in Europe, noted that though there is opposition {{to the teaching of}} Latin in Italy, it is nonetheless still compulsory in most secondary schools. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said in the case of France or Greece, too. Indeed, Ancient Greek is one of the compulsory subjects in Greek secondary education, whereas in France, Latin is one of the optional subjects that can be chosen in a majority of middle schools and high schools. Ancient Greek is also still being taught, {{but not as much as}} Latin.|$|E
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (<b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
25|$|In essence, a {{flagship}} can {{be located}} in the market where the station's owner is headquartered, or in the largest market where that owner operates. For example, WSB-TV in Atlanta is the flagship of Cox Media Group, because Cox's headquarters is located in a suburb of that city. However, Cox owns WFXT in Boston, which is larger than Atlanta. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said for TEGNA who lists three of its properties as its flagship stations (WXIA-TV in Atlanta, WUSA in Washington, D.C. and KUSA in Denver), but also owns WFAA in Dallas, which is larger than Atlanta, Washington D.C., and Denver in terms of Media market. Likewise, prior to merging with Gannett in 2013, WFAA served as the flagship station for Belo, as its headquarters were located in Dallas.|$|E

25|$|The {{role and}} nature of Sanskrit {{must be taken into}} {{consideration}} to understand the occurrence of consonant clusters. The orthography of written Sanskrit was completely phonetic, and had a tradition of not separating words by spaces. Morphologically it was highly synthetic, and it had a great capacity to form large compound words. Thus clustering was highly frequent, and it is Sanskrit loanwords to the Gujarati language that are the grounds of most clusters. Gujarati, on the other hand, is more analytic, has phonetically smaller, simpler words, and has a script whose orthography is slightly imperfect (a-elision) and separates words by spaces. Thus evolved Gujarati words are less a cause for clusters. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said of Gujarati's other longstanding source of words, Persian, which also provides phonetically smaller and simpler words.|$|E
25|$|However, {{what both}} Takeda {{and his son}} Tokimune says should be taken with a big pinch of salt. Famous proponents of the art {{including}} Kondo sensei and Sagawa sensei have {{been quoted as saying}} Takeda and his son had the same teaching system ie only to teach one or two people the real 'techniques' ie the aiki of the art. The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said for teachers of the modified form of daitoryu, the art of aikido.|$|E
25|$|Statistics on {{the number}} of parishes may be more {{reliable}} and consistent, even though they may not necessarily directly translate into the numbers of adherents. By number of parishes and quantity of church buildings, the UOC(MP)'s strong base is central and northernwestern Ukraine. However, percentage wise (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) its share of parishes there varies from 60 to 70 percent. At the same time, by percentage alone (with respect to rival Orthodox Churches) the UOC(MP)'s share of church buildings peaks in the urban russophone southern and eastern Ukrainian provinces, being as high as 90%. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said about Transcarpathia, although there the UOC(MP)'s main rival is the Greek Catholic Church and thus its share of total church buildings is only 40%. The capital Kiev is where the greatest Orthodox rivalry takes place, with the UOC(MP) holding about half of the Orthodox communities there. The only place where the UOC(MP) is a true minority, in both quantity, percentage and support are the former Galician provinces of Western Ukraine. There the total share of parishes does not exceed more than five percent. The UOC(MP) does not have any parishes abroad, as its followers identify themselves under the same umbrella as those of the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E
