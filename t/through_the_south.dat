5|$|For {{purposes}} of the Office for National Statistics, Manchester forms the most populous settlement within the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third-largest conurbation. There {{is a mixture of}} high-density urban and suburban locations in Manchester. The largest open space in the city, at around , is Heaton Park. Manchester is contiguous on all sides with several large settlements, except for a small section along its southern boundary with Cheshire. The M60 and M56 motorways pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> of Manchester, through Northenden and Wythenshawe respectively. Heavy rail lines enter the city from all directions, the principal destination being Manchester Piccadilly station.|$|E

5|$|Allied air {{and naval}} attacks against Japanese {{shipping}} in the South China Sea were expanded during early 1945 as additional USAAF units moved into {{bases in the}} Philippines and other demands on these forces permitted. Land-based patrol aircraft and medium bombers operated over the sea from liberated areas of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies from February. While Allied submarines and these aircraft failed to prevent the escape of the Ise-class battleships when they sailed for Japan during Operation Kita in mid-February, the medium bombers were sinking large numbers of Japanese merchant ships {{by the end of}} the month. Medium and heavy bombers also raided Japanese-held ports across the South China Sea area. As a result of the air and submarine attacks, the Japanese ceased sending ships <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea in April.|$|E
5|$|Although Portuguese by birth, Ferdinand Magellan {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} King Charles I of Spain, on whose behalf he left Seville on 10 August 1519, with {{a squadron of}} five ships, {{in search of a}} western route to the Spice Islands in the East Indies. Success depended on finding a strait or passage <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> American land masses, or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to wait out the southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E

5|$|As the {{perimeter}} shrank and the surviving defenders fell back, they became concentrated {{into a small}} area in the city centre. By now there were about 10,000 German soldiers in the city centre, which was being assaulted from all sides. One of the other main thrusts was along Wilhelmstrasse on which the Air Ministry, built of reinforced concrete, was pounded by large concentrations of Soviet artillery. The remaining German Tiger tanks of the Hermann von Salza battalion took up positions in {{the east of the}} Tiergarten to defend the centre against Kuznetsov's 3rd Shock Army (which although heavily engaged around the Reichstag was also flanking the area by advancing through the northern Tiergarten) and the 8th Guards Army advancing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> of the Tiergarten. These Soviet forces had effectively cut the sausage-shaped area held by the Germans in half and made any escape attempt to the west for German troops in the centre much more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the length}} of time it took to build her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived {{at a time when the}} reconquest of the Philippines was well underway. As a part of that movement, the {{planners}} had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at Manila to soften up Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|During 1941 and {{the first}} months of 1942 Japan conquered or {{established}} de facto rule over almost the entire South China Sea region. Control of the sea was vital to the Japanese economy, as it was the conduit through which essential supplies of oil and other natural resources passed from occupied Malaya, Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. As the war turned against Japan, convoys of ships passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea frequently came under attack from Allied submarines and – by late 1944 – aircraft. These attacks were guided by information gained from signals intelligence and long-range air patrols, supplemented by reports from coast watchers along the Chinese coast and other observers in Asian ports. While losses of oil tankers and freighters were increasingly heavy, the Japanese Government continued to order ships to make the voyage. In an attempt to limit losses, convoys and individual ships took routes well way from the established sea lanes, or sailed close to the shore and operated only at night.|$|E

5|$|M-55 {{starts at}} a {{three-way}} intersection with US31 north of Manistee. The trunkline runs southeast on Caberfae Highway over the Manistee River {{and through the}} Peters and Highpoint bayous. The highway passes near the community of Eastlake before turning eastward through forest land. In eastern Manistee County, the roadway crosses the Pine River south of the Tippy Dam Pond in Wellston. M-55 intersects M-37 in western Wexford County southwest of the Caberfae Peaks Ski & Golf Resort. The roadway turns northeasterly along the south shore of Lake Mitchell where it then curves southeasterly to run concurrently along M-115 along the south shore of Lake Cadillac and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> side of Cadillac. At the interchange with the US131 freeway, M-55 merges north along the freeway, bypassing downtown Cadillac.|$|E
5|$|Mamucium was {{levelled}} as Manchester {{expanded in}} the Industrial Revolution. The {{construction of the}} Rochdale Canal <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> western corner of the fort in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the building of viaducts for the Great Northern Railway over the site in the late 19th century, damaged the remains and even destroyed some of the southern half of the fort. When the railway viaducts were built, Charles Roeder documented the remains that were uncovered in the process, including parts of the vicus. Mills were all around the site. Castlefield became the south west corner of Manchester city centre. Deansgate, which developed into the main thoroughfare, follows the general line of Roman road to Ribchester.|$|E
5|$|North of Bedford, M-37 meanders through rural Barry County. The road {{passes through}} mixed {{agricultural}} and forest lands near several small lakes in the area. On its path to Hastings, the trunkline runs through Dowling and meets the western terminus of M-79. The highway follows Hanover Street <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> side of Hastings into downtown, where it turns west on Green Street and north on Broadway Street. At {{the intersection of}} Broadway and State streets, M-37 meets and joins M-43. West of Hastings, M-43 separates and heads south toward Kalamazoo while M-37 turns northwesterly and runs parallel to the Thornapple River. The highway follows the river west and north to the community of Middleville through mixed farms and forests.|$|E

5|$|On May20, {{following}} Typhoon Brenda's passage <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> China Sea, a monsoon trough {{extending from}} the area into the Bay of Bengal received enhanced low-level southwesterly flow. An environment of weak wind shear {{in the wake of}} the typhoon allowed a new area of low pressure to form within the southwesterly flow on May21. With convection becoming persistent and the system's overall presentation more organized by May22, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300UTC. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Later that day, convection wrapped entirely around the center of circulation; this structural improvement, combined with nearby surface observations, prompted the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Cecil.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} second inauguration on March 4, 1901, William and Ida McKinley {{undertook}} a six-week {{tour of the}} nation. Traveling mostly by rail, the McKinleys were to travel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> to the Southwest, and then up the Pacific coast and east again, to conclude with a visit on June 13, 1901, to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. However, the First Lady fell ill in California, causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches {{he had planned to}} give urging trade reciprocity. He also postponed the visit to the fair until September, planning a month in Washington and two in Canton before the Buffalo visit.|$|E

After interring the deceased in a grave they may have used the eastern entrance to leave the cemetery.

5|$|The city is {{connected}} by road on a north-south axis reaching Viana do Castelo and the Spanish border to Porto by the A28 motorway. In Greater Porto, the A28 {{has the most}} popular suburban commercial areas of Northern Portugal with suburban shopping centers, large stand-alone stores, retail parks and outlets and reaches Porto's major thoroughfares and ring roads, including the VCI inner orbital motorway. Póvoa is also reached by the A7 (from Guimarães and Vila Nova de Famalicão) and A11 (from Braga and Barcelos) motorways on an east-west axis, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> and north of the city, in that order, and both cross the A28.

5|$|The {{principal}} {{route to}} the town centre is the A338 spur road, a dual carriageway that connects to the A31 close to the Hampshire border. The A31 joins the M27 at Southampton and from there the M3 to London and the A34 to the Midlands and the North can be accessed. The main road west is the A35 to Honiton in Devon which runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> East Dorset Conurbation and continues east as far as Southampton, albeit as a non-primary route. The A350 in the neighbouring borough of Poole provides the only northern route out of the conurbation. National Express coaches serve Bournemouth Travel Interchange & Bournemouth University. There are frequent departures to London Victoria Coach Station and Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. Local buses are provided mainly by two companies, Wilts & Dorset, the former National Bus Company subsidiary and now owned by the Go-Ahead Group, and Yellow Buses, the former Bournemouth Council-owned company and successors to Bournemouth Corporation Transport, which began operating trams in 1902. Other operators serving the town include Damory Coaches and the Shaftesbury & District bus company.|$|E
5|$|The river flows <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Downs National Park, {{and is a}} {{designated}} Site of Nature Conservation Importance, in recognition of its value for wildlife.

The quality of the water is generally good, and the river is measured at four gauging stations, three on the main channel, and one of the River Lod, just before its junction with the Rother. Water from the underlying Lower Greensand aquifer and the adjacent chalk aquifer helps to maintain the flows during the summer months, despite the fact that large volumes are abstracted from both the aquifers and the river for the public water supply.|$|E
