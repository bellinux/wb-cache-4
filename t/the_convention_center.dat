5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were {{not expected to be}} prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> <b>Center</b> was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> {{was plagued}} {{from the start}} by budget {{problems}} and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes {{to be used in}} the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.|$|E

During construction of <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> <b>Center,</b> the observation deck, which had been briefly reopened by the city (still sporting the original World's Fair-era displays and explanations of the panorama), was closed while the tower was commandeered by the Knoxville Public Building Authority as offices for, quite literally, overseeing the construction of <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> <b>Center.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Convention</b> <b>Center</b> was completed in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Voter {{approval}} of <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> bond levy {{was critical to}} winning investor participation {{in the rest of}} the Garden Gateway development. But political complications once more interfered with the ballot proposal. For years, municipal and county court judges had been pressing for a new courthouse and county jail. Cleveland had agreed to put a bond levy for both structures on the November ballot. But with the onset of the Recession of 1958, Celebrezze believed voters would turn down both proposals. To save <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center,</b> he suggested postponing the courthouse levy. Judges reacted with outrage, attacking <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> bond levy as unnecessary. Council reaction was poor as well, with a majority of Cleveland City Council members agreeing that <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> bond issue was now dead because of the recession.|$|E

25|$|The {{mayor and}} city council were still {{negotiating}} over the TIF deal in March 2004, although both {{hoped to have}} legislation passed by May. Even as the Center for Exhibition Industry Research said a headquarters hotel was important {{for the success of}} <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center,</b> there was concern by other hotels in the city that <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> had not generated enough room nights to justify its construction. Washington Post business columnist Steven Pearlstein questioned in April 2004 if such a large hotel, questionably financed by the city, was really needed to make <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> profitable. Pearlstein argued that two 500-room hotels, built solely with private financing, would be adequate.|$|E
