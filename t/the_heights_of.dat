5|$|In {{addition}} to legislative reform, the breaching of coastal flood defense systems during Vera prompted a redesign of such mechanisms.

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E
5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E

5|$|Barbara Bell, another scholar, {{believes}} that an economic catastrophe {{such as a}} famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better {{address the problem of}} feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, the records of the annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00 on 14 May, a {{pontoon bridge}} had been erected over which {{elements}} of the 1st Panzer Division began crossing the Meuse into the bridgeheads. General Marcel Têtu, commander of the Allied Tactical Air Forces ordered an air strike against the pontoon bridge. Between 15:00 and 16:00 Allied bombers and fighters attacked the bridge. During this attack, Strachwitz organized the traffic across the bridge and ensured delivery of the anti-aircraft ammunition to help fend off the aerial attack, which inflicted only minor damage and did not stop the German advance. Panzer-Pionierbataillon 37 and Sturm-Pionierbataillon 43 ran into enemy tanks at Chéhéry and Panzer-Brigade I into French tanks at Bulson. More than 70 French tanks were left destroyed on the battlefield. While Kirchner ordered the bulk of 1st Panzer Division to keep heading west, French General Charles Huntziger ordered elements of his IIe Armée to protect <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> Stonne, south of Sedan. This dissipated his forces and the French resistance was broken near Vendresse.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably well in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> British politics, he seldom visited the school, did not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but {{had little interest in}} the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} day of the invasion, the two main forces made rapid {{progress}} inland, the militia troops sent against them retreating and deserting without offering resistance. Serious opposition to the British advance did not begin until 1 February, when French defenders on <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> Desfourneaux and Surirey were attacked by Prevost's troops, under the direct command of Brigadier-General Daniel Hoghton. Fighting was fierce throughout the next two days, as the outnumbered French used the fortified high ground to hold back a series of frontal assaults. The British lost 84 killed and 334 wounded to French losses of over 700 casualties, and by 3 February the French had been forced back, withdrawing to Fort Desaix near the capital. Progress was also made at Cape Salomon, where the appearance of British troops panicked the French defenders into burning the naval brig Carnation and retreating to the small island, Ilot aux Ramiers, offshore. Henderson's men, assisted by a naval brigade under Captain George Cockburn, set up batteries on the coast and by 4 February had bombarded the island into surrender, opening the principal harbour of Martinique to naval attack.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{successful}} campaign in Extremadura, on 27 January 1811 Soult began his investment of Badajoz. Almost immediately the Spanish Army of Extremadura {{arrived in the}} vicinity with some 15,000 troops {{under the command of}} Gen. Mendizabal. Soult's army, too small to surround Badajoz, was unable to prevent 3,000 of Mendizabal's men from reinforcing the fortress and the remainder occupying <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> San Cristóbal. This posed a major threat to the French, so Soult moved at once to engage. In the ensuing Battle of the Gebora the French inflicted 1,000 casualties on the Spanish field army and took 4,000 prisoners, at a cost to themselves of only 400 casualties. The remnants of Mendizabal's defeated army fled towards Badajoz or into Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Guderian's {{plan for}} 13 May was straightforward. The 2nd Panzer Division {{in the north}} was to form the right flank of the assaulting force when it reached the Meuse near Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division, {{reinforced}} by the Infantry Regiment Großdeutschland, a battalion of assault engineers, and divisional artillery of the 2nd and 10th Panzer Divisions, {{was to make the}} main attack by crossing the Meuse just north of Sedan and seizing <b>the</b> <b>Heights</b> <b>of</b> la Marfee overlooking the city. The 10th Panzer Division was to cross the Meuse south of Sedan and protect the southern flank of the corps. Throughout the day, large masses of troops and equipment assembled north of the Meuse in preparation for the river crossing.|$|E

5|$|Jolin {{started to}} depict Stockholm {{when he moved}} to Fiskargatan, on the tall cliffs of {{southern}} Stockholm in 1914. From his studio he could see most of the city. He divided the view, facing Stadsgården or Riddarholmen, into smaller frames for his painings. Noted works from that time are: Strömmen mot Kastellholmen (Over the Strömmen on to the Kastellholmen) 1914, now in the Stockholm City Museum; Utsikt över Riddarholmen (View of Riddarholmen) 1914, bought by the Nationalmuseum but kept in the Moderna Museet, and Utsikt mot Kastellholmen (View towards the Kastellholmen) 1915, now in the Malmö Konstmuseum. In the Stockholm från Söders höjder (Stockholm from <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> Söder) 1938, elements from Oriental art are present in the naked, branches of the trees and the red buoys looking like Chinese lanterns hanging in the trees. These paintings are defined by swift, flowing brushwork and forceful contours framing fresh, light colours. His composition of the motif involved putting details against big blocks of cool pink, sheer blue, ivory turquoise and emerald, thereby creating a populated setting. There is always an air of teaming citylife along the docks and busy boating on the water of the Strömmen in these paintings.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Liszt's {{inclusion}} of a choral finale in his Dante Symphony changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow {{the structure of the}} Divina Commedia and compose Dante in three movements—one each for the Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a Magnificat, {{at the end of the}} second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> Heaven and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February Mendizabal withdrew {{most of his}} {{men from}} Badajoz, leaving behind a 7,000-strong garrison. The field army's 9,000 {{infantry}} settled on <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> San Cristóbal while the 3,000 horse encamped behind them on the plains of the Caya. The Spanish commander again ignored Wellington's plan, failing to dig entrenchments on the heights, nor did he send out a cavalry screen to protect his front and monitor the French movements. Soult, however, largely ignored the Spanish army {{for the next few}} days, concentrating instead on building up his siege lines and battering Badajoz. Heavy rains also flooded both the Guadiana and Gebora rivers, rendering them impassable, so that between 11–18 February the French were only able to shell {{the southern end of the}} Spanish line, pushing the Spaniards further away from Badajoz and the protection of the San Cristóbal fort.|$|E

5|$|The Anzacs {{were confronted}} by a treacherous, {{confusing}} tangle of ravines and spurs that descended from <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the Sarı Baır range to the sea. The landing was only lightly opposed by scattered Turkish units until Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division and perceiving {{the threat posed by}} the landings, rushed reinforcements to the area in what became a race for the high ground. The contest for the heights was decided on the second ridge line where the Anzacs and Turks fought over a knoll called Baby 700. The position changed hands a number of times on the first day before the Turks, having the advantage of the higher ground on Battleship Hill, took final possession of it. Once the Anzac advance was checked, the Turks counter-attacked, trying to force the invaders back to the shore, but failed to dislodge them from the foothold they had gained. A trench perimeter quickly developed and a bloody stalemate ensued until August.|$|E
5|$|The City of London's first {{reconstruction}} {{plan was}} written by the City Engineer F. J. Forty and published in 1944. It had met with considerable criticism and William Morrison, Minister for Town and Country Planning, asked the City of London Corporation to prepare a new plan. Holden was approached, and he accepted provided that William Holford also be appointed. Holden's and Holford's City of London Plan (1946–1947) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of plot ratio calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up to five times the ground area. For the bomb-devastated area around St Paul's Cathedral, Holden proposed a new precinct around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate. <b>The</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> buildings would be strictly defined to protect these views. The plan was accepted by the Minister for Town and Country Planning in 1948 and was incorporated into the wider London Development Plan.|$|E
5|$|The Gamezebo {{reviewer}} {{had special}} {{praise for the}} game's sound design {{and how it was}} used to clue the player into puzzle solutions. TouchArcade commended how the game's sparse story unfolded by watching the assassination targets go about their time at the compound. The reviewer also noted that his suspension of disbelief was broken when characters would eventually return to partying after reacting to a gunshot, but suggested that the game's Easter eggs redeemed its psychopathic qualities. Pocket Gamer wrote that the game did not reach <b>the</b> <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the series' situational humor in hiding bodies stealthily. Other criticism included Gamezebo, which blamed the game's core multiplier ability for breaking the balance of the game. TouchArcade thought that the game played better on the tablet iPad than on the smaller iPhone, and praised the feature that synced game progress, since Apple's iCloud service was known for its struggle to successfully implement the same feature. Despite Square Enix Montreal being best known for its Go series, Hitman: Sniper was the studio's biggest revenue generator. As its most lucrative title, the game helped to fund the development of the Go series.|$|E
