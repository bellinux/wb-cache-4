They are often used {{at the end of the}} threaded portion of a shaft or screw to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as <b>thread</b> <b>relief</b> in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least [...] smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. [...] <b>Thread</b> <b>relief</b> can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter. [...] They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on technical drawings by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.|$|E
50|$|Max Loehr {{suggests}} that bronze vessel during Zhengzhou phase consist of three styles in their decor: style I is featured by <b>thread</b> <b>relief</b> which is incised {{in the model}} not on the mold; in style II, <b>thread</b> <b>relief</b> is replaced by ribbon relief which is carved in the mold not in the model; style III combines styles I and II with thunder patterns, quills pattern, and more bands of designs which are carved on the model not the mold. Jia vessels fit well into such categorization. The decorations develop from <b>thread</b> <b>relief</b> to ribbon relief {{with one or more}} vivid taotie mask according to how many sections they have.|$|E
50|$|The decor of this Jia {{is within}} a single narrow {{register}} around the waist of the vessel. The style of decoration has been developed beyond the thread-relief on the preceding examples, and the taotie formed by two kui dragons is now franked in raised riboon-like bands. This style loses the delicacy of <b>thread</b> <b>relief</b> but represents the Shang progression toward the distinction of figure and ground.|$|E
50|$|Dimity is a lightweight, sheer cotton fabric, used historically, {{having at}} least two warp <b>threads</b> thrown into <b>relief</b> to form fine cords. It is a cloth {{commonly}} employed for bed upholstery and curtains, and usually white, though sometimes a pattern is printed on it in colors. It is stout in texture, and woven in raised patterns. Originally dimity was made of silk or wool, but since the 18th century it has been woven almost exclusively of cotton.|$|R
50|$|Advantages over {{standard}} powder compaction are {{the possibility of}} thinner walls and larger workpieces. Height to diameter ratio has no limitation. No specific limitations exist in wall thickness variations, undercuts, <b>reliefs,</b> <b>threads,</b> and cross holes. No lubricants are need for isostatic powder compaction. The minimum wall thickness is 0.05 inches (1.27 mm) and the product can have a weight between 40 and 300 pounds (18 and 136 kg). There is 25 to 45% shrinkage of the powder after compacting.|$|R

Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. <b>Thread</b> <b>relief</b> can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major thread diameter.

50|$|This is a beaker-shaped {{container}} with three hollow, pointed legs. It has a plain bow handle and two capped uprights. This jia {{is one of}} the most elegant of the Middle Shang period. The decoration, mainly in <b>thread</b> <b>relief,</b> consists of two bands both framed by small continuous circles - typical for the period. The lower band is divided into six panels by thick and shallow ridges. Every other ridge forms the central part of a taotie face with two bulging eyes. This mask is formed by the dissolved bodies of two confronted dragons in profile. The upper band above the constricted waist is a smaller, narrower and eye-less version of the same theme. The short uprights spring upwards from the rim of the flowing mouth. Set at right angles with the handle, they occupy the segment of the rim the farther away from this handle, which is another characteristic of the Middle Shang style. The nipple-like caps arc incised with whorl-circles, the only dynamic elements in an otherwise frontal and static decoration.|$|E
50|$|When {{it comes}} to the décor of the jia vessel, simple designs are most common. The lack of complex design is due to the jia vessel being one of the oldest vessel forms. As time progressed, vessel décor got more elaborate. While one simple band of décor was {{prevalent}} in Early Shang times, towards the middle and late Shang periods more than one band of décor was more common. As the Zhou period began it was not unlikely to see a jia covered in ornamentation. The vessel shape changed to accommodate the change in decoration, and vice versa. When more elaborate designs are seen it is normally the taotie motif, or mask design. The taotie motif shows two dragon-like figures in profile, that together to form the taotie mask. Whorl circles were also a common decoration on the jia vessel. The décor on the jia can be classified by Max Loehr's five styles of Anyang bronzes. Style I is classified by thin <b>thread</b> <b>relief</b> designs, they are described as being light and airy and consist of simple forms. Style II uses a thicker ribbon relief. It has incised ornaments and harsh and heavy forms. Style III has more of a curvilinear design where only the eyes of the figures protrude and uniform like patterns appear. In style IV the decoration becomes separate from the background, which normally is made of the thunder pattern. The motifs and pattern are flush with the surface of the vessel. Style V vessels have decoration in a very high relief.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} equations are {{the standard}} formulas for conducting Acme/Stub Acme thread strength analysis on threaded connections. This specification contains the equations {{used by the}} Acme/Stub Acme AutoProgram. All assumptions should be understood and applied in the proper context. In the event of actual test data, the test results {{should be used in}} lieu of these theoretical equations. Designs are to be based at all times on sound engineering practices and judgment. Thread Strength calculations that are covered in this design standard: Yield of the Box at the <b>thread</b> <b>relief</b> due to axial loads (tension / compression) Yield of the Pin at the <b>thread</b> <b>relief</b> due to axial loads (tension / compression) Yield of the threaded connection due to axial tension (thread strip) Axial load generated by an applied torque and vise versa Maximum allowable torque prior to yield Optimal thread size to minimize strength differential between the pin and box Thread Strength calculations that are not covered in this design standard: Thread jump out Bearing stress Compressive buckling in pin & box noses It is suggested that designs take into account design considerations to account for these items. All stress or force values calculated below are based on static forces and they do not account for pressure-induced loads and/or axial loads generated by hanging weight.
