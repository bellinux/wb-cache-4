25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. <b>Those</b> <b>dreams</b> were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} rabbis {{themselves were}} at times not free from {{sharing in the}} popular beliefs. Thus, {{while there is a}} whole catalog of prognostications by means of Dreams in Ber. 55 et seq., and Rabbi Johanan claimed that <b>those</b> <b>dreams</b> are true which come in the morning or are dreamed about us by others, or are repeated, Rabbi Meïr declares that dreams help not and injure not. Dream interpretation is not however a factor in considering mythologyfication of Talmud knowledge since it was at the time a part of the wider nascent development of what later became the discipline of Psychology, and also incorporated Astrology, and effect of digestion on behaviour.|$|E

500|$|The free-associative [...] "Champion" [...] is {{primarily}} composed of motivational lyrics, but West also briefly {{touches on the}} strained relationship he had with his father–who divorced from his mother {{when he was just}} three-years-old–eventually reaching the conclusion that even with their ups and downs, in the end, his father was a champion in his eyes. West described [...] "Stronger" [...] as an [...] "emancipation", as he uses the song to vent his frustration over mistakes he has made in the past. He describes his tribulation's with music critics and media causing his return as a [...] "Stronger" [...] rapper, as the song title implies. [...] "I Wonder" [...] carries an introspective tone, retaining a chorus about finding one's dreams, while West uses the verses to describe the struggle a person experiences in determining the meaning behind their life and achieving <b>those</b> <b>dreams.</b> Inspired by watching Bono open stadium tours, West concentrated on speaking volumes without using too many words on the song and delivers his raps in an exuberant, staccato manner. Using the same vocal stylings, [...] "Flashing Lights" [...] tells the operatic narrative of man contemplating the complexities of a tragic relationship. [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothing" [...] serves as West's reflection on his fame and is characterized by bitter remorse and defiant self-awareness. West begins the song by expounding his conflicted feelings regarding wealth and desire, describing a compulsion to spend that overwhelms any and all other objectives in life. He ties this into his perceived overall inability to keep himself together even as he grows into an increasingly prominent figure in the public eye.|$|E
500|$|The [...] are {{humans who}} willingly {{give up their}} lives to have their souls sealed in statues and commune with summoners with whom they have {{established}} a mental link. This link grants a summoner access to a fayth's dreams and enables {{him or her to}} physically realize <b>those</b> <b>dreams</b> as , powerful creatures which may be employed to aid the summoner in battle or in a time of special need. During the events of Final Fantasy X, the fayth of the aeon Bahamut serves as the chosen representative of the fayth as a collective. The fayth aids High Summoner Yuna and her guardians in bringing the spiral of death to an end, which results in their own passing. In Final Fantasy X-2, the fayth return in their aeon forms, this time having been overcome by the despair and malice of Shuyin, rendering them his unwilling puppets of chaos. Yuna and her allies free both the fayth and Shuyin from the darkness that has consumed them. Ten aeons are identified in Final Fantasy X: Valefor, Ifrit, Shiva, Ixion, Bahamut, Anima, Yojimbo and the three Magus Sisters. The game builds on mythological figures through the inclusion of the aeons, such as the Arabic Ifrit, the Hindu deity Shiva and even the Jungian figure Anima and the demon Valefor. Wilder wrote on the Jungian analysis of Anima and tied Square Enix's depiction of the Aeon as both a representation of Seymour's corruption. Wilder analyzes the chained and blinded depiction of the figure that is Seymour's mother and tying the form to her bound to servitude to Seymour in his descent into madness.|$|E
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have <b>those</b> <b>dreams</b> and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
