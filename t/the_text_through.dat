5|$|Outside of China, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} texts to mention gunpowder is Roger Bacon's Opus Majus (1267) and Opus Tertium in what has been interpreted as a reference to firecrackers. In the early 20th century, a British artillery officer proposed that another work tentatively attributed to Bacon, Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae, also known as Opus Minor, dated to 1247, contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder. These claims have been disputed by science historians. The formula itself, claimed to have been hidden within <b>the</b> <b>text</b> <b>through</b> encryption, is not useful for firearm or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke.|$|E

After significant observation, Stefanko has concluded that [...] "as hybrid selves who cross and recross borders of language and culture, these Latina writers create hybrid texts in order to 'survive in diaspora,' to use Donna Haraway's term, seeking to heal the fractures and ruptures resulting from exile and dispersal". Through her creation of How the García Girls Lost Their Accents Alvarez has intentionally fictionalized her own life story in a polyphonous manner which extends {{beyond the boundaries of}} traditional style and genre, thus setting herself apart from the average author both stylistically and structurally.|$|E

500|$|... is a chorale cantata, a {{style in}} which both text and music {{are based on a}} hymn. In this instance, the source was Martin Luther's hymn of the same name, the main hymn for Easter in the Lutheran church. The {{composition}} is based on the seven stanzas of the hymn and its tune, which was derived from Medieval models. Bach used the unchanged words of a stanza of the chorale in each of the seven vocal movements, in the format of chorale variations [...] (for all stanzas), and he used its tune as a cantus firmus. After an opening sinfonia, the variations are arranged symmetrically: chorus–duet–solo–chorus–solo–duet–chorus, with the focus on the central fourth stanza about the battle between Life and Death. All movements are in Eminor, and Bach achieves variety and intensifies the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>text</b> <b>through</b> many musical forms and techniques.|$|E
500|$|The {{primary source}} of Biblical Hebrew {{material}} is the Hebrew Bible. epigraphic materials from the area of Israelite territory are written in a form of Hebrew called Inscriptional Hebrew, although this is meagerly attested. According to Waltke & O'Connor, Inscriptional Hebrew [...] "is not strikingly different from the Hebrew preserved in the Masoretic text." [...] The damp climate of Israel caused the rapid deterioration of papyrus and parchment documents, {{in contrast to the}} dry environment of Egypt, and the survival of the Hebrew Bible may be attributed to scribal determination in preserving <b>the</b> <b>text</b> <b>through</b> copying. No manuscript of the Hebrew Bible dates to before 400BCE, although two silver rolls (the Ketef Hinnom scrolls) from the seventh or sixth centuryBCE show a version of the Priestly Blessing. Vowel and cantillation marks were added to the older consonantal layer of the Bible between 600CE {{and the beginning of the}} 10th century. The scholars who preserved the pronunciation of the Bibles were known as the Masoretes. The most well-preserved system that was developed, and the only one still in religious use, is the Tiberian vocalization, but both Babylonian and Palestinian vocalizations are also attested. The Palestinian system was preserved mainly in piyyutim, which contain biblical quotations.|$|E

50|$|This {{approach}} {{is based on}} the belief that participants seek and gain deeper understanding of concepts in <b>the</b> <b>text</b> <b>through</b> thoughtful dialogue rather than memorizing information that has been provided for them. While Socratic Circles can differ in structure, and even in name, they typically involve the following components: a passage of text that students must read beforehand and two concentric circles of students: an outer circle and an inner circle. The inner circle focuses on exploring and analysing <b>the</b> <b>text</b> <b>through</b> the act of questioning and answering. During this phase, the outer circle remains silent. Students in the outer circle are much like scientific observers watching and listening to the conversation of the inner circle. When the text has been fully discussed and the inner circle is finished talking, the outer circle provides feedback on the dialogue that took place. This process alternates with the inner circle students going to the outer circle for the next meeting and vice versa. The length of this process varies depending on the text used for the discussion. The teacher may decide to alternate groups within one meeting, or they may alternate at each separate meeting.|$|E
