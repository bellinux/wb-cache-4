30|$|The {{paper has}} four main messages. First, {{in the context of}} a global {{strategy}} to increase the incomes of the poorest workers, it is important to identify interventions to support subsistence entrepreneurs. The constraints they face and the type of support they need differ from those of vocational or transformational entrepreneurs. Second, the evidence of what works for subsistence workers is limited. A few programs have been successful, but they tend to be small, and there is limited knowledge available about design and implementation in different contexts and with different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Third, given prevalent market failures faced by the poor, interventions to complement safety net programs and improve the livelihoods of subsistence entrepreneurs are required. Fourth, going forward, it is critical to adopt a more systematic approach to designing, implementing, and evaluating new programs. Special attention should be paid to eligibility, targeting, and profiling mechanisms; selection of businesses to be supported; adaptation of core interventions (training, access to finance, advisory and mentoring services, and networking) to beneficiary needs; whether and how programs are integrated into subsectors and/or value chains; and delivery mechanisms for different services.|$|E

40|$|In January 2005, Russia {{implemented}} a major overhaul of its social assistance system. The principal hallmark was the cashing out or monetization of some benefits previously provided on an in-kind basis. Using household survey data, this article measures {{the social and}} economic effects of the monetization of transportation privileges in the Saratov region and analyzes the attitude of citizen categories now receiving privileges to the further transformation of their privileges into cash benefits in the future. With respect to the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> that fared relatively better and worse through the reforms as measured by changes in consumption, local travel, and perceived changes in their standard of living, the clearest finding is that rural beneficiaries fared better than their urban counterparts. This was expected because monetization was implemented for transportation benefits that are used primarily by urban residents. With respect to outcomes by income class, there is a broad pattern of beneficiaries in households with lower economic resources faring less well, although the overall effects are not large. Beneficiaries' responses to questions about further monetization of specific benefits overwhelmingly favor monetization, with the conspicuous exception of benefits for housing and communal services where sector-specific factors are at work. This is particularly telling given the poor implementation of the first wave of reforms. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract There is {{increasing}} {{experience with the}} valua-tion of ecosystem services. However, to date, less attention {{has been devoted to}} who is actually benefiting from ecosystem services. This nevertheless is a key issue, in particular, if ecosystem services analysis and valuation is used to support environmental management. This study assesses and analyzes how the monetary benefits of seven ecosystem services are generated in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, are distributed to different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> We analyze the following ecosystem ser-vices: (1) timber production; (2) rattan collection; (3) jelutong resin collection; (4) rubber production (based on permanent agroforestry systems); (5) oil palm production on three management scales (company, plasma farmer, and independent smallholder); (6) paddy production; and (7) carbon sequestration. Our study shows that the benefits generated from these services differ markedly between the stakeholders, which we grouped into private, public, and household entities. The distribution of these benefits is strongly influenced by government policies and in partic-ular benefit sharing mechanisms. Hence, land-use change and policies influencing land-use change can be expected to have different impacts on different stakeholders. Our study also shows that the benefits generated by oil palm conversion, a main driver for land-use change in the pro-vince, are almost exclusively accrued by companies and {{at this point in time}} are shared unequally with local stakeholders...|$|E
30|$|One {{possibility}} for our findings {{could relate to}} misclassification <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> into <b>types.</b> The correct classification <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> into <b>types</b> is crucial when estimating the overall response to seed capital because our simulations suggest that type 2 beneficiaries should be much more responsive to seed capital than type 1 and type 3 beneficiaries. We classify all beneficiaries who were employed prior to seed capital and who had disability degrees close to a cash-cliff as type 2. Observed bunching at cash-cliffs prior to seed capital announcement is consistent with labour supply responses to a non-linear budget set, but Fig.  3 also displays bunching at disability degrees that are not associated with higher DI benefits (for example, 80 % and 100 %). Clustering of disability degrees at decimal numbers may therefore also reflect rules of thumb that case workers use {{in the assessment of}} disability degrees. Consequently, the true proportion <b>of</b> <b>type</b> 2 <b>beneficiaries</b> may be much smaller than predicted.|$|R

50|$|After the EPA had {{introduced}} watershed-based NPDES permitting in 2007, interest in nutrient removal and achieving regional TMDLs {{led to the}} development of nutrient trading schemes. Nutrient trading is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> water quality trading, a market-based policy instrument used to improve or maintain water quality. Water quality trading arose around 2005 and is based on the fact that different pollution sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Water quality trading involves the voluntary exchange of pollution reduction credits from sources with low costs of pollution control to those with high costs of pollution control, and the same principles apply to nutrient water quality trading. The underlying principle is “polluter pays”, usually linked with a regulatory driver for participating is the trading program. A 2013 Forest Trends report summarized water quality trading programs and found three main <b>types</b> <b>of</b> funders: <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> watershed protection, polluters compensating for their impacts and ‘public good payers’ that may not directly benefit, but fund the pollution reduction credits on behalf of a government or NGO. As of 2013, payments were overwhelmingly initiated by public good payers like governments and NGOs.|$|R
40|$|Classification is a {{first step}} in theory construction, and social {{scientists}} concerned with voluntary action have devoted considerable effort toward the classification of formal voluntary organizations. Internal political structure (Sills, 1957), organizational incentives (Clark and Wilson, 1961), <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> (Bell and Force, 1956; Blau and Scott, 1962) and stage in the formalization process (Chapin and Tsouderos, 1956) are among the proposed bases for classification. Typologies involving organizations ’ functions for members and/or society are more commonly used. Gordon and Babchuk (1959) classified organizations according to whether they served instrumental, expressive, or instrumental-expressive functions. Similarly, Warriner and Prather (1965) classified organizations {{on the basis of the}} &dquo;value functions&dquo; of their central activities: pleasure in performance, sociability, ideological symbolism, or production. Palisi and Jacobson (1977) have used a study of student participation to show that the Gordon-Babchuk and Warriner-Prather typologies can fruitfully be combined. Work along such lines will doubtlessly continue. Gordon and Babchuk’s (1959) typology, in particular, has been shown on the basis of members ’ perceptions to be a unidimensional, valid framework for describing voluntary associations (Jacoby and Babchuk, 1963), and it has proven useful in predicting members ’ activities (Jacoby, 1965), recruitment processes (Jacoby, 1966), and organizational problems (Warner and Miller, 1964). However, such typologies have been criticized for resulting in categories which are too broad to allow many important distinctions to be made (Warner and Miller, 1964; Smith and Freedman, 1972 : 9). Moreover, any classificatory scheme which is not strictly based on empirically observed differences may reflect the values of the analyst to an unintended and undesirabl...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we aim {{to assess}} the “best fit” of the {{existing}} Lithuanian micro-datasets for constructing a national micro-simulation model. Specifically, we compare and evaluate the potential of two (state level) representative micro-data surveys {{in terms of their}} potential to simulate Lithuanian (direct) taxes, social contributions and social benefits. Both selected datasets contain rich information on the socio-economic and demographical conditions of the country: the Household Budget Survey (HBS) for the years 2004 and 2005 and the European Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) in Lithuania for the year 2005. The selected databases offer the most comprehensive range of income and other socio-demographic attributes, needed for simulation of tax and contributions’ payers/amounts and benefits’ recipients/amounts. The evaluation of the dataset capacity to simulate these measures is done by a comparative statistical analysis. Among the comparative categories are definitions (of households, incomes), survey collection modes, level of aggregation of various variables, demographic and incomes variables and corresponding numbers (amounts). The comparative analysis of the HBS and EU-SILC datasets shows, that despite embedded differences and shortages regarding simulation capacities of both surveys, these datasets contain valuable and sufficient information for the purpose of simulation of Lithuanian tax-benefit policies. In general a conclusion could be drawn, that HBS offers higher possibilities of simulating the Lithuanian tax-benefit system. This dataset contains more detailed national income categories (i. e. recipients of maternity/paternity insurance, diverse pensions, etc.) — information on which is not available in the EU-SILC. The latter dataset does not contain national policy system specific components, but offer information on income aggregates, such all old-age pensions, social exclusion benefits, etc. Additionally, HBS also offers information as the non-cash transfers, while the EU-SILC has a higher focus on the cash incomes. As some of the Lithuanian social policies are interlinked, HBS information on different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> enables more precise simulation of some measures. On the other hand, the EU-SILC provides more information on living conditions, which directly or indirectly could be used in the micro-simulation model underlying dataset. Generally, the comparison of HBS and EU-SILC datasets highlights the difficulties and dangers of simulation result interpretation, if the underlying data come from methodologically different datasets. This applies both to the use of micro-simulation methodology and any other empirical analysis. We also draw a conclusion, that the use of EU-SILC data for Lithuania provides a higher value and opportunities of coherent cross-country (EU) taxbenefit simulations, while HBS enables a more precise national policy simulation.

40|$|In Luxembourgish {{legislation}} {{the term}} “international protection” includes both refugee status and subsidiary protection status. Integration of beneficiaries of international protection into the Luxembourgish labour market might appear quite unproblematic at first glance. From a legal point of view, the access is indeed very much open to both beneficiaries of international protection {{as well as}} beneficiaries of subsidiary protection. As from 2006 onwards, the legislator proceeded with an approximation of both statuses, providing the same rights to both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of international protection. As soon as the applicants are granted international protection they are authorised to engage in employed or self-employed activities under the same conditions as Luxembourgish nationals, with the exceptionof civil servant jobs. This is also true {{for most of the}} support measures that aim to advance or enhance the access to employment, whether on the level of education, vocational training, language learning, recognition of diploma, counselling, social aid or access to housing. In each of those areas, the beneficiaries of international may in principle benefit from equivalent access as provided to other migrants, third-countrynationals or Luxembourgish nationals. Yet, the reality on the ground seldom matches the aims of the legislative framework. Effective access to the labour market remains a significant challenge for beneficiaries of international protection in order to fully integrate in Luxembourgish society. The linguistic regime as well as the high demands in terms of language requirements constitute a first major hurdle, both at the level of education/vocational training and the labour market. Rather than being able to immediately access the regular education system, respectively the labour market, refugees must first engage in a learning process sometimes coupled with administrative procedures (i. e. recognition of diplomas) that may significantly slow down the integration process. The transition period that begins once the applicant is granted international protection status appears to be particularly challenging. Indeed, several measures from which the applicants for international protection benefited during the procedure will no longer be available once they are granted the status. Thus, social aid, including housing, provided to international protection seekers will no longer be applicable to refugees. Even though national authorities have implemented several specific targeted measures in order to facilitate the transition period (i. e. progressive financial contribution to accommodation costs), it remains a phase of instability and uncertainty for the refugees and their families. This also stresses the need for employment-related support measures, which in Luxembourg are implemented in a more general integration framework. Thus, most of the support measures that exist for beneficiaries of international protection are not tailored to them in particular, but they are also open to other types of migrants or foreigners living in Luxembourg...|$|E

50|$|Second, {{criticism}} {{has been directed}} towards the way the Court tackles the issue of compatibility. Through its narrow interpretation of ‘social assistance’, the Court is said to altogether isolate {{the effect of the}} concerned provision of the Directive and seem to evade rather than interpret its true meaning. This has been seen as an attitude by the Court of unwillingness to question the legality of the European Union’s legislative choices in secondary law, and looking to resolve conflicts between primaryand secondary EU law by imposing “forcefully reconciliatory” interpretations instead of formally invalidating provisions. A likely explanation for this has been uttered by some academics: the outcome of the case is more important to the Court than the process, as the process is ignored and bypassed to achieve the desired outcome of, in line with previous case law, promoting an 'integrationist' agenda friendly to free movement and citizenship. Two main criticisms have been formulated against this integrationist approach. First, this decision creates a considerable legal uncertainty, as a distinction must be made now between benefits specifically granted for jobseekers and ‘ordinary‘ social assistance. Some authors consequently wonder if a form of jobseekers benefits that would fall within the latter category even exists. Moreover, the social laws of Member States usually do not classify benefits on the basis of big underlying socio-political objectives such as “facilitating access to the labour market”, but rather, they usually distinguish benefits on the basis <b>of</b> form and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> Second, this decision causes jobseekers to be treated differently depending {{on the question of whether}} or not Member States have included them into their general social security system, rather than having granted specific benefits to them. This has been seen to showcase a formal and superficial way to deal with the underlying material problem as to when and when not foreign jobseekers are to be included in the welfare system of the host Member State.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how {{the notions of}} benevolent acts, welfare issues and social justice are conceived by Indonesian Muslims, and investigates the multiplicity of roles played by Islamic charitable associations. Such associations, which have multiplied rapidly {{in the past two}} decades, were typically established by members of the affluent middle class and carried out widespread welfare-oriented activities in both urban and rural areas. By relating three main issues (welfare, dakwah and politics), this study also discusses whether charity activism can generate social mobility among low income households as the targeted beneficiaries, and whether Islamic charitable associations are able to promote collective social change instead of simply strengthening middle class networks or serving certain religious denominations. Using social the intellectual and socio-historical development of the NGO sector at large as an approach, this research proposes the following conclusions. First, there have been contending views among Indonesian Muslims about how the perceived problems, such as welfare, poverty, and social injustice, should be resolved. Islamic charities, with their wide-spread engagement with social enterprises in the communities, tend to confine their activities to short-term relief actions, and reluctantly penetrate the political sphere in order to empower the underprivileged to claim back their social, economic, and political rights, and to restore their self-reliance to reach their social and economic goals. Islamic charities flourishing in post New Order Indonesia have emerged as a new popular pattern of social activism, the vey antithesis, both discursively and practically, of development and advocacy NGOs at large, which primarily promote collective and structural change. Second, religious and cultural proximities remain essential to the formation of Islamic social enterprises and the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Most Islamic charities have originated from dakwah (religious dissemination) movements or {{from a wide range of}} politically-oriented Islamic solidarity groups. This origin has shaped not only the types of discourse and activities within Islamic charitable associations, but also has determined the categories of beneficiaries to be served. This research found that while under the framework of dakwah, Islamic charities have been able to reformulate notions of brotherhood, solidarity, mutual help, and even social justice, as a means of strengthening the welfare of the Islamic community, they still tend to restrict their work to narrowly defined deserving beneficiaries belonging to the same religion or even denomination within their religion. Therefore, Islamic charities are now challenged how to make their social services beneficial to a wider range of stakeholders in Indonesia, as a culturally and religiously diverse country. Finally, the interplay between religion and politics has influenced the nature of Islamic charities in Indonesia and shaped the relations of Islamic charities among themselves and with others (non-Muslim charities or secular NGOs). This research suggests that sharing similar religious values and having similar identities do not always result in cooperation, partly because the fragmented political orientations have put the existing associations to compete with each other instead of establishing strategic partnerships for long-term welfare project...|$|E
40|$|Stakeholder {{analysis}} has become {{popular in the}} management literature, since the 1980 s but is usually accompanied by debate about its use and scope. Later on, {{the view that the}} consideration <b>of</b> various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> stakeholders is <b>beneficiary</b> for organisations has been borrowed by the information systems literature where it was realised that successful implementation of information systems does not depend only on technical aspects. In this paper we examine how the use of stakeholder concept can be expanded outside the boundaries of a company or a group of companies, helping at the implementation of a successful electronic commerce policy from national governments. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} effects of the Colombian Unemployment Insurance program on future labor participation, unemployment, formality, school {{attendance}} and earnings <b>of</b> its <b>beneficiaries,</b> on household earnings and school attendance of the household members, and on weight and height of their children at birth. We use both regression discontinuity and matching differences-in-differences methods and find similar results in all outcomes but labor participation for males and females. We do not find any significant effect of the program on future unemployment rates, school attendance <b>of</b> the <b>beneficiaries</b> or <b>of</b> the household members, neither of their children’s weight or height at birth. We found a negative effect on formality measured as the enrollment on health insurance, and a reduction of both individual and household earnings of males and females, although weaker for females. Finally, labor participation of females is negatively affected although with mixed results, while that of males falls around 8 percent. The results are sensible to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> training <b>beneficiaries</b> receive in the program. We significantly benefited from feedback provided by Hugo López, and by Verónica Alaimo, Robert LaLonde, Jacqueline Mazza, Carmen Pages, and participants at the workshops organized in the Project Protecting Workers against Unemployment in Latin America and the Caribbean, organized by the Inter-American Development Bank. We also thank Carlos Barbosa, Jorge Eliécer Giraldo and Francisco Lasso for assistance, the staff of Comfama and Comfenalco for providing us the data <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> and Martha Ligia Restrepo for her support with the Sisben data.

40|$|El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar la aceptabilidad, consumo y tolerancia de un suplemento alimentario llamado «Nutricrema» especialmente formulado para niños, mujeres embarazadas y madres lactantes desnutridas o en riesgo de desnutrir. Se efectuó un estudio observacional descriptivo en una muestra aleatoria de beneficiarios de Distritos definidos como prioritarios y no prioritarios según nivel de pobreza. Se aplicó una encuesta sobre características socioeconómicas y del retiro, consumo, preparación, tolerancia y dilución intrafamiliar de la Nutricrema. Los datos se analizaron según tipo de distrito, beneficiarios y grupo étnico (36, 6 % de indígenas). Se estudiaron 747 menores de cinco años y 704 mujeres embarazadas. Una proporción importante presentaba condiciones sociales adversas (madres sin instrucción, vivienda sin abastecimiento de {{agua potable}} o con piso de tierra), especialmente en distritos prioritarios (p The {{objective}} was to analyze the acceptability, consumption and tolerance of Nutricrema in people from different areas of Panama. An Observational descriptive study in different health facilities located in twenty districts of the country, providing information on the acceptability and consumption of «Nutricrema» in children 6 to 59 months of age, by pregnant and lactating women, was done. An interview was prepared with information related to the socioeconomic status {{of the family and}} of the frequency of retirement, consumption, methods of preparation and level of tolerance of Nutricrema among the members of each family. Data was analyzed according to «priority» and «non priority» districts, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> and ethnic group. Significant differences were considered with a value of p < 0. 05. The study included, 747 children less than five years old and 704 pregnant women. Approximately one third of the families were considered as native. This ratio was significantly higher in «priority districts». Eighty percent (80 %) <b>of</b> the <b>beneficiary</b> members received the «Nutricrema» on a regular basis. The average consumption was 6. 4 ± 1. 4 days per week, 3. 0 ± 1. 1 servings/day and 99 ± 64 grams of the Nutricrema/day. Most of the population (90 %) did no show food intolerance to Nutricrema. We concluded that acceptance and consumption of this food supplement was high in mothers and child with a low percentage of intolerance observed. Nutricrema is a cost-effective intervention to supply energy, protein and micronutrients in high risk familie...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} dynamics of racial classification in contemporary Brazil, as state and social movement actors have recently come together to implement anti-racist legislation and policies. Brazil is an important site for study of race because until {{early in this century}} laws and official policies largely treated it as irrelevant. More recently, policies such as affirmative action have been implemented to combat racial inequality, however the meaning of race and the categories for the new policies are being created and the categories are contested. Two primary questions guide this dissertation: How are official categories being constructed for new race- targeted affirmative action policies in Brazil? And how are these new categories negotiated by Brazilians who are being asked to self-identify for inclusion in these policies? The first question addresses {{the dynamics of}} racial classification and categorization in contemporary Brazilian affirmative action policy, and the other the possible consequences these practices may have for boundary dynamics in the population. The first question draws on a qualitative case study - semi-structured interviews; documentary research; and participant-observation – of affirmative action policy in highereducation in Brazil. Scholars of ethno-racial politics in Latin America argue that states more readily consider claims based on the recognition and protection of cultural difference as legitimate, but are resistant to calls for the remedy of racial discrimination. As a counterexample, I show how issues of racial exclusion and discrimination gained traction in public policy in Brazil. I show how race came to be only one component of that policy; instead, race was combined with class to establish a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> status for affirmative action: poor black students. In the process quotas for public school student have also become widespread. The second question draws on sixteen months of participant-observation and forty-two semi-structured interviews with Brazilians connected to Black movement organized college prep courses. I discuss how Brazilians striving to enter the university negotiate the use of new policies. I find that the unique way affirmative action policies have been designed and implemented in Brazil, targeting poor students as well as poor black students, contributes to produce a new population, one that doesn’t view color in oppositional terms but feels solidarity along class lines that are racially inclusive...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this diploma thesis lies on an {{evaluation}} of the support of the so-called "rural tourism industry" in a selected area of the South Moravian Region, provided by the ERDF`s Regional Operational Programme "Southeast". The theoretical part of the thesis includes literature research; it also analyses and explains basic terminology on the fields of tourism industry and rural tourism industry, deals with the beginnings of the rural tourism in the Czech Republic and other countries; thereafter follows an explanation of the various forms of the rural tourism including an assessment of the significance of this kind of tourism while regarding the enormously important aspect of the sustainable development of the tourism industry in general. After defining important basic theoretical terms follows the second, regional politics concerning part; specifically a short explanation of the systematic implementation of the grants provided by the EU Structural Funds. This part deals mainly {{with the support of the}} tourism industry through the Regional Operational Programme. The next chapter gives an insight into the specifics of the analysed area of the South Moravian Region from the viewpoint of its potential for the development of the tourism industry, determined by the area's local and implementational preconditions. The applied part of the diploma thesis consists of the main analysis of all EU-supported projects from the priority axis 2, field of support 2. 1 (Infrastuctural support for the tourism industry). The first chapter of this part shows the general conclusions following from the main analysis' results. The individual projects are sorted by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> the project's focus and population count in the area of realisation. However, the focus of this diploma thesis lies on the support of the rural tourism industry; therefore it was necessary to define the standards for the determination of relevant projects, which follow the ideas of the rural tourism. These determined projects are further divided into specifical categories and described in regard of their benefits. Finally, {{an evaluation of the}} support provided by the Regional Operational Programme "Southeast" and of the possibilities of further development of the rural tourism industry...|$|R
