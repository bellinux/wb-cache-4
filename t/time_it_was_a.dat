5|$|After {{basic design}} work was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E
5|$|American {{explorer}} John Lloyd Stephens and English architect Frederick Catherwood {{visited the}} site in 1840, at which <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> confused jumble of overgrown ruins. Stephens published {{a description of the}} archaeological remains a year later. Catherwood did not draw any of the structures due to the poor state of the remains. The two excavated one of the mounds and recovered some ceramic vessels, which Catherwood drew.|$|E
5|$|During {{a sabbatical}} year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an {{investigation}} of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous variable stars. At the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mystery {{as to why they}} varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.|$|E

5|$|During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards {{attacked}} the Jokhang in 1966 {{and for a}} decade there was no worship in Tibetan monasteries. Renovation of the Jokhang began in 1972, and was mostly complete by 1980. After this {{and the end of}} persecution, the temple was re-consecrated. It is now visited by a large number of Tibetans, who come to worship Jowo in the temple's inner sanctum. During the Revolution, the temple was spared destruction and was reportedly boarded up until 1979. At that time, portions of the Jokhang reportedly housed pigs, a slaughterhouse and Chinese army barracks. Soldiers burned historic Tibetan scriptures. For a <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hotel.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, a {{tropical}} depression formed {{off the coast}} of Central America. It moved west-northwest, passing southwest of the Revillagigedo Islands. It then turned north and then north-eastward. For some <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hurricane, and it lost that intensity on or just before September 25. The tropical storm made landfall near San Pedro, California early on September 25 with winds of severe gale strength. It dissipated later that day. The strongest reported wind was of Force 11, reported by a ship, making this system a minimal hurricane. The lowest pressure was reported by the same ship and was 28.67inHg (971mb).|$|E
5|$|The {{area has}} been a major focus of modern Egyptological {{exploration}} for the last two centuries.

5|$|Athens {{was chosen}} as the Greek capital for {{historical}} and sentimental reasons, not because it was a large city. At the <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> town consisting of only 400 houses {{at the foot of the}} Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of Athens (1837, under the name Othonian University), the Athens Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens of Athens (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), and the Old Parliament Building (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion, Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.|$|E
5|$|His {{expedition}} completed after a {{total of}} 17 months, Beebe and Blair crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, then crossed the United States {{to return to their}} home in New York. Their expedition had obtained live or stuffed specimens of nearly all the pheasants he had sought, and also produced extensive notes about their behavior. Some of these pheasants, such as Sclater's impeyan or Himalayan monal, had never before been seen in the wild by Americans or Europeans. Beebe's observations of sexual dimorphism in pheasants during this expedition led him to become the first biologist to correctly understand the mechanism by which this aspect of sexual selection operates. On the basis of his observations he also proposed a new evolutionary model of pheasant ancestry, involving a period of rapid diversification followed by more typical and gradual changes. Although this evolutionary model is now taken for granted, in William Beebe's <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> novel idea.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E

5|$|On 24 August 1968 {{the group}} was again activated, this time in Vietnam. Its {{activation}} {{was part of a}} larger activation of several military police groups in the region to provide greater command and control for Military Police operating throughout the region. As such, the headquarters element took command of military police units already operating in the country. The Brigade provided policing duties, based in Long Binh along with the 89th Military Police Group. During that <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> subordinate unit of the 18th Military Police Brigade. It received its distinctive unit insignia on 12 November 1969. The group operated in Vietnam until the pullout of U.S. forces from the nation, receiving ten campaign streamers for its role in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Strangeways Brewery {{was founded}} in 1778 by two grain merchants, Thomas Caister and Thomas Fry, just north {{of what is now}} Manchester city centre. Their {{principal}} customers were the cotton workers of Manchester, then a burgeoning mill town. Henry Boddington, born in 1813 in Thame, Oxfordshire, joined the brewery in 1832 as a travelling salesman when the brewery was in the possession of Hole, Potter and Harrison. Like most Manchester breweries at the <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> modestly sized operation. Boddington had become a partner by 1848, alongside John and James Harrison, and by this time the company went under the name John Harrison & Co. In January 1853, Boddington borrowed money to become its sole owner. Between Boddington's takeover until 1877, the brewery's output increased tenfold from 10,000 to 100,000 barrels a year, making it not only Manchester's largest brewery but {{one of the largest in}} the North of England, with over 100 tied houses. By 1883 Henry Boddington & Co. was a limited liability company. Henry Boddington's estate was valued at almost £150,000 when he died in 1886.|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} forming, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Fernanda. Banding features increased, and outflow became well-established throughout the storm. Fernanda intensified further and attained hurricane status late on August 10. Soon after, a large eye became evident on satellite imagery, which became more distinct and organized. The hurricane subsequently underwent rapid intensification, and by August 12, Fernanda reached peak winds of 145mph (230km/h); at that <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and was located about 1070 miles (1725km) {{southwest of the}} southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The peak winds were based on estimates from the Dvorak technique. After maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours, the hurricane began a slow weakening trend. By August 14, the eye had become less distinct as the storm moved over cooler waters, while winds decreased to below major hurricane status, or Category 3 intensity. At that time, the NHC forecast Fernanda to decelerate and turn to the northwest, although the possibility of a more westward track toward Hawaii was noted.|$|E

5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
5|$|The Three Way {{main event}} began an {{extended}} storyline revolving around the participants. At Bound for Glory, A.J. Styles defeated Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match {{to retain the}} TNA X Division Championship. TNA then held a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match at TNA's Genesis PPV event on November13. In that match, Team Ministry (Alex Shelley, Daniels, Samoa Joe, and Roderick Strong) defeated the team of Austin Aries, Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley, and Sonjay Dutt. After the contest, Joe assaulted Daniels, performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on him twice, the second time on a steel chair. Daniels suffered an injury in the storyline due to the attack, sidelining him until December11 at TNA's Turning Point PPV event. At that event, Daniels saved Styles from an assault by Joe following Joe's victory over Styles to win the TNA X Division Championship. Daniels then challenged Joe for the championship at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January15, 2006, but Joe retained the title. At TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February12, 2006, Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in another Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title. The three competed again, but this time in a Three Way Ultimate X match for the championship at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March12, 2006. Daniels won, becoming the new TNA X Division Champion. The rivalry ended on the April13, 2006 episode of Impact! when Joe defeated Daniels to win back the championship. TNA promoted an Unbreakable rematch at their 2009 Turning Point PPV event on November15. This <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Three Way match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between Styles, Daniels, and Joe. Styles won the match to retain the championship.
