The right to unrectricted free thinking is to be enjoyed by all and sundry, including teenagers. Accordingly publicly enforced indoctrination called "civic education" deserves unqualified rejection.

40|$|Ideas that {{underlie}} postmodern <b>thoght</b> <b>are</b> rarely used in conversations about archrtectural education {{the way that}} philosophers and lrterary crrtics have used it since the early 1970 s: as a call to abandon that portion of modern vocabulary that sustains Plato 2 ̆ 7 s story that Truth is something that already exists, that our own human capacrties are not enough to get us a glimpse of Truth, and therefore, that some method that is detached from our own inadequate capacrties is needed if we are ever to extract the Real Truth from our mortal inclinations toward deceiving ourselves by believing in mere opinion, felt emotion, bad theory, or last night 2 ̆ 7 s dream. My favorite philosophers and lrterary critics call for abandonment of the old notion that {{the whole point of}} beginning an investigation, pondering a question, or having a conversation, in the first place, is to know, in the end, which of the investigators, ponderers, or conversants were right and which were wrong. This postmodern take on what inquiry or conversation is all about, challenges us to wean ourselves off of our old habit of wanting to know who is right and who is wrong...|$|R
