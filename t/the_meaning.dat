The trees have been tested on a corpus, {{and the results are}} encouraging. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} describing the form of French linguistic units, which express non-singular meanings. It also attempts to explain the semantic markers employed to express such <b>meanings.</b> <b>The</b> data collection is done through observation using non-active participation and field notes. The data then is descriptively analyzed by classification. <b>The</b> <b>meanings</b> of <b>the</b> non-singular linguistic units can be grouped into 1) <b>the</b> non-singular <b>meaning</b> based on word category and word sub-category 2) <b>the</b> non-singular <b>meaning</b> based on numbers 3) <b>the</b> non-singular <b>meaning</b> based on <b>the</b> process, and 4) the semantic markers which express <b>the</b> non-singular <b>meanings.</b> <b>The</b> result shows that <b>the</b> non-singular <b>meanings</b> only appear in pronouns and nouns. Based on the number, <b>the</b> non-singular <b>meanings</b> fall into finite and non-finite categories. They can also be classified as lexical and grammatical. The semantic markers determining <b>the</b> non-singular <b>meanings</b> can be grouped into inflectional affixes, determinants, zeros and contexts...|$|R

5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} a relevance-theoretic account of prosody by considering how <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of British English nuclear tones can be embedded in a more general relevance theoretic account and how <b>the</b> proposed <b>meanings</b> might combine with <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of other linguistic and non-linguistic stimuli in the interpretation of particular utterances. It presents a suggestion for <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of tones in Southern British English, explaining how they !t into the larger framework and into fuller accounts of the interpretation of individual utterances. It considers what this approach says about the nature of <b>the</b> prosodic <b>meanings</b> assumed and about how the semantics pragmatics distinction might be understood with regard to prosody. Finally, it considers how this approach might be compared with approaches in other frameworks...|$|R

5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of a concept. Tillich used {{the example of a}} national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E
