5|$|Nea Salamina's emblem {{incorporates}} the Olympic flame, the color red {{and the five}} rings of the Olympic Games. The club's colors during its first two years were yellow and crimson, when {{it was part of}} the Cyprus Amateur Football Federation. After 1950, <b>the</b> <b>governing</b> <b>council</b> changed its colors to red and white: red symbolizing power, and white symbolizing peace. Red-and-white striped jerseys were chosen because they resembled those worn by Olympiakos Piraeus.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} year he became Home Secretary in India {{in the administration of}} Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, and in 1909 was temporarily a member of <b>the</b> <b>governing</b> <b>council.</b> His experience of administrative matters, including with regard to policing, proved to be useful to Curzon during the government's 1905 partition of Bengal along communal lines. So useful was his knowledge and ability that his term in India was extended for two years beyond the usual retirement age. This was to enable him to provide the summarisation, negotiation and drafting skills necessary to ensure success in administrative reform of the Provincial Councils by Curzon's successor as Viceroy, Lord Minto.|$|E
5|$|The University of Toronto has {{traditionally}} been a decentralized institution, with governing authority shared among its central administration, academic faculties and colleges. <b>The</b> <b>Governing</b> <b>Council</b> is the unicameral legislative organ of the central administration, overseeing general academic, business and institutional affairs. Before 1971, the university was governed under a bicameral system composed {{of the board of}} governors and the university senate. The chancellor, usually a former governor general, lieutenant governor, premier or diplomat, is the ceremonial head of the university. The president is appointed by the council as the chief executive.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} {{treasure}} Morgan collected during his expedition is disputed. Talty {{writes that the}} figures range from 140,000 to 400,000 pesos, and that owing to the large army Morgan assembled, the prize-per-man was relatively low, causing discontent. There were accusations, particularly in Exquemelin's memoirs, that Morgan left away {{with the majority of}} the plunder. He arrived back in Port Royal on 12 March to a positive welcome from the town's inhabitants. The following month he made his official report to <b>the</b> <b>governing</b> <b>Council</b> of Jamaica, and received their formal thanks and congratulations.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1812, Russia and the Ottoman Empire {{signed the}} Treaty of Bucharest, {{bringing}} the Russo-Ottoman War to a close. For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. <b>The</b> <b>Governing</b> <b>Council</b> scrambled {{to take an}} oath of loyalty to Russia in the hope that this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon's plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled {{over the course of the}} uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding the minutiae of the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became clear that there was nothing to prevent the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik's Serb population after the Russians withdrew. Karađorđe thus refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest and fighting continued.|$|E
