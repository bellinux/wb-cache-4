Such fish include <b>T-Bar</b> cichlids, Honduran red points, Green Terrors, Jewel cichlids, Salvini, Jack Dempsey, (Keep {{in mind as}} Dempseys outgrow the convicts territorial issues will become a problem.) Pictus catfish, plecostomus, {{as well as other}} convicts. Other fast moving fish such as Giant Danios can be used as dither fish. Also remember, if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E

25|$|Full flow penetrometers (<b>T-bar,</b> ball, and plate) probes {{are used}} in {{extremely}} soft clay soils (such as sea-floor deposits) and are advanced {{in the same manner}} as the CPT. As their names imply, the <b>T-bar</b> is a cylindrical bar attached at right angles to the drill string forming what look likes a T, the ball is a large sphere, and the plate is flat circular plate. In soft clays, soil flows around the probe similar to a viscous fluid. The pressure due to overburden stress and pore water pressure is equal on all sides of the probes (unlike with CPT's), so no correction is necessary, reducing a source of error and increasing accuracy. Especially desired in soft soils due to the very low loads on the measuring sensors. Full flow probes can also be cycled up and down to measure remolded soil resistance. Ultimately the geotechnical professional can use the measured penetration resistance to estimate undrained and remolded shear strengths.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUse of <b>T-bars</b> in {{shipbuilding}} {{has increased}} recently. Although <b>T-bars</b> having a web height {{of at least}} twice the flange width are generally required for ships, the dimensions of existing hot-rolled <b>T-bars</b> are not suitable. As a result, <b>T-bars</b> for ships are typically fabricated by welding two plates. To solve this problem, a new rolling method for <b>T-bars</b> using a universal mill and edger mill was investigated. Finite element analyses of universal and edger rolling were executed to investigate the characteristics of side camber. Next, multi-pass rolling experiments simulating the rolling passes at a universal roughing mill and an edger mill were performed, and straight pure lead <b>T-bars</b> having satisfactory cross sections were obtained. However, the web heights {{at the top and}} tail ends were larger than those of the other part. Additional vertical rolls were applied to edger rolling to enable a slight reduction of the web height, and the web height deflection was eliminated by this new arrangement. The results of this research clearly demonstrated the potential of the new rolling process for producing <b>T-bars</b> of ships...|$|R

500|$|During {{construction}} {{the underground}} parking garage remained open. An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating {{two levels of}} underground parking underneath. The challenge was solved by combining a <b>T-bar</b> grid to absorb weight with about 150"outriggers", or [...] "tiebacks", inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads. This design allows {{for the removal of}} individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning.

2500|$|The [...] "Camry" [...] {{nameplate}} originated on a four-door sedan approximate to the Toyota Celica {{called the}} Celica Camry.

Production had earlier commenced in December 1979 at the Tsutsumi plant at Toyota, Aichi. Despite the marketing position, Celica Camry shares few components with its namesake—but rather the Carina (A40/A50). Toyota modified the Carina by elongating its front-end and incorporating styling cues such as the <b>T-bar</b> grille motif that resembled the Celica XX/Supra (A40).

2500|$|The Kiandra Goldrush was short-lived, but the {{township}} remained a service centre for recreational and survival skiing {{for over a}} century. The Kiandra courthouse closed as a police station in 1937, and was for a time used as a private residence, before becoming the Kiandra Chalet (until 1953) and later the Kiandra Chalet Hotel, The owner of the Chalet ran a ski rope tow. The Chalet closed in 1973 and the building became a Roads Depot building. Australia's first <b>T-Bar</b> was installed on Township Hill in 1957, but in 1978, Kiandra's ski lift operations re-located permanently to nearby Mount Selwyn (Selwyn Snowfields). Selwyn is the most northerly of Australia's ski resorts with a base elevation of 1492m and a top elevation of 1614m. Selwyn is well suited to families and first timers, with 88% of terrain catering to beginners and intermediates, however the steeper gradient of the Racecourse Run provides some more challenging terrain for advanced skiers and boarders.

Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times positively reviewed the performance and wrote that it was the most memorable moment of the night.

Dancers were also present as Rihanna emerged from the cage and began dancing along the broad stretch of stage. The performance concluded with big multi-coloured balloons pouring down red confetti from the ceiling as they burst, finalizing with Rihanna returning to the paint-covered cage and smearing it over herself ending with her silhouette being broadcast through the cage. At the ceremony, Rihanna also won the award for Best International Female Solo Artist. Whilst promoting her first feature film appearance in Battleship, Rihanna made a visit to Japan, performing [...] "We Found Love" [...] on the Japanese music television program Music Station. She donned a traditional kimono and concluded the performance by crowd surfing into the audience.

Rihanna later performed [...] "We Found Love" [...] at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the seventeenth and final song on the set list.

50|$|In 1962, {{the first}} ski season at Horseshoe Valley opened with five alpine slopes, a <b>T-bars,</b> four rope tows {{and a small}} base lodge.

50|$|Today, <b>T-bars</b> for children, {{particularly}} the more classic styles, are often considered semi-formal shoes, appropriate for school (some primary {{schools in the}} United Kingdom require that pupils wear them with their uniform).
