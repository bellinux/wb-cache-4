25|$|Until 2004, primary {{students}} traditionally {{took the}} National Elementary Achievement Test (NEAT) {{administered by the}} Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS). It {{was intended as a}} measure of a school's competence, and not as a predictor of student aptitude or success in secondary school. Hence, the scores obtained by students in <b>the</b> <b>NEAT</b> were not used as a basis for their admission into secondary school. During 2004, when DECS was officially converted into the Department of Education, <b>the</b> <b>NEAT</b> was changed to the National Achievement Test (NAT) by the Department of Education. Both the public and private elementary schools take this exam to measure a school's competency. As of 2006, only private schools have entrance examinations for secondary schools.|$|E

25|$|If, for {{environmental}} or other reasons, a solvent or solvent blend {{is required to}} replace another of equivalent solvency, the substitution can {{be made on the}} basis of the Hansen solubility parameters of each.

A 1:1 mixture of toluene and 1,4 dioxane has δD, δP and δH values of 17.8, 1.6 and 5.5, comparable to those of chloroform at 17.8, 3.1 and 5.7 respectively. Because of the health hazards associated with toluene itself, other mixtures of solvents may be found using a full HSP dataset.|$|E

25|$|Jian'an poetry {{refers to}} those poetic {{movements}} occurring {{during the final}} years of the failing Han Dynasty and continuing their development into the beginning of the Six Dynasties period. Jian'an is considered as a separate period because this is one case where the poetic developments fail to correspond with <b>the</b> <b>neat</b> categories aligned to chronology by dynasty. Typical poets of this period are Cao Cao, Cao Pi, Cao Zhi, and Xu Gan. One of the more important poetic developments of this period is toward the odd number, fixed length verse styles also typical of the Tang poetry period. As a result, some of the poetic forms often associated with Tang poetry can be traced back developmentally to some of the forms developed during the Jian'an period.|$|E

Finally, the frustrated mass of job-seekers McGregor encounters upon his arrival to the city is seen against <b>the</b> <b>neat</b> groups of marching men that excite a young reporter in Book VI.
