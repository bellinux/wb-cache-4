Now he's {{found a way to}} nurse a healthy level of ambition without taking that risk. He has, of course, a pronounced tendency to be wrong about the issues... Most typically, he appears as an ideological combatant. He seems to be selling himself to the nation's conservatives as an attractive spokesman.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the style of hanging-back defensive play common in the later 1950s and 1960s, Orr {{was known for his}} fluid skating and end-to-end rushing. Orr's rushing enabled him to be where the puck was, allowing him not only to score effectively but also to defend when necessary. According to the Bruins' Phil Esposito, [...] "No matter how fast an opponent was, Bobby could skate faster than him if he needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> framework of a play. If he was caught up-ice and the other team had an odd-man rush, that's when you saw his truly great speed. Very seldom did he not get back to have a hand in breaking up the play." [...] Orr also benefited from playing most of his career in Boston Garden, which was [...] shorter than the standard NHL rink. This suited his rushing style very well, as he was able to get {{from one end of the}} ice to the other faster than in a standard rink.|$|E

Holly catches onto the idea when she calls her parents herself, but she notices her parents seem mentally disoriented.

[...] Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J.

While Julis is showing Ayato and Saya around the city the next day as thanks for him saving her during the duel, Saya says that Ayato is a powerful opponent whose opponents never live to tell the tale, which Julis does not believe. Eventually, she realizes that Ayato is immensely powerful.
