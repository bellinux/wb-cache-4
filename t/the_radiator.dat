5|$|Eraserhead is a 1977 American surrealist body horror film written, produced, and {{directed}} by filmmaker David Lynch. Shot in black-and-white, Eraserhead is Lynch's first feature-length film, coming after several short works. The film was produced {{with the assistance of}} the American Film Institute (AFI) during the director's time studying there. Starring Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Jeanne Bates, Judith Anna Roberts, Laurel Near, and Jack Fisk, it tells the story of Henry Spencer (Nance), who is left to care for his grossly deformed child in a desolate industrial landscape. Throughout the film, Spencer experiences dreams or hallucinations, featuring his child and the Lady in <b>the</b> <b>Radiator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spencer begins {{experiencing}} visions, again {{seeing the}} Man in the Planet, {{as well as}} the Lady in <b>the</b> <b>Radiator</b> (Laurel Near), who sings to him as she stomps upon spermatozoon-like creatures. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a creature resembling the child, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into a pool of blood and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers.|$|E

5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/5 {{carried the}} 2 cm FlaK 38 whose mount was wider, and lighter, {{than that of}} the Flak 30, and the {{platform}} was enlarged to accommodate it from 1942. Vehicle width increased to , but the height returned to that of the normal vehicle. Initially, vehicles modified with the wider platform for the Flak 38 did not have a special designation, but they were given one sometime in 1943. The earliest known use is 1 September 1943, but the older name lingered until 1 December 1944. The Luftwaffe ordered 293 sets of armor plate (Behelfspanzerung) for its vehicles in 1943. These plates covered <b>the</b> <b>radiator,</b> windshield and both sides of the driver's compartment and were fitted to both versions.|$|E
5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; <b>the</b> <b>radiator</b> under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E
5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of {{scissors}} {{and for the first time}} removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in <b>the</b> <b>Radiator,</b> as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E

50|$|In {{the oldest}} modern {{hydronic}} heating technology, a single-pipe steam system delivers steam to <b>the</b> <b>radiators</b> where <b>the</b> steam gives up its heat and is condensed back to water. <b>The</b> <b>radiators</b> and steam supply pipes are pitched so that gravity eventually takes this condensate back {{down through the}} steam supply piping to the boiler where it can once again be turned into steam and returned to <b>the</b> <b>radiators.</b>|$|R

25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict {{flow to the}} heater core. The passenger side tank of <b>the</b> <b>radiator</b> {{is used as a}} bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through <b>the</b> <b>radiator</b> if the thermostat fails.|$|E
25|$|Pre-war Triumphs {{carried a}} stylised Globe badge, usually on <b>the</b> <b>radiator</b> grille, {{and this was}} also used on the first three models {{produced}} under Standard's control.|$|E
25|$|Externally, the FA-1/FB-1 {{could be}} {{distinguished}} from the FA-2/FB-2 (FPA-2/FPB-2) by the position of <b>the</b> <b>radiator</b> shutters – the FA-1/FB-1's shutters were {{at the far end}} of the carbody, whereas on the FA-2/FB-2 they were further forward, the design having been modified to allow the installation of a steam generator behind <b>the</b> <b>radiator.</b> The FPA-4/FPB-4 were visually different due to the additional radiator space that was positioned below the shutters. These Canadian variants were intended and used for high-speed passenger service, and remained in use into the 1990s on Via Rail Canada.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Radiators</b> wore their {{influences}} on their sleeve, or, at least, proudly displayed them in concert. [...] While their albums mainly featured songs written by chief songwriter/keyboardist/vocalist Ed [...] "Zeke" [...] Volker and other band members, their concerts typically included {{a wide variety}} of music written by other artists. [...] From the local New Orleans scene, <b>The</b> <b>Radiators</b> often featured works by, among others, The Meters, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint, Fats Domino, Earl King, Jelly Roll Morton, and, of course, Professor Longhair, several of whom played with <b>The</b> <b>Radiators</b> at one time or another. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Radiators</b> also covered songs traditionally associated with New Orleans or Mardi Gras, such as Iko Iko and St. James Infirmary Blues.|$|R

50|$|Averill {{had a short}} {{career as}} the singer Steve Rapid in Ireland's first punk band <b>The</b> <b>Radiators</b> from Space who were not very highly thought of by the musical establishment. <b>The</b> <b>Radiators</b> {{developed}} from Averill's involvement with Pete Holidai in two earlier bands: Greta Garbage and the Trashcans. Averill remained with the band from their inception in September 1976 until August 1977 when the other members moved to London. His last gig (during this period of <b>the</b> <b>Radiators)</b> was at Ireland's first outdoor rock concert in Dalymount Park on August 21 with Thin Lizzy.|$|R

25|$|Caterhams {{have very}} poor {{aerodynamics}} {{due to the}} blunt windscreen, open-wheel design, and open cockpit. At very high speeds, lift becomes a problem. To combat this, the CSR has several features that reduce lift by 50%. The front cycle wings are fitted closer to the tires to reduce turbulence. In addition, they have a small lip that angles air upward and creates {{a small amount of}} down force. Also, the new front suspension scheme reduces turbulence and drag formerly caused by the spring and damper units. The biggest enhancement is the vent added on top of the nose cone. On previous Caterhams, the air from <b>the</b> <b>radiator</b> caused turbulence by knocking against the engine and other parts on the underside. A plastic panel behind <b>the</b> <b>radiator</b> now directs air straight out through the vent, creating down force and reducing turbulence.|$|E
25|$|The Volvo symbol is {{an ancient}} {{chemistry}} sign for iron. The iron sign is used to symbolize the strength of iron used in the car as Sweden {{is known for its}} quality iron.

25|$|Since 1904, the fluted {{top surface}} to <b>the</b> <b>radiator</b> grille has been Daimler's {{distinguishing}} feature. This motif {{developed from the}} heavily finned water-cooling tubes slung externally {{at the front of}} early cars. Later, a more conventional, vertical radiator had a heavily finned header tank. Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and, even later, on the rear licence plate holder.|$|E
