25|$|On {{the stage}} to Geneva the frigid weather and several {{mechanical}} issues bore down on Alavoine. Thus it was not Lambot who attacked, but Heusghem (who had been second {{for the last two}} years). It appeared that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his shining Tour, however his bicycle broke on the ride to Metz. Heusghem made a prohibited bike change to stay in race for first. However, this defied the rules during this time, and he was docked one hour by race officials, dropping him to fourth overall. This is when Lambot noticed his change and took over in Dunkerque. Amidst all this Lambot took his second win of the Tour de France at the age of 36, becoming the first to win the Tour de France without winning a stage.|$|E
25|$|By February 638 {{there was}} a lull in the {{fighting}} on the Persian front. The Suwad, the Tigris valley, and the Euphrates valley were now under the complete control of the Muslims. The Persians had withdrawn to Persia proper, east of the Zagros mountains. The Persians continued raiding Mesopotamia, which remained politically unstable. Nevertheless, it appeared as if <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the dividing line between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Sassanids. In the later {{part of the year}} 638 Hormuzan, who commanded one of the Persian corps at the Battle of Qadisiyyah {{and was one of the}} seven great chiefs of Persia, intensified his raids in Mesopotamia, Saad according to Umar's instructions undertook offensive actions against Hormuzan and Utbah ibn Ghazwan aided by Nouman ibn Muqarin attacked Ahvaz and forced Hormuzan to enter into a peace treaty with the Muslims according to which Ahvaz would remain in Hormuzan's possession and he would rule it as a vassal of the Muslims and would pay tribute. Hormuzan broke the treaty and revolted against the Muslims. Umar sent Abu Musa Ashaari, governor of Busra to deal with Hormuzan. Hormuzan was defeated and sought once again for peace. Umar accepted the offer and Hormuzan was again made vassal of the Muslims. This peace also proved short-lived once Hormuzan was reinforced by the fresh Persian troops sent by Emperor Yazdgerd III in late 640. The troops concentrated at Tuster north of Ahvaz. Umar sent Governor of Kufa, Ammar ibn Yasir, governor of Busra Abu Musa, and Nouman ibn Muqarin towards Tustar where Hormuzan was defeated, captured and sent to Madinah to Caliph Umar, where he apparently converted to Islam. He remained a useful adviser of Umar throughout the campaign of conquest of Persia. He is also considered to be the mastermind behind the assassination of Caliph Umar in 644. After the victory at Tustar, Abu Musa marched against Susa, a place of military importance, in January 641, which was captured after a siege of a couple of months. Next Abu Musa marched against Junde Sabur, the only place left of military importance in the Persian province of Khuzistan which surrendered to the Muslims after a siege of a few weeks.|$|E

Page suggested that they attempt [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'", originally a jump blues song popularised in a rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. [...] "As soon as I heard John Bonham play", Jones recalled, [...] "I knew <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> great... We locked together as a team immediately". Before leaving for Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P. J. Proby album, Three Week Hero.

500|$|In 1982, Madonna {{was working}} with {{producer}} Reggie Lucas on her debut album. She had already composed three songs, when Lucas brought {{one of his own}} compositions to the project, calling it [...] "Borderline". However, after recording the song, Madonna was unhappy with the final version. According to her, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the song. This led to a dispute between the two. After finishing the album, Lucas left the project without altering the songs to Madonna's specifications. Hence, Madonna brought her then boyfriend John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to remix [...] "Borderline" [...] and two other recorded tracks. On hearing the final version, Seymour Stein, head of Sire Records declared, [...] "I dared to believe <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> huge beyond belief, the biggest thing I'd ever had, after I heard 'Borderline'... The passion that she put into that song, I thought, there's no stopping this girl." ...|$|E

Byrne said the song was the last recording Selena made before she {{was shot and killed}} by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques, on March 31, 1995. [...] Behar said promotion [...] "will be on the superstar scale" [...] and [...] " [...] didn't put this marketing campaign behind it because there was a tragedy. We put this marketing campaign behind it because we believed that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a huge album because of the music. This is a record that we're going to work over the next 10 months." [...] EMI Records and EMI Latin put aside [...] ($784,000 2015 USD) to complete Dreaming of You. [...] "Oh No (I'll Never Fall in Love Again)", a song intended to be recorded for Dreaming of You, was released on the SelenaQRadio (a free radio operated by Quintanilla, Jr.) in September 2015. Quintanilla, Jr. decided to release the demo version of the song after fans began requesting for it to be heard.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} in January 2016 that Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler were working on a memoir titled The 15:17 to Paris, which would highlight {{the events of the}} 2015 Thalys train attack. Perseus Books Group, who will be publishing the book, described the memoir as “the gripping true story of a terrorist attack that would have killed more than 500 people if not for their actions, but it is also the story of three American boys, their friendship, and the values we hold dear.” Jeffrey E. Stern, an international journalist, will co-write the book. David Steinberger, {{president and chief executive of}} Perseus Books Group, said that he is “confident that this is going to be a film. It’s extremely cinematic, and there’s a lot of interest in the movie.” He further said that [...] "based on the material, that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an important book and one that readers were really going to respond to.” The memoir was made available to the public on August 23, 2016, almost a year after the 2015 Thalys train attack. In the acknowledgements, Stone stated that he [...] "give all the credit to God" [...] and made further acknowledgement of his family, friends, the United States Air Force, the citizens of Sacramento and the United States Armed Forces.|$|E

500|$|Recording {{completed}} in March 1999 and all parties involved were enormously {{proud of the}} record. [...] "When it was done, we were so stoked. It was like a masterpiece for our band," [...] remembered DeLonge. [...] "We knew <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the best thing we}} ever did." [...] Hoppus felt the band achieved the purest, cleanest sound on the record that they had been striving for. Finn felt similarly, proud of his work on the record and believing in retrospect that the album would appeal to the masses. As the album was recorded on analog tape, the trio put enormous trust into Finn to give the record the polished pop sound they wanted, recalled DeLonge in 2012. [...] "The Party Song" [...] was the final song to be completed, and the three were mixing the song coincidentally when lead single [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] premiered on Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ. Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., best known for his work with Beck, played keyboards for several songs on the album. After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. In 2013, Hoppus referred to Enema of the State as [...] "the heart of Blink-182's musical sensibilities," [...] singling out [...] "its simplicity, its purity, its singularity of purpose between the three of us." [...] According to Barker, the album's title stemmed from DeLonge, who was worried about his diet at the time and using enemas.|$|E
500|$|... "Beat Goes On" [...] was {{performed}} during the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008–09) {{as the second}} song of the opening segment, [...] "Pimp". After descending the throne during the first song, [...] "Candy Shop", Madonna and her dancers are featured on a 1935 Auburn Speedster {{to the performance of}} the song. Both Williams and West appeared in the videos being displayed on the backdrops. Sarah Liss of CBC News called the performance [...] "pulsating," [...] noting that [...] "her studio collaborators—Pharrell Williams and Kanye West—present in spirit and countenance (their virtual likenesses grimaced from those massive screens) if not in body." [...] Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound praised the performance, writing that [...] "by the second song, 'Beat Goes On', it was clear that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one hell of an innovative show." [...] Roffman also pointed out that [...] "a digital Kanye West joined Madonna on stage, rapping along as the singer flipped and bounced on the floor." [...] During a Chicago concert, Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "a song about the freedom to dance ("Beat Goes On") becomes an anthem for political frustration, and it's the only moment that's generated any real controversy, but she doesn't say anything about either the Republican or the Democratic candidate that she hasn't said before. The power of any great Madonna song is implicit: 'Say what you like/Do what you feel/You know exactly who you are'." [...] The live performance of the song at River Plate Stadium of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was recorded and released on the live CD-DVD album, Sticky & Sweet Tour (2010).|$|E
500|$|The long-running Hardy Boys Mystery Stories series {{ended in}} 2005 and was {{replaced}} with a reboot series, [...] In these volumes, the Hardys' adventures are narrated in the first person, each brother alternating chapters. This fresh approach to telling the adventures reveals two boys quite foreign to how they have been portrayed before, egotistical and jealous, and longtime readers will find few connections with the boys' previous personalities. The boys' Aunt Gertrude becomes [...] "Trudy", their mother Laura is given {{a career as a}} librarian, and their father is semi-retired. The boys are given their cases by a secret group known as ATAC, an acronym for American Teens Against Crime. In this new series, the Hardy Boys seem [...] "more like regular kids – who have lots of wild adventures – in these books, which also deal with issues that kids today might have thought about. For example, the second book in the series, Running on Fumes, deals with environmentalists who go a little too far to try to save trees." [...] The Hardys are also featured in a new graphic novel series, begun in 2005 and produced by Papercutz, and a new early chapter book series called The Hardy Boys: Secret Files, begun in 2010 by the publisher Simon & Schuster under their Aladdin imprint. The last Undercover Brothers books were released in January 2012 (main series) and July 2012 (Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys Super Mystery'07 series). [...] At the time of cancellation, there was one book that had been announced, but was ultimately shelved (The Case Of The MyFace Kidnapper); it is unknown whether <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the final title of this unpublished book, since many bookstore websites and Simon & Schuster's website always had the letters [...] "W.T."

Nicolas co-owned Rhinoceros recordings and had previously worked with the band on their 1982 album, Shabooh Shoobah, five years earlier. In the band's 2005 official autobiography – INXS: Story to Story, Nicholas was optimistic about the album's production as he recalls, [...] "There was a really good feeling in the studio that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> something big.

Mittal later said of his involvement, [...] "I never expected that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> such a huge project.

2500|$|In 2005, C-SPAN {{planned to}} cover Dr. Lipstadt's {{book on the}} trial, History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving via its Book TV programme, but the cable network was heavily criticized when it was {{revealed}} that they had planned to put together a de facto debate between Dr. Lipstadt and Irving, by airing a new speech by Irving that they'd arranged with him to videotape, after an older one by Lipstadt (the network claimed <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done for [...] "balance"); when Lipstadt told C-SPAN she would not appear on the show under those circumstances, C-SPAN originally told her they would air Irving's speech by itself, but C-SPAN ended up cancelling this planned programme and instead aired a special that focused on how the trial was viewed by Washington Post reporter T. R. Reid and included clips of both Lipstadt and Irving.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cast and}} crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an {{isolated}} set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, [...] "I knew <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't ever {{want to go through}} this again". For example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially {{did not know how to}} minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely. Actor Leo Burmester said, [...] "Shooting The Abyss has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself." [...] A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank. Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night. In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.|$|E
