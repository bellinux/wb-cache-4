5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{victory was}} seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They {{consistently}} opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt that this would enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt that this would leave too much of a burden on the American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.|$|E

25|$|The first {{conference was}} held at the Hotel de Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, Netherlands, from 29 to 31 May 1954.

25|$|On 5 December 1988 (16 {{days prior}} to the attack), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a {{security}} bulletin saying that, on that day, {{a man with an}} Arabic accent had telephoned the US Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, and told them that a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> blown up within the next two weeks by someone associated with the Abu Nidal Organization; he said a Finnish woman would carry the bomb on board as an unwitting courier.|$|E

25|$|Oppenheimer, who was {{now head}} of the General Advisory Committee of the {{successor}} to the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Commission, presided over a recommendation against {{the development of the}} weapon. The reasons were in part because the success of the technology seemed limited at the time (and not worth the investment of resources to confirm whether this was so), and because Oppenheimer believed that the atomic forces of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more effective if they consisted of many large fission weapons (of which multiple bombs could be dropped on the same targets) rather than the large and unwieldy super bombs, for which there was a relatively limited number of targets of sufficient size to warrant such a development.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{very little}} was {{returned}} {{except for a}} few ships. Since the Lend-Lease agreement did not provide any practical mechanism for allied nations to make good on any materials or equipment destroyed in the war, the United States government was in fact implicitly conceding that it did not expect the return of every piece of material and equipment that it was loaning to its allies. Any suggestion otherwise in the part of the administration was intended more as political rhetoric to keep public opinion on its side as opposed to serious foreign policy. The intended and actual commitment the United States expected from its allies was to prevent the ravages of the conflict from reaching the North American continent. This in turn helped to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the world's strongest most prosperous industrial power {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|On September 25, 2007, the United States Supreme Court {{agreed to}} hear a lethal-injection {{challenge}} arising from Kentucky, Baze v. Rees. In Baze, the Supreme Court addressed whether Kentucky's particular lethal-injection procedure comports with the Eighth Amendment and will determine the proper legal standard by which lethal-injection challenges in general should be judged, all {{in an effort to}} bring some uniformity to how these claims are handled by the lower courts. Although uncertainty over whether executions in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> put on hold during the period in which the United States Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of lethal injection initially arose after the court agreed to hear Baze, no executions took place during the period between when the court agreed to hear the case and when its ruling was announced, {{with the exception of one}} lethal injection in Texas hours after the court made its announcement.|$|E

25|$|At {{this turn}} of events, Siho Lamphouthacoul inveigled Kouprasith Abhay into a coup, {{on the grounds}} that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> forced by events to accept their new government. Beginning at 2200 hours on the night of 18/19 April 1964, Siho's police unit Bataillon Special 33 (Special Battalion 33) seized Vientiane's infrastructure. Minister of Defense Phoumi Nosavan was {{contacted}} at 0415 hours; he declined to join the coup. By 0430, another DNC unit, Bataillon Special 11 (Special Battalion 11) had arrested Souvanna Phouma and 15 leading officials of such opposed factions as the Royal Lao Army, Forces Army Neutraliste, and the French Embassy. The coup force emptied the safe in FAN's headquarters and looted Kong Le's home. Some 15 other FAN officials sought asylum from the coup in the Soviet Embassy. The Royal Lao Air Force was placed on alert, with its pilots bedded down in tents on the flight line.|$|E
25|$|Before the Pentagon was built, the United States Department of War was {{headquartered}} in the Munitions Building, a temporary structure erected during World War I along Constitution Avenue on the National Mall. The War Department, {{which was a}} civilian agency created to administer the U.S. Army, was spread out in additional temporary buildings on the National Mall, as well as dozens of other buildings in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. In the late 1930s a new War Department Building was constructed at 21st and C Streets in Foggy Bottom but, upon completion, the new building did not solve the department's space problem and ended up {{being used by the}} Department of State. When World War II broke out in Europe, the War Department rapidly expanded in anticipation that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> drawn into the conflict. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson found the situation unacceptable, with the Munitions Building overcrowded and the department spread out.|$|E
25|$|By its tenth year, 1976, the National Register listed 46 shipwrecks and vessels. In 1985 Congress {{mandated}} that the National Park Service undertake {{a survey of}} historic maritime sites, including military sites, {{in tandem with the}} National Trust for Historic Preservation and the maritime preservation community. The program was known as the National Maritime Initiative. Its goal was to establish priorities for the preservation of maritime resources and recommend roles for {{the federal government and the}} private sector in addressing those priorities. The program identified eight categories to which the known maritime resources of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> classified. They included: preserved historic vessels, shipwrecks and hulks (those ships not afloat but not submerged entirely); documentation (logs, journals, charts, photos, etc.); aids to navigation (including coast guard stations and life-saving stations), marine sites and structures (wharves; warehouse, waterfronts, docks, canals, etc.); small craft (less than 40 feet long, less than 20 tons of displacement); artifact collections (fine art, tools, woodwork, parts of vessels, etc.); and intangible cultural resources (shipwright and rigging skills, oral traditions, folklore, etc.).|$|E

Among his accomplishments was accelerating the process of economic modernization to give Taiwan a 13% growth rate, $4,600 per capita income, and the world's second largest foreign exchange reserves. On 16 December 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter announced that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>would</b> no longer recognize the ROC as the legitimate government of China.
