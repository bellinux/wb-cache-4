5000|$|Oxycephaly, {{also known}} as <b>turricephaly,</b> [...] acrocephaly, hypsicephaly, oxycephalia, steeple head, tower head, tower skull, high-head {{syndrome}} and Turmschädel, {{is a type of}} cephalic disorder where the top of the skull is pointed or conical due to premature closure of the coronal suture plus any other suture, like the lambdoid, or it may be used to describe the premature fusion of all sutures. It should be differentiated from Crouzon syndrome. Oxycephaly is the most severe of the craniosynostoses.|$|E
50|$|The cranial {{bones are}} {{affected}} as well, similar to Crouzon syndrome and Pfeiffer syndrome. Craniosynostosis {{occurs when the}} fetal skull and facial bones fuse too soon in utero, disrupting normal bone growth. Fusion of different sutures leads to different patterns of growth on the skull. Examples include: trigonocephaly (fusion of the metopic suture), brachycephaly (fusion of the coronal suture and lambdoid suture bilaterally), dolichocephaly (fusion of the sagittal suture), plagiocephaly (fusion of coronal and lambdoidal sutures unilaterally), and oxycephaly or <b>turricephaly</b> (fusion of coronal and lambdoid sutures).|$|E
40|$|Saethre-Chotzen {{syndrome}} is an autosomal acrocephalosyndactyly syndrome whose gene {{has been assigned}} to chromosome 7 p (TWIST). A case of a 13 -year-old girl with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (ACS III) is described. The features of the syndrome include: turriplagiocephaly with a cranial circumference of 52 cm, facial asymmetry, low hairline, proptosis, antimongoloid slanting of palpebral fissures, nasal deviation with high bridge, angled ears, scoliosis and torticollis, clinodactyly of {{the fourth and fifth}} toes, large halluxes, and neurosensorial hypoacusia. For correction of the deformity, a cranioorbital remodeling was performed. The craniofacial approach with remodeling of the frontal bar and reduction of the <b>turricephaly</b> resulted in a satisfactory morphological and functional outcome, with complete three-dimensional reshaping and remodeling of the frontonasoorbital area...|$|E
40|$|In 1980, a novel {{multiple}} malformation syndrome {{has been}} described in a 17 -year-old woman with micro- and <b>turricephaly,</b> intellectual disability, distinctive facial appearance, congenital atrichia, and multiple skeletal anomalies mainly affecting the limbs. Four further sporadic patients {{and a couple of}} affected sibs are also reported with a broad clinical variability. Here, we describe a 4 -year-old girl strikingly resembling the original report. Phenotype comparison identified a recurrent pattern of multisystem features involving the central nervous system, and skin and bones in five sporadic patients (including ours), while the two sibs and a further sporadic case show significant phenotypic divergence. Marked clinical variability within the same entity versus syndrome splitting is discussed and the term "cerebro-dermato-osseous dysplasia" is introduced to define this condition. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
