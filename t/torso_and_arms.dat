25|$|If, as {{is thought}} to be the case, Leonardo painted the <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> of Christ in The Baptism of Christ on which he famously collaborated with his master Verrocchio, then his {{understanding}} of topographical anatomy had surpassed that of his master at an early age as can be seen by a comparison of the arms of Christ with those of John the Baptist in the same painting.|$|E
25|$|Rifkin {{committed}} {{his first}} murder in 1989, killing {{a woman in}} his home in East Meadow, Nassau County, Long Island, New York. He then dismembered her body, removing her teeth and fingertips, putting her head in a paint can and then leaving the paint can in the woods of a southern New Jersey golf course and her legs farther north in New Jersey and then dumping her remaining <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> into the East River around New York City.|$|E
25|$|At least 182 burial {{sites were}} found at Gobero. Of these, 67 have been excavated, and some {{were found to have}} pottery and other {{artifacts}} located around them. Earlier burials, usually those associated with the early occupation, have bones that are very dark in color which was most likely caused by their submersion when the lake levels rose. The early burials had tight constriction of the legs, which were usually pulled towards the <b>torso,</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms.</b> This suggests that their bodies might have been wrapped or bound with animal skin, ligament or basketry binding.|$|E

50|$|According {{to initial}} {{accounts}} from the officers, Crawford {{did not respond}} to verbal commands to drop the BB gun/air rifle and lie on the ground, and eventually began to move as if trying to escape. Believing the air-rifle was a real firearm, one of the officers fired two shots into Crawford's <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm.</b> He died of his injuries shortly afterwards.|$|R
500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Tabak had strangled Yeates at her flat {{within minutes of}} her arrival home on 17 December 2010, using [...] "sufficient force" [...] to kill her. The prosecutors stated that Tabak – around a foot (30cm) taller than Yeates – had used his height and build to overpower her, pinning her to the floor by the wrists, {{and that she had}} suffered 43 separate injuries to her head, neck, <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> during the struggle. The injuries included cuts, bruises, and a fractured nose. Lickley told the court that the struggle was lengthy, and her death would have been slow and painful. However, he did not offer an explanation for the reasoning behind Tabak's initial attack on Yeates.|$|E
500|$|Ivy {{appears as}} a tall, large busted woman with short, white hair. A bluish-purple leotard covers her <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms,</b> with patches of the fabric removed to expose her cleavage, {{buttocks}} and various parts of her abdomen. Similar leggings cover her legs midway below her thighs, connected to the leotard by garters at golden metal bands at their peak. A sleeve of the same material covers her right arm and hand, while armor covers her left arm, hand, and shoulder. A smaller pauldron covers her right shoulder, while high heels cover her feet, and a white glove covers her right hand. The left shoulder pauldron incorporates the Tudor Rose, a traditional heraldic symbol of England, while the plates of the armor were designed to resemble the links of her sword. A mask covering {{the right side of}} her face and eye were also considered but abandoned after the initial character concept. While her design has been altered slightly as the series has progressed, the concept has remained consistent throughout the series, {{with the exception of the}} removal of the glove in later designs. Ivy stands [...] tall, making her the series' tallest female character, and with a bust measurement of 100cm (39in) also the bustiest, though this was an aspect that the developers felt they had overdone by her appearance in Soulcalibur IV.|$|E
2500|$|... 26 January: Stephen Sinclair, 20. Nilsen's final victim. Sinclair was {{originally}} from Perth, Scotland; {{at the time}} he encountered Nilsen, he was a heroin addict, who suffered from the habit of self-harming. Nilsen encountered Sinclair in Oxford Street, where he first bought the youth a hamburger before suggesting that Sinclair accompany him to Cranley Gardens. After Sinclair had consumed alcohol and injected heroin at Nilsen's flat, Nilsen strangled him to death with a ligature. The head, upper <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> of Sinclair were stowed in the tea chest in Nilsen's living room; Sinclair's lower torso and legs were stowed beneath Nilsen's bathtub.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{mechanism}} to communicate emotions to hu-mans by using head, <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm</b> movements of a hu-manoid robot, without exploiting its facial features. To this end, we build a library of pre-programmed robot movements and we ask people to attribute emotional scores to these ini-tial movements. The answers are then used to fine-tune motion parameters with an active learning approach...|$|R

50|$|Mechanical {{attacks are}} strong against {{biological}} parts, biological attacks are strong against alchemical parts, and alchemical attacks are strong against mechanical parts. In {{order to create}} parts you have to collect pieces from defeated enemies and mini-games. Then those pieces are brought to the labs {{of one of the}} three mad scientists where you play mini-games to combine the pieces into either Legs, Heads, <b>Torsos,</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms.</b> You then may create your own controllable monster by combining the parts into a single creature.|$|R

50|$|The Weapons Pak, which {{consisted}} of existing weapons and armor, mostly in different colours to their original, included yellow versions of Beast Man's <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm</b> armor (as well as his whip, in its original black). As a result, many examples of the Beast Man figure found on the second-hand market can be found to be wearing this yellow version of the armor. Some sellers even promote this as a variant version of the figure, but in actuality it is just down to previous owners mixing the parts up over the years, as Beast Man figures only ever came wearing the red version of the armor.|$|R

A giant robotic yellow lion with ninja earth magic {{which forms}} {{the majority of}} the body of Senpuujin: legs, <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> left <b>arm</b> (which forms Gourai Senpuujin's chest). Its attack is the Karakuri Ninpou Lion Dance (Karakuri Ninpō Ren Jishi).|$|R
50|$|There {{were little}} {{supplies}} {{available to the}} Zeon remnants, so to build up their forces, the Dra-C was built from salvaged parts and mobile suit components (notably the <b>torsos</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> of Zaku II F2s). This new machine is a space-only, fast interception mobile suit, armed only with a 40mm vulcan gun on its right <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> a beam saber-equipped shield on the left arm. This mobile suit was notably used by the Delaz Fleet remnants during the Delaz Conflict of 0083, and some would continue to see some use at least another thirteen years afterward, {{in the hands of}} the Axis Fleet during both the Gryps Conflict of 0087-0088, and by the Sleeves in 0096.|$|R

5000|$|Neshek {{has a very}} unorthodox {{style of}} {{delivery}} that transitions from starting at a submarine angle to finishing sidearm with an explosive thrusting motion. Near {{the release of the}} pitch, his <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm</b> angle in a moderate [...] "V" [...] shape. He developed the delivery after being struck in the forearm with a ball in high school by C. J. Woodrow (a former Philadelphia Phillies farmhand). He then began to throw side <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> play shortstop due to his injury. When it healed, he could not change back to over the shoulder and his unique delivery stayed the way it is. He still has a lump in his forearm where he was struck.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method for {{determining}} body orientation and pose information from laser scanner data using particle filtering with an adaptive modeling algorithm. A parametric human shape model is recursively updated to fit observed data after each resampling step of the particle filter. This updated model is then used in the likelihood estimation step for the following iteration. This method has been implemented and tested by using a network of laser range finders to observe human subjects {{in a variety of}} interactions. We present results illustrating that our method can closely track <b>torso</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm</b> movements even with noisy and incomplete sensor data, and we show examples of body language primitives that can be observed from this orientation and positioning information.
