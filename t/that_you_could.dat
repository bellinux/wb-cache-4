5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} Oz books, {{no one can}} die. One of the books assures us that while {{you are in the}} Land of Oz, you cannot die. Unfortunately, this {{information}} comes after characters in the books have been chopped into pieces, beheaded, melted, and so forth and it is mentioned <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be transformed into an inanimate object, turned into sand, and buried. Even so, you would still be alive and presumably conscious.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed to}} strike an {{extraordinary}} {{balance between the}} psychological and the supernatural {{in such a way}} as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|E

25|$|The road {{began in}} the Forum Romanum, passed through the Servian Wall at the porta Capena, went through a cutting in the clivus Martis, and left the city. For this stretch of the road, the {{builders}} used the via Latina. The building of the Aurelian Wall centuries later required the placing of another gate, the Porta Appia. Outside of Rome the new via Appia went through well-to-do suburbs along the via Norba, the ancient track to the Alban hills, where Norba was situated. The road {{at the time was}} a via glarea, a gravel road. The Romans built a high-quality road, with layers of cemented stone over a layer of small stones, cambered, drainage ditches on either side, low retaining walls on sunken portions, and dirt pathways for sidewalks. The via Appia {{is believed to have been}} the first Roman road to feature the use of lime cement. The materials were volcanic rock. The surface was said to have been so smooth <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not distinguish the joints. The Roman section still exists and is lined with monuments of all periods, although the cement has eroded out of the joints, leaving a very rough surface.|$|E
500|$|Jon Hamm {{praised the}} {{prostitution}} sequence as [...] "Very elegant paired with Don's pitch to Jaguar. This idea of something beautiful <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> possess, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> own. It's one thing when you're {{talking about a}} car. It's something else when you're talking about a human being." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, {{music video}} blog Yes, We've Got a Video! ranked both the marching band video and the Rube Goldberg machine video at number 3 in their top 30 videos of 2010. The latter in {{particular}} was praised for [...] "the cleverness {{of it and the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> always pick up something new upon each and every view." ...|$|E

500|$|Albania's bunkers {{have even}} {{become a symbol}} of sorts for the country. Pencil holders and {{ashtrays}} in the shape of bunkers have become one of the country's most popular tourist souvenirs. One such line of bunker souvenirs was promoted with a message to buyers: [...] "Greetings {{to the land of the}} bunkers. We assumed <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not afford to buy a big one." ...|$|E
500|$|Film maker Zoya Akhtar wrote: [...] "He has a {{very strong}} {{storytelling}} style and he proved <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell a great story with not a lot of money." [...] Actor Ranbir Kapoor added, [...] "He's very sensitive to actors, to performances and very attached to his cinema. All his films may not be big money spinners but the impact Anurag has, his contribution to Indian cinema, is immense." ...|$|E
500|$|Shrek has 31 {{sequence}}s, with 1,288 {{shots in}} every sequence total. Aron Warner {{said that the}} creators [...] "envisioned a magical environment <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> immerse yourself into." [...] Shrek includes 36 separate in-film locations {{to make the world}} of the film, which DreamWorks claimed was more than any previous computer-animated feature before. In-film locations were finalized and as demonstrated by past DreamWorks animated movies, color and mood was of the utmost importance.|$|E

500|$|Green {{starred in}} the first season of Starz's series, Camelot, as the sorceress Morgan le Fay. Green stated, [...] "This is such an iconic story and you have 10 episodes to explore a {{character}}. It's not a girlfriend role <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have in a movie. It's a real ballsy character. She has some guts." [...] In 2012, Green played a vengeful witch Angelique Bouchard whose curse turns Johnny Depp's character into a vampire in Tim Burton's Dark Shadows.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{so excited}} about the 'Alejandro' video, [...] Actually, we're {{shooting}} it very soon and I don't want to say who the director is yet because it's {{going to give a}} lot away. [...] Are you absolutely mad? I would never, ever tell you ! I {{would be more likely to}} lie through my teeth to you [...] what the video's about so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> all be surprised. But I will tell you it's not the sequel to the 'Telephone' video.|$|E
500|$|One month later, on October 4, Mike Duffy, who {{was later}} {{appointed}} as a Conservative senator by Harper, said [...] "It is possible <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> change prime minister without having an election", {{and that some}} Conservatives wanted Harper to temporarily become prime minister without holding an election. The next day Layton walked out on talks with Harper and Duceppe, accusing them of trying to replace Paul Martin with Harper as prime minister. Both Bloc and Conservative officials denied Layton's accusations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, sir," [...] said Frank. He {{paused for}} a moment, and then resumed--"Well, there is {{something}} <b>that</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do, sir. I have a little brother out of employment; if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get him a situation, sir." ...|$|R

500|$|We {{learn about}} the stars by {{receiving}} and interpreting the messages which their light brings to us. The message of the Companion of Sirius when it was decoded ran: [...] "I am composed of material 3,000 times denser than anything you have ever come across; a ton of my material {{would be a little}} nugget <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> put in a matchbox." [...] What reply can one make to such a message? The reply which most of us made in 1914 was—"Shut up. Don't talk nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|The divorce writ {{prompted}} a deluge of bad publicity for Hubbard and elicited an unexpected letter to Northrup {{from his first}} wife, Polly, who wrote: [...] "If I can help in any way I'd like to—You must get Alexis in your custody—Ron is not normal. I had hoped <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> straighten him out. Your charges sound fantastic to the average person—but I've been through it—the beatings, threats on my life, all the sadistic traits you charge—twelve years of it ... Please do believe I do so {{want to help you}} get Alexis." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{other films}} {{tend to use}} only one {{storyboard}} artist, Jumper required six, who each worked on an individual action sequence. The artists were given specific instruction on {{the rules of the}} teleportation used in the film, to ensure accuracy in the storyboarding. One of them, Rob McCallum, reflected on the instructions: [...] "I was just thinking, 'How would a guy that can teleport fight?' So you were really pushing yourself to try to think of inventive, cool, spectacular ways <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> use this jumping talent that these characters have." ...|$|E

500|$|Soul {{music is}} a {{combination}} of R and gospel that began in the late 1950s in the United States. Soul music is characterized by its use of gospel techniques with a greater emphasis on vocalists, and the use of secular themes. The 1950s recordings of Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, and James Brown are commonly considered the beginnings of soul music. Solomon Burke's early recordings for Atlantic Records codified the style, and as Peter Guralnick writes, [...] "it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see anything resembling a movement".|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|He went on {{to exhibit}} {{considerable}} pride in the Haitian plantation built {{with the help of}} his sons: I wish you would go there. [...] would give you the best in the house. You ought to go, to see how happy the human race can be. It is a fine, rich valley, about thirty miles from Port Platte; heavily timbered with mahogany all round; well watered; flowers so beautiful; fruits in abundance, so delicious <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not refrain from stopping to eat, till you could eat no more. My sons have laid out good roads, and built bridges and mills; the people are improving, and everything is prosperous.|$|E
