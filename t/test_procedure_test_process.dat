40|$|Component-based {{systems are}} {{becoming}} prevalent {{at a rapid}} pace. With the growing demand for components, there arises a need for adequate component <b>testing</b> <b>procedures.</b> The component <b>testing</b> <b>process</b> at user end suffers with the unavailability of source code, which precludes extrapolating standard testing approaches. Effective Object Oriented (OO) component testing techniques require structural and behavioral information of component as a necessary test support element. We propose an OO component-testing framework that relies on utilization of metadata captured in discrete descriptors. A component developer generates a Component-Descriptor (CD) concomitantly with the component that provides behavioral analyses. The user chooses a component by browsing CDs and preparing Component Requirements Descriptor (CRD). Using analyses of component behavior in CD and of minimal requirements in CRD, third-party tester (TPT) conducts user directed component testing and reports bugs to the provider {{in the form of}} Component-Test-Specification-Descriptor (CTSD). The provider eliminates those bugs and returns the modified component and CD to TPT. This continues until TPT is satisfied with the reliability of component services. TPT then packages CTSD with the component for the user. The component provider, user, and TPT, each has the responsibility for descriptors unique to their perspective. The proposed framework attempts to eliminate the dilemma of unavailable information and supports objectivity in component <b>testing</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R

50|$|Documentation {{testing is}} part of {{non-functional}} testing of a product. It may be a type of black box testing that ensures that documentation about {{how to use the}} system matches with what the system does, providing proof that system changes and improvement have been documented.

It includes test case specifications, <b>test</b> plans, <b>test</b> <b>procedures,</b> <b>test</b> reports, and test logs. It is about the testing of all the documents stating, defining, explaining and reporting or validating requirements, procedures followed and results. Documentation testing starts with the beginning of the very first software process to be most cost effective. Documentation testing includes checking the spelling and grammar to review any ambiguity or inconsistency between what functionality it performs and what it is supposed to do.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} a study of AUV energy systems and endurance. A {{comparative}} study {{of a number of}} high energy density systems is carried out and based on this study, a few high energy density systems are selected for possible use on the AUV "C-SCOUT". The optimum operating speed and the endurance limits of "C-SCOUT" are then calculated. Next, two powering prediction methods (the "ITTC 1978 " method and the "Load-Varying Self-Propulsion Test" method) are compared, in order to estimate the powering performance of "C-SCOUT". Subsequently an account of the resistance, self-propulsion and bollard pull tests conducted on "C-SCOUT", is included. Areas discussed include <b>test</b> setup, <b>test</b> <b>procedure,</b> <b>test</b> results and problems faced. Finally this thesis takes a look at propeller design.

40|$|This paper reviews {{global and}} {{multiple}} tests for the combination ofn hypotheses using the orderedp-values of then individual tests. In 1987, Röhmel and Streitberg presented a general method to construct global level α tests based on orderedp-values when there exists no prior knowledge regarding the joint {{distribution of the}} corresponding test statistics. In the case of independent test statistics, construction of global tests is available by means of recursive formulae presented by Bicher (1989), Kornatz (1994) and Finner and Roters (1994). Multiple <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> can be developed by applying the closed test principle using these global tests as building blocks. Liu (1996) proposed representing closed tests by means of “critical matrices” which contain the critical values of the global tests. Within the framework of these theoretical concepts, well-known global <b>tests</b> and multiple <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> are classified and {{the relationships between the}} different tests are characterised.
