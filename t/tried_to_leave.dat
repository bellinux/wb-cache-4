5|$|Isaac was {{the only}} patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> God {{told him not to}} do so.

Isaac was the oldest of the biblical patriarchs {{at the time of his}} death, and the only patriarch whose name was not changed.|$|E

5|$|On 25 January the gale {{was still}} blowing; the fleet <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Botany Bay, but only HMS Supply made it out, {{carrying}} Arthur Phillip, Philip Gidley King, some marines and about 40 convicts; they anchored in Sydney Cove in the afternoon. On 26 January, {{early in the}} morning, Phillip {{along with a few}} dozen marines, officers and oarsmen, rowed ashore and took possession of the land in the name of King George III. The remainder of the ship's company and the convicts watched from on board Supply.|$|E
5|$|Schmidt had {{secretly}} been sending money to British banks with fleeing refugees {{ever since the}} Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933. When she eventually <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country on 28 June 1939, Sicherheitsdienst (SD) agents arrested her at the Dutch border and took her to Gestapo headquarters. Once there she was seen by Walter Schellenberg, who at that time worked in the counter-intelligence department of the SD. He gave her an ultimatum: cooperate with the Nazis or be sent to a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her {{room with a}} wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E

The FBI agrees to allow Metro-Dade to conduct the surveillance as its equipment was in place first. Crockett and Tubbs watch Amato's abusive relationship with his wife Rita (Katherine Borowitz). When Rita attempts to hire a hitman to kill Amato, Crockett intercepts the call and meets with her, arranging her help in their case in return for her safety. She explains that she has <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Amato before, but he hired thugs to rape her divorce lawyer's wife to scare her into place.|$|E
5|$|By the {{day after}} Hurricane Lane made landfall, most of the {{evacuated}} people returned to their homes to begin the cleanup process. Some tourists who remained {{in the area for}} the storm continued their vacations, while others <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the area. The federal government {{declared a state of emergency}} for nine municipalities in Sinaloa, allowing emergency funds to give relief support to the affected population. Helicopters were used to distribute foods and locate cut-off residents. The government set up three temporary shelters in Mazatlán for 360people and three shelters in Culiacán for about 1,000affected residents. To prevent the spread of Dengue fever, officials sent epidemiologists to 67communities, with 18mobile units and 15Nebulizer units. By a month after the storm, all roads and highways affected by the hurricane were open for transportation.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{returned}} to Normandy, expecting {{to have been}} given both the Duchy and England, to find that William Rufus had crossed the Channel and been crowned king, as William II. The two brothers disagreed fundamentally over the inheritance, and Robert soon began to plan an invasion of England to seize the kingdom, helped by a rebellion {{by some of the}} leading nobles against William Rufus. Henry remained in Normandy and took up a role within Robert's court, possibly either because he was unwilling to openly side with William Rufus, or because Robert might have taken the opportunity to confiscate Henry's inherited money if he had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> William Rufus sequestered Henry's new estates in England, leaving Henry landless.|$|E

5|$|The Ultimate Warrior {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} in his steel cage match with Rick Rude. After the Warrior missed a splash attempt, Rude attempted {{to win the}} match by escaping the cage. The Warrior stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted to perform their finishing moves. Rude was then able to perform a Rude Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the Warrior rather than escape the cage. Rude performed a shoulderblock and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> through the cage door. The Warrior held him back while Bobby Heenan, Rude's manager, tried to pull Rude out. The Warrior pulled both Rude and Heenan into the cage. He punched Heenan and then threw {{him out of the}} cage with an atomic drop. Warrior then knocked Rude down three times with clotheslines and threw him onto the ring floor with a gorilla press drop. Warrior climbed over the cage and dropped to the arena floor to win the match and retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|The second match pitted Razor Ramon, {{with the}} 1–2–3 Kid in his corner, against WWF Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett, who had The Roadie in his corner. Ramon took {{control at the}} {{beginning}} of the match by using power moves against Jarrett. Jarrett <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the match, but the 1–2–3 Kid forced him back into the ring. Jarrett took advantage of one of Ramon's mistakes to gain the advantage. He applied a sleeper hold on Ramon, who used his strength advantage to escape the move. After Ramon threw Jarrett, the Kid attempted to interfere but was kicked by Jarrett. Ramon jumped off the ropes to attack Jarrett, but Jarrett avoided the move and applied a figure four leglock on Ramon. Ramon reversed the move to place the pressure on Jarrett's legs. He then threw Jarrett to the mat with a suplex from the second rope and prepared to execute the Razor's Edge, his finishing move. The Roadie entered the ring and attacked Ramon, prompting the referee to disqualify Jarrett; because titles cannot change hands on a disqualification, Jarrett retained his championship.|$|E
5|$|While Governor Shirley was at Louisbourg trouble {{had been}} brewing between the Royal Navy {{and the people}} of Boston. The Navy had long sought to press Americans into service on its ships. Impressment was a long-standing {{practice}} in Britain, but its application in America was resisted by the colonists. In 1702 Fort William on Castle Island had fired on HMS Swift as it <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Boston Harbour with six recently impressed men aboard. As a result of American complaints (reinforced by British merchants), Parliament in 1708 banned impressment in the American colonies. Navy leaders argued that the American exemption from impressment had been in force only during Queen Anne's War, which ended in 1713. In practice, Royal Navy captains had to apply to colonial governors for a license to press men. In late November 1745 a fight between a press gang and some sailors staying in a boarding house in Boston left two of the sailors with fatal injuries. Two members of the press gang were charged with murder and convicted, but were released when the indictment was found invalid.|$|E

5|$|The {{breakout}} {{began as}} soon as the weather allowed the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing to provide air cover on 1 December. As the soldiers formed a convoy and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the perimeter, the PVA 241st Regiment immediately swarmed over the American forces, with three other regiments closing in. Left with no choice, the covering aircraft dropped napalm right in front of RCT-31, causing casualties among both Chinese and US troops. The resulting firestorm wiped out the blocking Chinese company, allowing the convoy to advance. As the front of RCT-31 made their way forward, heavy small arms fire caused many members of the rear guard to seek shelter below the road instead of protecting the trucks. Chinese fire also killed or wounded those already in the trucks as well as the drivers, who viewed the job as a form of suicide. Slowly, the convoy approached a roadblock under Hill 1221 in the late afternoon. Several parties tried to clear Hill 1221, but after taking part of the hill, the leaderless soldiers continued out onto the frozen reservoir instead of returning to the column. As Faith led an assault on the roadblock, he was hit by a Chinese grenade and subsequently died of his wounds. The convoy managed to fight past the first road block, but as it reached the second at Hudong-ni, RCT-31 disintegrated under Chinese attacks. About 1,050 soldiers out of the original 2,500 managed to reach Hagaru-ri, and only 385 survivors were deemed able-bodied. The remnants of RCT-31 were formed into a provisional army battalion {{for the rest of the}} battle.|$|E
