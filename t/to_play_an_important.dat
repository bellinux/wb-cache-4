SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions.

Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E

Newer types, {{such as the}} Panther, were still experiencing crippling reliability problems that restricted their combat efficiency, {{so much of the}} effort fell to the 841 Panzer IVs that took part in the battle. Throughout 1943, the German army lost 2,352 Panzer IVs on the Eastern Front; some divisions were reduced to 12–18 tanks {{by the end of the}} year. In 1944, a further 2,643 Panzer IVs were destroyed, and such losses were becoming increasingly difficult to replace. Nevertheless, due to a shortage of replacement Panther tanks, the Panzer IV continued to form the core of Germany's armored divisions, including elite units such as the II SS Panzer Corps, through 1944.|$|E
5|$|Until {{recently}} {{historians have}} accepted {{an account of}} the time that Tecumseh was furious with Tenskwatawa for losing the battle, and that Tecumseh had threatened to kill his brother for making the attack. According to this story, the Prophet lost prestige after the battle and no longer served as a leader of the confederacy. In their subsequent meetings with Harrison, several Native leaders claimed that the Prophet's influence was destroyed; some accounts said that he was being persecuted by other leaders. Historians Alfred A. Cave and Robert Owens have argued that the Natives were probably trying to mislead Harrison, in an attempt to calm the situation, and that Tenskwatawa continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role in the confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed {{a longing for}} a pre-Christian Northern past; the mass media typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry {{in various parts of}} the world. That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{categorize}} {{a case of}} epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early. Less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy (2.8 per 100,000), childhood absence epilepsy (0.8 per 100,000) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (0.7 per 100,000). Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are {{also referred to as}} epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction, for instance Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome. Genetics is believed <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent exome and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.|$|E
5|$|Until 1880 the Met ran no goods trains, but goods trains {{ran over}} its tracks from 20 February 1866 when the GNR began {{a service to}} the LC via Farringdon Street, {{followed}} by a service from the Midland Railway from July 1868. The GNR, the GWR and the Midland all opened goods depots in the Farringdon area, accessed from the City Widened Lines. Goods traffic was <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> part of Met traffic on the extension line out of Baker Street. In 1880, the Met secured the coal traffic of the Harrow District Gas Co., worked from an exchange siding with the Midland at Finchley Road to a coal yard at Harrow. Goods and coal depots were provided at most of the stations on the extension line as they were built. Goods for London were initially handled at Willesden, with delivery by road or by transfer to the Midland. The arrival of the GCR gave connections to the north at Quainton Road and south via Neasden, Acton and Kew.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, Roma's then-president Franco Sensi sacked Zeman {{and signed}} Fabio Capello as a replacement, {{with the aim}} of winning the league title. By the 2000–01 {{campaign}} under the new coach, Roma were building a competitive team around Totti, who was by now being utilised as a creative attacking midfielder by Capello in a 3–4–1–2 formation, due to his passing skills and playmaking abilities. Totti scored in a 2–0 home win over Bologna on his season debut on 1 October 2000. On 10 December, Totti scored the match-winning goal in a 2–1 home win against Udinese with a powerful left-footed volley to help Roma to their fifth home win of the season. He continued his goalscoring form by scoring against Napoli at home in a 3–0 victory on 28 January 2001, as Roma finished {{the first half of the}} league season in first place. Totti continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> role in keeping the club at the top of the table throughout the remainder of the season, gaining a comfortable lead over rivals Juventus. On 17 June 2001, at the Stadio Olimpico, Roma beat Parma 3–1, with their three main attackers, Totti, Vincenzo Montella and Gabriel Batistuta scoring one goal each, as Roma were crowned champions of Italy for the third time in their history. Totti finished the league season with 13 goals, equalling what was at the time his personal goalscoring record in a single Serie A season.|$|E

Chow had worked previously with Woo on the two A Better Tomorrow films.

John Woo approached his friend, Sally Yeh, asking her to be in a film <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> female character. Yeh was currently contracted with Tsui Hark and accepted the role but later felt she did not give her best performance. The supporting roles were filled out by friends of the actors and director.

Two of Woo's close friends joined the cast: actor Kenneth Tsang and screenwriter Barry Wong.
