5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators working against {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of <b>the</b> <b>greatness</b> of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, saw their borders as lying much farther east. The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since then were part of the Prussian Empire, shaken by the 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|What Hasekura said or did {{to bring}} about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to {{indicate}} {{that he and his}} descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of <b>the</b> <b>greatness</b> and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud <b>the</b> <b>greatness</b> of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E

25|$|The Malay Annals is a {{historical}} literature written {{in the form of}} narrative-prose with its main theme was to laud <b>the</b> <b>greatness</b> and superiority of Melaka. The narration, while seemingly relating the story of the reign of the sultans of Melaka until the demise of the sultanate to the Portuguese in 1511 and beyond, deals with a core issue of Malay statehood and historiography, the relationship between rulers and ruled. The Annals are prefaced by a celebration of <b>the</b> <b>greatness</b> of Allah, the Prophet and his companions. They begin with a genealogical account of the first sultan of Melaka who is said to be descended from Raja Iskandar Zulkarnain. The Annals cover the founding of Melaka and its rise to power; its relationship with neighbouring kingdoms and distant countries; the advent of Islam and its spread in Melaka and the region as a whole; the history of the royalty in the region including battles won or lost, marriage ties and diplomatic relationships; the administrative hierarchy that ruled Melaka; <b>the</b> <b>greatness</b> of its rulers and administrators, including the Bendahara Tun Perak and Laksamana, Hang Tuah. The Annals conclude with the account of Melaka's defeat by the Portuguese forces in 1511, resulting not only in the downfall of Melaka, but also in the eventual re-emergence of the Melakan-modeled sultanates {{in other parts of the}} region, including Johor, Perak and Pahang.|$|E
