5000|$|Harman Kardon's design {{goal is to}} {{have the}} highest {{possible}} design quality for the price, rather than unnecessary features. The Harman Kardon model 330 series (330, 330A, B and C) from 1968-1979 {{is an example of the}} company's design philosophy, a basic no frills stereo <b>transistor</b> <b>receiver</b> but with excellent performance in its class.

50|$|The {{advent of}} {{transistors}} greatly reduced the battery requirements, since the current requirements at low voltage were greatly reduced {{and the high}} voltage battery was eliminated. Low cost systems employed a superregenerative <b>transistor</b> <b>receiver</b> sensitive to a specific audio tone modulation, the latter greatly reducing interference from 27 MHz Citizens' band radio communications on nearby frequencies. Use of an output transistor further increased reliability by eliminating the sensitive output relay, a device subject to both motor-induced vibration and stray dust contamination.In both tube and early transistor sets the model's control surfaces were usually operated by an electromagnetic escapement controlling the stored energy in a rubber-band loop, allowing simple rudder control (right, left, and neutral) and sometimes other functions such as motor speed, and kick-up elevator.|$|E
50|$|Sinclair wrote a {{book for}} Bernard's Publishing, Practical <b>transistor</b> <b>receivers</b> Book 1, which {{appeared}} in January 1959. It was re-printed late that year and nine times subsequently. His practical stereo handbook was published in June 1959 and reprinted seven times over 14 years. The last book Sinclair wrote as an employee of Bernard's was Modern Transistor Circuits for Beginners, published in May 1962. At Bernard Babani he produced 13 constructors' books.|$|R
50|$|Between 1963 and 1964, Fisher {{introduced}} {{their first}} all-transistor stereophonic receiver, the Fisher 400T. Early <b>transistor</b> <b>receivers</b> were not highly regarded by hi-fi enthusiasts, so manufacturers such as Fisher moved gradually with the technological advance. In the 1960s, Fisher made two trend-setting breakthroughs, marketing the first all-transistor (solid state) amplifier {{and the first}} receiver-phonograph combination, the forerunner of the compact stereo and integrated component system. These products brought Avery Fisher both fame and fortune. From 1959 to 1961, the firm also made important improvements in AM-FM stereo tuner design.|$|R
5000|$|By December 1965 NORAD {{decided to}} use the future Site C-6 radar [...] "for SLBM {{surveillance}} on an “on-call” basis" [...] "at the appropriate DEFCON", and the specifications for the Avco 474N SLBM Detection and Warning System contracted 9 December 1965 required the AN/GSQ-89 processing system for networking the AN/FSS-7 SLBM Detection Radar to also process Site C-6 data. By June 1966 the Site C-6 system was planned [...] "to have the capability to operate in the SLBM warning mode simultaneously with the space surveillance and tracking modes". [...] Rebuilding of the [...] "separate faces for transmitting and receiving" [...] began in 1967, with the destroyed analog phase shifters and vacuum tube receivers replaced by low-loss diode phase shifters and <b>transistor</b> <b>receivers.</b>|$|R

It consisted of a KG-3 transmitter a KG-12 receiver. The transmitter used about 500 <b>transistors</b> and the <b>receiver</b> about 300. The transmitter was switchable {{to function as a}} receiver.|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{microchips}} {{work well}} in their intended environments. However, generic microchips will not fimction correctly if exposed to sufficient amounts of ionizing radiation, the kind that satellites encounter in outer space. Modern CMOS circuits must overcome three specific concerns from ionizing radiation: total-dose, single-event, and dose-rate effects. Minority-carrier devices such as bipolar <b>transistors,</b> optical <b>receivers,</b> and solar cells must also deal with recombination-generation centers caused by displacement damage, which are not major concerns for majority-carrier CMOS devices. There are {{ways to make the}} chips themselves more resistant to radiation. This extra protection, called radiation hardening, has been called both a science and an art. Radiation hardening requires both changing the designs of the chips and altering the ways that the chips are manufactured...|$|R

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the CB radio service, transmitters and receivers used vacuum tubes; solid-state transmitters were not widely available until 1965, after the introduction of RF-power transistors. [...] Walkie-talkie hand-held units became affordable with the use of <b>transistors.</b> Early <b>receivers</b> did not cover all the channels of the service; channels were controlled by plug-in quartz crystals, with one of several operating frequencies selected by a panel control in more expensive units. Superheterodyne receivers (using one or two conversion stages) were the norm in good-quality equipment, although low-cost toy-type units used super-regenerative receivers. With the earliest sets two quartz crystals were needed for transmitting and receiving on each channel, which was costly. By the mid-1960s [...] "mixer" [...] circuits made frequency-synthesized radios possible, which reduced cost and allowed full coverage of all 23 channels with a smaller number of crystals (typically 14). The next improvement came during the mid-1970s; crystal synthesis was replaced by PLL technology using ICs, enabling 40-channel sets with only one crystal (10.240 MHz). Almost all were AM-only, although there were a few single sideband sets.|$|R
40|$|Optical {{interconnects}} {{are increasingly}} {{important for our}} communication and data center systems, and are forecasted to be {{an essential component of}} future computers. In order to meet these future demands, optical interconnects must be improved to consume less power than they do today. To do this, both more efficient transmitters and more sensitive receivers must be developed. This work addresses the latter, focusing on device level improvements to tightly couple a low capacitance photodiode with the first stage <b>transistor</b> of the <b>receiver</b> as a single phototransistor device. First I motivate the need for a coupled phototransistor using a simple circuit model which shows how receiver sensitivity is determined by photodiode capacitance and the length of wire connecting it to the first <b>transistor</b> in a <b>receiver</b> amplifier. Then I describe our use of the unique rapid melt growth technique, which is used to integrate crystalline germanium on silicon photonics substrates without an epitaxial reactor. The resulting material quality is demonstrated with high quality (0. 95 A/W, 40 + GHz) germanium photodiodes on silicon waveguides. Next I describe two germanium phototransistors I have developed. One is a germanium- gated MOSFET on silicon photonics which has up to 18 A/W gate-controlled responsivity at 1550 nm. Simulations show how MOSFET scaling rules can be easily applied to increase both speed and sensitivity. The second is a floating base germanium bipolar phototransistor on silicon photonics with a 15 GHz gain x bandwidth product. The photoBJT also has a clear scaling path, and it is proposed to create a separate gain and absorption region photoBJT to realize the maximum benefit of scaling the BJT without negatively affecting its absorption and photocarrier collection. Following this design a 120 GHz gain x bandwidth photoBJT is simulated. Finally I present a metal-cavity, which can have over 50 % quantum efficiency absorption in sub- 100 aF germanium photodiodes, which addresses the issue of absorption in photodiodes which have been scaled to near sub-wavelength dimensions...|$|R
40|$|This letter {{presents}} {{the design and}} characterization of a 220 GHz microstrip single-chip receiver {{monolithic microwave integrated circuit}} (MMIC) with an integrated antenna in a 0. 1 mu m GaAs metamorphic high electron mobility <b>transistor</b> technology. The <b>receiver</b> MMIC consists of a novel slot-square substrate lens feed antenna, a three-stage low noise amplifier, and a sub-harmonically pumped resistive mixer. The receiver MMIC is mounted on a 12 mm silicon substrate lens which focuses the radiation from the calibration loads to the on-chip antenna through an opening in the backside metallization of the MMIC. The double sideband noise figure of this quasioptical receiver is as low as 8. 4 dB (1750 K) at 220 GHz including the losses in the antenna and in the lens. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work demonstrates the highest integration level versus operating frequency for a MMIC ever published, regardless of technology...|$|R
40|$|The Background Emission Anisotropy Scanning Telescope (BEAST) is a {{millimeter}} wavelength experiment designed to generate maps of {{fluctuations in the}} cosmic microwave background (CMB). The telescope is composed of an off-axis Gregorian optical system with a 2. 2 m primary that focuses the collected microwave radiation onto an array of cryogenically cooled high electron mobility <b>transistor</b> (HEMT) <b>receivers.</b> This array is composed of six corrugated scalar feed horns in the Q band (38 to 45 GHz) and two more in the Ka band (26 to 36 GHz) with one of the six Q-band horns connected to an ortho-mode transducer for extraction of both polarizations incident on the single feed. The system has a minimum beam size of 200 with an average sensitivity of 900 mu K root s per receiver. This paper describes the design and performance of the BEAST instrument and provides the details of subsystems developed and used toward the goal of generating a map of CMB fluctuations on 200 scales with sensitivity in l space between l similar to 100 and l similar to 500. A map of the CMB centered on the north celestial pole has been generated from the BEAST telescope in a 9 degrees wide annulus at declination 37 degrees with a typical pixel error of 57 +/- 5 mu K when smoothed to 300 resolution. A brief summary of the map and results generated by an observing campaign at the University of California White Mountain Research Station are also included...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel circuit {{technique}} {{to generate a}} reduced voltage swing (RVS) signals for active power reduction on main buses and clocks. This is achieved without performance degradation, without extra power supply requirement, and with minimum area overhead. The technique stops the discharge path on the net that is swinging low at a certain voltage value. It reduces active power on the target net {{by as much as}} 33 % compared to traditional full swing signaling. The logic 0 voltage value is programmable through control bits. If desired, the reduced-swing mode can also be disabled. The approach assumes that the logic 0 voltage value is always less than the threshold voltage of the nMOS receivers, which eliminate the need of the low to high voltage translation. The reduced noise margin and the increased leakage on the <b>receiver</b> <b>transistors</b> using this approach have been addressed through the selective usage of multithreshold voltage (MTV) devices and the programmability of the low voltage valu...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a dual-linear-polarization HEMT (High Electron Mobility <b>Transistor)</b> amplifier <b>receiver</b> {{system of the}} 45 -GHz band (hereafter Z 45), and installed it in the Nobeyama 45 -m radio telescope. The receiver system is designed to conduct polarization observations by taking the cross correlation of two linearly-polarized components, from which we process full-Stokes spectroscopy. We aim to measure the magnetic field strength through the Zeeman effect of the emission line of CCS (J_N= 4 _ 3 - 3 _ 2) toward pre-protostellar cores. A linear-polarization receiver system has a smaller contribution of instrumental polarization components to the Stokes V spectra {{than that of the}} circular polarization system, so that it is easier to obtain the Stokes V spectra. The receiver has an RF frequency of 42 - 46 GHz and an intermediate frequency (IF) band of 4 - 8 GHz. The typical noise temperature is about 50 K, and the system noise temperature ranges from 100 K to 150 K over the frequency of 42 - 46 GHz. The receiver system is connected to two spectrometers, SAM 45 and PolariS. SAM 45 is a highly flexible FX-type digital spectrometer with a finest frequency resolution of 3. 81 kHz. PolariS is a newly-developed digital spectrometer with a finest frequency resolution of 60 Hz, having a capability to process the full-Stokes spectroscopy. The Half Power Beam Width (HPBW) of the beam was measured to be 37 " at 43 GHz. The main beam efficiency of the Gaussian main beam was derived to be 0. 72 at 43 GHz. The SiO maser observations show that the beam pattern is reasonably round at about 10 % of the peak intensity and the side-lobe level was less than 3 % of the peak intensity. Finally, we present some examples of astronomical observations using Z 45. Comment: 32 pages, 12 figures, accepted by PAS...|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{development}} of power semiconductors and allied technologies, one way to convert the voltage of a DC supply to a higher voltage, for low-power applications, was to convert it to AC by using a vibrator, followed by a step-up transformer and rectifier. For higher power an electric motor was used to drive a generator of the desired voltage (sometimes combined into a single [...] "dynamotor" [...] unit, a motor and generator combined into one unit, with one winding driving the motor and the other generating the output voltage). These were relatively inefficient and expensive procedures used only {{when there was no}} alternative, as to power a car radio (which then used thermionic valves/tubes requiring much higher voltages than available from a 6 or 12 V car battery). The introduction of power semiconductors and integrated circuits made it economically viable to use techniques as described below, for example to convert the DC power supply to high-frequency AC, use a transformer—small, light, and cheap due to the high frequency—to change the voltage, and rectify back to DC. Although by 1976 <b>transistor</b> car radio <b>receivers</b> did not require high voltages, some amateur radio operators continued to use vibrator supplies and dynamotors for mobile transceivers requiring high voltages, although transistorised power supplies were available.|$|R
40|$|Low-swing on-chip {{interconnect}} circuits {{have been}} viewed as alternative {{solutions to the problem}} of delay and power increase of on-chip interconnects. This thesis aims to characterize and optimize several basic low-swing interconnect circuits, by developing simple delay and power estimation methodologies. Accuracies of the proposed methods are validated against SPICE-based simulations on the 90 nm technology node. Based on the delay and power estimation methods developed, optimum power-delay trade-off curves are obtained and directly used for comparison among different interconnect circuit strategies. Three low-swing techniques are included, i. e. conventional level converter (CLC), pseudodifferential interconnect circuit (PDIFF), and current-mode signaling (CM). These techniques represent significantly different driver and receiver topologies, where CLC uses lower supply voltage of a normal inverter driver, PDIFF uses NMOS only drivers, while CM has a low impedance termination at the receiving end. In addition, an optimized full-swing repeater-based technique is included as a baseline for comparison. A simplified repeater performance estimation technique considering ramp input signals is also proposed. The most important step in estimating delay of different driver circuits is the accurate estimation of transistor effective resistance, which considers velocity saturation effects and voltage transition patterns. Optimization for the CM circuit for on-chip interconnects requires completely different treatment than the voltage-mode circuits, due to the different and more complex effective driver resistance and termination resistance modeling. Sizing the driver and <b>receiver</b> <b>transistors</b> should be done simultaneously as their resistive values which affect its performance are dependent on each other. Optimum transistor sizing is very dependent on the required voltage swing chosen. Results of our comparisons show that optimized CLC (reduced voltage supply) repeaters appears to give the best general performance with a slight delay overhead compared to full-swing repeaters. The fact that CLC with repeaters has shorter delay than single-segment CM and PDIFF highlights the effectiveness of repeater structures in long wires. The inclusion of inductance and closed-form solutions to derive optimum transistor sizings for various low-swing interconnect circuits may be developed as a future work using delay and power estimation models presented in this thesis, which is a challenging task to do considering the non-linear equations involved...|$|R
