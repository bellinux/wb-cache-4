2500|$|The June 1916 {{incursion}} {{into the}} U.S. by Pancho Villa resulted in Wilson's class being mobilized {{as part of}} the Vermont National Guard and he was reinstated to serve. [...] The following year he was commissioned as an artillery officer. During military training in Massachusetts, the young officers were often invited to dinner by the locals, and Wilson had his first drink, a glass of beer, to little effect. A few weeks later at another dinner party, Wilson drank some Bronx cocktails, and felt at ease with the guests and liberated from his awkward shyness; [...] "I had found the elixir of life," [...] he wrote. [...] "Even that first evening I got thoroughly drunk, and within the next <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> I passed out completely. But as everyone drank hard, not too much was made of that." ...|$|E

Franken was referring to a news report alleging that Russia had compromising material on Trump and Trump surrogates were in contact with the Russian government. Sessions replied that he was [...] "not aware of any of those activities" [...] and said [...] "I have been called a surrogate at a <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in that campaign and I didn't have—did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it." [...] In his January 17 responses to written questions presented by Senator Patrick Leahy, Sessions stated that he had not been [...] "in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election".|$|E

Love at first sight has occurred a <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> in high life; but, as a rule, the extempore mania {{is to be found}} among unsophisticated creatures such as the dove, the blue-tailed dingbat, and the ten-dollar-a-week clerk.

60|$|Nowhere in Political Mechanics have I {{seen such}} a Problem as this of {{hoisting}} to their feet the heavy-bottomed Dutch. The cunningest leverage, every sort of Diplomatic block-and-tackle, Carteret and Stair themselves running over to help in critical seasons, is applied; to almost no purpose. Pull long, pull strong, pull all together,--see, the heavy Dutch do stir; some four inches of daylight fairly visible below them: bear a hand, oh, bear a hand!--Pooh, the Dutch flap down again, as low as ever. As low,--unless (by Diplomatic art) you have WEDGED them at the four inches higher; which, after the first <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> is generally done. At the long last, partially in 1743 (upon which his Britannic Majesty drew sword), completely in 1747, the Dutch were got to their feet;--unfortunately good for nothing when they were! Without them his Britannic Majesty durst not venture. Hidden in those dust-bins, there is nothing so absurd, or which would be so wearisome, did it not at last become slightly ludicrous, as this of hoisting the Dutch.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{his poetry}} {{they did not}} think much, and {{whatever}} was good in it they ascribed to his wife, his sister, and Hartley Coleridge. He wrote poetry, they said, ‘because he couldn’t help it—because it was his hobby’—for sheer love, and not for money. They could not understand his doing work ‘for nowt,’ and held his occupation in somewhat light esteem {{because it did not}} bring in ‘a deal o’ brass to the pocket.’ ‘Did you ever read his poetry, or see any books about in the farmhouses?’ asked Mr. Rawnsley. The answer was curious: ‘Ay, ay, <b>time</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> But ya’re weel aware there’s potry and potry. There’s potry wi’ a li’le bit pleasant in it, and potry sic as a man can laugh at or the childer understand, and some as takes a deal of mastery to make out what’s said, and a deal of Wudsworth’s was this sort, ye kna. You could tell fra the man’s faace his potry would niver have no laugh in it. His potry was quite different work from li’le Hartley. Hartley ’ud goa running along beside o’ the brooks and mak his, and goa in the first oppen door and write what he had got upo’ paper. But Wudsworth’s potry was real hard stuff, and bided a deal of makking, and he’d keep it in his head for long enough. Eh, but it’s queer, mon, different ways folks hes of making potry now. [...] . Not but what Mr. Wudsworth didn’t stand very high, and was a well-spoken man enough.’ The best criticism on Wordsworth that Mr. Rawnsley heard was this: ‘He was an open-air man, and a great critic of trees.’ ...|$|E
