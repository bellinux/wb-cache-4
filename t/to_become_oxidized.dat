M. abscessus infections are difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance. Thus, new treatment options are urgently needed.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the ability of}} green tea catechins to induce electrophile-responsive element (EpRE) -mediated gene {{expression}} {{and the role of}} their quinones in the mechanism of this induction were investigated. To this end, Hepa 1 c 1 c 7 mouse hepatoma cells were used, stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the expression regulation of an EpRE from the human NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO 1) gene. The results obtained show that several, but not all, catechins tested are able to induce EpRE-mediated gene transcription, with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and gallocatechin gallate (GCG), both containing a pyrogallol and a galloyl moiety, being the most powerful inducers. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the EpRE-mediated response to catechins was increased in cells with reduced cellular glutathione (GSH) levels and decreased in cells with increased levels of GSH, corroborating a role for catechin quinones. The intrinsic capacity of catechins to form quinone type metabolites upon their oxidation was demonstrated using incubations of epigallocatechin (EGC) and EGCG with tyrosinase and the GSH-trapping method. Glutathione conjugates formed in these incubations were identified as 2 ¿-glutathionyl-EGC, 2 ¿, 6 ¿-diglutathionyl-EGC, 2 ¿-glutathionyl-EGCG, and 2 ¿, 6 ¿-diglutathionyl-EGCG, supporting the formation of quinone type metabolites involving especially the pyrogallol moiety of these catechins. Formation of the EGCG-quinone-glutathionyl adducts was also observed in the EpRE-LUX cellular system. This further supports the importance of the pyrogallol moiety for the quinone chemistry of the catechins. Finally, the presence of the pyrogallol moiety in the catechins also results in a relatively lower half-wave oxidation potential (E 1 / 2) and calculated heat of formation (DHF) for conversion of the catechins to their corresponding quinones, pointing at an increased ability <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>oxidized.</b> Altogether, our studies reveal that catechins, especially those containing a pyrogallol moiety, induce EpRE-mediated detoxifying gene expression and that this induction {{is likely to be the}} result of their quinone chemistry...|$|E
40|$|The {{vision of}} this thesis {{is to improve}} the {{machinability}} of workpiece steels. Workpiece material frequently transfers to the cutting tools during machining, and the transfer layers then forming on the tools may give both good and bad effects on machining performance and tool life. The objective of this work is to understand the effects of alloying element additions to workpiece steels on material transfer and the roles of the formed transfer layers on friction characteristics and wear of tools. To isolate and study the influence of the individual alloying elements, model steels are specifically designed. These steels include one reference with C as the only alloying element and others alloyed also with single additions or combined additions of 1 mass% Si, Mn, Cr and Al. The experiments are performed using both a sliding test, simulating the material transfer in milling, and a turning test. In a sliding contact, the mode of transfer is strongly dependent on the normal load and sliding speed. Material transfer initiates extremely fast, in less than 0. 025 s, and characteristic transfer layers develop during the first few seconds. The different steel compositions result in the formation of different types of oxides in the transfer layers. At the workpiece/tool interface where the conditions involve high temperature, high pressure and low oxygen supply, easily oxidized alloying elements in the steel are preferentially transferred, enriched and form a stable oxide on the tool surface. The degree of enrichment of the alloying elements in the oxides is strongly related to their tendencies <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>oxidized.</b> The difference in melting temperature of the oxides, and thus the tendency to soften during sliding, explains the difference in the resulting friction coefficient. The widest differences in friction coefficients are found between the Si and Al additions. A Si containing oxide shows the lowest friction and an Al containing oxide the highest. The damage mechanism of coated tools is chiefly influenced by the form and shear strength of the transferred material. Absence of transfer layer or non-continuous transferred material leads to continuous wear of the coating. Contrastingly, continuous transfer layers protect it from wear. However, transfer layers with very high shear strength result in high friction heat and a large amount of steel transfer. This leads to rapid coating cracking or adhesive wear...|$|E
40|$|A {{target for}} protein {{oxidation}} by {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) is tyrosine, which may form the age- and/or disease-related biomarkers dityrosine, chlorotyrosine and nitrotyrosine. It was already recognized that immunochemical assays should facilitate studies {{on the role of}} oxidative stress in aging and chronic disease and simplify the evaluation of therapeutic approaches. This thesis describes a contribution to the field of measuring protein oxidation by introducing and utilising a novel oxidation sensitive probe. Upon oxidation the fluorescein-labelled tyramine (hence called TyrFluo) may couple to oxidized proteins carrying a tyrosyl radical by forming a dityrosine bond. Exposure of the cells to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in the presence of either TyrFluo or (the acetylated cellmembrane permeable) acTyrFluo gave a cellular labelling characteristic for each probe (immunodetection was performed with an HRP-conjugated polyclonal antibody against the fluorescein moiety) independent of the abundance of a particular protein. In order to identify those intracellular proteins that are most susceptible to oxidation by H 2 O 2 we have used acTyrFluo to label proteins in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). 2 D-PAGE and subsequent Western-blotting were performed on a mixed sample of acTyrFluo-labelled and 35 S-methionine-labelled proteins of NHDF. The identification of TyrFluo-labelled proteins was achieved by matching the obtained immunoblot and the autoradiogram to our reference database of the human MRC- 5 fibroblasts. This revealed that the labelled proteins were associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; i. e. BiP/GRP 78, calnexin, GRP 94, PDI, and GRP 58 /Erp 57). In agreement, fluorescence microscopy showed a co-localization of the acTyrFluo-labelled proteins with the KDEL-receptor ERD 2 on the ER membrane. Since H 2 O 2 is a weak oxidant we infer that it must be converted first into a hydroxyl radical (OH.) in the ER (possibly. by a Fenton reaction using transition metal ions available in the ER) for proteins and acTyrFluo <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>oxidized.</b> In addition, by altering the anti-oxidative capacities of the cells (e. g. GSH content) the extent of protein labelling could be modulated. To investigate whether ER-related protein folding/maturation is impaired after subjecting cells to oxidative stress the maturation of a [35 S]-methionine labelled model protein, the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr), was followed in pulse-chase experiments under oxidative conditions. Under the same conditions the ratio of GSH versus GSSG was measured and related to the degree of maturation of the LDLr. The velocity of LDLr-maturation was reduced or even abolished in an H 2 O 2 -dependent manner. This impairment may result from oxidized folding proteins, sulfhydryls of LDLr, glycosylating enzymes in the ER and/or Golgi, or of eradicated vesicular transport towards the Golgi complex. However, when cells were allowed to recover after the oxidation maturation could be restored. This restoration depended protein synthesis, since blocking of translation by cycloheximide prevented restoration of maturation. In addition, the low GSH/GSSG balance could not be restored during this recovery period. This impaired maturation cannot be put on the account of the ER solely. The transport towards the Golgi complex may also be reduced dramatically, after the H 2 O 2 treatment. The 'free radical theory of aging' describes the age-related accumulation of radical-induced damage to biomolecules and has been extended to the oxidative "garbage catastrophe theory". According to this theory, aging may derive from imperfect clearance of oxidatively damaged, relatively indigestible material, the accumulation of which further hinders cellular catabolic and anabolic functions and mainly affects postmitotic non-proliferating cells. Damage to the ER, and its subsequent impaired functionality may be involved in the process of aging. There are several phenomena that suggest its involvement. The contribution to the age-related accumulation of damaged protein {{as a consequence of the}} oxidation of ER resident proteins is discussed...|$|E

Herein we present crystallographic and kinetic evidence for the human form of UGDH that clarifies participation of covalent catalysis in the enzymatic mechanism. Substitution of the putative catalytic base for water attack on the thioester (Glu(161)) by an incompetent analog (Gln(161)) gave a UGDH variant (E 161 Q) in which the hydrolysis step had become completely rate-limiting so that a thioester enzyme intermediate accumulated at steady state. By crystallizing E 161 Q in the presence of 5 mm UDP-glucose and 2 mm NAD(+), we succeeded in trapping a thiohemiacetal enzyme intermediate and determined its structure at 2. 3 Å resolution.
