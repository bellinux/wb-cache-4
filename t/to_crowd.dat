5|$|In his {{usage of}} grisaille, van der Weyden distinguishes between the earthly realm {{of flesh and}} blood, and the divine, {{represented}} by ancient sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time. Art historian Shirley Blum believes these figures were relegated to the architectural elements so as not <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> the central devotional image.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the two clubs play {{each other}} in the league on Boxing Day every year, with the match usually {{attracting}} the biggest league attendance of the season. However, in 2009 the match was removed from the fixture list by the Irish Football Association due <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> trouble at Windsor Park. The match returned in 2011, and usually alternates venues between the Oval and Windsor Park each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{date of the}} Gonzaga {{wedding was}} {{repeatedly}} postponed, because of diplomatic problems which delayed the bride's arrival in Mantua until 24 May. The wedding festivities began four days later; L'Arianna was performed on 28 May 1608, {{the first of the}} several spectacular entertainments. A large temporary theatre had been built for the occasion; according to the court's chronicler Federico Follino this held 6,000 people—a figure which Carter deems unlikely. Whatever its size, the arena could not hold everyone who wished to be present. Follino's account records that although the duke had strictly limited the numbers from his household entitled to be there, many distinguished foreign visitors could not be seated and were obliged <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> around the doors.|$|E

5|$|The events {{started on}} 30 August 1942 after the Japanese recaptured four POWs {{escaped from the}} Selarang Barracks camps, and {{required}} that the other prisoners sign a pledge not to escape. After they refused, they were forced <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> in the areas around the barracks square for nearly five days with little water and no sanitation. The executions of the recaptured POWs failed to break the men. The commanders, however, finally capitulated on 5 September when their men started to fall ill and die from dysentery. Upon signing the pledge, the men were {{allowed to return to}} the barracks buildings.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{continued}} to involve himself in cricket administration after his retirement as a player. He was a Victorian selector from 1957 to 1980–81 and the Prahran {{delegate to the}} Victorian Cricket Association (VCA) from 1955–56 to 1979–80. Loxton was Prahran's vice president and was involved in coaching and selecting teams, and his service to the club was honoured with life membership. He served as a MCG trustee from 1962 to 1982. The Victorian was appointed as the manager for Australia's tour of India in 1969–70 but had to withdraw due to a clash of commitments. In his absence, the campaign hit rocky waters. Although Australia won 3–1, the players became disgruntled with the arrangements made by the administrators, while rancorous incidents leading <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> riots were frequent.|$|E

The Corpas family, encouraged by the low prices in genome sequencing, was the first example of citizen science crowd sourced analysis of personal genomes.|$|E
25|$|In an {{era when}} {{lacrosse}} was notably rough and tumble and players wore no padding, all the while swinging wooden sticks, Lalonde was one never to back down from the toughness aspect of the game. His favourite tactic was <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> his check and bull his way through opposition. Along with all his goals, the intensely competitive Lalonde also amassed 45 penalties and 356 penalty minutes during his career on the West Coast.|$|E
25|$|After {{defeating}} Cambridge United 4–0 at {{home and}} Blyth Spartans 1–3 away, Torquay were drawn against Leeds United, away, {{in the third round}} of the Cup. Torquay were not expected to go to Elland Road and get any kind of favourable result, yet they managed to hold the Yorkshire club to a 2–2 draw; the scene was thus set for over 11,000 fans <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> into Plainmoor on the afternoon of Wednesday, 12 January.|$|E

25|$|Entering the Victorian Premier League in 2005 as South Melbourne Football Club, {{and with}} a new team under former player and new coach John Anastasiadis, the club reached the Preliminary Final of the VPL, going down to their old rivals Heidelberg United. The season was {{highlighted}} by fluctuating crowd attendances at home games, national media attention paid <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> trouble with fans of Preston Lions, but also by good performances by a young and talented side, which before the season had been a relegation favourite.|$|E
25|$|Just {{after the}} war, Genoa {{remained}} a strong contender in the Northern section. Garbutt led Genoa to championship success in 1922–23 where they beat Lazio 6–1 in the final, {{over the course}} of two legs. The following season, Genoa made their way past Bologna in the Northern finals, but not without controversy; after riots in the second leg during the game in Bologna, the game was called off due <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> rioting and FIGC awarded Genoa with a 2–0 victory. In the national final that season, Genoa beat Savoia 4–1 {{over the course of}} two legs; this would be their ninth and to date final Italian championship.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{pressure}} of Test cricket, Burke was an entertaining and attacking batsman, characterized by a clean line, quick movement back or forward and good balance, notably in playing the on-drive. Standing a little under six feet, Burke played with a low grip on his bat with little backlift. He played square-on while on the back foot, with chest facing the bowler, preferring to have his body behind swinging balls rather than the textbook side-on stance. Lantern jawed and poker faced, Burke showed little overt reaction <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> sentiment over his batting approach, tugging his cap lower before every delivery. He {{was known for his}} sense of humour, often enlivening the team with his piano playing and jokes.|$|E

25|$|The fight {{took place}} under new rules {{regarding}} knockdowns: the fallen fighter would have 10 seconds {{to rise to}} his feet under his own power, after his opponent moved to a neutral corner (i.e., one with no trainers). The new rule, which was not yet universal, was asked {{to be put into}} use during the fight by the Dempsey camp, who had requested it during negotiations. Dempsey, {{in the final days of}} training prior to the rematch, apparently ignored the setting of these new rules. Also, the fight was staged inside a 20-foot ring, which favored the boxer with superior footwork, in this case Tunney. Dempsey liked <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> his opponents, and normally fought in a 16-foot ring that offered less space to manoeuver.|$|E
25|$|By 1 August {{the route}} {{had been pushed}} as far as Camp VIII, {{at the base of}} the Shoulder at around 7800m, and the next day the whole team {{assembled}} there to prepare for the final push for the summit. However, the weather had been gradually deteriorating for several days, and soon a severe storm broke. At first it did not dispirit the team, and a secret ballot was held to decide which climbers should make the first summit attempt. However, as the storm continued for day after day their position became more serious. One of the tents collapsed on the fourth night, forcing Houston and Bell <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> into other, already cramped tents. On August the 6th, with weather forecasts offering little hope of improvement, the party for the first time discussed retreating.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of Madame Bovary in 1856 {{was followed by}} more scandal than admiration; it was not understood at first that this novel {{was the beginning of}} something new: the scrupulously truthful portraiture of life. Gradually, this aspect of his genius was accepted, and it began <b>to</b> <b>crowd</b> out all others. At the time of his death, he was widely regarded as the most influential French Realist. Under this aspect Flaubert exercised an extraordinary influence over Guy de Maupassant, Edmond de Goncourt, Alphonse Daudet, and Zola. Even after the decline of the Realist school, Flaubert did not lose prestige in the literary community; he continues to appeal to other writers because of his deep commitment to aesthetic principles, his devotion to style, and his indefatigable pursuit of the perfect expression.|$|E
