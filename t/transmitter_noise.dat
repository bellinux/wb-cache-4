The duplexer in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) is essential for blocking the transmitted noise and transmitted signal leakage into the receiver. Active duplexer eliminates the need for filters by using a cancellation process. A key problem with active duplexer is to keep the transmitted noise level below the Rx noise floor. We propose to embed a pilot signal into the transmitted noise. The known pilot signal can then be used to control the cancellation loop and so eliminate the <b>transmitter</b> <b>noise</b> and leakage.

40|$|Different geographies {{and localities}} {{around the world}} have adopted various {{wireless}} interface standards for mobile communications. As a result roaming users will require multiple handsets with multiple standards and multiple band capabilities. Triple-band hand sets are currently offered for high end users. In the future quad-band handsets including GSM 850 will become common in the market. This trend will continue. The addition of third generation functionality to second generation platforms will be even more difficult and complex. The radio handset should {{be able to use the}} same hardware for communications anywhere in the world. Therefore users will require small low cost terminals with multimode/ multi-band capability. The software radio concept has been developed to address these challenges. The replacement of fixed frequency components in the front end of the software radio is one of the key architectural changes required. The duplexer is one such component. Since duplexing filters are not normally tuneable, each band requires a separate duplexer in a multi-band system. The duplexers are passive devices (ceramic or SAW) and multiple duplexers lead to a dramatic increase in terminal cost and size. Abstract Adaptive Duplexer for Software Radio iv This thesis proposes a new adaptive duplexer architecture to reduce/eliminate the multiple duplexer problem in software radio. This technique is based on combining a low isolation device with an adaptive double loop cancelling scheme. The proposed double loop cancellation provides the required transmitter leakage and <b>transmitter</b> <b>noise</b> isolation over wideband using a delay element and an adjustable vector attenuator in each cancellation path. This thesis analyses the double loop cancellation technique. The cancellation path delay constraints are derived for coefficients with limited adjustment range in the cancellation paths. A linear relationship between the bandwidth and the achievable cancellation level is obtained. It is shown that the residual signal power is proportional to the square of the duplexing frequency. It is concluded that the delays in the cancellation paths should be chosen to straddle the expected range variation of the delay in the main path, predominantly caused by variations in antenna matching. The new algorithm uses a single cost function to achieve simultaneous cancellation in both the transmit band and the receive band. A direct conversion receiver architecture was chosen for the hardware prototype, since it is more suitable for multi-band systems. Alternate structures are also possible. A prototype of the adaptive duplexer using a 20 dB circulator and a single loop cancelling technique was designed and implemented. It achieved a total Tx leakage cancellation of 69 dB at 2 GHz with 45 MHz duplexing frequency. However it was not possible to simultaneously cancel the <b>transmitter</b> <b>noise</b> in the receiver band. The original prototype was extended to include the second loop. The achieved isolation between the transmit and the receive signals and the achieved reduction of the <b>transmitter</b> <b>noise</b> in the receiver band were 66. 8 dB and 58 dB respectively. These results were obtained over 5 MHz bandwidth and using a 190 MHz duplexing frequency. The performance is more than adequate for W-CDMA applications. Lowering the duplexing frequency improves the cancellation bandwidth and so the scheme performs better with other standards, such as IS- 95 (CDMA), using 45 MHz duplexing offset...|$|E
40|$|Detecting and localising <b>noise</b> <b>transmitters</b> in the UHF band {{implicate}} difficulties {{because a}} great amount of reflectionsand diffractions occur. As one can see inthe theory part, predicting a precise propagation path to an arbitrary signal is a next to impossible undertaking. Therefore it is chosen to focus on being able to predict a probable path of the signal, and then be able to present amost likely placement of the <b>noise</b> <b>transmitter.</b> This paper will suggest a possible solution to the problem described above. The solution uses the fact that reflectedsignals is the same signal with slightly different delays and amplitudes due to the difference in propagation path. Thisis measured by using two antennas, the main antenna is pointing in the direction where the signal is strongest while thesecondary antenna beam is used to scan in the horizontal plane to identify signals as reflections. When the system has identified the different directions as either reflections or the shortest path to the receiver, theresult is presented on a screen using an aerial photo or a detailed map. The system then identifies strong reflectorsthatthe signal bounce off from, from this the signal is traced back to a possible location, in combination with the shortestmeasured path. Areas most probable to hold the <b>noise</b> <b>transmitter</b> is then presented on the map. The way the system measures the delays is to correlate the two signals from the antennas. This implies that the noisesignal need to have relatively good autocorrelation properties. It will be discussed whether this is the case, but theone commercial <b>noise</b> <b>transmitter</b> available on the Internet that could be found that actually indicate how the noisesignal is created, claims to be using pseudo random noise. This type of signals have very good autocorrelationproperties, hence the suggested system will be ideal to track this. Due to the fact that prediction of the path of a signal in the UHF band presents many difficulties regardingreflections,the first part of the paper focuses on collecting information regarding propagation in the UHF frequency band. Most ofthe information is collected from literature concerning mobile communications, as this is a big topic when planningmobile networks as the GSM. A lot of the literature discuss the layout and placement of transmitters for the bestpossible coverage. When trying to detect <b>noise</b> <b>transmitters</b> this has to be turned upside down, because one is measuringa signal and trying to answer where its origin is. To prove the concept a simulation is presented that generates a number of reflections, then uses an antenna to measurethem, before it correlates the different directions to find the shortest path. The simulation is then run a number oftimes to generate probabilities of detecting the correct direction $pm 5 ^circ$ of the real shortest signal direction. Results from this test show that when receiving a signal where the power is divided between all the reflections in theway $E_ 0 /N$ where $N$ is the number of reflections and $E_ 0 $ is 20 dB above the noise floor, and using an antenna withHPBW of 11. 18 $^circ$ gives correct measurements in 95 % of the cases. In the 5 % of cases where the system fails todetect the shortest path the combination of the shortest delayed signal with the strongest signal direction do notproduce a sufficiently high enough correlation peak for the detector to regard as a correlation point. In addition to these results there are done many measurements regarding the effect of antenna main lobe width, antennaside lobes, number of reflections, Gaussian and uniform background noise, and signal strength...|$|R
