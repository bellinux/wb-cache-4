2500|$|The {{acoustical}} {{science of}} noise barrier design {{is based upon}} treating an airway or railway as a line source. The theory is based upon blockage of sound ray travel toward a particular receptor; however, diffraction of sound must be addressed. Sound waves bend (downward) when they pass an edge, such as the apex of a noise barrier. Barriers that block line of sight of a highway or other source will therefore block more sound. Further complicating matters is the phenomenon of refraction, the bending of sound rays {{in the presence of}} an [...] atmosphere. Wind shear and thermocline produce such inhomogeneities. The sound sources modeled must include engine noise, <b>tire</b> <b>noise,</b> and aerodynamic noise, all of which vary by vehicle type and speed.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>tire</b> <b>noise</b> is {{generated}} through {{the conversion of}} kinetic energy to sound waves, more noise is produced as {{the speed of a}} vehicle increases.

50|$|Roadway {{noise is}} the {{collective}} sound energy emanating from motor vehicles. It consists chiefly of road surface, tire, engine/transmission, aerodynamic, and braking elements. <b>Tire</b> pavement <b>noise</b> {{has been found}} to be the biggest contributor of highway noise. In developed and developing countries, roadway noise contributes a proportionately large share of the total societal noise pollution. In the U.S., it contributes more to environmental noise exposure than any other noise source.|$|R
50|$|Tire tread block shapes, groove configurations, and sipes affect <b>tire</b> <b>noise</b> {{pattern and}} {{traction}} characteristics.

Summary: The influence of the road mechanical stiffness on <b>tire</b> road <b>noise</b> has been a research subject since the late 70 's. Research efforts have addressed principally the measurement procedures of the road mechanical stiffness {{and the development of}} poro-elastic surfaces, including implementation on pilote sites. This report is an attempt to quantify the influence of this mechanic stiffness on <b>tire</b> road <b>noise.</b> The estimation is performed by simulation using a rolling tire algorithm developed at INRETS. The stiffness of present pavements is much larger than the tire sicknesses. It appears that a reduction of this pavement stiffness could reduce substantially the rolling noise. For his, the pavement stiffness must be of the same order of magnitude than the pavement stiffness (pavement stiffness/tire stiffness < 10). The noise reduction would be practically independent of speed and could reach 5 dB(A). The reduction appears to occur mainly at medium and high frequencies...|$|R

50|$|Source {{control in}} roadway noise has {{provided}} little reduction in vehicle noise, {{except for the}} development of the hybrid vehicle; nevertheless, hybrid use will need to attain a market share of roughly fifty percent to have a major impact on noise source reduction of city streets. Highway noise is today less affected by motor type, since the effects in higher speed are aerodynamic and <b>tire</b> <b>noise</b> related. Other contributions to reduction of noise at the source are: improved tire tread designs for trucks in the 1970s, better shielding of diesel stacks in the 1980s, and local vehicle regulation of unmuffled vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Automotive {{soundproofing}} aims {{to decrease}} or eliminate {{the effects of}} exterior noise, primarily engine, exhaust and <b>tire</b> <b>noise</b> across a wide frequency range. When constructing a vehicle which includes soundproofing, a panel dampening material is fitted which reduces the vibration of the vehicles body panels when they are excited {{by one of the}} many high energy sound sources caused when the vehicle is in use. There are many complex noises created within vehicles which change with the driving environment and speed at which the vehicle travels. Significant noise reductions of up to 8 dB can be achieved by installing a combination of different types of materials.|$|E
50|$|The {{automotive}} environment {{limits the}} thickness of materials that can be used, but combinations of dampers, barriers, and absorbers are common. Common materials include felt, foam, polyester, and Polypropylene blend materials. Waterproofing may be necessary based on materials used. Acoustic foam can be applied in different areas of a vehicle during manufacture to reduce cabin noise. Foams also have cost and performance advantages in installation since foam material can expand and fill cavities after application and also prevent leaks and some gases from entering the vehicle. Vehicle soundproofing can reduce wind, engine, road, and <b>tire</b> <b>noise.</b> Vehicle soundproofing can reduce sound inside a vehicle from five to 20 decibels.|$|E

5000|$|Sound {{designer}} Peter Mohlin {{has attempted}} to use sound three-dimensionally, providing noises for when a car changes speeds, changes direction or turns on or off, with Herndon quoting that, “In a way, we’ve transformed the steering wheel {{into a kind of}} musical controller." [...] According to CD News, [...] "Instead of current two dimensional sound - when a car is near or far away, or when it accelerates or decelerates - they have attempted to make sounds three dimensional to indicate what the car is doing more naturally." [...] For example, as the car accelerates the noise rotates around the car at an increasing rate, eventually cutting as wind and <b>tire</b> <b>noise</b> reach a sufficient decibel level.|$|E
50|$|Advantages: As {{opposed to}} all other types of hot mix, PFC is {{designed}} to let water drain through the mixture into the underlying layer. PFC mixtures significantly reduce water spray, improve wet weather visibility and visibility of pavement markings, significantly reduce <b>tire</b> <b>noise,</b> and restore ride quality. PFC mixtures have stone on stone contact and relatively high amounts of asphalt binder. As a result, they offer good resistance to rutting and cracking. PFC mixtures are relatively easy to design and place. PFC mixtures require only a minimal amount of compaction with a static roller. This helps facilitate a smooth riding surface. PFC mixtures provide for a roadway that has a uniform yet coarse surface texture. The coarse texture and permeable mix characteristics improve wet weather traction.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the use of}} {{acoustic}} absorbent materials specifically felt {{to mitigate}} <b>tire</b> cavity resonance <b>noise</b> is presented. The inclusion of a trim in the tire cavity {{is represented by the}} addition of the acoustic damping loss factor into the sound pressure response function. In addition, the possible solution of using multilayer trim materials to mitigate the cavity mode effect is presented using the sound absorption coefficient values from the impedance tube experiments and by adopting other empirical models. Moreover, the sound absorption coefficient calculated from the method of electrical-analogy is compared with that from the experimental data and found to be reasonable. Experimental modal analysis was performed to show the effect of inserting an absorbent material (polyfelt) onto the inside surface of the tire where reduction in both the inside cavity sound pressure level and the wheel hub acceleration was observed. A Taguchi analysis is also done to rank the effectiveness of varying trim thickness and mass density as well as adding air gap to suppress <b>tire</b> cavity resonance <b>noise...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of sound levels, engine {{operation}} is of greatest impact with respect to mobile sources such as automobiles and trucks. Engine noise is a particularly large component of mobile source noise for vehicles operating at lower speeds, where aerodynamic and <b>tire</b> <b>noise</b> is less significant. Generally speaking, petrol and diesel engines emit less noise than turboshafts of equivalent power output; electric motors very often emit less noise than their fossil fuel-powered equivalents. Thrust-outputting engines, such as turbofans, turbojets and rockets emit {{the greatest amount of}} noise because their method of producing thrust {{is directly related to the}} production of sound.Various methods have been devised to reduce noise. Petrol and diesel engines are fitted with mufflers (silencers); newer turbofans often have outsized fans (the so-called high-bypass technology) in order to reduce the proportion of noisy, hot exhaust from the integrated turboshaft in the exhaust stream, and hushkits exist for older, low-bypass turbofans. No known methods exist for reducing the noise output of rockets without a corresponding reduction in thrust.|$|E
