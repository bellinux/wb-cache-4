25|$|The Union {{started the}} war with five Regular mounted regiments: the 1st and 2nd U.S. Dragoons, the 1st Mounted Rifles, and the 1st and 2nd Cavalry. These were renumbered the 1st through 5th U.S. Cavalry regiments, respectively, and a 6th was recruited. The Union was {{initially}} reluctant to enlist additional regiments, because of the expense, the understanding that training an effective cavalryman could {{take as long as}} two years, and <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>that</b> the rough and forested terrain of the United States, being so different from that of Western Europe, would make the deployment of Napoleonic-style cavalry forces ineffective. As the war progressed, the value of cavalry was eventually realized (primarily for non-offensive missions), and numerous state volunteer cavalry regiments were added to the army. While initially reluctant to form a large cavalry force, the Union eventually fielded some 258 mounted regiments and 170 unattached companies, of differing enlistment periods, throughout the war and suffered 10,596 killed and 26,490 wounded during the struggle.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>that</b> Thomas's votes follow Antonin Scalia's is {{reflected}} by Linda Greenhouse's observation that Thomas voted with Scalia 91 {{percent of the}} time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time. Jan Crawford asserts that to some extent, this is true in the other direction as well, that Scalia often joins Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia. Statistics compiled annually by Tom Goldstein of SCOTUSblog demonstrate that Greenhouse's count is methodology-specific, counting non-unanimous cases where Scalia and Thomas voted for the same litigant, regardless of whether they got there by the same reasoning. Goldstein's statistics show that the two agreed in full only 74% of the time, and that the frequency of agreement between Scalia and Thomas is not as outstanding as is often implied by pieces aimed at lay audiences. For example, in that same term, Souter and Ginsburg voted together 81% of the time by the method of counting that yields a 74% agreement between Thomas and Scalia. By the metric that produces the 91% Scalia/Thomas figure, Ginsburg and Breyer agreed 90% of the time. Roberts and Alito agreed 94% of the time.|$|E

2500|$|Louis-Dreyfus, Alexander, and Richards {{have all}} tried to launch new sitcoms as title-role characters. Almost every show was {{canceled}} quickly, usually {{within the first}} season. This {{gave rise to the}} term Seinfeld curse: the failure of a sitcom starring one of the three, despite <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>that</b> each person's Seinfeld popularity should almost guarantee a strong, built-in audience for the actor's new show. Shows specifically cited regarding the Seinfeld curse are Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Watching Ellie, Jason Alexander's Bob Patterson and Listen Up!, and Michael Richards' The Michael Richards Show. Larry David said of the curse, [...] "It's so completely idiotic. It's very hard to have a successful sitcom." ...|$|E

In it, Pape questions <b>the</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> <b>that</b> coercive air power is both effective and relatively cheap.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> is <b>that</b> crises {{are largely}} due to swings in {{short-term}} capital.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>wisdom</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> import restraints {{help the}} protected domestic industry {{at the expense}} of consumers. In the longer term, however, trade restraint may encourage foreign firms to adopt new and more threatening business strategies, such as upgrading the quality of their products or moving plants to the United States. If these long-term dynamic effects of restraint are considered, trade restraints may prove harmful to the domestic industry as well as consumers. ...|$|R
