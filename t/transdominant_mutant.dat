40|$|Mutation {{of either}} of two {{critical}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev, results in marked defects in viral replication. Thus, inhibition of the function of {{one or both of}} these proteins can significantly inhibit viral growth. In the present study, we constructed a novel transdominant Tat mutant protein and compared its efficiency in inhibiting HIV- 1 replication with that of <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> Rev M 10 when these proteins were stably expressed either alone or in combination in T-lymphocyte cell lines. The transdominant Tat mutant protein alone resulted in a modest inhibition of HIV replication, but it was able to enhance the ability of the M 10 Rev mutant protein to inhibit HIV- 1 replication. These results suggest a possible synergistic effect of these <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> proteins in inhibiting HIV- 1 replication...|$|E
40|$|Overview summary Expression of Rev M 10, a <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> {{form of the}} Rev gene, in T {{cell lines}} confers {{resistance}} to HIV in vitro. Isertion of this Rev M 10 gene into PBL appears to be nontoxic and well-tolerated by SCID mice. These results demonstrate that genetic modification of T cells by an antiviral gene can be performed safely and without overt toxicity. This finding encourages the development of therapeutic strategies to genetically protect T cells to prolong their survival in HIV-infected individuals...|$|E
40|$|Terminal {{differentiation}} of muscle cells follows a precisely orchestrated program of transcriptional regulatory {{events at the}} promoters of both muscle-specific and ubiquitous genes. Two distinct families of transcriptional co-activators, GCN 5 /PCAF and CREB-binding protein (CBP) /p 300, are crucial to this process. While both possess histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) activity, previous studies have failed to identify a requirement for CBP/p 300 HAT function in myogenic differentiation. We have addressed this issue directly using a chemical inhibitor of CBP/p 300 {{in addition to a}} negative <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant.</b> Our results clearly demonstrate that CBP/p 300 HAT activity is critical for myogenic terminal differentiation. Furthermore, this requirement is restricted to a subset of events in the differentiation program: cell fusion and specific gene expression. These data help to define the requirements for enzymatic function of distinct coactivators at different stages of the muscle cell differentiation program...|$|E
40|$|Applications of <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutants</b> {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) regulatory proteins, especially Rev mutant, have been attempted for gene therapy against AIDS, because the Rev protein is essential for viral replication. We have previously reported that a mutant Rev protein (dRev) lacking its nucleolar targeting signal remained out of nuclei in expressed cells and strongly inhibited the function of Rev. To investigate the effects of dRev on HIV- 1 replication, we established several dRev-expressing human cell lines with two different vector systems and examined virus production in these cells. An HIV- 1 -derived vector containing drev cDNA was constructed and introduced into CD 4 -positive HeLa cells and cells of the human T-cell line CCRF-CEM (CEM). In dRev-expressing HeLa cells, virus replication, syncytium formation, and cell death caused by HIV- 1 infection were remarkably suppressed, and the same vector also conferred a resistant phenotype on CEM cells. The production was also suppressed in CEM cells containing the drev gene driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. In addition, we found that dRev did not cause nucleolar dysfunction in a transient assay, in contrast to other <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutants</b> and wild-type Rev. Since dRev cannot migrate into the nuclei, it is expected not to interfere with nuclear/nucleolar functions of the host cell. We conclude that dRev is one promising candidate as an antiviral molecule for gene therapy against AIDS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe c-Myc and E 2 F {{transcription}} {{factors are}} among the most potent regulators of cell cycle progression in higher eukaryotes. This report describes the isolation of a novel, highly conserved 434 kDa protein, designated TRRAP, which interacts specifically with the c-Myc N terminus and has homology to the ATM/PI 3 -kinase family. TRRAP also interacts specifically with the E 2 F- 1 transactivation domain. Expression of <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutants</b> of the TRRAP protein or antisense RNA blocks c-Myc- and E 1 A-mediated oncogenic transformation. These data suggest that TRRAP is an essential cofactor for both the c-Myc and E 1 A/E 2 F oncogenic transcription factor pathways...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionarily}} conserved protein domain, {{called the}} Krüppel-associated box (KRAB), {{present in the}} amino termini {{of a large number}} of Krüppel-type zinc finger proteins is a strong repressor domain. In order to develop novel strategies to control human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) gene expression, we constructed a series of expression vectors expressing the wild-type Tat or Tat <b>transdominant</b> negative <b>mutants</b> fused to the KRAB repressor domain. We found that the KRAB domain tethered to the transactivating response element is able to suppress both basal and Tat-mediated activity of HIV- 1 long terminal repeat-driven gene expression. These results suggest that the KRAB repressor domain fused to the Tat <b>transdominant</b> negative <b>mutants</b> can be successfully employed to control HIV- 1 gene expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{induction}} of interferon (IFN) genes by viruses or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) {{requires the}} assembly of {{a complex set of}} transcription factors on responsive DNA elements of IFN gene promoters. One of the factors necessary for regulating IFN-beta gene transcription is nuclear factor NF-kappa B, the activation of which is triggered by dsRNA. It has previously been suggested that the dsRNA-activated p 68 protein kinase (PKR) may act as an inducer-receptor, transducing the signal from dsRNA to NF-kappa B through phosphorylation of the inhibitor I kappa B. We present direct evidence that PKR can phosphorylate I kappa B-alpha (MAD- 3) and activate NF-kappa B DNA binding activity in vitro. We further show that dsRNA induces an unusual phosphorylated form of I kappa B-alpha. The expression of a <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> PKR is able to perturb the dsRNA-mediated signaling pathway in vivo, suggesting a role for this kinase in IFN-beta gene induction...|$|E

Although {{the introduction of}} specific antiviral genes into T leukemia cells can provide relative resistance to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, the testing of such genes against primary viral isolates in human CD 4 + lymphocytes has been limited, and safety questions remain regarding gene delivery into cells from HIV-infected patients. In this report, we evaluate the efficacy of a <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> protein, Rev M 10, against cloned and primary HIV isolates in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and describe different methods of gene transfer into peripheral blood lymphocytes from HIV-infected individuals. We show that gold microparticles can mediate stable Rev M 10 gene transfer into these cells. Introduction of Rev M 10 by these techniques conferred resistance to HIV infection in vitro to cloned and clinical isolates. Nonviral delivery of HIV protective genes will facilitate the development of gene therapy for AIDS and the analysis of viral and cellular gene expression in human T lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Gene therapy may be {{of benefit}} in human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) -infected individuals {{by virtue of its}} ability to inhibit virus replication and prevent viral gene expression. It is not known whether anti-HIV- 1 gene therapy strategies based on antisense or transdominant HIV- 1 mutant proteins can inhibit the replication and expression of clinical HIV- 1 isolates in primary CD 4 + T lymphocytes. We therefore transduced CD 4 + T lymphocytes from uninfected individuals with retroviral vectors expressing either HIV- 1 -specific antisense-TAR or antisense-Tat/Rev RNA, transdominant HIV- 1 Rev protein, and a combination of antisense-TAR and transdominant Rev. The engineered CD 4 + T lymphocytes were then infected with four different clinical HIV- 1 isolates. We found that replication of all HIV- 1 isolates was inhibited by all the anti-HIV vectors tested. Greater inhibition of HIV- 1 was observed with transdominant Rev than with antisense RNA. We hereby demonstrated effective protection by antisense RNA or <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> proteins against HIV- 1 infection in primary CD 4 + T lymphocytes using clinical HIV- 1 isolates, and this represents an essential step toward clinical anti-HIV- 1 gene therapy. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Intramuscular {{immunization}} of mice with plasmids encoding two <b>transdominant</b> negative <b>mutants</b> of the HIV- 1 Tat protein (Tat 22 and Tat 22 / 37) elicited a humoral {{response to}} wild-type Tat that {{is comparable to}} that induced by inoculation of wild-type tat DNA or Tat protein. The percentage of the responders and the Ab titers continued to increase after three additional DNA boosts and pretreatment with bupivacaine {{at the site of}} inoculation, without a significant difference (p > 0. 05) among the three groups of mice immunized with mutant and wild-type tat genes. By utilizing synthetic peptides representing the amino acid sequence of Tat, one major B cell epitope was defined within the cysteine-rich domain of Tat. Anti-Tat IgG Abs directed against this epitope were found in mice immunized with all tat DNA constructs, whereas different Tat epitopes were detected in mice immunized with the Tat protein. Similarly, IgG 2 a was the predominant isotype in DNA-immunized mice, with both mutants and wild-type tat genes, as compared with protein immunization, which induced mostly IgG 1 and IgG 3. Sera from most immunized mice neutralized the effect of extracellular Tat in activating HIV- 1 replication. A cellular response was also elicited as indicated by the proliferation of splenocytes when stimulated with wild-type Tat. These results indicate that the wild-type Tat Ag is recognized by Abs and T cells induced by DNA immunization with mutated tat genes, suggesting the possible use of these Tat <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutants,</b> lacking viral trans activation activity and capable of blocking wild-type Tat activity, in the development of an anti-HIV- 1 vaccine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, an episomal {{system for}} ecdysone-inducible gene {{expression}} was developed. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (293 VE) expressing a heterodimer of modified ecdysone and retinoid X receptors and the Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen- 1 were screened. Plasmids containing the EBV replication origin, oriP, and the ecdysone-response element could replicate and persist in 293 VE cells to inducibly express luciferase or Vpr. The induction level, tested with luciferase reporter plasmid, varied among cell lines from 254 - to 2056 -fold. In one highly inducible cell line, HIV- 1 Vpr was expressed well and caused G 2 cell cycle arrest {{in the presence}} of the inducer, while in the absence of the inducer, no Vpr protein or cell cycle arrest could be detected. Using different selection markers, HIV- 1 Vpr was coexpressed with Vpr mutants defective in phosphorylation at Ser 79 and G 2 cell cycle arrest activity. These Vpr <b>mutants</b> were <b>transdominant</b> to wild-type Vpr for G 2 cell cycle arrest activity, but did not alter wild-type Vpr phosphorylation. It is likely that the <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutants</b> and wild-type Vpr compete for a downstream target(s) of G 2 cell cycle arrest...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previously we {{described}} a <b>transdominant</b> negative <b>mutant</b> of the HIV- 1 Tat protein, termed Nullbasic, that downregulated the steady state levels of unspliced and singly spliced viral mRNA, an activity caused by inhibition of HIV- 1 Rev activity. Nullbasic also altered the subcellular localizations of Rev and other cellular proteins, including CRM 1, B 23 and C 23 in a Rev-dependent manner, suggesting that Nullbasic may disrupt Rev function and trafficking by intervening with an unidentified {{component of the}} Rev nucleocytoplasmic transport complex...|$|R
40|$|Integrase interactor 1 (INI 1) /hSNF 5 is a host {{factor that}} {{directly}} interacts with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) integrase and is incorporated into HIV- 1 virions. Here, we show that while INI 1 /hSNF 5 is completely absent from purified microvesicular fractions, it is specifically incorporated into HIV- 1 virions with an integrase-to-INI 1 /hSNF 5 stoichiometry of approximately 2 : 1 (molar ratio). In addition, we show that INI 1 /hSNF 5 is not incorporated into related primate lentiviral and murine retroviral particles despite the abundance of the protein in producer cells. We {{have found that the}} specificity in incorporation of INI 1 /hSNF 5 into HIV- 1 virions is directly correlated with its ability to exclusively interact with HIV- 1 integrase but not with other retroviral integrases. This specificity is also reflected in our finding that the <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> S 6, harboring the minimal integrase interaction domain of INI 1 /hSNF 5, blocks HIV- 1 particle production but not that of the other retroviruses in 293 T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that INI 1 /hNSF 5 is a host factor restricted for HIV- 1 and that S 6 acts as a highly specific and potent inhibitor of HIV- 1 replication...|$|E
40|$|The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates gene {{expression}} through protein degradation. Here {{we show that}} the F-box protein bTrCP, the receptor component of the SCF E 3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for IkBa and b-catenin degradation, is colocalized in the nucleus with ATF 4, {{a member of the}} ATF-CREB bZIP family of transcription factors, and controls its stability. Association between the two proteins depends on ATF 4 phosphorylation and on ATF 4 serine residue 219 present in the context of DSGXXXS, which is similar but not identical to the motif found in other substrates of bTrCP. ATF 4 ubiquitination in HeLa cells is enhanced in the presence of bTrCP. The F-box-deleted bTrCP protein behaves as a negative <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> that inhibits ATF 4 ubiquitination and degradation and, subsequently, enhances its activity in cyclic AMP-mediated transcription. ATF 4 represents a novel substrate for the SCFbTrCP complex, which is the first mammalian E 3 ubiquitin ligase identified so far for the control of the degradation of a bZIP transcription factor. Proteasome-mediated protein degradation requires the co-valent attachment of polyubiquitin to the substrate proteins (11, 25, 38). The cascade of ubiquitin transfer reactions in-volves the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E 1, an E 2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that operates with specificity factor E 3...|$|E
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) Rev protein is essential for viral structural protein expression (Gag, Pol, and Env) and, hence, for viral replication. In transient transfection assays, mutant forms of Rev have been identified that inhibit wild-type Rev activity and therefore suppress viral replication. To determine whether such transdominant Rev proteins could provide long-term protection against HIV infection without affecting T cell function, T leukemia cell lines were stably transduced with a retroviral vector encoding a <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> of the Rev protein, M 10. While all the M 10 - expressing cell lines remained infectable by HIV- 1, these same cells failed to support a productive replication cycle when infected with a cloned isolate of HIV- 1. In addition, {{two out of three}} M 10 -expressing CEM clones were also resistant to highly productive infection by a heterogeneous HIV- 1 pool. Expression of M 10 did not affect induction of HIV transcription mediated by the kappa B regulatory element or Tat. Importantly, constitutive expression of Rev M 10 did not alter the secretion of interleukin 2 in response to mitogen stimulation of EL- 4 and Jurkat cells. The inhibition of HIV infection in cells stably expressing a transdominant Rev protein, {{in the absence of any}} deleterious effect on T cell function, suggests that such a strategy could provide a therapeutic effect in the T lymphocytes of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients...|$|E

In this study, we demonstrated by both indirect immunofluorescence and Western immunoblot analysis that nuclear exit of Rev <b>transdominant</b> negative <b>mutants</b> was defective {{compared with that of}} wild-type Rev. The basic and activation domains of Rev signal import and export, respectively, of Rev across the nuclear membrane. In cotransfection experiments, mutants containing mutations of Rev inhibited the nuclear egress of wild-type Rev, thus revealing a novel transdominant negative phenotype...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the role of endogenous AP- 1 activity in cellular transformation induced by oncogenes, we have made use of a fos mutant (supfos- 1) and a jun mutant (supjun- 1), either of which can function as a transdominant inhibitor of AP- 1 -mediated transcriptional regulation. Chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) infected {{with a series of}} transforming retroviruses were doubly infected with retrovirus carrying supfos- 1 or supjun- 1, and suppression of cellular transformation was monitored in terms of reversion to normal cellular morphology or acquisition of anchorage-dependent growth. Cellular transformation induced by several exogenously expressed transforming genes of the fos or jun family was efficiently suppressed, as expected. CEF transformed by v-src, v-yes, v-fps, c-Ha-ras, and N-terminally truncated c-raf were also induced to revert to the normal phenotype by these <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutants,</b> suggesting that functional transcription factor AP- 1 activity is essential for the cellular transformation induced by these oncogenes. The suppression is not attributable to nonspecific inhibition of cellular proliferation, because CEF transformed by v-ros or v-myc were not induced to revert to the normal phenotype. We next analyzed changes in all known components of chicken AP- 1 induced by v-src, c-Ha-ras, or activated c-raf transformation. The levels of both Fra- 2 and c-Jun expression were elevated two- to fourfold, and hyperphosphorylation of Fra- 2 was also observed. We further showed that Fra- 2 -c-Jun heterodimer is mainly responsible for the elevated AP- 1 DNA-binding activity in these transformed cells, and we propose that this heterodimer {{play a crucial role in}} the transformation induced by these oncogenes...|$|R
40|$|The Rev protein {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is an essential regulatory protein which acts post-transcriptionally to mediate nuclear export of the incompletely spliced mRNAs encoding the viral structural proteins. Rev mediates its effect, in part, through interaction with a cis-acting RNA target sequence, the Rev responsive element (RRE), located within the env region of the viral structural mRNAs. There exist transdominant Rev mutants {{that are capable of}} binding to the RRE yet are unable to carry out wild-type Rev function, strongly suggesting that cellular cofactors are involved in the Rev response. Towards the isolation of such factors and the elucidation of the mechanism of Rev action, we have developed a highly efficient, one-step, non-denaturing purification protocol for a recombinant form of Rev (H 6 Rev) and a <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> of Rev (H 6 AC 4). These recombinant proteins contain six histidine residues at the N-terminus which enable their purification using nickel-affinity chromatography and which can also serve as a means to isolate Rev-host factor complexes reconstituted in vitro. Both purified proteins form stable complexes with the RRE in vitro while only H 6 Rev exhibits wild-type Rev function in vivo when exogenously introduced into mammalian cells, confirming that the purification strategy employed retains the biological activity of the proteins. To complement the in vitro reconstitution experiments, we have generated human lymphoid cell lines that express biologically active H 6 Rev in a tightly regulated, inducible fashion. These cell lines can serve as a source for the isolation of Rev-host factor complexes formed in the mammalian cell. Controlled expression of H 6 Rev is achieved using a tetracycline-modulated promoter. By varying the concentration of tetracycline in the medium, the activity of this promoter, and hence the level of H 6 Rev expression, can be modulated over a wide range of concentration...|$|E
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) long terminal repeat (LTR) contains two binding sites for the NF-kappa B/Rel family of transcription factors which are required for the transcriptional activation of viral genes by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 1. In the present study, we examined the effect of transdominant mutants of I kappa B alpha on the synergistic activation of the HIV- 1 LTR by TNF-alpha and the HIV- 1 transactivator, Tat, in Jurkat T cells. The synergistic induction of HIV- 1 LTR-driven gene expression represented a 50 - to 70 -fold stimulation and required both an intact HIV- 1 enhancer and Tat-TAR element interaction, since mutations in Tat protein (R 52 Q, R 53 Q) or in the bulge region of the TAR element that eliminated Tat binding to TAR were unable to stimulate LTR expression. Coexpression of I kappa B alpha inhibited Tat-TNF-alpha activation of HIV LTR in a dose-dependent manner. Transdominant forms of I kappa B alpha, mutated in critical serine or threonine residues required for inducer-mediated (S 32 A, S 36 A) and/or constitutive (S 283 A, T 291 A, T 299 A) phosphorylation of I kappa B alpha were tested for their capacity to block HIV- 1 LTR transactivation. I kappa B alpha molecules mutated in the N-terminal sites were not degraded following inducer-mediated stimulation (t 1 / 2, > 4 h) {{and were able to}} efficiently block HIV- 1 LTR transactivation. Strikingly, the I kappa B alpha (S 32 A, S 36 A) <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutant</b> was at least five times as effective as wild-type I kappa B alpha in inhibiting synergistic induction of the HIV- 1 LTR. This mutant also effectively inhibited HIV- 1 multiplication in a single-cycle infection model in Cos- 1 cells, as measured by Northern (RNA) blot analysis of viral mRNA species and viral protein production. These experiments suggest a strategy that may contribute to inhibition of HIV- 1 gene expression by interfering with the NF-kappa B/Rel signaling pathway...|$|E
40|$|E 2 F- 1 is a {{transcription}} factor suspected of activating genes required for S phase and a known {{target for the}} action of RB, the retinoblastoma gene product.

In contrast, coexpression of a naturally occurring loss-of-function RB mutant or wild-type p 53 did not suppress the induction of apoptosis under these conditions.

40|$|Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) is {{incorporated}} within the membrane of primate lentiviral virions. Here we demonstrate that Hsp 70 is also incorporated into oncoretroviral virions {{and that it}} remains associated with membrane-stripped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) virion cores. To determine if Hsp 70 promotes virion infectivity, we attempted to generate Hsp 70 -deficient virions with gag deletion mutations, Hsp 70 <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutants,</b> or RNA interference, but these efforts were confounded, largely because they disrupt virion assembly. Given that polypeptide substrates are bound and released by Hsp 70 in an ATP-hydrolytic reaction cycle, we supposed that incubation of HIV- 1 virions with ATP would perturb Hsp 70 interaction with substrates in the virion and thereby decrease infectivity. Treatment with ATP or ADP had no observable effect, but ATPγS and GTPγS, nucleotide triphosphate analogues resistant to Hsp 70 hydrolysis, dramatically reduced the infectivity of HIV- 1 and murine leukemia virus virions. ATPγS-treated virions were competent for fusion with susceptible target cells, but viral cDNA synthesis was inhibited to an extent that correlated with the magnitude of decrease in infectivity. Intravirion reverse transcription by HIV- 1, simian immunodeficiency virus, or murine leukemia virus was also inhibited by ATPγS. The effects of ATPγS on HIV- 1 reverse transcription appeared to be indirect, resulting from disruption of virion core morphology that was evident by transmission electron microscopy. Consistent with effects on capsid conformation, ATPγS-treated viruslike particles failed to saturate host antiviral restriction activity. Our observations support a model in which the catalytic activity of virion-associated Hsp 70 is required to maintain structural integrity of the virion core...|$|R
40|$|Regulation {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) gene expression is dependent on specific regulatory regions in the long terminal repeat. These regions include the enhancer, SP 1, "TATA," and trans-activating (TAR) regions. In addition, viral regulatory proteins such as tat and rev are important in regulating HIV gene expression. The mechanism of tat activation remains the subject of investigation, but effects at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels seem likely. Previous mutagenesis of the tat protein revealed that the amino terminus, the cysteine-rich domain, and the basic domain were all required for complete tat activation. Mutants of other viral trans-acting regulatory proteins, including E 1 A, tax, and VM 65, have been identified that were capable of antagonizing the activity of their corresponding wild-type proteins. We wished to determine whether mutants of the tat protein could be identified that exhibited a similar phenotype. One mutant (delta tat) that truncated the basic domain of tat resulted in a transdominant phenotype inhibiting tat-induced gene expression of the HIV long terminal repeat but not other viral promoters. This mutant exhibited its maximal phenotype in cotransfection experiments when present in an 8 - to 30 -fold molar excess over the wild-type tat gene. Trans-activation of the HIV long terminal repeat by delta tat was very defective at the DNA concentrations used in these experiments. RNase protection analysis indicated that this mutant decreased tat-induced steady-state mRNA levels of the HIV long terminal repeat. Second-site mutations of the delta tat gene in either the amino terminus or cysteine region eliminated the transdominant phenotype. In contrast to tat, which was localized predominantly to the nucleolus, delta tat was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting that it may inhibit tat function by preventing nucleolar localization. <b>Transdominant</b> <b>mutants</b> of tat may {{have a role in}} potentially inhibiting HIV gene expression...|$|R

This effect was observed both after in vitro infection of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from normal donors and after reactivation of the latent infection in PBMCs from seropositive patients. The antiviral effect of tat 22 was limited to conditions of low virus production.

40|$|AbstractIKKα is a {{component}} of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that {{plays a key role in}} the activation of NF-κB. In Ikkα mutant mice and mice expressing a <b>transdominant</b> negative <b>mutant</b> of IκBα (cIκBαΔN), molars have abnormal cusps, indicating that Ikkα is involved in cusp formation through the NF-κB pathway. However, Ikkα mutant incisors also have an earlier phenotype where epithelium evaginates outward into the developing oral cavity rather than invaginating into the underlying mesenchyme. A similar evagination of epithelium was also observed in whisker development, suggesting that Ikkα contributes to the direction of epithelial growth during the early stages of development in many ectodermal appendages. Since cIκBαΔN mice have normal incisor epithelial invagination, Ikkα's role appears to be NF-κB independent. Changes in Notch 1, Notch 2, Wnt 7 b, and Shh expression found in incisor epithelium of Ikkα mutants suggest that this NF-κB-independent function is mediated by Notch/Wnt/Shh signaling pathways...|$|R

The inability of traditional drug-based therapies to inhibit HIV replication effectively for extended periods of time has stimulated intense research to develop novel approaches for this disease. Current understanding of HIV molecular biology and pathogenesis has opened the way for the development of gene therapy strategies for HIV infections. In this context, a number of intracellular immunization-based strategies have been evaluated, and some of them have reached the stage of phase I/II human clinical trials. These strategies include the use of single-chain antibodies, capsid-targeted viral inactivation, <b>transdominant</b> negative <b>mutants,</b> ribozymes, antisense oligonucleotides and RNA decoys. While a number of issues remain to be studied before intracellular immunization {{can be applied to the}} treatment of HIV infections, the significant progress already made in this field is likely to lead to clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|UL 9 is {{the origin}} binding protein of Herpes Simplex Virus type- 1 (HSV- 1). It binds cooperatively to two high {{affinity}} sites within the HSV- 1 origin, exists as a dimer in solution and exhibit ATPase and helicase activities. The {{goal of this}} thesis is to define and map the functional domains of UL 9. The identification and analysis of <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutants</b> of UL 9 provided a genetic approach to identify domains and functional sites. UL 9 contains six sequence motifs, conserved in a superfamily of RNA and DNA helicases, mutations within these abolish UL 9 function in vivo. Overexpression of wild-type UL 9 is inhibitory to plaque formation in a transfection assay which measures viral plaque formation by infectious HSV- 1 DNA. Constructs containing mutations in motif I, II or VI are strong transdominant inhibitors of plaque formation by the wild-type virus. The transdominant phenotype can be relieved by introducing a second mutation in the DNA-binding domain or by deleting the N-terminal 35 amino acids of the protein. The inhibitory effects of wild type UL 9 can also be partially relieved by deletion of amino acids 292 - 404. We propose that the N-terminal 35 amino acids of UL 9 and residues 292 - 404 may define new functional domains of the UL 9 protein. ^ A UL 9 -specific monoclonal antibody (17 B) whose epitope maps to the N-terminal 33 amino acids was used to study the intracellular localization of UL 9. We demonstrate the colocalization of UL 9 and the HSV- 1 single-strand DNA binding protein in replication compartments, sites of viral DNA synthesis. Cells transfected with various deletion or pyruvate kinase fusion constructs were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence assay to define the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of UL 9. A fusion construct containing the carboxy-terminal 107 residues (amino acids 745 - 851) localized efficiently to the nucleus. Mutations designed to alter a potential NLS sequence (793 -KREFAGARFKLR- 804) within the C-terminal 107 residues result in a mutant UL 9 protein which fails to localize efficiently to the nucleus. These {{results suggest that the}} major NLS of UL 9 maps within the C-terminal 107 amino acids. ...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxia profoundly {{influences}} tumor {{development and}} response to therapy. While {{progress has been made}} in identifying individual gene products whose synthesis is altered under hypoxia, little is known about the mechanism by which hypoxia induces a global downregulation of protein synthesis. A critical step in the regulation of protein synthesis in response to stress is the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF 2 � on Ser 51, which leads to inhibition of new protein synthesis. Here we report that exposure of human diploid fibroblasts and transformed cells to hypoxia led to phosphorylation of eIF 2 �, a modification that was readily reversed upon reoxygenation. Expression of a <b>transdominant,</b> nonphosphorylatable <b>mutant</b> allele of eIF 2 � attenuated the repression of protein synthesis under hypoxia. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -resident eIF 2 � kinase PERK was hyperphosphorylated upon hypoxic stress, and overexpression of wild-type PERK increased the levels of hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of eIF 2 �. Cells stably expressing a dominant-negative PERK allele and mouse embryonic fibroblasts with a homozygous deletion of PERK exhibited attenuated phosphorylation of eIF 2 � and reduced inhibition of protein synthesis in response to hypoxia. PERK �/ � mous...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAt several E. coli promoters, {{initiation}} of transcription is repressed by a tight nucleoprotein complex {{formed by the}} assembly of the H-NS protein. In order to characterize {{the relationship between the}} structure of H-NS oligomers in solution and on relevant DNA fragments, we have compared wild-type H-NS and several <b>transdominant</b> H-NS <b>mutants</b> using gel shift assays, DNase I footprinting, analytical ultracentrifugation, and reactivity toward a cross-linking reagent. In solution, oligomerization occurs through two protein interfaces, one necessary to construct a dimeric core (and involving residues 1 - 64) and the other required for subsequent assembly of these dimers. We show that, as well as region 64 - 95, residues present in the NH(2) -terminal coiled coil domain also participate in this second interface. Our results support the view that the same interacting interfaces are also involved on the DNA. We propose that the dimeric core recognizes specific motifs, with the second interface being critical for their correct head to tail assembly. The COOH-terminal domain of the protein contains the DNA binding motif essential for the discrimination of this specific functional assembly over competitive nonspecific H-NS polymers...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) utilizes the NF-kappaB/Rel pathway to mediate, in part, its transcriptional regulation through NF-kappaB binding sites {{present in the}} HIV- 1 LTR. In unstimulated cells, DNA binding NF-kappaB sub-units are retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitory IkappaB proteins. Upon stimulation by cytokines, viruses or dsRNA, IkappaBalpha is rapidly phosphorylated and degraded, resulting in the release of NF-kappaB and the subsequent increase in NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression. The effect of <b>transdominant</b> <b>mutants</b> of IkappaBalpha (TD-IkappaBalpha) on the synergistic activation of the HIV- 1 LTR by TNFalpha and the HIV- 1 transactivator Tat, was examined in Jurkat T cells. Co-expression of WT IkappaBalpha and TD-IkappaBalpha inhibited Tat-TNF activation of HIV- 1 LTR in a dose dependent manner. TD-IkappaBalpha also effectively inhibited HIV- 1 multiplication in a single cycle infection model in COS- 1 cells. To {{examine the effect of}} inducible expression of TD-IkappaBalpha on de novo HIV- 1 multiplication, we generated Jurkat T cells inducibly expressing TD-IkappaBalpha by doxycycline (Dox). Dox induction of TD-IkappaBalpha dramatically reduced both NF-kappaB DNA binding activity and LTR directed gene activity. The time course of de novo HIV- 1 infection was altered by Dox induction of TD-IkappaBalpha in Jurkat cells, resulting in a dramatic inhibition of HIV- 1 multiplication. Interestingly, induced expression of TD-IkappaBalpha also progressively decreased the expression of endogenous IkappaBalpha to undetectable levels by 24 h after induction, indicating that TD-IkappaBalpha was able to repress endogenous NF-kappaB dependent gene expression. We also demonstrated that production of TD-IkappaBalpha reduced endogenous IkappaBalpha gene transcription, due to the continued cytoplasmic sequestration of RelA(p 65) by TD-IkappaBalpha. In vivo genomic footprinting revealed stimuli-responsive protein-DNA binding not only to the - 63 to - 53 kappaB 1 site but also to the adjacent - 44 to - 36 Spl site of the IkappaBalpha promoter. In vivo protection of both sites was inhibited by Dox-inducible TD-IkappaBalpha expression. Prolonged NF-kappaB binding and a temporal switch in the composition of NF-kappaB complexes bound to the - 63 to - 53 kappaB 1 site of the IkappaBalpha promoter were also observed; with time after induction, decreased levels of transcriptionally active p 65 -p 50 and increased c-rel-p 50 heterodimers were detected at the kappaB 1 site. Mutation of either the kappaB 1 site or the Sp 1 site abolished transcription factor binding to the respective sites, as well as the inducibility of the IkappaBalpha promoter in transient transfection studies. Based on these results, specific activation of TD-IkappaBalpha can block NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression and HIV- 1 infection...|$|R
40|$|INI 1 /hSNF 5 is an HIV- 1 {{integrase}} (IN) binding protein specifically {{incorporated into}} virions. A truncated mutant of INI 1 (S 6, aa 183 - 294) harboring the minimal IN binding Rpt 1 domain potently inhibits HIV- 1 particle production in a transdominant manner. The inhibition requires interaction of S 6 with IN within Gag-Pol. While INI 1 is a nuclear protein and harbors a masked nuclear export signal (NES), the <b>transdominant</b> negative <b>mutant</b> S 6 is cytoplasmic, {{due to the}} unmasking of NES. Here, we have {{examined the effects of}} subcellular localization of S 6 on HIV- 1 inhibition and further investigated the stages of assembly that are affected. We found that targeting an NLS-containing S 6 variant [NLS-S 6 (Rpt 1) ] to the nucleoplasm (but not to nucleolus) resulted in complete reversal of inhibition of particle production. Electron microscopy indicated that while no electron dense particles at any stage of assembly were seen in cells expressing S 6, virions were produced in cells expressing the rescue mutant NLS-S 6 (Rpt 1) to wild-type levels. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that p 24 exhibited a diffuse pattern of localization within the cytoplasm in cells expressing S 6 in contrast t...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe HIV- 1 transframe protein p 6 ⁎ {{known to}} {{modulate}} HIV- 1 protease activation {{has been suggested}} {{to interact with the}} viral pathogenicity factor Nef. However, a potential interaction site in p 6 ⁎ has not been mapped so far. To evaluate effects of p 6 ⁎ modification on viral replication in light of Nef function, clustered substitutions were introduced into the central p 6 ⁎ region of the infectious provirus NL 4 - 3 and virus growth and composition of the various mutants was analyzed in different cell cultures in {{the presence or absence of}} Nef. Whereas clustered p 6 ⁎ substitutions did neither affect particle incorporation of Nef, nor precursor maturation or viral infectivity, a simultaneous substitution of 40 of the total 56 p 6 ⁎ residues significantly diminished viral infectivity and replication in a Nef-independent manner. Furthermore, this extended modification was not capable of rescuing the negative effects of a <b>transdominant</b> Nef <b>mutant</b> on particle production suggesting that the proposed target for Nef interaction in Gag-Pol is located outside the modified p 6 ⁎ region. In sum these data strongly argue against a functional connection of the central p 6 ⁎ region and Nef during viral life cycle...|$|R
