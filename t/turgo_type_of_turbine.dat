50|$|One of {{the first}} {{production}} cars to use these turbos was the Japanese 1988 Honda Legend and used a variable geometry turbo with an integrated water cooled intercooler installed on its 2.0 L V6 engine. There was also the limited-production (only 500 produced) 1989 Shelby CSX-VNT, equipped with a 2.2-liter Chrysler K engine. The Shelby CSX-VNT utilised a turbo from Garrett, called the VNT-25 because it used the same compressor and shaft as the more common Garrett T-25.

40|$|The {{wind power}} {{research}} at the division of Electricity at Uppsala University is aimed towards increased understanding of vertical axis wind <b>turbines.</b> The considered <b>type</b> <b>of</b> wind <b>turbine</b> is an H-rotor with a directly driven synchronous generator operating at variable speed. The experimental work presented in this thesis comprises investigation of three vertical axis wind <b>turbines</b> <b>of</b> different design and size. The electrical, control and measurement systems for the first 12 kW wind turbine have been designed and implemented. The second was a 10 kW wind turbine adapted to a telecom application. Both the 12 kW and the 10 kW were operated against dump loads. The third turbine was a 200 kW grid-connected wind turbine, where control and measurement systems have been implemented. Experimental results have shown that an all-electric control, substituting mechanical systems such as blade-pitch, is possible for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbine.</b> By controlling the rectified generator voltage, the rotational speed <b>of</b> the <b>turbine</b> is also controlled. An electrical start-up system has been built and verified. The power coefficient has been measured and the stall behaviour <b>of</b> this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbine</b> has been examined. An optimum tip speed ratio control has been implemented and tested, with promising results. Use <b>of</b> the <b>turbine</b> to estimate the wind speed has been demonstrated.

40|$|The Gazelle is a {{wind turbine}} with a fixed blade angle and utilising a 22 kW {{induction}} generator to produce three phase electricity that is exported direct {{to the national}} grid. The advantages <b>of</b> this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbine</b> assembly are {{generally considered to be}} the relatively low cost of construction and the small size because of the reduced amount of moving parts that are required. The existing system has disadvantages. The primary ones that will be considered here are the problems encountered adapting to a change in wind conditions. Energy is lost as the traditional method of operation requires this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>turbine</b> to be shut down at low or high wind speeds. There are improvements that can be made. After consideration of many areas that can be optimised, the most beneficial to the amount of energy that can be produced are the selection of the correct blade angle for a specific. location and the additional power that can be generated resulting from the redesign of the control strategy. These are considered in the research program described. A picture of a Gazelle is shown as Figure 1 - 1. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
