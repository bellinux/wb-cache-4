40|$|Quantification of {{precious}} metal content is important for studies of ore deposits, basalt petrogenesis, and precious metal geology, mineralization, mining, and processing. However, accurate determination of metal concentrations can be compromised by microheterogeneity {{commonly referred to as}} the "nugget effect", i. e., spatially significant variations in the distribution {{of precious}} metal minerals at the scale of instrumental analytical beam footprints. There are few studies focused on the spatial distribution of such minerals and its detrimental effects on quantification of the existing suite of relevant reference materials (RM). In order to assess the nugget effect in RM, pressed powder pellets of MASS- 1, MASS- 3, WMS- 1 a, WMS- 1, and KPT- 1 (dominantly sulfides) as well as CHR-Pt+ and CHR-Bkg (chromite-bearing) were mapped with micro-XRF. The number of verified nuggets observed was used to recalculate an effective concentration {{of precious metal}}s for the analytical aliquot, allowing for an empirical estimate of a minimum mass <b>test</b> <b>portion.</b> MASS- 1, MASS- 3, and WMS- 1 a did not contain any nuggets; therefore, a convenient small <b>test</b> <b>portion</b> could be used here (< 0. 1 g), while CHR-Pt+ would require 0. 125 g and WMS- 1 would need 23 g to be representative. For CHR-Bkg and KPT- 1, the minimum <b>test</b> <b>portion</b> mass would have to be ∼ 80 and ∼ 342 g, respectively. Minimum test portions masses may have to be greater still in order to provide detectable analytical signals. Procedures for counteracting the detrimental manifestations of microheterogeneity are presented. It is imperative that both RM and pristine samples are treated {{in exactly the same way}} in the laboratory, lest powders having an unknown nugget status (in effect all field samples for analysis) can not be documented to be representing a safe minimum mass basis...|$|E

To obtain accurate results, a homogeneous microanalytical reference material for calibration is needed. Several researchers have used the Mn-and Fe-rich RMs, JMn- 1, NOD-A- 1, NOD-P- 1 and FeMn- 1, for this purpose; therefore, they were tested in this study to determine their suitability for microanalysis. Their homogeneity was investigated by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) with {{two different types of}} lasers (nano-and femtosecond), with spot and line scan analyses and with different operating parameters, such as spot size, pulse repetition rate and fluence.

Uncertainties at the 95 % confidence level (CL) have been determined for bulk- and micro-analytical purposes. In contrast to former compilation procedures, this approach delivers data that consider present-day requirements of data quality. New analytical data and the nearly complete data set of the GeoReM database were used for this study. Data quality was checked by {{the application of the}} Horwitz function and by a careful investigation of analytical procedures.

We have therefore determined 46 major and trace elements in dust samples, using in-situ 200 nm-femtosecond laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Very small <b>test</b> <b>portions</b> of 4 - 7 mu g {{were enough to}} enable analyses down to detection limits of femtograms and ng g(- 1), respectively. The data agree within 40 to 15 % with the reference values for <b>test</b> <b>portions</b> of 1 to 100 mu g, respectively. The femtosecond laser results are compared to those obtained using a 213 nm nanosecond laser, which show {{the advantages of the}} femtosecond laser, such as the ability to use non-matrix-matched calibration, reliable measurements of volatile elements, and smaller quantities of material ablation with similar results for the repeatability. The technique is especially useful for measurements of small amounts of dust on filters, and for 2 D-distribution maps of selected elements to identify minerals or contamination. To demonstrate the applicability, five dust samples from Niger and Chad, in the Sahara zone, were analyzed. The samples are characterized by enrichment in light REEs and a distinct Eu anomaly, with surface soils as their source. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} use of analytical macro-beam techniques (such as portable XRF, PXRF) for geochemical measurements, {{as a result of}} their convenience and relatively low cost per measurement. Reference materials (RMs) are essential for validation, and sometimes calibration, of beam measurements, just as they are for the traditional analytical techniques that use bulk powders. RMs are typically supplied with data sheets that tabulate uncertainties in the reference values by element, for which purpose they also specify a minimum recommended mass of material to be used in the chemical analysis. This minimum mass may not be achievable using analytical beam techniques. In this study, the mass of the <b>test</b> <b>portion</b> interrogated by a handheld PXRF within pellets made from three silicate RMs (SdAR L 2, M 2 and H 1) was estimated using a theoretical approach. It was found to vary from 0. 001 to 0. 3 g for an 8 mm beam size and 0. 0001 to 0. 045 g for a 3 mm beam. These <b>test</b> <b>portion</b> masses are mainly well below the recommended minimum mass for these particular RMs (0. 2 g), but were found to increase as a function of atomic number (as might be expected). The uncertainties caused by heterogeneity (UHET) in PXRF measurements of the three RMs were experimentally estimated using two different beam diameters for eighteen elements. The elements showing the highest levels of heterogeneity (UHET > 5 %) seem generally to be those usually associated with either an accessory mineral (e. g., Zr in zircon, As in pyrite) or low <b>test</b> <b>portion</b> mass (associated with low atomic number). When the beam size was changed from nominally 8 to 3 mm, the uncertainty caused by heterogeneity was seen to increase for most elements by an average ratio of 2. 2. These values of UHET were used to calculate revised uncertainties of the reference values that would be appropriate for measurements made using a PXRF with these beam sizes. The methods used here to estimate UHET in PXRF measurements have a potential application to other analytical beam techniques...|$|E

For the pilot <b>test</b> <b>portion</b> of the study, students (N = 297) participated in newly developed instructional modules (careers, writing, design, and multimedia) predetermined by a committee of agricultural education and communications faculty at the University of Arkansas.
