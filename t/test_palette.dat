40|$|Transformation of {{guideline}} {{knowledge into}} statements that are executable within computer-based decision support systems {{is an area}} of active research. We sought (a) to determine whether a limited set of action types could be defined to comprehensively categorize activities recommended by the vast majority of clinical guidelines, (b) to describe the relative frequency of these action types, and (c) to create a library of recommendations that might be used in future validation activities. We randomly selected a test set of 50 recommendations from the National Guideline Clearinghouse and extracted from them 150 recommendations. We next tested the ability of a preliminary palette of action types to categorize guideline-mandated activities. The preliminary palette was expanded to accommodate several unanticipated actions. The <b>test</b> <b>palette</b> included prescribe, perform therapeutic procedure, educate/counsel, test, dispose, refer/consult, conclude, monitor, test, document, advocate, prepare, and no recommendation. This extended palette was tested on 150 randomly selected recommendations that constituted a validation set. Together, the test set and validation set of recommendations constitute a library {{that can be used in}} future investigations. We found the action palette to be comprehensive and usable for categorization. Thus, we define a set of terms that we believe can facilitate implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Specifically, implementation tasks can be modeled using the action palette so that associated beneficial services can be generally provided...|$|E

Toonz 4.0 provided more powerful tools compared to Toonz 3.0 and an extremely intuitive user interface for traditional cell animators working in the film, video, interactive games and new media industries. Softimage Toonz 4.0 offered greatly enhanced key features such as a new pencil <b>test</b> module, <b>Palette</b> Editor, Xsheet, Ink and Paint module, and flip module, and allowed users to further customize the software by adding separate modules for scanning and rendering.|$|R
50|$|Pastel {{techniques}} {{can be challenging}} since the medium is mixed and blended directly on the working surface, and unlike paint, colors cannot be <b>tested</b> on a <b>palette</b> before applying to the surface. Pastel errors cannot be covered the way a paint error can be painted out. Experimentation with the pastel medium {{on a small scale}} in order to learn various techniques gives the user a better command over a larger composition.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{rely upon}} a color {{system in which the}} colors are divided into four groups of {{harmonious}} colors which are said to match with the four seasons of the year. The seasons are, to some degree, arbitrary, and it sometimes happens that someone will be on the cusp of two seasons. But, as Carole Jackson insists, [...] "with <b>testing,</b> one <b>palette</b> will prove to be better harmonious than the other." [...] Jackson also acknowledges, however, that the reference to the four seasons {{is nothing more than a}} convenient artifice: [...] "We could call your coloring 'Type A,', 'Type B,' and so on, but comparison with the seasons provides a more poetic way to describe your coloring and your best colors." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} science {{approaches to the}} classification of painting concentrate on problems of attribution. While this goal is certainly worthy of pursuit, there are other valid tasks related to the classification of painting including the identification of period styles, the description of styles, and {{the analysis of the}} relationship between different painting styles. This dissertation proposed and developed a general approach to the classification of style and achieved this goal using a semantically-relevant feature set. The resulting automated painting analysis system style support the following tasks: recognize painting styles, identify key relationships between styles, outline the basis for style proximity, and evaluate and visualize classification results. ^ The study initially conducted a review of the features currently applied to this domain and implemented these features, supplementing them with commonly used features in image retrieval applications. The study evaluated these features for classification accuracy, speed, storage space, and semantic relevance, and mapped the features considered to formal elements discussed in the domain, including light, line, texture, and color. In particular, the study successfully employed several color features not previously applied to painting classification, such as color autocorrelograms and dynamic spatial chromatic histograms. The dissertation proposed and developed a palette description feature for describing the color content of paintings. In <b>tests,</b> the <b>palette</b> description feature classified style as well as comparable color features. ^ The study evaluated the features against two databases of paintings using a variety of supervised and unsupervised classification techniques including k-nearest neighbor, hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, and multidimensional scaling. In summary, the dissertation proposed and developed a theoretical style center and variance as both an analytical tool and an evaluation technique for classification accuracy. A style description ratio based on the theoretical style center and variance served as a reliable basis for the evaluation of classification results. ...|$|R
40|$|AURORA is ESA’ {{long term}} {{technology}} program devoted to prepare human exploration missions within the solar system, primarily Mars, the Moon and asteroids. To achieve this goal, {{it is necessary}} previously to acquire knowledge and to improve existing European technology level through robotic missions. To accomplish this European road map the Moon appears as attractive platform for first stations, technology test field, experiments and in general for collecting experience. In particular, the German Aerospace Center, DLR, as the biggest engineer center in Germany with a primary role to develop aerospace technologies, is motivated to be prepared also for the AURORA vision. Concentrating on the Moon as a first goal is a middle course to <b>test</b> the <b>palette</b> of technologies defined in ESA’ technology matrix for AURORA. The present paper discuses a flexible concept, which enables to prove and validate different technological goals at a reasonable cost. The proposed reference mission includes a Space-Tug-Vehicle in Moon orbit, transfer the surveillance/relay satellite into low lunar orbit, landing on the Moon with a lander equipped with a rover for miscellaneous challenges and automated return with samples to the Earth. As a path-breaking in this concept, which should guaranties low mission costs, it is intended the application of several technologies like: arc-jet propulsion for lunar satellite attitude control; combined chemical-electrical propulsion for service module of the super orbital velocity automated reentry vehicle; selection of low impulse trajectories; broad Ka–band/ X–band communication system for data transmission; advanced ATJ solar arrays with total surface of 100 m 2 as primary energy source and automated rendezvous-docking system, among others. The analysis includes first global mass budgets for the Lunar-Space-Tug-Vehicle and its component modules; energy budgets for subsystems like electric power supply and propellants and delta-velocity budgets for the complete trajectory and its segments. Also are defined the propulsion properties for the different modules. As an option against conventional Earth re-entry with super orbital velocity, it is here analyzed a reentry option with aerobraking maneuver in upper Earth atmosphere. ...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY One Line Pitch: A {{boutique}} {{paint and}} textile retailer selling an edited palette of paints and a unique line of textiles to customers having {{a penchant for}} locally produced, environmentally friendly products for the well lived and well loved home. Business Summary: We offer professional architectural color consulting services, specifying our own <b>tested</b> and edited <b>palette</b> of premium paint colors. Our line of paints coordinates directly to a line of modern textiles, screen-­‐printed locally in Portland, Oregon. The paints are sold by the quart or gallon and the textiles are sold by the yard in our Pearl District retail location. Look out for our tote bags, pillows and other textiles for the table as well. Product/Services: Bolt and Brush will offer professional, architectural color consulting services and a premium line of environmentally friendly paints for retail sale. A line of textiles, designed and screen-­‐printed locally, will also be sold by the yard. Other ancillary products made from the same yardage sold in the store like tote bags, pillows and textiles for the dining table will also be made locally and sold both online and in retail stores. Target Market: Bolt and Brush’s targeted customer, both male and female, is design savvy with a strong appreciation for locally produced goods that are also environmentally friendly. Typically these consumers have at least some level of higher education. They {{are in the middle}} to upper middle class income range and despite the economic downturn; these customers are still financially capable of make purchases for premium goods and services. Management: Sarah Miller, Founder and sole employee, having color and textile design experience in multiple industries, a BFA in Textile Design and the near completion of an MBA. Sarah’s natural inclination is towards the arts and design, but steadfast persistence in the practicalities of opening a business makes her a likely candidate for entrepreneurial success in the design field. Sales/Marketing Strategy: Bolt 2 ̆ 6 Brush’s marketing strategy focuses initially on local support, i. e. newspaper and magazine write-­‐ups, radio spots, and word of mouth from satisfied customers of the color consultation process. The company will gain needed brand awareness nationally with a strong on-­‐line presence and personality that taps into the design-­‐centric community. Financial Strategy: We have established a three-­‐year ramp up period of developing brand recognition in the online design community using guerilla-­‐marketing tactics. At the end of the three-­‐year period, once the strength of the brand has been established, we will invest in the overhead of a retail storefront, which will allow for additional avenues for growth. Risk Assessment: The risk involved lies mostly on Sarah Miller and her spouse. 50, 000 in seed money is from their personal funds and Sarah would be compromising other career opportunities by focusing her creative energies on growing the business. The risk of failure, otherwise, at this stage is minimal and will affect few. The worst-­‐case scenario would be that customers would not respond to the patterns and colors brought to market. If this occurred, Sarah would shift the focus of her business and reevaluate the company’s direction...|$|R
