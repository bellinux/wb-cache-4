40|$|Introduction: “The fatty liver” is over {{collection}} of fat (triglycerides) {{inside of the}} liver cells leads to middle increased liver. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis appears at <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with pathological level of the lipids in their blood, at <b>the</b> diabetic <b>patients,</b> and at <b>the</b> obese <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> safest method for diagnosis of the fatty liver is biopsy of the liver, but the ultrasound of the liver is also very objective method for diagnosis. The goal of the research was to find connection between pathological ultrasound of liver (fatty liver) and pathological levels cholesterol, triglycerides, sugar {{in the blood of}} all of <b>the</b> <b>patients.</b> <b>The</b> <b>patients</b> and Methods: There were 170 of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> in <b>the</b> trans-section study (57 of the men (33. 50 %) and 113 of the women (66. 50 %). <b>The</b> <b>patients</b> were divided in two groups: a) experimental group with <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with pathological level of lipids in their blood (32 of the men, and 59 of the women), and b) control group with <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with normal values of the lipids in their blood (25 of the men, and 54 of the women).

5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{attenuation}} parameter (CAP) {{is a method}} for measuring steatosis based on FibroScan. Despite observer dependency, ultrasound (US) robustly diagnoses moderate and severe steatosis. Here, we aimed to evaluate the correlation of CAP with US-identified steatosis in real-world clinical practice. Methods: CAP and US were performed for 1554 chronic liver disease (CLD) patients. CAP was performed by two technicians, and US was performed by 30 hepatologists. The performance of the CAP {{as compared with the}} US results was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: 532 (34. 2 %) of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, 723 (46. 5 %) of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> had hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and <b>the</b> rest were <b>patients</b> with metabolic risk factors. CAP values were significantly correlated with the steatosis grades identified by US for all <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> (ρ =  0. 497, P <  0. 001), for <b>the</b> HBV-infected <b>patients</b> (ρ =  0. 495, P <  0. 001), for <b>the</b> HCV-infected <b>patients</b> (ρ =  0. 343, P <  0. 001), and for <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with metabolic risk factors (ρ =  0. 515, P <  0. 001). Using CAP, the AUROC values were 0. 759, 0. 795, 0. 715, and 0. 716 for ≥moderate steatosis identified by US in, respectively, all <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>the</b> HBV-infected <b>patients,</b> <b>the</b> HCV-infected <b>patients,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with metabolic risk factors. The AUROC values were 0. 791, 0. 868, 0. 807 and 0. 701 for severe steatosis identified by US in, respectively, all <b>the</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>the</b> HBV-infected <b>patients,</b> <b>the</b> HCV-infected <b>patients,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with metabolic risk factors.

Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible.

5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> {{presents}} {{less than}} eight hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E

Objective 1 : To find out whether <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> educated without an educational plan are as knowledgeable as <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> educated through an educational plan. Objective 2 : To compare whether <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> educated without an educational plan comply with the principles of the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction {{in the same way as}} <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> with an educational plan. A qualitative form of research had been chosen for this thesis, semi-standardized interview in particular. The analysis of the data gained was subsequently carried out.
