25|$|Léonce {{enrolled}} in the new music school, Schola Cantorum, located in the Montparnasse neighborhood of Paris. His talent as an excellent singer and flute player soon became apparent, thus began his very prolific artistic career. During this time, he loved to watch plays at the theatre in his free time and felt more and more drawn to the stage. He participated in small stage productions {{in order to learn}} the trade; he had to accept any offer that came his way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid,</b> which often amounted to a pittance. At the same time he continued to take music and theatre classes.|$|E
25|$|After {{dropping}} out of high school, Foley pursued standup comedy {{for about a year}} in the Toronto Second City Training Centre, where he began taking improv classes and met Kevin McDonald, who gave him a job as an usher at a local art house movie theatre. He played Lewis Allen in the miniseries Anne of Avonlea. Foley, McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney and Scott Thompson formed The Kids in the Hall, which debuted on television from 1988 to 1995. Foley played some characters, including Hecubus, one of the Sizzler sisters, the A. T. & Love boss, Bruno Puntz Jones, Mr. Heavyfoot, Jocelyn and Lex. Initially involved with , he left the troupe {{in the middle of the}} writing, dissatisfied with the internal strife and the quality of the script, and joined the NewsRadio cast instead. As he had not signed any contract with the studio, Foley agreed to sign a deal which would allow the rest of the troupe <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid</b> for the script, though he was convinced that it would never be shot. When it was greenlit, Foley did the film because he was contractually obligated. He is the only member of the group who is uncredited as a writer. Foley rejoined the troupe in 2000 and has been an integral part of their various reformations. He appeared in the Kids in the Hall 2010 reunion project Death Comes to Town. Paul Simms, creator of NewsRadio, happened to be a huge fan of Foley's work and wrote the role of Dave Nelson specifically for him. Much of his character on the show was based on his own personality quirks, including his coffee addiction and his love of the sitcom Green Acres.|$|E

500|$|The poor sales caused {{financial}} problems {{and may have}} caused a suicide, for on August 22, Charles A. Watts, secretary of the Centennial Corporation and described by Campbell as the real force behind the coin, killed himself. The day before he died, he told {{a meeting of the}} corporation that there were funds enough to pay all debts, and that Fraser was not owed any money. Neither proved to be the case, and unpaid bills totaled $6,000, with no money to pay them. In fact, Fraser's fee of $1,200 was outstanding, and she tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid</b> even with the half dollars, but her bill was unsatisfied until a year later, when she was paid by check. The half dollars were not owned by the corporation, as the Vancouver National Bank had advanced money for them. Sales came to a virtual halt by the end of October. Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl offered to buy the remainder of the issue at face value, but this was rejected as many people had paid $1 for their coins. A total of 35,034 pieces were sent back to the mint for redemption and melting, leaving 14,966 pieces outstanding. According to Swiatek and Breen, [...] "given the remoteness and exclusively local nature of the celebration, it is surprising that as many as fourteen thousand coins were sold." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{sheet music}} {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] {{is written in}} common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Set in the key of A major, it follows the basic chord progression of A–E–D for the verse and A–E–Fm–D progression for the chorus, while Gaga's voice spans from A3 to D5 Gaga's references for the saxophone solo was E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen hence she ultimately asked Clarence Clemons from E Street Band to play the instrument. Clemons told Rolling Stone that in January 2011, he was contacted by Gaga's management and {{they wanted him to}} play on Born This Way. Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that he could record it on the coming Monday or Tuesday, but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. Clemons flew from Florida to New York, and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "The Edge of Glory". She simply told Clemons, [...] "We'll put the tape on and you just play". The recording concluded by 3 a.m. after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid,</b> since he [...] "would have done it for free. I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money." ...|$|E
500|$|Giancarlo Vulcano, a music {{editor and}} {{associate}} arranger on the show, revealed that Richmond taught him the song one morning at Silvercup Studios—where {{the show is}} filmed—and they played {{the first half of}} [...] "He Needs a Kidney" [...] at the script's read-through. According to Vulcano, the 30 Rock staff loved the song and the two were satisfied with the reception of it. While arranging the instrumentation, Richmond hired violinists for the episode's background music and for [...] "He Needs a Kidney", which according to him he usually does not get the opportunity {{to have a lot of}} violin sounds on the show. The recording sessions with the musical guests took place on Stage 1 at Silvercup Studios; Stage 1 serves as the set for TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictitious comedy sketch show featured on 30 Rock. Richmond and Vulcano were complimentary towards the musicians—Clay Aiken, Sara Bareilles, the Beastie Boys (Mike D and Ad-Rock), Mary J. Blige, Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Steve Earle, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Talib Kweli, Cyndi Lauper, Adam Levine, Michael McDonald, Rhett Miller, Moby, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata—who performed [...] "He Needs a Kidney". In the DVD commentary for this episode, Richmond believed that the entire song would not make it into the airing. Elvis Costello was once approached to do an appearance on 30 Rock, but the appearance fell-through. At an Oscar's after party, Fey ran into Costello and asked him if he could appear, which he agreed to. According to Fey, none of the music artists got paid to appear on the show as [...] "they all did [...] for free." [...] The reason for this was due to a joke in the song in which Sheryl Crow was the only individual <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid,</b> as the rest said they did it for free. Following the broadcast of this episode of 30 Rock, the musical performance video was made available for digital download on iTunes with all the proceeds from the sales going to the National Kidney Foundation.|$|E
5000|$|Comedy open mic nights {{can be held}} at {{established}} comedy clubs, but {{are more}} commonly held at other venues {{with or without a}} stage, often the upstairs or back room of a pub or bar. Such nights give newer or emerging comedians an opportunity to practice and improve, with a view <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> work in the future. More experienced comedians may use open mics as an opportunity to work out newer material or a new character, as the audience is not paying in anticipation of seeing their normal act. In a typical open mic night, newer acts will get three or maybe five minutes of stage time, but more experienced acts may get ten or more minutes.|$|R

2500|$|The main Polish–Lithuanian forces arrived only on 26 July 1410. The {{day before}} von Plauen ordered the town outside the Marienburg Castle to be burned, depriving allied {{soldiers}} of shelter and clearing the battlefield. The siege was not intense: Polish King Jogaila {{was confident that}} Prussia had already fallen and began distributing land among his nobles. He sent his troops to capture numerous small castles that were left without garrisons. Only eight castles remained in Teutonic hands. The Knights were allowed to communicate with their allies. They send envoys to Sigismund of Hungary and Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, who provided a loan to hire mercenaries and promised to send Bohemian and Moravian reinforcements {{by the end of}} September. The Livonian Order sent 500 men as soon as its three-month truce with Lithuania expired. [...] The siege, holding Jogaila's army in place, helped to organize defensive forces in other parts of Prussia. The besiegers expected capitulation and were not prepared for a long-term engagement, suffering from lack of ammunition, low morale, and an epidemic of dysentery. The nobles wanted to return home for the harvest and the mercenaries wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid.</b> Lithuanian troops, commanded by Vytautas, were the first to withdraw. The siege was eventually lifted on 19 September. Before departing, Jogaila built a stronghold in Stuhm (Sztum), south of Marienburg, hoping to keep pressure on the Knights. The Polish–Lithuanian forces returned to Poland and Lithuania, leaving Polish garrisons in fortresses that surrendered or were captured.|$|E

Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid</b> you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever since I was a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E

But it sort of simmered to that point, and then people wanted to hear bands like Nirvana, which weren't hardcore, not pop or rock, it was sort of more heartfelt music, and we were sort of caught up in that...In Europe especially, the music scene was just exploding. We completely attribute all of our success to going and playing in Europe. That's where all the buzz about us came from. We were touring throughout the States in the mid-80s, and we'd get a little bit of audience here and there, but {{after a couple of years}} in Europe, we started doing some big shows there, and all of a sudden, people in the States were coming out to our shows. And we went from <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> $200 <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>paid</b> $1000. It was just like that. You had to have the buzz, and then it all just kind of blew up. Every major label tried to sign every band, and then it became no longer an alternative, it sort of became co-opted by the mainstream and people moved on to hip hop and dub step and then everyone got sick of rock and roll and went to raves.|$|R
