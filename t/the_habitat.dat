40|$|This book {{analyses}} <b>the</b> <b>Habitats</b> Directive; one of {{the most}} prominent piece of EU environmental legislation of the past decades. Seen by some as the cornerstone of Europe’s nature conservation policy, among other measures the Directive established the so-called "Natura 2000 " ecological network, which covers more than 18 % of the surface of the EU. However, despite the fact the Directive was adopted over twenty years ago only 17 % of <b>the</b> protected <b>habitats</b> and species in Europe are being adequately protected while 10 - 60 % of animal species remain under threat. In light of the limited success and the contested nature of <b>the</b> <b>Habitats</b> Directive so far this book examines the successes and failures of <b>the</b> <b>Habitats</b> Directive from a legal and political angle. The book brings together international experts to consider the application, implementation and future of <b>the</b> <b>Habitats</b> Directive in order to assess whether <b>the</b> <b>Habitats</b> Directive is resilient enough to tackle biodiversity loss in the twenty- first century. Particular emphasis is put on the legal regime attached to the Natura 2000 network and its possible impact on land development and the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Habitats</b> Directive and other topics including liability for ecological damage and transboundary nature conservation...|$|R
40|$|Student paper, EEB 4839, 2008 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the small mammal species diversity within forest and prairie habitats.

5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do {{for about an hour}} after sunset. This may be in order to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of <b>the</b> <b>habitat</b> for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more {{is known about}} the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, <b>the</b> <b>habitat</b> of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E

5|$|In {{ecosystems}} such as mangrove swamps, trees {{play a role}} {{in developing}} <b>the</b> <b>habitat,</b> since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the water depth and creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation.
