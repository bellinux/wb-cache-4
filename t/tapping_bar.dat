5000|$|There were {{specific}} accoutrements for {{the individual}} trade groups. The mining foreman or Steiger, for example, carried the Steigerhäckel, a simple hewer (Häuer) bore a miner's hatchet (Grubenbeil). Able miners (Doppelhäuer) carried a miner's axe (Bergbarte or Bergparte), which was simultaneously a tool and a weapon. The smelters (Hüttenleute) wore the leather apron as a pinafore (Schürze) {{in front of them}} (i.e. [...] "back to front") and carried various implements: the Firke or Furkel, the rake (Rechen) and the <b>tapping</b> <b>bar</b> (Stecheisen or Abstichlanze).|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{determine the influence of}} the <b>tapping</b> <b>bar</b> and sieve agitators (balls and brushes) on determining mean particle size and standard deviation of ground corn. <b>Tapping</b> <b>bar</b> had no influence (P> 0. 10) on mean and standard deviation; however the presence of balls and brushes on sieves decreased (P< 0. 002) mean particle size and increased (P< 0. 0001) standard deviation. These results suggest that balls and brushes should be used when determining mean particle size to assist particle flowability. More research should be conducted {{to determine the effects of}} the <b>tapping</b> <b>bar</b> and sieve agitators over a wider range of particle sizes...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} time-series {{analysis}} and a time-beating experiment {{were used to}} test the structural and perceptual validity of notated metre. Autocorrelation applied to the flow of melodic intervals between notes from thirty fragments of compositions for solo instruments by J S Bach strongly supported the validity of bar length specifications. Time-beating data, obtained with four stimuli from the same set, played in an expressionless mode, and presented under categorically distinct tempos to different subgroups of musically trained subjects, were rather inconsistent with respect to <b>tapped</b> <b>bar</b> lengths. However, <b>taps</b> were most frequently given to the events in the stimuli that corresponded with the first beats according to the score notations. No significant effects of tempo on tapping patterns were observed. The findings are discussed in comparison with other examinations of metre inference from musical compositions...|$|R
50|$|Technology Brokering {{can make}} an impact on any kind of product {{regardless}} of its nature. For example, a <b>bar</b> <b>tap</b> handle could be pretty much anything, a stick or piece of metal, a button, etc. However, {{with the help of}} IDEO, Sam Adams was able to innovate its <b>bar</b> <b>tap</b> handles. The totally redesigned Sam Adams tap continues to have a similar shape as the others, but Sam Adams’ has a blue fluorescent cover displaying the Sam Adams brand while giving a sense of the elegance and class behind the Sam Adams brand.|$|R

50|$|Norway {{has limited}} {{availability}} of beers on tap in pubs and nightclubs. This {{is due to}} the custom of each pub signing a contract with one brewery, limiting them to providing draught beer from that brewery. In exchange, the brewery will provide the bar with all the systems required for pulling beer, including tanks, taps, and glasses. In place of the <b>tap</b> selection, <b>bars</b> often carry a number of bottled beers. However, these usually carry a much higher price tag.|$|R

50|$|Carbon dioxide is used {{to produce}} carbonated soft drinks and soda water. Traditionally, the {{carbonation}} of beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation, but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks with carbon dioxide recovered from the fermentation process. In the case of bottled and kegged beer, the most common method used is carbonation with recycled carbon dioxide. With the exception of British Real Ale, draught beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing <b>taps</b> on the <b>bar</b> using pressurized carbon dioxide, sometimes mixed with nitrogen.|$|R
50|$|By further extension, in brewing {{and beer}} retail, ullage is {{the residue of}} beer left in a barrel that has been emptied. When calculating tax returns and the like, {{licensed}} premises owners, landlords or managers can factor in the duty on ullage, or unavoidable barrel wastage.Ullage therefore {{has come to be}} used as a general term, in the licensed trade, for waste beer whether at the barrel or at the <b>bar</b> <b>tap</b> or pump. However, what customers leave in their glasses does not count as ullage, because it has been sold.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, with jazz-rock fusion guitar playing, jazz guitarists {{incorporated}} rock guitar soloing approaches, such as riff-based soloing and {{usage of}} pentatonic and blues scale patterns. Some guitarists used Jimi Hendrix-influenced distortion and wah-wah effects {{to get a}} sustained, heavy tone, or even used rapid-fire guitar shredding techniques, such as <b>tapping</b> and tremolo <b>bar</b> bending. Guitarist Al Di Meola, who started his career with Return to Forever in 1974, {{was one of the}} first guitarists to perform in a [...] "shred" [...] style, a technique later used in rock and heavy metal playing.

50|$|Taffer's most {{expensive}} rescue {{also resulted in}} his biggest failure. His visit to The Los Angeles Brewing Company during Season 4 saw him put $1 million into updating the bar, which included {{the use of a}} self-service beer tap and an in-house brewing system, which was intended to allow the bar (which became known as LABrewCo) to start serving its own beer. Four months after the rescue, the brewing system was discovered to have never been used, the self-serve tap was disconnected, and the owner had reverted changes to the <b>bar</b> <b>taps</b> and the menu. Not only that, but it was also revealed that LABrewCo's liquor license had been suspended and the business was put up for sale.|$|R
5000|$|Vai {{began his}} rise to public acclaim in 1983 when, {{shortly before the}} release of Flex-Able, his {{composition}} [...] "The Attitude Song" [...] was published in Guitar Player magazine. The song centered itself on a main guitar riff in the time signature 7/16, played over a rhythm section centered in 4/4. Each following section of the song showcased a number of specialized techniques (such as two-handed <b>tapping,</b> whammy <b>bar</b> acrobatics, sweep picking, alternate picking, multi-part harmonies, and odd phrasing) used in angular and exaggerated ways that were unique to the song at the time. Interest from the public eye grew more so when Vai's song [...] "Blue Powder" [...] (a demonstration for the Carvin X100b amplifier) was published in Guitar Player as well, which showed the virtuoso side of Vai's compositional process. Also in 1986, Vai was cast in the blockbuster film Crossroads as the Devil's guitar player [...] "Jack Butler". In the famous [...] "duel scene" [...] between Vai and Ralph Macchio's characters, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts {{with the exception of}} the slide guitar, which was performed by Ry Cooder.|$|R
40|$|Using slide {{presentation}} as a reinforcer {{a simple}} operant was auto-shaped in human subjects. The operant (<b>bar</b> <b>tapping)</b> was established, for most subjects, in an auto-shaping technique where a discriminative stimulus (SD) was available. In this technique a response {{made in the}} presence of SD was immediately reinforced. However, where no response was emitted {{in the presence of}} SD the procedure was recycled, i. e. Chain FT 10 -sec. (darkness) FT 10 -sec. (SD), with no reinforcement delivered. Response-independent schedules (FT 10 -sec.) were used (i) for an analysis of supersitutious responding, and (ii) for a control condition. Responding was not maintained under the non-contingent conditions but was re-established under the response-contingent (training) schedules. The educational implications of auto-shaping are discussed...|$|R
30|$|To {{compare the}} {{resonance}} frequency of bending vibration and that generated by tapping {{a cross section}} mentioned above, free-free bending vibration tests were conducted on the large and small specimens with and without the concentrated mass using the following procedure as shown in Fig.  2. The test bar was suspended by two threads at the nodal positions of free-free vibration corresponding to its first resonance mode, and then the bending vibration was generated by tapping the LR-plane (y-axis, T-direction) and LT-plane (y-axis, R-directions) of the large specimen and the LR-plane of the small specimen (y-axis, T-direction) at one end using the wooden hammer (<b>tapping</b> 2), while <b>bar</b> motion was detected by a microphone {{at the other end}} (microphone placement 2). The signal was processed through the FFT digital signal analyzer to yield high-resolution resonance frequencies.|$|R
