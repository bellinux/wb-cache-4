5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in <b>the</b> <b>set</b> is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> This problem {{does not seem to have}} been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} safety {{meetings}} were scheduled {{in order to}} prevent accidents on <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> One of the items on the agenda was finding the closest hospital to <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> according to make-up effects coordinator John Vulich. Furthermore, several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes, including Manners, David Duchovny, and John Shiban. During one of the days that the show was being prepped, a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> but one escaped. It was eventually found behind Manners' desk. In order to prevent future accidents, the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut.|$|E
5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All contents of <b>the</b> <b>set</b> were housed within a tin case. <b>The</b> <b>set</b> was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, {{after only a}} day on the market, Warner Bros. announced that there were two errors discovered within <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> The first was that the 2.0 audio track on Superman, was instead the 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release instead. <b>The</b> <b>set</b> was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E

5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> that is, an operation which takes {{an element of the}} group and an element of <b>the</b> <b>set</b> and returns an element of <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> Most often, <b>the</b> <b>set</b> is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E

5|$|In number theory, Znám's problem asks {{which sets}} of k {{integers}} have the property that each integer in <b>the</b> <b>set</b> is a proper divisor {{of the product}} of the other integers in <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> plus 1. Znám's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám, who suggested it in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related problem drops the assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znám problem hereafter.|$|E
