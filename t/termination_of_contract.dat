25|$|When the {{employers}} {{were asked about}} the kafala system, 55.8% wanted the system to change. The {{reason for this is}} that {{the employers}} felt that the burden was too high on them. In fact the figure increased to 65% when the employers were informed of the obligation to reimburse the recruitment fees in case of an early <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> by the migrant workers. A large amount of the employers even felt that the migrant workers should not be included in the Lebanese labour code, out of fear of the expansion of these rights to other foreigners like the Syrian or Palestinian refugees.|$|E
25|$|In the new Greater Romania, Theodorian was {{a member}} of the arts {{directorate}} committee within the Arts Ministry in 1923, appointed inspector-general of the theaters some four years later. As such, in 1929 he investigated the conflict between the National Theater and actress Maria Giurgea, who alleged unlawful <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> In parallel, he became a founding member of the Society of Romanian Dramatic Authors (SADR). Created solely by Theodorian's efforts, it fulfilled his dream to give dramatists more social standing, and, on his initiative, offered special prizes specifically for Romanian-themed comedies. These went to Anton Holban, Ion Marin Sadoveanu, and George Mihail Zamfirescu. He served as SADR president in 1923–1926, and again in 1933–1939, being seconded by Ion Al. Vasilescu-Valjean, Mihail Sorbul, and Rebreanu (with Paul Gusty as treasurer and Victor Ion Popa as secretary). He represented the body as a speaker at the funerals of Garabet Ibrăileanu, Petre I. Sturdza, and Eugeniu Botez. He also attended congresses of the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers, promoting Romanian works for an international audience, and playing host to Coolus when the latter visited Buharest in November 1934. His Bujoreștii was translated into Italian by Venere Isopescu, and published in Lanciano by Casa editrice Rocco Carabba.|$|E

2500|$|Despite lasting in {{the serial}} for eight years, {{during his tenure}} in EastEnders, {{producers}} appeared to differ in their opinions of Pete's importance in the programme; some referenced the character's value, while others deemed him disposable and there were several attempts to cull the character. It was revealed in 1987 that Pete was originally only {{intended to be a}} short-term character. Show creator and series producer Julia Smith had considered killing him off in 1986, but she vetoed this idea, ultimately deciding that Pete was too much of an asset to lose. When producer Mike Gibbon took the helm as head of the serial in 1989, he employed writer David Yallop to pen storylines that controversially killed-off various characters in the show. According to Yallop, the decision to axe the characters was dependent of the talent of the actors portraying them. Yallop stated that Pete Beale was among the characters to be killed. The storyline never came to fruition because Gibbon's controversial plots were not sanctioned by the BBC and Yallop's storylines were not used; Yallop sued the BBC for <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> at which time the finer details of the proposed plots were disclosed to the media. Despite this, in 1991, EastEnders storyline editor Andrew Holden described Pete as [...] "almost synonymous" [...] with the programme because he had been there since day one. He added, [...] " [...] carry a lot of history. Original characters are very precious things. [...] has always seen himself as a family man and in the future we see him making a determined effort to put his family back together. Whatever happens he'll always carry a torch for Kathy". According to Holden at that time, Pete was [...] "an untouchable", not in danger of being killed-off.|$|E
