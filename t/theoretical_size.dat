2500|$|The {{development}} of the bluefin trevally larvae after hatching has been briefly described {{in a study of}} changes in the digestive enzymes of the species. The species has depleted its storage of energy from the egg at 3 days old, with a series of transformations including coiling of the gut and fin formation occurring before flexion at 26 days of age. Digestive enzymes active from hatching to 30 days old show an apparent shift from carbohydrate utilisation to protein and lipid utilisation as the larvae grows older. Measurements from juveniles in Hawaii indicate the fish is around 70mm by 100 days and 130mm by 200 days. Otolith data fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth curve shows the species grows to 194mm in its first year, 340mm in the second and 456mm in the third year. It reaches 75cm by 8 years of age and 85cm by 12 years. [...] This model also suggests a growth of 0.45mm/day; while laboratory feeding studies found the fish grow at an average of 0.4mm/day in these confined conditions. The maximum <b>theoretical</b> <b>size</b> indicated from the growth curves is 89.7cm, [...] much less than the 117cm reported as the known maximum size. Juveniles often enter estuaries, however the species is not estuary dependant as breeding is known to occur where no estuaries are present, suggesting the use of these habitats is facultative. The fish move from these shallower inshore waters to deeper reefs as they grow.|$|E

50|$|The Memory Stick PRO, {{introduced}} on January 9, 2003 as a {{joint effort}} between Sony and SanDisk, would be the longer-lasting solution to the space problem. Most devices that use the original Memory Sticks support both the original and PRO sticks since both formats have identical form factors. Some readers that were not compatible could be upgraded to Memory Stick PRO support via a firmware update. Memory Stick PROs have a marginally higher transfer speed and a maximum theoretical capacity of 32 GB, although it appears capacities higher than 4 GB are only available in the PRO Duo form factor. High Speed Memory Stick PROs are available, and newer devices support this high speed mode, allowing for faster file transfers. All Memory Stick PROs larger than 1 GB support this High Speed mode, and High Speed Memory Stick Pros are backwards-compatible with devices that don't support the High Speed mode. High capacity memory Sticks such as the 4 GB versions are expensive compared to other types of flash memory such as SD cards and CompactFlash. According to Sony, the Memory Stick PRO has a maximum <b>theoretical</b> <b>size</b> of 2 TB.|$|E

40|$|Axial-flux {{permanent}} magnet machines are popular and widely used for many applications {{due to their}} attractive features such as light weight, low noise, high torque, robust and higher efficiency {{due to lack of}} field excitation. The main essence {{of this paper is to}} perform slotted and slotless axial-flux {{permanent magnet}} synchronous generator design based on <b>theoretical</b> <b>sizing</b> equations and then finite element analysis is reinforcement in order to get a more reliable and accuracy machine design. A comparative study of machine design and performances over the same rating but different configurations i. e., slotted and slotless are also discussed. And then, finite-element method (FEM) software was made for the slotted stator and slotless stator (AFPMSG) in order to compare their magnetic flux density and efficiency. The AFPMSG topology considered in this paper is a three-phase double-rotor single-stator topology with 16 pole-pairs, 2 kW rated power and 188 rpm rated speed.

40|$|A {{high-pressure}} silicon infiltration {{technique was}} applied to sinter diamond–SiC composites with different diamond crystal sizes. Composite samples were sintered at pressure 8 GPa and temperature 2170 K.

The composite samples have pronounced nanocrystalline structure: the volume-weighted mean crystallite size is 41 – 106 nm for the diamond phase and 17 – 37 nm for the SiC phase. The decrease of diamond crystal size leads to increased dislocation density in the diamond phase, lowers average crystallite sizes in both phases, decreases composite hardness, and improves fracture toughness.

40|$|Abstract Background This article {{deals with}} the <b>theoretical</b> <b>size</b> {{distribution}} (of number of sub-taxa) of a fossil taxon arising from a simple null model of macroevolution. Model New species arise through speciations occurring independently and at random at a fixed probability rate, while extinctions either occur independently and at random (background extinctions) or cataclysmically. In addition new genera are assumed to arise through speciations of a very radical nature, again assumed to occur independently and at random at a fixed probability rate. Conclusion The size distributions of the pioneering genus (following a cataclysm) and of derived genera are determined. Also {{the distribution of the}} number of genera is considered along with a comparison of the probability of a monospecific genus with that of a monogeneric family. </p...|$|E
