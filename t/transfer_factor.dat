5000|$|The {{history of}} {{cellular}} derived <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> {{as a treatment}} effectively ended in the early 1980s. While the research world was initially excited by the discovery of Dr Lawrence {{and the possibility that}} a small molecule could effect the immune system, the concept of small molecules having such profound biologic effect had not been proven. Despite several successes in using <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> to treat human disease and uncover immune effects, one then-prominent researcher was exposed for falsifying data related to his work on <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> and guinea pigs; effectively casting all of <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> science in a negative light. [...] This scandal was followed shortly thereafter by the discovery of the Interleukin-1 alpha molecule and thus attention further shifted towards research on interleukins. By 1973, it was discovered that blood products could harbor viruses such as hepatitis A, indicating that <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> treatments derived from human or cow blood cells had the potential to transmit these diseases. With the eventual discovery of HIV/AIDS as an additional blood-borne disease most researchers viewed a product derived from blood as an unsafe treatment since screening for hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS would not be developed until after 1985. [...] Some studies using <b>transfer</b> <b>factor</b> have been conducted after the discovery of HIV/AIDS, but almost all have been outside of the United States.|$|E
5000|$|To {{communicate}} between cells, {{the immune}} system employs hormone-like signal substances; <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> are one class of such immune system communication substances. <b>Transfer</b> <b>factors</b> include both inducer/helper functions (Inducer Factors) and regulator functions (Regulator Factors)—historically called [...] "suppressor functions". The Inducer Factors translate an apparently mature immune response from the donor to the recipient. Regulator Factors help control overreactions and limit allergies and autoimmune conditions. <b>Transfer</b> <b>factors</b> {{have been shown to}} induce an immune response in less than 24 hours. <b>Transfer</b> <b>factors</b> are not species-specific, thus <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> produced by a cow's immune system are just as effective in humans as they are in the cow.|$|R

The first cultivation was made three years after soil contamination and plants were grown during 3 successive years. The plant-soil (CS) -C- 137 <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> varied maximally 12 -fold among soils and 35 -fold among species when grown on the same soil. Single correlations between <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> and soil properties were found, but they varied widely with plant type and can hardly {{be used as a}} predictive tool because of the few soils used. The variation of (CS) -C- 137 concentrations in plants among soils was related to differences in soil solution Cs- 137 and K concentrations, consistent with previous observations in hydroponics and pot trials. Absolute values of <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> could not be predicted based on a model validated for pot trials. The Cs- 137 activity concentration in soil solution decreased significantly (11 - to 250 -fold) for most soils in the 1997 - 1999 period and is partly explained by decreasing K in soil solution. <b>Transfer</b> <b>factors</b> of lettuce showed both increasing and decreasing trends between 2 consecutive years depending on soil type. The trends could be explained by the variation in Cs- 137 and K concentrations in soil solution. It is concluded that differences in (CS) -C- 137 <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> among soils and trends in <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> as a function of time can be explained from soil solution composition, as shown previously for pot trials, although absolute values of <b>transfer</b> <b>factors</b> could not be predicted.
