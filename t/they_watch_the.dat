5|$|In the Time Room, Prismo reveals to Jake that Finn {{has been}} transported to a separate, altered world {{based on his}} wish that The Lich never existed. Together, <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> events in Finn's world on Prismo's television, and Prismo asks Jake what {{he would like to}} wish for. Jake wishes for a sandwich, but Prismo urges him to {{consider}} using his wish on something important, such as helping Finn. Jake tells Prismo he will use it when he knows Finn will be in real danger, and after a conversation, the two decide to hang out; Prismo mutes the TV and the two begin to ignore the events happening in Finn's timeline.|$|E
5|$|Jenny {{spends her}} final days putting {{together}} a film of memories for Bette and Tina. The film contains friends past and present sharing their best moments. During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It is assumed that she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing. As <b>they</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>the</b> Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence in the control room. Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking of loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} bris arrives, and Kyle is {{grounded}} for sending Ike away. When the mohel arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in distress and some old pictures prompts {{a change of heart}} in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is explained to him what a circumcision actually is, at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. <b>They</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> same episodes all the time, while Lisa {{says that the}} Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment is a joke about the construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects {{support the idea of}} this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure to food {{commercials}} {{is assumed}} to be related to children's food preferences and snack food intake patterns. However, surprisingly few studies tested whether watching food commercials actually leads to elevated snack food intake. OBJECTIVE: We experimentally tested the side effects of television food commercials on concurrent nonadvertised sweet snack food intake in young children aged 8 - 12 y. DESIGN: The children (n = 120) watched a movie interrupted by 2 commercial breaks that contained either food commercials or neutral commercials. While <b>watching,</b> <b>the</b> children could freely eat palatable food. Afterward, they filled out questionnaires and were weighed and measured. RESULTS: The main finding of our study was the interaction between commercial type and sex of the child. Food intake in boys was higher when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> food commercials than when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> neutral commercials, whereas food intake in girls was slightly lower when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> food commercials than when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> neutral commercials. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that boys are susceptible to food cues in commercials...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to food {{commercials}} {{on television}} {{is considered to}} be related to elevated snack food intake in front of the television. However, this assumed relation has as yet not been fully established. The present study, therefore examined the direct effects of watching television food commercials on concurrent non-advertised snack food intake in young adults. In addition, possible sex differences were investigated. Participants (N = 82, 50 % male) watched a movie interrupted by two commercial breaks that contained either food commercials or neutral commercials. While <b>watching,</b> <b>they</b> could freely eat crisps and chocolate coated peanuts. Afterwards, participants filled out questionnaires and were weighed and measured. Regression analyses showed that men and women were differently affected by the food commercials. Food intake in women was higher when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> food commercials than when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> neutral commercials, whereas food intake in men was lower when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> food commercials than when <b>they</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> neutral commercials. The results suggest that especially women are vulnerable for eating more snack food when exposed to food commercials...|$|R

25|$|After lunch all {{the youth}} of the city {{go out into the}} fields {{to take part in a}} ball game. The {{students}} of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.|$|E
25|$|After {{each country}} has rehearsed, the {{delegation}} meets with the show's artistic {{director in the}} video viewing room. Here, <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> footage of the rehearsal just performed. At this point the Head of Delegation may make known any special requirements needed for the performance, and request them from the host broadcaster. Following this meeting, the delegation hold a press conference where members of the accredited press may pose them questions. The rehearsals and press conferences are held in parallel; so one country holds its press conference, while the next one is in the auditorium rehearsing. A printed summary of the questions and answers which emerge from the press conferences is produced by the host press office, and distributed to journalists' pigeon-holes.|$|E
25|$|As evening comes, Michael tells Ted that The Passion of Saint Tibulus {{was more}} {{successful}} for him than even Jurassic Park. Ted decides to give up, but finds Dougal doesn't have the handcuff key, {{and they are}} forced to walk home still handcuffed to the railing. Back at the house, Brennan scolds them as they have caused the film to become so popular that people are arriving from all over Ireland and Europe to see it. As punishment, Brennan plans to reassign them all to locations worst than Craggy Island, and then leaves. Ted and Dougal lament their fate, but Jack shows them the video cassette, which has a video of Brennan in California with his secret mistress and his son. Ted realises he can use this tape for blackmail and force Brennan to change his mind, and joins the other two as <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> tape a few more times.|$|E

25|$|As {{children}} grow older they slowly grow into their roles within their society. Both genders learn from adults {{how to do}} certain things that later will help the tribe. For example, girls learn how to make doll clothing, which teaches them how to make real garments. Boys, on the other hand, are given miniature bows for them to practice hunting very small game with. Children at young ages are integrated into society evenly. They are given small tasks based on their age to follow. Boys practice hunting and follow men on some hunting events. Having little boys follow the men into hunting events lets them learn firsthand how to hunt, receive tips on what to do while hunting, and gain experience for when they do events when they are older. Girls learn the same way. <b>They</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> women of the society do their daily routines and mimic them on smaller scales. Like the example given above with the doll making. Having a little girl make the clothes for themselves teaches them how to make clothing they would want in the future.|$|E
25|$|At a truck stop, Pee-wee discovers {{his wallet}} is missing and pays for his meal by washing dishes. He befriends Simone, a {{waitress}} who dreams of visiting Paris. As <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> sunrise at a dinosaur museum, Pee-wee encourages her {{to follow her}} dreams, but Simone tells him about her jealous and large boyfriend, Andy, who disapproves. Andy arrives and tries to attack Pee-wee, who escapes onto a moving train and meets Hobo Jack. Pee-wee eventually arrives at the Alamo, but learns {{at the end of}} a guided tour that the building does not have a basement. At a bus station, Pee-wee encounters Simone, who tells him that she and Andy broke up and she is on her way to Paris. She tells Pee-wee not to give up finding his bike. Pee-wee calls Dottie at the bike shop and apologizes for his behavior. Andy spots Pee-wee and resumes his attack. Pee-wee evades Andy at a rodeo by disguising himself as a rodeo bull rider. Forced to ride for real, Pee-wee does well but receives a concussion.|$|E
25|$|The Lords Chamber is {{the site}} of nationally {{televised}} ceremonies, the most important of which is the State Opening of Parliament, which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session, either after a General Election or in the autumn. At this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented: the Crown (both literally, and figuratively in the person of the Sovereign), The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Commons, (who together form the Legislature), the Judiciary (although no judges are members of either House of Parliament), and the Executive (both Government Ministers, and ceremonial military units in attendance on the Sovereign); and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large Royal Gallery immediately outside the Chamber. The Sovereign, seated on the Throne, delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the Government's programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session. The Commons may not enter the Lords' debating floor; instead, <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> proceedings from beyond the Bar of the House, just inside the door. A small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session, when the Sovereign is merely represented by a group of Lords Commissioners.|$|E

500|$|As <b>they</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>the</b> {{hotel is}} {{revealed}} {{to be part of}} a large simulation; the Doctor identifies themselves aboard an automated prison spaceship, and the beast as a relative of the Nimon, a creature that feeds off the faith of others. The ship's automated systems had provided it [...] "food" [...] by bringing aboard creatures who had a strong faith. The beast mutters that [...] "death would be a gift" [...] for the Doctor before it passes away. The Doctor finds his TARDIS nearby, Gibbis asks for a lift home and the Doctor then takes Amy and Rory to London, believing it best for the two to stop travelling with him before they end up getting killed. Giving them a new house and car, the Doctor sets off alone in the TARDIS.|$|E
500|$|The writing {{staff was}} {{looking for a way to}} end the episode and {{executive}} producer Sam Simon suggested that <b>they</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> film The Quiet Man. The writers came in on a Saturday to watch the film together. They were inspired by the film's fight scene between John Wayne and Victor McLaglen's characters to do a fight scene between Homer and Tom in the episode. The scene was difficult for the producers to sound-mix because they wanted it to be funny but not horrifying. They discovered that the more realistic the effects used sounded, the funnier the scene became. The producers tried all sorts of different sounds for when Homer cracks his back on the fire hydrant and chose the tiniest realistic sound, because they believed that it was the most painful and [...] "hilarious".|$|E
