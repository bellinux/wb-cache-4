An additional storey was added around 1864-5. In 1909, the 2nd Duke of Westminster ordered major refurbishments and the expansion of a three-storey wing. He moved out of Grosvenor House in 1916 into <b>this,</b> <b>where</b> he stayed until his death in 1953.|$|E

Also in each case, the applicant is allowed 3 test shots to familiarize with the particular firearm used for the test. The shotgun is an exception to <b>this,</b> <b>where</b> only one round is allowed as a test shot.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} skilled nature {{required}} for playing the agung, {{it is not uncommon}} to see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance, using tricks in an attempt to throw others off-beat. For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals has a hard time ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed, becoming the butt of jokes. Normally agung players switch off after each piece, but during instances like <b>this</b> <b>where</b> one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody, employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.|$|E

25|$|The Austrian {{university}} system had been open to any student who passed the Matura examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed {{the introduction of}} entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee ("Studienbeitrag") of €363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. There are some non-state exceptions to <b>this,</b> <b>where</b> students can still study for a subsidized education, for example within the campus system of the English Teacher Training College. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, {{as long as a}} certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance). When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around €363.36 per term is charged. Some further exceptions to the fee apply, e.g. for students with a year's salary of more than about €5000. In all cases, an obligatory fee of €17 is charged for the student union and insurance.|$|E

Ben Brantley of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Mr. Sarsgaard... emerges as an actor to watch with a performance of breathtaking emotional conviction." [...] The following year he starred in Kingdom of Earth opposite Cynthia Nixon and directed by John Cameron Mitchell. His performance in the play received favorable reviews amongst critics. In October 2002, Sarsgaard returned to theater in a New York production of Lanford Wilson's Burn <b>This,</b> <b>where</b> he replaced Edward Norton.|$|E
500|$|One famous {{dance that}} is well known is called the Tinikling, where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles.

The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other. The Muslim version of <b>this</b> <b>where</b> bamboo poles are also used is called the Singkil.

Law believed so much in Conran's movie that {{he became one of}} the producers and used his clout to get Paltrow involved. Once she had been suggested for the role, Law did not remember [...] "any other name coming up. It just seems that she was perfect. She was as enthusiastic about the script and about the visual references that were sort of put to her, and jumped on board." [...] Paltrow said in an interview, [...] "I thought that this is the time to do a movie like <b>this</b> <b>where</b> it's kind of breaking into new territory and it's not your basic formulaic action-adventure movie." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast {{to feel as if}} all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to <b>this</b> , <b>where</b> Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E

500|$|Hidden {{behind his}} wall, Pink becomes {{severely}} depressed. In {{order to get}} him to perform, a doctor medicates him. This results in a hallucinatory on-stage performance where he believes that he is a fascist dictator performing at concerts similar to Neo-Nazi rallies, at which he sets brownshirts-like men on fans he considers unworthy. [...] Upon realizing the horror of what he has done, Pink becomes overwhelmed and wishes for everything around him to cease. Showing human emotion, he is tormented with guilt and places himself on trial, his inner judge ordering him to [...] "tear down the wall", opening Pink to the outside world. The album turns full circle with its closing words [...] "Isn't <b>this</b> <b>where</b> ...", the first words of the phrase that begins the album, [...] "... we came in?", with a continuation of the melody of the last song hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters' theme.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{observed}} that Justice Kennedy's majority opinion [...] "embraced Bustamonte's premise that when police request consent to search, the request itself carries the implication that an alternative of refusal exists". Other scholars, such as Ric Simmons, have noted that Drayton reflects [...] "the Court at the midpoint of this evolution, moving from a subjective binary test that focuses {{on whether or not}} the subject acted voluntarily, to a more nuanced objective test that focuses on the amount of compulsion used by the law enforcement officer". Additionally, Matthew Phillips wrote that Drayton [...] "illustrates the metamorphosis of the totality-of-the-circumstances test into a purely objective test" [...] because Justice Kennedy's opinion [...] "did not explicitly consider any subjective factors" [...] with respect to whether Drayton and Brown felt they could deny consent when questioned by the police. Phillips suggested that the decision to abandon subjective factors could lead to [...] "bizarre results" [...] in cases, like <b>this,</b> <b>where</b> [...] "circumstances of the search indicate at least some level of coercion".|$|E
500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like <b>this,</b> <b>where</b> ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E
