National worship services were organised (a thing <b>that</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> before), and since then they are held yearly in different regions of the republic.|$|E

Architecture firm Hornblower & Marshall designed the mortuary chapel, which included marble laurel wreaths and a neo-classical design. Smithson was entombed on 6 March 1905. His casket, which had been held in the Regent's Room, was placed into the ground underneath the crypt.

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} patent, Ritty became {{overwhelmed}} with {{the responsibilities of}} running two businesses, so he sold all of his interests in the cash register business to Jacob H. Eckert of Cincinnati, a china and glassware salesman, who formed the National Manufacturing Company. In 1884 Eckert sold the company to John H. Patterson, who renamed the company the National Cash Register Company and improved the cash register by adding a paper roll to record sales transactions, thereby creating the journal for internal bookkeeping purposes, and the receipt for external bookkeeping purposes. The original purpose of the receipt was enhanced fraud protection. The business owner could read the receipts to ensure that cashiers charged customers the correct amount for each transaction and did not embezzle the cash drawer. It also prevents a customer from defrauding the business by falsely claiming receipt of a lesser amount of change or a transaction <b>that</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> in the first place. The first evidence of an actual cash register was used in Coalton, Ohio, at the old mining company.|$|E

25|$|The brief {{conflict}} between Malacca and Lê Dynasty of Annam, began {{shortly after the}} 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, then already a Muslim kingdom. The Chinese government, without knowing about the event, sent a censor Ch'en Chun to Champa in 1474 to install the Champa King, but he discovered Vietnamese soldiers had taken over Champa and were blocking his entry. He proceeded to Malacca instead and its ruler sent back tribute to China. In 1469, Malaccan envoys on their return from China was attacked by the Vietnamese who castrated the young and enslaved them. In view of Lê Dynasty's position as a protectorate to China, Malacca abstained from any act of retaliation. Instead, Malacca sent envoys to China in 1481 {{to report on the}} Vietnamese aggression and their invasion plan against Malacca, as well as to confront the Vietnamese envoys who happened to be present in the Ming court. However, the Chinese informed that since the incident was years old, they could do nothing about it, and the Emperor {{sent a letter to the}} Vietnamese ruler reproaching him for the incident. The Chinese Emperor also granted permission for Malacca to retaliate with violent force should the Vietnamese attack, an event <b>that</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> again after that.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} {{by-product of}} the Gregorian mission was the close relationship it fostered between the Anglo-Saxon Church and the Roman Church. Although Gregory had {{intended for the}} southern archiepiscopal see to be located at London, <b>that</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> A later tradition, dating from 797, when {{an attempt was made}} to move the archbishopric from Canterbury to London by King Coenwulf of Mercia, stated that on the death of Augustine, the [...] "wise men" [...] of the Anglo-Saxons met and decided that the see should remain at Canterbury, for that was where Augustine had preached. The idea that an archbishop needed a pallium in order to exercise his archiepiscopal authority derives from the Gregorian mission, which established the custom at Canterbury from where it was spread to the Continent by later Anglo-Saxon missionaries such as Willibrord and Boniface. The close ties between the Anglo-Saxon church and Rome were strengthened later in the 7th century when Theodore of Tarsus was appointed to Canterbury by the papacy.|$|E

An anonymous {{review in}} the Batavia-based Doenia Film praised the film's picture (especially its colour) and both Krohn and Boekebinder's acting.

However, the review criticised the censorship bureau's failure to catch scenes of Frederick drinking alcohol, which the reviewer found [...] "dangerous to the prestige [...] " [...] considering the large native audiences. Kwee Tek Hoay, writing in Panorama, criticised the film extensively, writing that it seemed meant exclusively for Dutch audiences in the Netherlands, as those living in the Indies would {{be able to see it}} did not reflect reality and was in places illogical.
