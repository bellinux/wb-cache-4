5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} <b>their</b> <b>strategy</b> in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for {{one side or the}} player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E
5|$|In the Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task (DCCS), {{children}} are initially asked to sort cards {{by a single}} dimension (such as color), and are subsequently required to alter <b>their</b> <b>strategy</b> to sort cards based on a second dimension (such as shape). Typically, three-year-old {{children are}} able to sort cards based on a single dimension, but are unable to switch to sort the cards based on a second dimension. However, five-year-old children are able to sort cards based on one dimension and can then switch to sorting cards on a second dimension.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August {{the three}} Allied commanders– Marlborough, Baden and Eugene– met to decide <b>their</b> <b>strategy.</b> To give {{themselves}} another major crossing over the Danube a plan by Baden to besiege {{the city of}} Ingolstadt with a force of 15,000 men was agreed to, despite leaving the Allied army numerically inferior. This army, totalling 52,000 men and now without the commander who led the Imperial troops on the Schellenberg, would meet the Franco-Bavarian forces, numbering 56,000 men, {{in and around the}} small village of Blindheim. The engagement, fought on 13 August 1704, would become known in German as the Battle of Höchstädt, and in English, as the Battle of Blenheim.|$|E

5|$|The German plan {{of attack}} was {{influenced}} by their army's experiences during the Battle of France. <b>Their</b> <b>strategy</b> {{was to create a}} diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus, possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.|$|E

5|$|After the engagement, the Allies {{received}} news of {{the defeat}} of the Allied army at Thermopylae. Since <b>their</b> <b>strategy</b> required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, and given their losses, the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and captured the now-evacuated Athens. However, seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, the Persians were later defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Fearing being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. The following year, however, saw an Allied army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea, thereby ending the Persian invasion.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} peace conference {{was held in}} Kano in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habré, and Goukouni. The Kano Accord was signed on 16 March by all those present, and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni. This {{was a result of}} Nigerian and French pressures on Goukouni and Habré to share power; the French in particular saw this as part of <b>their</b> <b>strategy</b> to cut all ties between Goukouni and Gaddafi. A few weeks later, the same factions formed the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.|$|E

Believing the bulk of the US X Corps would move to rescue the destroyed units, the 9th Army would then block and trap the main UN forces on the road between Hagaru-ri and Hungnam. The 9th Army initially committed eight divisions for the battle, with most of the forces concentrated at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Batch {{signature}} verification detects whether {{a batch of}} signatures contains any forgeries. Batch forgery identification pinpoints the location of each forgery. Existing forgery-identification schemes vary in <b>their</b> <b>strategies</b> for selecting subbatches to verify (individual checks, binary search, combinatorial designs, etc.) and in <b>their</b> <b>strategies</b> for verifying subbatches.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an evolutionary model, {{based on the}} assumption that agents may revise <b>their</b> current <b>strategies</b> if they previously failed to attain the maximum level of potential payoffs. We offer three versions of this reflexive mechanism, each one of which describes a distinct type: spontaneous agents, rigid players, and ‘satisficers’. We use simulations to examine the performance of these types. Agents who change <b>their</b> <b>strategies</b> relatively easily tend to perform better in coordination games, but antagonistic games generally lead to more favorable outcomes if the individuals only change <b>their</b> <b>strategies</b> when disappointment from previous rounds surpasses some predefined threshold...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} August, the {{mobilization}} of the fleet was complete; Kaiser Karl VI {{was assigned to the}} Cruiser Flotilla, which was commanded by Vice Admiral Paul Fiedler. For most of the war, the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though the armored cruisers were too slow to operate with the newer s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations. In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Central Powers. The Austro-Hungarians continued <b>their</b> <b>strategy</b> of serving as a fleet in being, which would tie down the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought.|$|E

5|$|George Steinbrenner {{bought the}} club in 1973 and {{regularly}} invested in new talent, using free agency to acquire top players.

Despite clubhouse disputes, the team reached the World Series four times between 1976 and 1981 and claimed the championship in 1977 and 1978. New York continued to pursue <b>their</b> <b>strategy</b> of signing free agents into the 1980s, but with less success, and the team eventually sank into mediocrity after 1981. In the early 1990s, the team began to improve as their roster was rebuilt around young players from their minor league system, including Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. After earning a playoff berth in 1995, the Yankees won four of the next five World Series, and the 1998–2000 teams were the last in MLB to win three straight Series titles.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 3634 (Often {{shortened}} to GJ 3634) is a {{red dwarf}} star in the Hydra constellation. One planet has been discovered in its orbit, Gliese 3634 b. GJ 3634 is under half the mass {{and size of the}} Sun, and is estimated to be at least a billion years younger, and lies near to Earth, with a distance of 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light years). It was targeted by astronomers during an over six-year survey of red dwarfs. The astronomers had recently changed <b>their</b> <b>strategy</b> to search for planets with extremely short orbits so they could narrow down candidates that transited, or crossed in front of, their host stars as seen from the Earth. The Super-Earth GJ 3634 b was the first planet discovered using this new strategy. The planet was confirmed using Doppler spectroscopy, or the observation and extrapolation of data from a recorded Doppler effect in the star's light, but later observations found no transiting pattern. The planet was published by its discoverers on February 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 b (commonly {{shortened}} to GJ 3634 b) is a super-Earth exoplanet in {{the orbit}} of the nearby red dwarf Gliese 3634 at approximately 64.5 light-years in constellation Hydra. The planet is approximately eight times the mass of Earth, and orbits its star every {{two and a half}} days at a distance of 0.0287 AU. The planet was the first to be discovered by a group of astronomers searching for exoplanets in {{the orbit of}} very-low-mass stars after the team reorganized <b>their</b> <b>strategy,</b> choosing to search for targets that they could also confirm using the transit method. However, a transit event associated with Gliese 3634 b was not detected. The planet's discovery was published in Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to {{reassess}} <b>their</b> <b>strategy.</b> They got that time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E

5|$|The battle caused massive {{casualties}} {{for both}} sides. By {{the end of}} the fight, 4th North Korean Division had been completely destroyed, with only 300 or 400 men in each of its regiments. Of its original 7,000 men, the regiment now had a strength of only 3,500, having suffered over 1,200 killed. Several thousand {{of the members of the}} division deserted during the fight. Most of these men were South Korean civilians forcibly conscripted into the North Korean army. 4th Division would not recover until much later in the war. The battle represented a new phase in the war for the North Koreans. Their numerical superiority was gone, and <b>their</b> <b>strategy</b> of attacking supply lines and rear formations of US units was no longer effective without overwhelming numbers. Additionally, the advantage the T-34 tank had once provided was also gone; American units were now well equipped with effective anti-tank weapons, as well as larger numbers of tanks of their own. Subsequently, all 4th Division's T-34s were quickly knocked out before they could inflict much damage.|$|E
5|$|The game's success, {{which went}} against what Square Enix assumed would happen {{due to the}} title's {{identity}} as a traditional role-playing game, prompted them to reconsider <b>their</b> <b>strategy</b> for game making, which {{up to that point}} had been geared towards developing titles tailored for western markets rather than focusing on the Japanese market. According to the developers, none of them believed that the game would be released overseas, and were overwhelmed by the positive fan feedback they had received. A manga titled Bravely Default: Flying Fairy began serialization online through Famitsu. Two compilation volumes were released in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Two supplementary books, released under the title Bravely Default: The Pocketbook of R, were released in December 2013. In addition to this, two drama CDs containing supplementary stories were released through 2013 and 2014. Music from the game was featured Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as DLC.|$|E
5|$|Thơ {{turned against}} Diệm {{and played a}} passive role in the coup. Upon the {{formation}} of the new government, he struggled to keep the nation under control as the MRC and civilian cabinet often gave contradictory orders. Media freedom and political debate were increased, but this backfired as Saigon became engulfed in infighting, and Thơ had a series of newspapers shut down after they used the new-found freedom to attack him. During that time, South Vietnam's military situation deteriorated as the consequences of Diệm's falsification of military statistics and the misguided policies that resulted were exposed. Minh and Thơ had a plan to try to end the war by winning over non-communist members of the insurgency, believing that they constituted the majority of the opposition and could be coaxed away, weakening the communists. As part of this policy, which the U.S. opposed, the government chose to take a low-key military approach in an attempt to portray themselves to the Vietnamese public as peacemakers. However, they were deposed in Khánh's U.S.-backed coup before they could pursue <b>their</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E
