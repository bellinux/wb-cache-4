2500|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol use on {{gasoline}} prices {{is the source}} of conflicting opinion from economic studies, further complicated by the non-market forces of tax credits, met and unmet government quotas, and the dramatic recent increase in domestic oil production. [...] According to a 2012 Massachusetts Institute of <b>Technology</b> <b>analysis,</b> ethanol, and biofuel in general, does not materially influence the price of gasoline, while a runup in the price of government mandated Renewable Identification Number credits has driven up the price of gasoline. [...] These in contrast to a May, 2012, Center for Agricultural and Rural Development study which showed a $0.29 to $1.09 reduction in per gallon gasoline price from ethanol use.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the use of}} prediction-enabled component technology (PECT) {{as a means of}} packaging predictable assembly as a deployable product. A PECT results from integrating a component technology with one or more <b>analysis</b> <b>technologies.</b> <b>Analysis</b> <b>technologies</b> allow <b>analysis</b> and prediction of assembly-level properties prior to component assembly, and, presumably, prior to component acquisition. <b>Analysis</b> <b>technologies</b> also identify required component properties and their certifiable descriptions. This report {{describes the}} major structures of a PECT. It then discusses the means of validating the predictive powers of a PECT so that consumers may obtain measurably bounded trust in design-time predictions. Last, it demonstrates the above concepts in a simple but illustrative model problem: predicting average end-to-end latency of a soft real-time application built from off-the-shelf software components...|$|R
