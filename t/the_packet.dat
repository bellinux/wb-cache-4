5|$|Network {{forensics}} {{is concerned}} with the monitoring and analysis of computer network traffic, both local and WAN/internet, for the purposes of information gathering, evidence collection, or intrusion detection. Traffic is usually intercepted at <b>the</b> <b>packet</b> level, and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real-time. Unlike other areas of digital forensics network data is often volatile and rarely logged, making the discipline often reactionary.|$|E
5|$|Synchronization Pattern: A USB packet {{begins with}} an 8-bit {{synchronization}} sequence, 00000001₂. That is, after the initial idle state J, the data lines toggle KJKJKJKK.

5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if <b>the</b> <b>packet</b> was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E
5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid.

30|$|Second, <b>the</b> data <b>packet</b> {{exchange}} is initiated {{immediately after the}} SV comparison in the first step. Once the node in the first step, i.e., node B, determines <b>the</b> different <b>packets,</b> it can send a request to node A for <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> it has not received, and send to node A <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> which node A has not received.

30|$|The DeNB {{also serves}} the regular LTE-A traffic such as voice and video UEs. The DeNB {{takes into account}} the source of <b>the</b> {{incoming}} <b>packets.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> are received from a standalone LTE-A user, then the PDCP of <b>the</b> DeNB forwards <b>packets</b> to <b>the</b> GTP for tunneling. After tunneling, <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> are routed towards the access gateway (aGW). On the other hand, if <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> are received from the RN, <b>the</b> data <b>packets</b> are sent to the GTP via IP and UDP for de-multiplexing. Later, <b>the</b> original standalone <b>packets</b> are sent to the aGW. Similarly, in downlink, the DeNB GTP recognizes the source and destination identities (IDs) of <b>the</b> incoming <b>packets.</b> If <b>the</b> destination ID of incoming packet belongs to an RN, then <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> belong to a user which is served by the RN. On <b>the</b> other hand, <b>packets</b> belong to a user which is directly served by the DeNB.

Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at <b>the</b> <b>packet</b> level. It can block ActiveX controls and Java applets. Other functionalities include cookie removal, and banner ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics {{that were not}} ads, breaking pages. Adjusting the settings fixed the problem, however the process was complicated. ZDNet noted {{the lack of information}} presented concerning attacks the firewall blocked.

5|$|Amazon {{went on to}} join Nelson in {{the chase}} to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign. During the voyage across the Atlantic, Nelson wanted to pass on {{specific}} instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French, but {{did not want to}} lose time by ordering his ships to heave to. Instead he gave the plans to Parker, who was described by Pulteney Malcolm as the 'best frigate captain in the service', and Parker sped along the line in Amazon, delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost 'hardly a yard of ground'. Once more in European waters after the fleet's return, Amazon captured the Spanish privateer Principe de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805. Principe was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and four swivels. Her crew of 160 men, under the command of Captain François Beck, were principally French. She had been out five weeks and had captured <b>the</b> <b>packet</b> Prince of Wales from Lisbon, and the letter of marque Lady Nelson, which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow. A number of Lady Nelsons crew were aboard Principe, as was a considerable amount of specie.|$|E

30|$|The data {{delivery}} in HH-MIP {{is similar to}} that in ROMIP as explained in the following. Initially <b>the</b> CN sends <b>packets</b> to <b>the</b> home address of destined MH, the HA intercepts and sends <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> to <b>the</b> THA by tunneling, and the THA tunnels <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> to <b>the</b> current location (FA) of MH. Meanwhile, a binding copy of the MH's THA is sent by the HA to CN so that later packets can be directly delivered to the THA, and the THA tunnels <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> to <b>the</b> current location (FA) of MH. Therefore, regular data {{delivery in}} HH-MIP requires <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> sent by <b>the</b> CN to be tunneled twice before they reach the destined MH.|$|R

5|$|At the {{transport}} layer, most communication adopts either the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is used {{when it is}} essential every message sent is received by the other computer whereas UDP is used when it is merely desirable. With TCP, packets are retransmitted if they are lost and placed in order before they are presented to higher layers. With UDP, packets are not ordered or retransmitted if lost. Both TCP and UDP packets carry port numbers with them to specify what application or process <b>the</b> <b>packet</b> should be handled by. Because certain application-level protocols use certain ports, network administrators can manipulate traffic to suit particular requirements. Examples are to restrict Internet access by blocking the traffic destined for a particular port or to affect the performance of certain applications by assigning priority.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes the contents of <b>the</b> <b>packet.</b> Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Hillary {{moved to}} the Isle of Man in 1808. Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a {{national}} lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, {{with the help of}} Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded in 1824. At the age of 60, Sir William took part in the 1830 rescue of <b>the</b> <b>packet</b> St George, which had foundered on Conister Rock at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. He commanded the lifeboat and was washed overboard with others of the lifeboat crew, yet finally everyone aboard the St George was rescued with no loss of life. It was this incident which prompted Sir William to set up a scheme to build The Tower of Refuge on Conister Rock – a project completed in 1832 which stands to this day at the entrance to Douglas Harbour. In 1854 the institution's name changed to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (in 1849 Prince Albert had added his support to the Institution) and the first of the new lifeboats to be built was stationed at Douglas in recognition of the work of Sir William.|$|E

Router1 has a route for this network (192.168.1.0/24) so router1 will forward <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> to router3, which will deliver <b>the</b> <b>packets</b> to PC3; reply <b>packets</b> will follow <b>the</b> same route to PC2.|$|R
25|$|Rarely {{used because}} of its {{outdated}} nature, window scanning is fairly untrustworthy in determining whether a port is opened or closed.
