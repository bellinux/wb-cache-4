Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E

Colbert, chose the word truthiness just moments before taping the premiere episode of The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – [...] "truth" [...] – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: [...] "We're {{not talking about}} truth, we're {{talking about something that}} seems like truth – the truth we want to exist", he explained. He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: [...] "Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> is or isn't true.

[...] Manson suggested calling guitarists Duke Erikson and Steve Marker {{to get together and}} write some songs. One week later, the group informally convened in Los Angeles, where they laughed, drank, and reminisced of the old days, leaving behind the tensions among them and general weariness that was partly responsible for their 2005 breakup; they set up their equipment and [...] "started fucking around." [...] "We were all pleased to notice on the first day there just didn't seem to be any personal tensions," [...] Vig recalled. [...] "Enough time had passed that any sort of weirdness or tension that had risen between us all had dissipated. So it was easy. There was no one <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> to do. We weren't signed to a label. We were between managers. So we made this on our own terms." [...] In that session, the group wrote the song [...] "Battle In Me".|$|E

[...] Ambrose made the remarks after Dryden commented on a poll that analyzed child care choices by Canadian families. Dryden won generally favourable reviews for his performance in Cabinet.|$|E

2500|$|Their first {{headlining}} tour, The Work Tour, had 27 dates. McFly's Dougie Poynter, Sandford's boyfriend played bass guitar during [...] "Just Can't Get Enough". White tripped on some wires back {{stage and}} had a foot injury, she remained seated on stage for some shows. In 2008 and 2009 the Saturdays appeared in adverts for several products including a brand of deodorant, tampons, mobile phones, an operating system, and hair removal products. The band was named as models for hair removal product, Veet. The band later became new faces of major campaign of Impulse women's deodorant. The Saturdays said that fashion is {{a huge part of}} the band, saying people look up to them as their icons. Sandford stated in an interview with Mail Online [...] "'We aren't models who can't sing. We all sing and we all dance. No one's <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> to do. We're all different because we're just ourselves – and that's the way it should be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matt Fowler said [...] "O Biclops, Where Art Thou?" [...] {{was another}} [...] "mostly flat" [...] episode and that {{while a few}} jokes connect, most are obvious and infantile. Fowler also said he was growing tired of Kröd's {{constant}} prudishness around sexual norm-breakers, and that the Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce characters are growing unnecessary because, [...] "not every joke needs to have {{each member of the}} gang chime in with a comment <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the joke is." [...] However, Fowler said he enjoyed the subplot with Dongalor and his unnamed girlfriend, and said Lucas and McQueen work very well together. Doug Knoop of The Seattle Times, however, singled this episode out as {{one of the main reasons}} he liked the series: [...] "It may not be to everyone's taste, but in last week's episode when (Krod) and his band of warriors ended up in a hot tub with a Cyclops, I knew this new outrageous parody series had found a place in my heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Party {{insiders}} {{suggested that}} Ignatieff {{would have to}} secure at least 35% of the delegates elected on [...] "Super Weekend" [...] to avoid being overtaken in subsequent ballots. Although he won the most delegates overall on that weekend, he did not reach the 35% target. An anonymous source speculated to the BBC that Ignatieff's 30-year absence from Canada and his initial support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq played against him in the election. Patrick Gossage, a Toronto political consultant and Ignatieff supporter, explained his eventual loss this way: [...] "There were people saying, 'Who is this <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> he's {{going to do with}} the party?' Even though he was supported by the party establishment he nevertheless was an outsider, and he never successfully dealt with the labels the media put on him that he'd been away for 30 years." [...] Lauren P. S. Epstein, the former prime minister of the Harvard Canadian Club, said: “What it came down to in the final vote was that the Liberal delegates were looking for someone who was more likely to unite the party; Ignatieff had ardent supporters, but at the same time, he had people who would never under any circumstances support him.” Running second in many polls but with strong second choice support, Bob Rae looked like the most likely candidate to capitalize on Ignatieff's second ballot weakness. However, critics cited Rae's turbulent tenure as Ontario Premier in the early to mid 1990s, arguing that electoral success in Ontario was essential for forming government.|$|E
