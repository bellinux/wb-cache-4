5|$|No one {{familiar}} with <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> can deny that congressional committees are useful. It {{is necessary to}} investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember {{that we are not}} descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> there were {{distinctive}} socioeconomic stratification among women as there has been among men for centuries. This deepened the inequality between the upper/middle and lower/working classes. Prior to the feminist movement, the socioeconomic status of a family was based almost solely on the husband/father's occupation. Women who were now attaining high status jobs were attractive partners to men with high status jobs, so the high earners married the high earners and the low earners married the low earners. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same, and have had increased difficulty competing in the economy.|$|E
2500|$|.....by far {{the most}} Radical measure of my lifetime. I do not object to the {{principle}} of graduated taxation: for the just principle of ability to pay is not determined simply by the amount of income.... But, so far as I understand the present measure of finance from the partial reports I have received, I find it too violent. It involves a great departure from the methods of political action established in this country, where reforms, and especially financial reforms, have always been considerate and even tender.... I do not yet see the ground on which it can be justly held that any one description of property should be more heavily burdened than others, unless moral and social grounds can be shown first: but in this case the reasons drawn from those sources seem rather to verge in the opposite direction, for real property has more of presumptive connection with the discharge of duty that that which is ranked as personal...the aspect of the measure is not satisfactory to a man of my traditions (and these traditions lie near the roots of my being).... For the sudden introduction of such change there is I think no precedent in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> And the severity of the blow is greatly aggravated in moral effect {{by the fact that it}} is dealt only to a handful of individuals.|$|E

6000|$|I {{hold that}} the {{proposition}} that slavery cannot enter a new country without police regulations is historically false. It is not true at all. I hold that <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> shows that the institution of slavery was originally planted upon this continent without these [...] "police regulations" [...] which the Judge now thinks necessary for the actual establishment of it. Not only so, but is there not another fact,--how came this Dred Scott decision to be made? It was made upon {{the case of a}} negro being taken and actually held in slavery in Minnesota Territory, claiming his freedom because the act of Congress prohibited his being so held there. Will the Judge pretend that Dred Scott was not held there without police regulations? There is at least one matter of record as to his having been held in slavery in the Territory, not only without police regulations, but in the teeth of congressional legislation supposed to be valid at the time. This shows that there is vigour enough in slavery to plant itself in a new country, even against unfriendly legislation. It takes not only law, but the enforcement of law to keep it out. That is <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> upon the subject.|$|E

60|$|Not {{only did}} that Ordinance prevail, {{but it was}} {{constantly}} looked to whenever a step was taken by a new Territory to become a State.

They did so because they had traced the Ordinance of '87 throughout <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> Begin with the men of the Revolution, and go down for sixty entire years, and until the last scrap of that Territory comes into the Union in the form of the State of Wisconsin, everything was made to conform with the Ordinance of '87, excluding slavery from that vast extent of country.|$|E
60|$|He {{comes before}} {{the people of}} the United States at a {{remarkable}} era in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and of the world. The two great parties of the nation appear--at least to an observer somewhat removed from both--to have nearly merged into one another; for they preserve the attitude of political antagonism rather through the effect of their old organizations than because any great and radical principles are at present in dispute between them. The measures advocated by the one party, and resisted by the other, through a long series of years, have now ceased to be the pivots on which the election turns. The prominent statesmen, so long identified with those measures, will henceforth relinquish their controlling influence over public affairs. Both parties, it may likewise be said, are united in one common purpose,--that of preserving our sacred Union, as the immovable basis from which the destinies, not of America alone, but of mankind at large, may be carried upward and consummated. And thus men stand together, in unwonted quiet and harmony, awaiting the new movement in advance which all these tokens indicate.|$|E
60|$|The {{day after}} the arrival of Mr. Rigby at the Castle, Coningsby quitted it for London, and before a week had elapsed had {{embarked}} for Cadiz. He felt a romantic interest in visiting the land to which Edith owed some blood, and in acquiring the language which he had often admired as she spoke it. A favourable opportunity permitted him in the autumn to visit Athens and the AEgean, which he much desired. In the pensive beauties of that delicate land, where perpetual autumn seems to reign, Coningsby found solace. There is something {{in the character of}} Grecian scenery which blends with the humour of the melancholy and the feelings of the sorrowful. Coningsby passed his winter at Rome. The wish of his grandfather had rendered it necessary for him to return to England somewhat abruptly. Lord Monmouth had not visited his native country since his marriage; but the period that had elapsed since that event had considerably improved the prospects of his party. The majority of the Whig Cabinet in the House of Commons by 1840 had become little more than nominal; and though it was circulated among their friends, as if from the highest authority, that 'one was enough,' there seemed daily a better chance of their being deprived even of that magical unit. For the first time in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> since the introduction of the system of parliamentary sovereignty, the Government of England depended on the fate of single elections; and indeed, by a single vote, it is remarkable to observe, the fate of the Whig Government was ultimately decided.|$|E
