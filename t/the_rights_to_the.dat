40|$|The {{break-up}} {{with the}} repressive regime, {{and above all}} rehabilitation of the consequences for victims, includes determining {{the truth about the}} character, carriers and methods of systematic violation of basic human rights. Many international instruments, which deal with the problem of victims of repressive regimes and the state discontinuity with repressive governance, proclaim <b>the</b> concept of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth. The paper deals with the normative contents of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth and different aspects of this concept that international courts recognize in relation to victims of repressive regimes.
