5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1945–46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection. Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first-choice state team, he made 82 and 25. This {{was not enough to}} convince the state selectors and Harvey did not get a recall to the Victorian team until the end of <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>when</b> he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by striking a career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win.|$|E

5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their first season, going 8–4, their financial status was a different story. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. They were in dire financial straits until the eleventh game of <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> <b>when</b> Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered {{the history of the}} franchise.|$|E

5|$|Male {{care for}} infants has been {{documented}} in ruffed lemur societies. During early development, adult males may guard the nests of multiple core group females, as well as help care for the infants that were likely fathered by other males. During <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>when</b> females practice infant stashing, males effectively lighten the reproductive burden of up to several mothers by guarding, huddling, grooming, travelling, playing with and feeding the young.|$|E
50|$|Weatherson {{finished}} four of {{his first}} seven seasons at Greenock Morton as the club's leading goalscorer. <b>The</b> <b>seasons</b> <b>when</b> Weatherson did not achieve this feat was <b>the</b> 2005-06 <b>season,</b> <b>when</b> he finished second behind returning fans' favourite Derek Lilley, then in <b>season</b> 2008-09 <b>when</b> he finished second again, this time behind Brian Wake and finally in <b>season</b> 2010-11, <b>when</b> he finished third behind Brian Graham, who was first and Allan Jenkins, who was second.|$|R

5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>when</b> off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E
5|$|The 1911 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was relatively inactive, with only six known tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic {{during the summer}} and fall. There were three suspected tropical depressions, including one that began the season in February and one that ended <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>when</b> it dissipated in December. Three storms intensified into hurricanes, two of which attained Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Storm data is largely based on the Atlantic hurricane database, which underwent a thorough revision for the period between 1911 and 1914 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Adamle {{was again}} {{one of eight}} Browns chosen for the Pro Bowl after Cleveland's 1951 season, when the team reached the {{championship}} game but lost to the Los Angeles Rams. He was named a first-team All-Pro by United Press International and the New York Daily News after <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> <b>when</b> he had one interception and one fumble recovery. He was used mainly as an outside linebacker in Cleveland's 5-3 defense later in his career, only attempting three rushes in the 1950s. Adamle finished college at Kent State University in 1950, earning a bachelor's degree, and received a master's degree in education from Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1951.|$|E

5|$|After a {{difficult}} start {{to life in}} the First Division, Cardiff secured their first victory in the top division by beating Middlesbrough 3–1. Keenor had been switched to centre-half for the match, a move Fred Stewart had resisted for some time due to his concern of Kennor's lack of height, away from his usual position at right-half and his performance impressed so much that he would go on to play the position for the remainder of his career. The 1921–22 season was also Keenor's tenth year at Ninian Park and he was subsequently awarded a testimonial match against Bristol City. In the following five years, Cardiff became an established side in the First Division, missing out on the league title in the 1923–24 season to Huddersfield Town on goal average after drawing the final game of <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>when</b> a win would have guaranteed them the championship.|$|E
5|$|After {{ensuring}} {{their own}} safety, Sunderland travelled to Bolton Wanderers on 3 May, {{who were not}} yet safe from relegation. Sunderland lost the game 2–0 at the Reebok Stadium. On 11 May, the last game of the Premier League season, Sunderland played Arsenal at the Stadium of Light. Arsenal won the game 1–0 through a Theo Walcott goal. Sunderland also recorded their highest home attendance of <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> <b>when</b> the match was watched by 47,802 people. Sunderland finished the season with 39 points in 15th place, with Kenwyne Jones as top goal scorer with seven goals. Left-back Danny Collins was named as Sunderland's player of the season, while on loan centre-back Jonny Evans was named as the club's young player of the season for the second season running. They finished with an average home attendance of 42,728 which was the fifth highest in the league.|$|E
5|$|After his {{performance}} for Sandefjord in 2006, Expressen said that Tegström was wanted by several Norwegian, Danish and Dutch clubs, but signed {{a new contract}} with Sandefjord in December 2006 {{to the end of}} the 2009 season. Verdens Gang predicted that the Sandefjord team would finish 11th in the 2007 Tippeligaen, but stated that Tegström had to perform at the same level as in the previous season for Sandefjord to avoid relegation. Tegström scored one goal for Sandefjord in the 2007 season; the team struggled throughout the season until it was relegated to the second tier. Tegström left Sandefjord half-way through <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> <b>when</b> he was sold to Fredrikstad in August 2007 for 4 million Norwegian krone (NOK), according to Sandefjords Blad.|$|E

5|$|Although the Giants played well, {{the team}} {{experienced}} financial hardship {{during its first}} year. Player salaries were so low that most had to take additional jobs to support themselves. The team's brief practices, held at 4:30 p. m. each day to accommodate outside-work schedules, enabled little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925 and owner Tim Mara spent $25,000 {{of his own money}} during the season to keep the team going. The financial struggle continued until the 11th game of <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> <b>when</b> the visiting Red Grange and the Chicago Bears drew more than 73,000 fans (a pro-football record) and an additional 20,000 were turned away. This gave the Giants much-needed revenue, possibly altering the team's history. In the 19–7 Bears victory, Grange intercepted a pass intended for Bomar and returned it for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|By 1876 Gilbert had {{qualified}} {{to play for}} Gloucestershire, as {{he had lived in}} the county for the length of time required by the rules. In his first season for the club he finished fifth in the first-class batting averages, scoring 907 runs at an average of 36.28. His highest score was 205 not out for an England XI against Cambridge University, the third-highest score of the season after W. G. Grace's two triple centuries. His innings lasted about seven hours, and he batted on each of the three days of the match. This was his maiden first-class century; he scored another hundred later in <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>when</b> he made 143 runs for a combined Kent and Gloucestershire side against a team representing England. In the same season he took 28 wickets at an average of 19.64, including seven wickets for 65 runs in the match between the United South of England XI and the United North of England XI.|$|E
5|$|Cook {{left the}} Barons {{to join the}} Minneapolis Millers of the United States Hockey League (USHL) in 1947. He coached the team for three seasons, leading the team to the Paul W. Loudon Trophy as league champions in 1949–50. He moved on to coach the Denver Falcons, also of the USHL, in 1950–51 then the Saskatoon Quakers of the Pacific Coast Hockey League (PHCL) the {{following}} season. Cook left the Quakers midway through <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>when</b> asked by Frank Boucher, {{general manager of the}} New York Rangers, to return to the NHL club as its head coach. He coached the final 47 games of the Rangers' 1951–52 season, winning 17, losing 22 and tying 8. He remained behind the Rangers bench in 1952–53, but the Rangers missed the playoffs after winning only 17 of 70 games. Cook was replaced as coach following the season as Boucher named himself head coach. Cook then retired from hockey.|$|E

5|$|Dalglish became manager {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Fagan after the Heysel Stadium disaster. He started by replacing long-serving full-backs Phil Neal and Alan Kennedy with Steve Nicol and Jim Beglin. Liverpool began the 1985–86 season poorly and were ten points behind Manchester United {{at the end of}} September. The club continued to struggle until the end of <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>when</b> they won eleven of their last twelve matches, as their rivals were dropping points. Liverpool needed to beat Chelsea in the last game of the season to win the league championship. A goal from Dalglish secured the championship. The club also progressed to the 1986 FA Cup Final, where they faced Everton. Liverpool went behind to a first-half goal from Gary Lineker, but two goals from Ian Rush and a Craig Johnston goal in the second half secured a 3–1 victory. The club had achieved a double of league championship and FA Cup in the same season for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe's first {{match for}} his new state in 192829 was against the touring England cricket team. He took 3/114 as the {{tourists}} compiled 406 in a drawn match. He took the wickets of leading batsmen Ernest Tyldesley, Douglas Jardine and Herbert Sutcliffe. During the second innings of the match against England, Halcombe struck George Geary {{in the head with}} a bouncer, forcing him to be carried from the field. This drew further attention to Halcombe's bowling action. Halcombe was dropped to the colts (youth) team, and he promptly bowled them to victory against South Australia with 6/31 and 6/32. After taking match figures of 3/77 against Victoria Colts, Halcombe played his second first-class fixture of <b>the</b> <b>season</b> <b>when</b> Australian selectors selected him for an Australian XI against England at the end of the season. He took 2/50 in a drawn match, his wickets being Maurice Tate and Maurice Leyland.|$|E

A one-stop pit strategy worked well for Glock as he finished seventh; Piquet took eighth. Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello and Nakajima took the next four places; Bourdais recovered from his early contact with Trulli to take 13th. Webber's initial success with a two-stop strategy faded as he finished 14th. Rosberg took 15th, ahead of Button and Fisichella. Trulli, Sutil and Kovalainen were the three retirements from the 56lap race.|$|E
