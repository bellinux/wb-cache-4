5|$|In {{the period}} from 1975 to 2001, the Emir ruled by decree. Human rights activists and {{opposition}} leaders made repeated allegations of systematic torture, the arbitrary arrest of thousands, and assassinations, {{all of which were}} denied by the authorities. Bahrain's Shia population widely claimed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> discriminated against by the government, and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> treated as second class citizens.|$|E

5|$|At {{the request}} of Natalee's father, Alabama judge Alan King {{declared}} Holloway legally dead in absentia on January 12, 2012. On August 16, 2017, Holloway's father announced that he and a private investigator had recently discovered human remains and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> DNA-tested {{to determine whether they}} belonged to his daughter. Final results revealed that the human remains did not belong to Natalee.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 the {{receivers}} {{determined that the}} company was insolvent. With a complex business structure to unravel, some commentators expect it may take years for the company's collapse to be fully resolved. By April 2010, timber company Gunns had taken over as the responsible entity running most of Great Southern's pulpwood schemes, but the land on which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> grown was yet to be sold.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} types and sizes of horse {{were used in}} war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply. Throughout history, mules and donkeys as well as horses {{played a crucial role}} in providing support to armies in the field.|$|E
5|$|Many of Priestley's {{political}} writings {{supported the}} repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the rights of Dissenters. They could not hold political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal the Acts, arguing that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> treated as second-class citizens.|$|E

She said in 2011 that she chose {{emancipation}} as she was influenced by other young actors doing it. In 1997, unhappy with the roles <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, but nothing happened with it.|$|E

5|$|The Vrba–Wetzler {{report was}} not {{distributed}} widely until weeks after Vrba's escape in April 1944. Between 15 May and 7 July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews (12,000 a day) were deported to Auschwitz. Vrba believed {{they would have}} run or fought had they been told <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> sent to their deaths.|$|E
5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto zooming in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look and feel and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> included in the shots.|$|E
5|$|The law had its detractors, {{even among}} those groups {{protected}} by it. Puritans were concerned that the act and the proprietary government in general were royalist. They were also concerned that by swearing allegiance to Calvert, who was Catholic, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> required {{to submit to the}} Pope, whom they considered to be the antichrist. Some Anglicans also opposed the law, believing that the Church of England should be the colony's sole established church.|$|E

Sometimes the participants <b>are</b> aware <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> observed, and other times the participants do not know <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>being</b> observed. Strict ethical guidelines must be followed when covert observation <b>is</b> <b>being</b> carried out.|$|R
5|$|The revolt was {{put down}} with the {{assistance}} of the unit imam, Halim Malkoč, and unit physician Dr. Willfried Schweiger. Malkoč told the Bosnian enlisted men of 1st Company that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> deceived, released the German NCOs and rallied the company to hunt down the ringleaders. Schweiger did the same with 2nd Company. Dizdarević and Džanić were shot and killed during the fighting, and Vukelić was captured, while Jelinek escaped.|$|E
5|$|The {{two best}} {{preserved}} specimens of Corythosaurus found, by Charles H. Sternberg in 1912, were lost on 6 December 1916 while being {{carried by the}} SS Mount Temple to the United Kingdom, during World War One. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> sent to Arthur Smith Woodward, a paleontologist of the British Museum of Natural History in England, when the ship transporting them was sunk by the German merchant raider SMS Möwe {{in the middle of}} the ocean.|$|E
5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position {{as head of the}} Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten {{played a crucial role in}} ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E

5|$|Between the {{releases}} of Hilary Duff and Dignity, Duff's personal life was eventful. In October 2006, {{she and her}} boyfriend at the time, Joel Madden of punk rock band Good Charlotte, claimed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> stalked by Russian emigre Maksim Miakovsky and his roommate, paparazzo David Joseph Klein. According to a restraining order filed by Duff, Miakovsky came to the United States solely to pursue a relationship with her. He was later arrested after threatening to kill her. In November, she ended her two-year relationship with Madden. Around the same time, her parents Robert and Susan separated after 22 years of marriage following an affair between Robert and another woman.|$|E
5|$|Despite the battalion's {{success in}} holding the {{trenches}} at Lone Pine, the August Offensive failed {{to break the}} deadlock as setbacks elsewhere resulted in continued stalemate {{and for the rest}} of the campaign the fighting was relatively static. Finally, in December the decision was made to evacuate the Allied force from the peninsula. During the evacuation, two of the battalion's soldiers, William Scurry and Alfred 'Buntie' Lawrence played a significant part through their invention of a self-firing rifle, which assisted in making the Turks believe that there were still men manning the trenches even as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E
