5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Terrace</b> View was a {{restaurant}} and café located in Citygarden. Operated by local restaurateur Jim Fiala, <b>the</b> <b>Terrace</b> View opened on August 19, 2009 with Chris Bork as chef. At {{the time of its}} opening, Fiala estimated the eatery would produce between $600,000 and $800,000 in revenue each year. <b>The</b> <b>Terrace</b> View employed about 30 workers.|$|E
5|$|A flat area, to the {{immediate}} west of the prison, is called <b>The</b> <b>Terrace</b> and was formed from rubble resulting from the levelling of the prison site. Adjoining the western perimeter wall, but outside the prison on the northern side of <b>the</b> <b>terrace</b> compound, is staff accommodation. Three adjoining residences {{were built in the}} 1890s as quarters for prison staff.|$|E
5|$|Intrinsic {{diffusion}} {{occurs on}} a uniform surface (e.g. lacking steps or vacancies) {{such as a}} single terrace, where no adatom traps or sources are present. This regime is often studied using field ion microscopy, wherein <b>the</b> <b>terrace</b> is a sharp sample tip on which an adparticle diffuses. Even {{in the case of}} a clean terrace the process may be influenced by non-uniformity near the edges of <b>the</b> <b>terrace.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Terraces</b> was {{purchased}} in 1884 {{and added to}} the Government house properties in 1886. In 1932, the earlier residence of the Governor, the Bella Vista was discontinued in favor of <b>The</b> <b>Terraces.</b> It, however, seems that both houses were intermittently used, depending on the choice of every individual Governor. That {{is the reason why}} <b>The</b> <b>Terraces</b> had to undergo major renovation when the Governor chose to reside at <b>the</b> <b>Terraces.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dividing <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> into {{separate}} pens stopped the fans from easing congestion by moving away sideways along <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> {{as they had}} done before.|$|R
5000|$|Locals to {{this day}} still plant rice and {{vegetables}} on <b>the</b> <b>terraces,</b> although more and more younger Ifugaos do not find farming appealing, often opting for the more lucrative hospitality industry generated by <b>the</b> <b>terraces.</b> <b>The</b> result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic [...] "steps", which need constant reconstruction and care. In 2010, a further problem was drought, with <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> drying up completely in March of that year.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified {{cracks in}} <b>the</b> <b>terrace</b> supporting the Memorial Gardens, {{and they were}} {{closed to the public}} as a potential hazard. Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled at a higher level to be visible from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. <b>The</b> <b>terrace</b> was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E
5|$|North of the gatehouse, {{located at}} 2, 4, and 6 <b>The</b> <b>Terrace,</b> are cottages built in Victorian style, in {{contrast}} to the Georgian style of the other houses. Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. An adjoining single-storey at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of the gatekeeper, located {{on the north side of}} the gatehouse. Number 16 <b>The</b> <b>Terrace,</b> south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, the southernmost house on <b>The</b> <b>Terrace,</b> and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.|$|E

50|$|The old part of {{the city}} of Peoria is built on a series of two <b>terraces.</b> <b>The</b> lower <b>terrace</b> slopes up from the Illinois River bank to a height of 83 feet where it meets the base of <b>the</b> second <b>terrace.</b> <b>The</b> width of <b>the</b> initial <b>terrace</b> varies from ¾ miles to 1½ miles. <b>The</b> second <b>terrace</b> {{encompasses}} a series of bluffs which rise from 75 to 100 feet above <b>the</b> first <b>terrace.</b> <b>The</b> North Side Historic District is located on <b>the</b> initial <b>terrace,</b> to <b>the</b> north of the city's central business district and is primarily residential in nature.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> Banaue Rice <b>Terraces</b> (...) are 2,000-year-old {{terraces}} {{that were}} {{carved into the}} mountains of Ifugao in the Philippines by ancestors of the indigenous people. <b>The</b> Rice <b>Terraces</b> are {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Eighth Wonder of the World". It is commonly thought that <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. <b>The</b> <b>terraces</b> are located approximately 1500 meters (5000ft) above sea level. They are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above <b>the</b> <b>terraces.</b> It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half the globe.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>terraces</b> {{were long}} {{thought to have}} been {{destroyed}} in the 1886 eruption. However, in February 2011, a team including researchers from GNS Science, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and Waikato University were mapping the lake floor when they reported discovering part of <b>the</b> Pink <b>Terraces.</b> <b>The</b> lowest two tiers of <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> were reported found at 60 m deep. A part of <b>the</b> White <b>Terraces</b> was also reported as rediscovered in June 2011. The announcement of the rediscovery of <b>the</b> White <b>Terraces</b> coincided with <b>the</b> 125th anniversary of the eruption of Mt. Tarawera in 1886.|$|R
5|$|The large {{triangular}} plaza on {{the west}} side of One World Trade Center, facing the Hudson River, was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to the street. However, the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design. <b>The</b> <b>terrace</b> can be accessed through a staircase on Vesey Street. <b>The</b> <b>terrace</b> is paved in granite, and has 12 sweetgum trees, in addition to a block-long planter/bench.|$|E
5|$|An {{inclined}} tramway, the ramp, {{was built}} {{from the front}} of <b>the</b> <b>terrace,</b> on the axis of the gatehouse, down towards the port area of Fremantle. The ramp, constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut and fill activities required to create the prison site and <b>the</b> <b>terrace.</b> The ramp {{is an integral part of}} the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment of the ramp, where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three terrace houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point. The limestone used for the early prison and its associated housing was quarried on the site.|$|E
5|$|Perry Ellwood {{inherited}} {{the house in}} 1910, and, together with his wife, May Ellwood (née Gurler), altered the mansion once again. The biggest changes were the addition of <b>the</b> <b>terrace</b> on the home's south face, a sunroom wing, and the relocation of the porte-cochere to {{the north side of}} the portico. This is the mansion that is visible today.|$|E
50|$|Also {{destroyed}} {{were the}} famed Pink and White Terraces. However, in February 2011 a team mapping the lake floor discovered {{what appeared to}} be part of <b>the</b> Pink <b>Terraces.</b> <b>The</b> lowest two tiers of <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> were reportedly found in their original place at 60 m deep (too deep for scuba diving without special gas gear). Subsequently, a portion of <b>the</b> White <b>Terraces</b> was reportedly rediscovered in June 2011. The announcement of the rediscovery of <b>the</b> White <b>Terraces</b> coincided with <b>the</b> 125th anniversary of the eruption of Mt. Tarawera in 1886. It was thought that the rest of <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> may be buried in sediment rather than having been destroyed.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 {{capacity}} {{was increased}} marginally by extending <b>the</b> <b>terracing</b> around <b>the</b> corner in between <b>the</b> Western <b>Terraces</b> and <b>the</b> North Stand.|$|R
50|$|A croquet {{lawn and}} tennis court were near to <b>the</b> <b>terraces.</b> To <b>the</b> south of <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> was {{landscaped}} parkland {{followed by a}} boating lake. The lake was enlarged by 1875, and featured an island grotto accessible by a footbridge.|$|R
5|$|A further terrace to {{the south}} of the Masonic Hall is split from the hall by St George's Place. It is formed of numbers 21 to 23 The Crescent, and number 42 Upper High Street. <b>The</b> <b>terrace</b> forms two listed {{building}} designations, both Grade II. Numbers 21 and 22 The Crescent are two-storey roughcast houses, each spanning three windows. The doorways are round-headed, and are flanked by ground floor bay windows. Number 23 forms the back of 42 Upper High Street, and is a two-storey red brick building.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above <b>the</b> <b>terrace,</b> the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E
5|$|Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 <b>The</b> <b>Terrace,</b> {{were built}} during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, {{also known as}} the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} and painted limestone walls. The plan is roughly square with verandahs and balconies along the west and south sides. A single storey building connects the south-east side of the house to the main prison wall.|$|E
5000|$|Another aspect was the {{necessity}} of creating terraces on his farm's hillsides leading him {{to the use of}} heavy machinery (like excavators). Many of <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> he construct are also given a humus storage ditch (placed in between <b>the</b> <b>terraces).</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{branch of}} Ridge System E turns into lobate scarps at the mare-highland {{boundary}} of Montes Recti (47.95 ^∘N, 18.36 ^∘W; Fig.  8 a, b). A lobate scarp {{runs along the}} southern margin of Montes Recti to make crisp <b>terraces</b> at <b>the</b> height of ∼ 100  m from the neighboring plain (Fig.  8 a). <b>The</b> <b>terraces</b> are tens of meters in width. The lithology of the slope between <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> and <b>the</b> mare-highland boundary is not clear in their spectral features. However, we interpreted that <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> are debris aprons, because there are craters with mountainside parts obliterated at the mare-highland boundary (Fig.  8 b). There are grooves along the mountainside edges of <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> (Fig.  8 b).|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of artificial <b>terrace</b> complexes in <b>the</b> mountains {{is evidence of}} their sedentary living, high population density, {{and high levels of}} agricultural and technical skills. <b>The</b> <b>terraces</b> were built around the fourth millennium BC. and all subsequent cultures used them for agricultural purposes. The vast majority of pottery found on <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> are from <b>the</b> Maykop period, the rest from the Scythian and Alan period. <b>The</b> Maykop <b>terraces</b> are among <b>the</b> most ancient in the world, but they are little studied. The longevity of <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> (more than 5000 years) allows us to consider their builders unsurpassed engineers and craftsmen.|$|R
5|$|In 1861 a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} construct a road from Blackfriars to the Mansion House; this {{would have resulted in}} the complete demolition of the College. However, protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south east and south west wings being sliced off, requiring extensive remodelling. The College was now a three-sided building with an open courtyard facing the New Queen Victoria Street laid out in 1866. <b>The</b> <b>terrace,</b> steps and entrance porch were also added around this time.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in <b>the</b> <b>Terrace</b> Ledge Kink model.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen is a {{restaurant}} on the sixteenth floor of the Trump International Hotel and Tower, Chicago in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Illinois. It {{is one of three}} food and dining options in the hotel's room service offering. Sixteen opened in early February 2008, and an adjoining outdoor patio terrace, named <b>The</b> <b>Terrace</b> at T, opened on June 25, 2009 following the completion of the hotel's construction.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Banaue Rice <b>Terraces</b> is {{an example}} of paddy fields in the country, it is located in Northern Luzon, Philippines and were built by the Ifugaos 2,000 years ago.

25|$|Nine {{concentric}} circles thus provide the main geometry of <b>the</b> eighteen <b>terraces.</b> Just as <b>the</b> {{identification of a}} circle presupposes a centre, so <b>the</b> <b>terraces</b> have been conceived as generated from the Shrine of the Báb. <b>The</b> eighteen <b>terraces</b> plus <b>the</b> one <b>terrace</b> of <b>the</b> Shrine of the Báb make nineteen terraces total. Nineteen is a significant number within both the Bahá'í and Bábí religions.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Terrace</b> of the Presidents: Robert Gannon, {{president}} of Fordham from 1936 to 1949, initiated {{the custom of}} engraving the granite steps leading up to Keating Hall {{with the names of}} heads of state who visit the university. Among the names engraved are George Washington, who visited the Rose Hill Manor before it was succeeded by St. John's College in 1841; Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Harry S. Truman; Richard Nixon; and the names of various other heads of state from around the world.|$|E
5|$|The late 19th century carvings of Roman Emperors and Governors of Roman Britain on <b>the</b> <b>terrace</b> {{overlooking}} the Great Bath are particularly {{susceptible to the}} effect of acid rain and are being protected with a wash of a sacrificial shelter coat every few years. Exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to warm air which had the effect of drawing corrosive salts out of the Roman stonework. To help reduce this, a new ventilation system was installed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|A trio {{of small}} Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon a common {{platform}} {{at the east}} end of <b>the</b> <b>terrace,</b> facing west. It is likely that the platform was purposely built to support the three temples that were built more-or-less simultaneously. Neither the platform nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that an early version of the central temple (Temple 30) was built first, then decommissioned with the platform being built to cover the early version, followed by {{the construction of a new}} version plus the two additional flanking temples.|$|E
5000|$|Quriwayrachina or Quri Wayrachina (Quechua quri gold, wayrachina {{a special}} oven for {{smelting}} metal, [...] "oven for smelting gold") is an archaeological site with agricultural terraces in Peru.
