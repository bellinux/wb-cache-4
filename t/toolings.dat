40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} numerical study is conducted to investigate temperature nonhomogeneities within a Spark Plasma Sintering tooling setup. Radial thermal gradients through a powder compact are encountered, {{a cause of}} microstructural nonuniformities in sintered specimens, which tend to become more significant when increasing the setup's characteristic size. In the insulating silicon nitride powder compact employed for the experimental procedures, a double pyrometer arrangement detects a strong temperature disparity between the overheated die and the area adjacent to the <b>tooling's</b> axis. A previous finite-element simulations campaign had individuated a possible solution in a novel punch design, consisting in the drilling of three concentric ring-shaped holes according to a specific geometrical pattern, whose efficacy is here experimentally verified. Further punch optimization strategies are drawn, involving a refinement of the threerings geometry by linearly varying the drilled holes characteristic dimensions along the radial direction, or the selective coating and consequent insulation of the punch cross section with {{a thin layer of}} hexagonal boron nitride. Ideal configurations are identified, consisting in a concentration of the graphite punch's mass at its center by means of a tailored holes pattern, or in the coating of a portion of the conventionally shaped punch with boron nitride...|$|R
40|$|An ultrasonic, {{vibration}} assisted diamond turning (UVADT) device {{has been}} constructed {{that allows for}} variation of vibration frequency and vibration amplitude via a direct drive actuator [1]. This device {{has been used to}} identify the relationships between the tool vibration variables and the process parameters. Frequencies as high as forty kilohertz and amplitudes up to seven micrometers have been achieved at the tool tip during cutting. This paper discusses the tool design, the experimental results, and the model used to describe the mechanism by which vibration assisted turning reduces tool wear. FINAL DESIGN / ACTIVE <b>TOOLING</b> Prototype vibration assisted machining (VAM) devices have been described in [1] and [2]. The tool used in this work represents an integrated tool that couples the actuators directly into the tool shank, creating a UVADT device that can now be integrated with a standard tool holder mechanism on conventional precision machine tools, shown in Figure 1. The new tool also has the distinct advantage of being adaptable to conventional or hard turning operations. The tool uses multiple PZTs actuated sequentially to achieve the desired frequency. 1 Additionally, this new integrated cutting tool / actuator system is now embeddable in other systems. For example, the compact tool has been coupled with a long-range fast-tool servo (FTS). The merged technology can now realize precision free-form components produced in hard materials directly on a diamond turning machine. This technology opens a new domain of precision single point tooling, whereby, the tool becomes active during the machining process...|$|R

5000|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, most of {{the auto}} {{factories}} had been destroyed or badly damaged. Germany needed debt relief. The London Agreement on German External Debts of 1953 provided that repayments were only due while West Germany ran a trade surplus, and that repayments were limited to 3% of export earnings. This gave Germany’s creditors a powerful incentive to import German goods, assisting reconstruction of the Car Industry. [...] In addition, {{the eastern part of}} Germany was under control of the Soviet Union, which dismantled much of the machinery that was left and sent it back to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Some manufacturers, such as Maybach and Adler (automobile), started up again, but did not continue making passenger cars. The Volkswagen production facility in Wolfsburg continued making the Volkswagen Beetle (Type 1) in 1945, a car which it had intended to make prior to the war (under the name of KdF-Wagen), except that the factory was converted to military truck production during the war. By 1955 VW had made one million Volkswagen Beetles, and by 1965 had built 10 million, as it gained popularity on export markets {{as well as on the}} home market. Other auto manufacturers rebuilt their plants and slowly resumed production, with initial models mostly based on pre-war designs. Mercedes-Benz resumed production in 1946 with the pre-war-designed 170 series. In 1951 they introduced the 220 series, which came with a more modern engine, and the 300 series. Opel revived the pre-war cars Opel Olympia in 1947 and the Opel Kapitän in 1948.

Egger {{was the first to}} produce H0e ready-to-run models, and they were a great success. In 1964 the range was expanded, including a steam locomotive. Models from Egger-Bahn were often used in presentation lay-outs. For instance Faller used them in their magazine, because Faller produced models more in a scale of 1:100 than 1:87. The small Egger_bahn models suited it very well. In the USA Egger-Bahn was marketed by AHM (as H0n30 scale) together with Roco Peetzy models under the name of [...] "Minitrains". [...] In order to cope with the market demands Egger had to produce more models. Besides, technical improvements, as Magna-Kraft, meant that models and moulds had to be reworked very often. Furthermore it was decided to simplify the models in order to cope with the demands. Customers respond badly to this change and sales went down. The company had to find new financial resources. These were found with Tristan movie company (Constantin movie company) that produced the Old Shatterhand movies. Tristan was forced to produce more USA-style models suiting the Winnetou scene. This was not successful. In the end the firm was broken up in 1967 and Jouef later acquired the <b>toolings</b> and produced the models. Jouef ended production in the early seventies. In 1983 the old moulds were discovered in an old bunker. Jouef retried to market these models under the name of Egger-Bahn in grey boxes.

40|$|Advanced Composites Division has {{developed}} innovative techniques to manufacture stiffened bulk heads and sandwich panels. Special tools are established for stiffener layup that avoid the complex machining operation. The stiffeners are co-cured and co-bonded {{with the basic}} skin to gain the advantage of composite. The long experience in composite tooling enable ACD to use the sub tools in three pieces between two stiffeners that maintains straightness of the stiffener minimizing the thinning of stiffener web. As bulk head panels have so many cutouts and kinks and also the surface is non developable, the wastage of prepreg material is minimised by using the tape of different width.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the number}} of low-volume cars, such as fun cars increased. The batch size for these cars is {{in the range of}} 5, 000 up to 100, 000. Common deep drawing tools for the mass {{production}} of car body panels are made of steel or cast iron. They can be used for more than 1 million parts but their manufacturing is time-consuming and costly. The reason for this project was the lack of low-cost and less time-consuming manufacturing concepts for small batch production deep drawing tools. The method of resolution was based on one category of rapid tooling technology which involves the application of advanced polymers to fabricate metal forming dies. Despite their advantages in production and cost reductions, polymer dies for sheet metal forming application have several drawbacks. Due to their lack of strength compared to steel or cast iron, the use of polymer dies was limited to a production rate below 1, 000 parts. The intention of this project was a significant durability improvement of polyurethane made deep drawing tools. PVD coating and thermal coating (flame spraying and plasma spraying) have been investigated as well as the modification of polyurethane by tribological favourable additives. In fact of extensive efforts on the area of PVD coating and thermal coating was the result dissatisfying. The adhesive strength of the coatings was basically and essentially unsound, therefore the activities with this coatings have been quit. In terms of durability improvement the modified polyurethane performed very well. On this base tooling concepts have been developed and tested. These <b>toolings</b> are capable for a small batch size production of car body panels. Dependent on the sheet thickness, work piece material and geometry the tool life will be in a range from 3, 000 to 20, 000 parts. Compared to the common dies, made of steel or cast iron, the polyurethane dies have considerable advantages in manufacturing time and price as well as in repairing and modifying. The tool cost reduction is the outcome of less time for manufacturing and a significant smaller effort for the smooth finishing operation. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceFrom 2012 to 2016, the Tore Supra tokamak was {{upgraded}} in an x-point divertor device {{within the}} frame of the WEST project. A huge design activity was made to modify the whole configuration of Tore Supra including the in-vessel components. Some of the most noticeable changes are the addition of inner divertor coils inside the vacuum vessel and the replacement of all plasma facing components. Fitting all the new components in a previously existing environment {{was probably one of the}} major challenges of the project. To improve the assembly plan and the design of <b>toolings,</b> Virtual Reality (VR) was introduced in the design process. For complex assembly operations, simulations were developed for VR headsets from CAD models. From the requirements expressed by the design team, the VR engineers developed dedicated tools to address the specific issues. Engineers, designers and operators were then able to experience the assembly conditions in a 3 D 360 ° real size immersive environment and interact with the models thanks to a large set of dedicated tools which are developed in the VR lab. This approach showed impressive results for issues such as accessibility, complex kinematics of large components and design of handling tools. It allowed reducing the number of mock-ups and helped the WEST assembly team to reduce the number of unforeseen assembly issues. It was for example used to simulate the assembly of the divertor: insertion through the ports, toroidal displacement on rails, and assembly with gaps lower than 1 mm. Virtual Reality will also provide innovative solutions to help designers in the anticipation of challenges linked to operation of a nuclear facility: operator's training for nuclear maintenance, virtual mock-ups for qualification of maintenance, maintenance scenario optimization with real time simulations [...] . A first module plotting the dose rate is currently being tested.
