25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} <b>thymidylate</b> and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme <b>thymidylate</b> synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme <b>thymidylate</b> synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|Thymidine monophosphate is also {{produced}} by the cell in a different reaction by methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate, a product of other metabolic pathways unrelated to thymidine, by the enzyme <b>thymidylate</b> synthase. The second route is sufficient to supply thymidine monophosphate for DNA repair. When a cell prepares to divide, a complete new set-up of DNA is required, and the requirement for building blocks, including thymidine triphosphate, increases. Cells prepare for cell division by making some of the enzymes required during the division. They are not normally present in the cells and are downregulated and degraded afterwards. Such enzymes are called salvage enzymes. Thymidine kinase 1 is such a salvage enzyme, whereas thymidine kinase 2 and <b>thymidylate</b> synthase are not cell cycle-dependent.|$|E
25|$|Thymidine monophosphate, {{the product}} of the {{reaction}} catalyzed by thymidine kinase, is in turn phosphorylated to thymidine diphosphate by the enzyme <b>thymidylate</b> kinase and further to thymidine triphosphate by the enzyme nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The triphosphate is included in a DNA molecule, a reaction catalyzed by a DNA polymerase and a complementary DNA molecule (or an RNA molecule in the case of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme present in retrovirus).|$|E
25|$|Two {{different}} classes of thymidine kinases {{have been identified}} and are included in this super family: one family groups together thymidine kinase from herpesvirus as well as cellular <b>thymidylate</b> kinases, the second family groups TK from various sources that include, vertebrates, bacteria, the bacteriophage T4, poxviruses, African swine fever virus (ASFV) and Fish lymphocystis disease virus (FLDV). The major capsid protein of insect iridescent viruses also belongs to this family. The Prosite pattern recognizes only the cellular type of thymidine kinases.|$|E
25|$|Emil Frei first {{demonstrated}} {{this effect}} — {{high doses of}} methotrexate prevented recurrence of osteosarcoma following surgical removal of the primary tumour. 5-fluorouracil, which inhibits <b>thymidylate</b> synthase, was later shown to improve survival when used as an adjuvant to surgery in treating patients with colon cancer. Similarly, the landmark trials of Bernard Fisher, chair of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, and of Gianni Bonadonna, working in the Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Milano, Italy, proved that adjuvant chemotherapy after complete surgical resection of breast tumours significantly extended survival — particularly in more advanced cancer.|$|E
25|$|Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), {{also known}} as {{ribonucleoside}} diphosphate reductase (rNDP), is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. Deoxyribonucleotides in turn {{are used in the}} synthesis of DNA. The reaction catalyzed by RNR is strictly conserved in all living organisms. Furthermore, RNR plays a critical role in regulating the total rate of DNA synthesis so that DNA to cell mass is maintained at a constant ratio during cell division and DNA repair. A somewhat unusual feature of the RNR enzyme is that it catalyzes a reaction that proceeds via a free radical mechanism of action. The substrates for RNR are ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP. dTDP (deoxythymidine diphosphate) is synthesized by another enzyme (<b>thymidylate</b> kinase) from dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate).|$|E

50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of transferases, {{specifically}} those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to uracil, thymine bases are found mostly in DNA, not RNA. Cells do not normally contain thymine bases that {{are linked to}} ribose sugars in RNA, thus indicating that cells only synthesize deoxyribose-linked thymine. The enzyme <b>thymidylate</b> synthetase is responsible for synthesizing thymine residues from dUMP to dTMP. This reaction transfers a methyl group onto the uracil base of dUMP to generate dTMP. The <b>thymidylate</b> synthase reaction, dUMP + 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate ⇔ dTMP + dihydrofolate, is shown to the right.|$|E
5000|$|... 5-FU acts {{in several}} ways, but principally as a <b>thymidylate</b> synthase (TS) inhibitor. Interrupting {{the action of}} this enzyme blocks {{synthesis}} of the pyrimidine thymidine, which is a nucleoside required for DNA replication. <b>Thymidylate</b> synthase methylates deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to form thymidine monophosphate (dTMP). Administration of 5-FU causes a scarcity in dTMP, so rapidly dividing cancerous cells undergo cell death via thymineless death. Calcium folinate provides an exogenous source of reduced folinates and hence stabilises the 5-FU-TS complex, hence enhancing 5-FU's cytotoxicity.|$|E

50|$|DUT is {{a member}} of the dUTPase family, which is known for catalyzing the pyrophosphoralysis of dUTP into dUMP and {{inorganic}} pyrophosphate. This function contributes to DNA replication and repair via de novo <b>thymidylate</b> biosynthesis, as the dUMP product is methylated by <b>thymidylate</b> synthase (TS) to form dTMP, which is then phosphorylated to dTTP. DUT is also crucial for maintaining genome integrity by reducing cellular dUTP levels, thereby preventing the repeated cycles of uracil misincorporation into DNA and DNA repair-mediated strand breaks that would lead to cell death.|$|E
