5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory on the belief <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> {{should be used to}} determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E

Section 2 gives two concrete {{examples of how}} our topic directly affects the internalism/externalism debate in normative epistemology. Section 3 responds to an argument against the view <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are mental states. Section 4 presents two problems for the view <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are propositions. Section 5 presents two problems for the view <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are non-mental facts. Section 6 argues <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are mental states. Section 7 responds to objections. 1...|$|R

5|$|As {{the half}} eagle {{approximated}} {{the size of}} a number of foreign gold coins, such as the British guinea and the French louis d'or, it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions.

5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For <b>that</b> <b>reason,</b> {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the popular}} albeit {{controversial}} ideas {{in the last century}} of moral philosophy is that {{what we ought to do}} is explained by our reasons. And one of the central features of <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> accounts for their popularity among normative theorists is that they can conflict. But I argue that the fact <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> conflict actually also poses two closely related problems for this popular idea in moral philosophy. The first problem is a generalization of a problem in deontic logic concerning the existence of conflicting obligations. The second problem arises from a tension between the fact <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> can conflict and a model of how <b>reasons</b> explain ‘ought’s <b>that</b> has been widely accepted. Having presented each of these problems, I develop a unified solution to them that is informed by results in both ethics and deontic logic. An important implication of this solution is that we must distinguish between derivative and nonderivative reasons and revise our conception how it is <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> explain ‘ought’s...|$|R

But this feature also raises a serious problem: we need some way of constraining this independence.

5|$|Question Time is an {{opportunity}} for the British public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time. It is for <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> – not for some misguided desire to be controversial, but for <b>that</b> <b>reason</b> alone – that the invitation has been extended.|$|E

40|$|To explain an {{intentional}} action one must exhibit the agent’s reasons. Donald Davidson famously {{argued that the}} only clear way to understand action explanation is to hold <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are causes. Davidson’s discussion conflated two issues: whether reasons are causes and whether reasons causally explain intentional action. Contemporary work on explanation and normativity help disentangle these issues and ground an argument that intentional action explanations cannot be a species of causal explanation. Interestingly, this conclusion is consistent with Davidson’s conclusion <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> are causes. In other words, reasons are causes, but rationalizing explanations are not causal explanations...|$|R
40|$|Several authors, {{including}} Thomas Nagel and David Gauthier, have {{defended the}} view <b>that</b> <b>reasons</b> of self-interest (prudential reasons) are rationally binding. That is, {{there is always}} a reason, bearing on the rational advisability, based on one's self-interest and, as a result, a person may act irrationally by knowingly acting against such reasons regardless of the person's desires or values. Both Nagel and Gauthier argue from the rationally mandatory nature of prudential reasons to the conclusion <b>that</b> moral <b>reasons</b> can be rationally mandatory, challenging the neo-Humean position <b>that</b> practical <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> bear on an agent's rationality are essentially grounded on the agent's subjective, contingent, conative states. I argue, pace Nagel and Gauthier, <b>that</b> prudential <b>reasons</b> are not rationally mandatory [...] that the rational requirement to act in one's own interest, when it exists, is, as the neo-Humean insists, grounded on one's subjective, contingent, conative states. Prudential reasons are not reasons for every (conceivable) agent [...] not in the sense that bears on the rational advisability of action...|$|R

Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles.
