5|$|Many {{people think}} of deserts as {{consisting}} of extensive areas of billowing sand dunes because that is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often depicted on TV and in films, but deserts do not always look like this. Across the world, around 20% of desert is sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia. Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities {{in the form of}} sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.|$|E

They locate an underground {{facility in the}} forest and find an intact 2007 Bentley Continental GT, which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper's death. After a high-speed chase, Sol {{and many of his}} men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.|$|E
5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style of underwear, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together {{with the rise of}} low-rise jeans and thong underwear. The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E

5|$|Banjo-Kazooie {{is set in}} the Spiral Mountain {{and follows}} the story of Banjo, a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is always kept in Banjo's backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her {{cauldron}} Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is more beautiful than her. Jealous, Gruntilda creates a machine that can transfer a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends to use with Tooty. She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping. In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her. Banjo and Kazooie learn from Tooty's friend, Bottles the mole, that she was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda's lair. Along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's former teacher.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{general-purpose}} Japanese dictionaries (as {{opposed to}} specifically character dictionaries) generally collate all entries, including words written using kanji, {{according to their}} kana representations (reflecting <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> pronounced).

25|$|The {{motivating}} insight behind topology is {{that some}} geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved, but rather on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> put together. For example, the square and the circle have many properties in common: they are both one dimensional objects (from a topological point of view) and both separate the plane into two parts, the part inside and the part outside.|$|E
25|$|Currency futures {{contracts}} are contracts specifying a standard volume {{of a particular}} currency to be exchanged on a specific settlement date. Thus the currency futures {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts {{in terms of their}} obligation, but differ from forward contracts in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> traded. They are commonly used by MNCs to hedge their currency positions. In addition they are traded by speculators who hope to capitalize on their expectations of exchange rate movements.|$|E
25|$|Although {{classes and}} {{structures}} {{are similar in}} both <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> declared {{and how they are}} used, there are some significant differences. Classes are reference types and structs are value types. A structure is allocated on the stack when it is declared and the variable is bound to its address. It directly contains the value. Classes are different because the memory is allocated as objects on the heap. Variables are rather managed pointers on the stack which point to the objects. They are references.|$|E

25|$|Pigs {{have been}} domesticated since ancient {{times in the}} Old World. Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that pigs were being managed in the wild in a way similar to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> managed by some modern New Guineans from wild boar as early as 13,000–12,700 BP in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, Nevalı Çori. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BP in Cyprus {{that must have been}} introduced from the mainland which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then. A separate domestication also occurred in China.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper lip}} is formed {{earlier than the}} palate, from the first three lobes named a to c above. Formation of the palate is the last step in joining the five {{embryonic}} facial lobes, and involves the back portions of the lobes b and c. These back portions are called palatal shelves, which grow towards each other until they fuse in the middle. This process is very vulnerable to multiple toxic substances, environmental pollutants, and nutritional imbalance. The biologic mechanisms of mutual recognition of the two cabinets, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> glued together, are quite complex and obscure despite intensive scientific research.|$|E
