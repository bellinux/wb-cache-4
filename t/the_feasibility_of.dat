Four propositions are presented in the paper. The first three propositions explain {{the nature of the}} up-down algorithm and the last one proves <b>the</b> implementation <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algorithm. The author also discusses <b>the</b> implementation <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> partially nested rectangular decision regions using the proposed algorithm.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} <b>the</b> thermodynamic <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> three reactions, one undesirable side reaction, and a flash separation for a water-splitting cycle. <b>The</b> thermodynamic <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> each {{reaction was}} analyzed using both an equilibrium constant based approach and through {{solution of the}} associated Gibbs free energy minimization problem. <b>The</b> thermodynamic <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> each reaction was determined {{at a variety of}} feed conditions, temperatures, and pressures. Future research will be conducted to determine optimal conditions at which to run the cycle to produce pure hydrogen and oxygen efficiently...|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was to decide on <b>the</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. <b>The</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and {{his understanding of the}} former made his advice invaluable.|$|E

5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> the approach.|$|E

5|$|From 1971 Texas Instruments {{had been}} making {{available}} the building block for a simple calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared {{in a number of}} Sinclair calculators. Clive Sinclair wanted to design a calculator to compete with the HP-35 using this series of chips.

5|$|In 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council {{discussed}} <b>the</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> {{building a}} road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic about the idea, {{as they did}} not believe it was financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the work on uranium {{was an effort to}} produce plutonium. After <b>the</b> <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> the world's first artificial nuclear reactor was demonstrated in Chicago at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium.
