5|$|In Southern Pacific Company v. Lowe, the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} where a {{shareholder}} receives a dividend representing earnings of a corporation realized by the corporation prior to January 1, 1913, <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> is not includible in the gross {{income of the}} shareholder for purposes of the Federal Income Tax Act of 1913, Ch. 16, 38 Stat. 114 (Oct. 3, 1913). No issues involving the definition of income with respect to wages, salary or other compensation for labor were decided by the Court.|$|E
5|$|The company {{announced}} post-tax profits in 1949 of £119,909 (tax: £140,500); for 1950 the figures were £164,704 and £201,500, respectively. Total dividend for those years was 30%. By 1952 the net profit was £146,318 (tax: £347,000) and in 1953 the respective figures were £228,583 and £449,000. <b>The</b> <b>dividend</b> {{for both of}} these years was 20%, but in 1953 {{there was also a}} special distribution of 2d/share for capital profits of £17,810 from sale of investments.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was paid in that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. An adjustment to the share capital was made, and in 1938 <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E

50|$|The company {{generally}} {{will guarantee}} that the policy's cash values will increase every year regardless {{of the performance of}} the company or its experience with death claims (again compared to universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance which can increase the costs and decrease the cash values of <b>the</b> policy). <b>The</b> <b>dividends</b> can be taken in one of three ways. The policy owner can be given a cheque from the insurance company for <b>the</b> <b>dividends,</b> <b>the</b> <b>dividends</b> can be used to reduce the premium payment, or <b>the</b> <b>dividends</b> can be reinvested back into the policy to increase the death benefit and the cash value at a faster rate. When <b>the</b> <b>dividends</b> paid on a whole life policy are chosen by the policy owner to be reinvested back into the policy, the cash value can increase at a rather substantial rate depending on the performance of the company.|$|R
5|$|From the 1840s, use of {{the river}} declined, {{as a result of}} {{competition}} from the railways, and changes in coastal shipping. Littlehampton grew in importance as a port and after years of resistance by the people of Arundel, the customs house was moved there in 1864. The Mid-Sussex Railway opened their line from Horsham to Pulborough and Petworth in 1859, which was extended to Ford and Littlehampton in 1863. Receipts from tolls had peaked at £2044 for the five years from 1835 to 1840, when a dividend of 11.8 percent was paid, but dropped quickly, raising just £389 for years between 1870 and 1875, when <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> was 1 percent.|$|E
5|$|Abir {{collected}} 70 tons {{of dried}} rubber in 1895, rising to 410 tons in 1898 {{by which time}} it had eleven operational posts. At {{the same time the}} price of rubber also increased from 6.30–6.50 fr per kilogram in 1894 to 8.04–10.00 fr per kilogram in 1898. Abir's costs in 1897 amounted to 0.25 fr per kilogram to purchase the rubber from the collectors (in lieu of tax), 0.4 fr for transportation, 0.25 in export duty paid to the Congo Free State and 0.45 for storage for a total cost of 1.35 fr per kilogram. In the same year Abir could sell on the rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr per kilogram. Abir's profits rose with the increasing quantity and price of rubber, for the first two years (1892–94) the company recorded a total profit of 131,340 fr, this had increased almost twentyfold by 1898 when they recorded a 2,482,697 fr profit just for one year. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> paid in 1898 was 1,100 fr per 500 fr share. These profits were made in spite of increasing costs due the doubling of export duty in 1892 and the construction of the Leopoldville-Matadi railway in 1894 which increased the cost of moving rubber to the coast to 0.63 fr per kilo, more than the entire trip to Antwerp had taken in 1892.|$|E
5|$|During 1938 and 1939, {{with war}} anticipated, an {{increasing}} part of Pick's {{time was spent}} in planning for the approaching conflict. The Railway Executive Committee was reconstituted in 1938 {{to act as a}} central coordinating body for the country's railways with Pick as the LPTB's representative. This role absorbed most of his time after the committee took over control of the railways on 1 September 1939. Following a disagreement {{with other members of the}} LPTB board over the government's proposals to limit <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> that it could pay to its shareholders, Pick stated his intention to retire from the board at the end of his seven-year appointment in May 1940. Pick had previously suggested a reorganisation of the LPTB's senior management structure and hoped to be able to continue with the organisation in some sort of joint general manager position. Ashfield chose not to find such a continuing role for Pick and, on 18 May 1940, to the surprise of many within the organisation, Pick retired from the LPTB board, officially due to failing health. Pick's post of chief executive was abolished and replaced with a group of six heads of department.|$|E
50|$|Debt-financed Dividends Received Limitation -Code Section 246A disallows {{the benefit}} of <b>the</b> <b>dividends</b> {{received}} deduction for debt financed purchases of corporate portfolio stock. As stated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the provision reduces <b>the</b> deduction for <b>dividends</b> received on debt-financed portfolio stock. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>dividends</b> received deduction is available only with respect to dividends “attributable” to stock financed through other means besides debt. A simple ratio is computed to determine what percentage of an investment is debt-financed. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>dividends</b> received deduction is reduced by {{the percentage of the}} investment funded by debt.|$|R

5|$|Payment of {{dividends}} {{to shareholders}} began in 1792, {{and over the}} next five years, tolls raised an average of £893 per year and <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> was 3.1 per cent. At this time, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them, he became chairman of the company. He then stopped the payment of dividends so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly. Apart from an interim payment in 1821, dividends were not reinstated until 1830. In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the canalisation of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham, and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal, which was seen {{as part of a larger}} scheme to link London to Portsmouth, an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641. He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811, at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal, and put up £20,000 of the initial £90,500 estimated cost. The canal opened in September 1816, but the estimated 100,000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth, and the 30,000 tons of local traffic, were far too optimistic, with actual traffic averaging around 15,000 tons per year throughout its life.|$|E
25|$|Division is {{essentially}} the inverse of multiplication. Division finds the quotient of two numbers, <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> divided by the divisor. Any dividend divided by0 is undefined. For distinct positive numbers, if <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> {{is larger than the}} divisor, the quotient is greater than1, otherwise it is less than1 (a similar rule applies for negative numbers). The quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields <b>the</b> <b>dividend.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ex-dividend date — the day {{on which}} shares bought and sold no longer come {{attached}} {{with the right to}} be paid the most recently declared dividend. In the United States, it is typically 2 trading days before the record date. This is an important date for any company that has many stockholders, including those that trade on exchanges, to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid <b>the</b> <b>dividend.</b> Existing holders of the stock will receive <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> even if they sell the stock on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the stock will not receive <b>the</b> <b>dividend.</b> It is relatively common for a stock's price to decrease on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equal to <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> paid. This reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the declaration of <b>the</b> <b>dividend.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} approach to valuing dividends is developed {{and applied to}} American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on Australian stocks. The values of ADR dividends are estimated from the period when, due to different ex-dividend dates, the ADRs and their underlying stocks trade with differential dividend entitlements. Australian ADR dividends are valued at less than their face value and <b>the</b> <b>dividends</b> on <b>the</b> underlying stocks are valued at more than their face value. This suggests that ADR dividends are priced by a clientele of US investors placing little value on the imputation tax credits attached to <b>the</b> <b>dividends</b> and that a clientele of Australian resident investors, who obtain value from imputation tax credits, price <b>the</b> <b>dividends</b> on <b>the</b> underlying stock...|$|R

25|$|The {{gains from}} the {{exploitation}} of rubber through the state and other companies like the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (ABIR) were huge. The original value in 1892 of the ABIR shares was 500 francs. In 1903 the shares had risen to 15,000 gold francs. <b>The</b> <b>dividend</b> in 1892 was 1 franc, but by 1903 <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> was 1,200 francs. These enormous gains came from horrible exploitation, and what Edmund Morel described as slavery. The scope of the destruction, together with disease and famine from forced labour, is estimated to have killed half of the native population of the colony.|$|E
25|$|A {{dividend}} from a {{small business}} ("Canadian-controlled private corporation") is grossed-up by 17 per cent, meaning that the shareholder includes 117 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>dividend</b> amount in income, to reflect the pre-tax income of the small business out of which it has paid <b>the</b> <b>dividend.</b> This income is taxed at the shareholder's personal income tax rate, but {{a part of the}} tax is offset by a 10.5217% dividend tax credit (for 2017) to reflect the federal tax paid at the corporate level.
