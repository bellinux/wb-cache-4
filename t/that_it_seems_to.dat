25|$|Second, Kennedy {{examined}} the statutory framework of Title VII, {{to determine whether}} Title VII's proscription of disparate treatment is afforded any lawful justifications in the disparate impact provision <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> conflict with. Looking to analogous Equal Protection cases, he reached the statutory construction that, in instances of conflict between the disparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions, permissible justifications for disparate treatment must be grounded in the strong-basis-in-evidence standard.|$|E

25|$|When {{the crisis}} loomed, {{one way to}} try to avert it was to simply start {{reducing}} the interest paid on discretionary and demand deposits. But such a move would have hurt the Medici name, and so it was undertaken too late. The bank's heavy leverage of their deposits meant that setbacks could be quite sudden. The fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been a common practice for Florentine banks to operate with as little as 5% of their deposits held in reserve lends further support to the idea that collapses could happen abruptly when bad loans were discovered. In addition to all of that, Lorenzo the Magnificent was not at all concerned about the bank. Instead, he chose to concentrate his time and his family's resources on patronizing artists and pursuing his own poetic and political interests.|$|E
25|$|One of the ‘B’ {{variants}} (Hill ‘6’) has a copyist’s gloss which {{proposes a}} meaning of ‘27,000 and 70 hides’ {{to make sense}} of the “27 and 70” reference: the “belong to it” refers to the entire list enumerated, a grand total. However, none of the ‘B’ lists can give us that total as they miss out between three and five burh. Therefore, the archetype of ‘B’ must have included these, as did that of ‘A’. However, by recalculating the mistranscriptions and supplying the missing burh figures from ‘A’ then the ‘restored’ total would be 28,671. Hill then turns to the second part of the final sentence “and 30 to the West Saxons”, this too is glossed as ‘30,000’ by the copyist ‘6’ so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> refer to hides; but Hill proposes that it refers to the 30 burh; there are in fact 31 of these in the combined lists, but he then proposes that Buckingham (at 1600 hides) is in fact Mercian, that is not of “the West Saxons”, so is not included in the grand total. The adjusted total of 27,071 then concurs with the final ‘B’ sentence/statement.|$|E

Sigurd enters the skjaldborg, and sees a warrior lying there—asleep and fully armed. Sigurd removes the helmet of the warrior, and sees {{the face of a}} woman. The woman's corslet is so tight <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have grown into the woman's body. Sigurd uses his sword Gram to cut the corslet, starting from the neck of the corslet downwards, he continues cutting down her sleeves, and takes the corslet off of her.|$|E

500|$|Iðunn is {{introduced}} in the Prose Edda in section 26 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning. Here, Iðunn is described as Bragi's wife and keeper of an eski (a wooden box made of ash wood and often used for carrying personal possessions) within which she keeps apples. The apples are bitten into by the gods when they begin to grow old and they then become young again, which is described as occurring up until Ragnarök. Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> him that the gods depend greatly upon Iðunn's good faith and care. With a laugh, High responds that misfortune once came close, that he could tell Gangleri about it, but first he must hear the names of more of the Æsir, and he continues providing information about gods.|$|E

Becky Bain of Idolator described it as [...] "the brats-on-parade clip", and wrote that the dedication to Yauch [...] "would be a nice sentiment if anything in this video resembled anything Yauch stood for". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice called it a [...] "dumb" [...] video and wrote that {{it reminded her of}} the [...] "Our Lips Are Sealed" [...] video by The Go-Go's.|$|E

500|$|The Face {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music journalists upon its release, later landing at number two and nine on the year-end lists of publications Beats per Minute and Pretty Much Amazing, respectively. Edmunds said that [...] "releasing music of this quality {{at such an}} early age and so early into their career only makes one excited {{as to what the}} future holds for them", concluding his review that [...] "The Face acts as a reminder to other producers to stay {{at the top of their}} game, because the kids are coming up from behind". Will Ryan, writing for Beats per Minute, called the record's four songs to be the some of the best club tracks of all time, labeling it a [...] "complete statement that overloads all possible cylinders, as vital as the ages of the producers behind it might suggest, delivered by a duo whose rise can only just qualify as meteoric". Sherburne, when interviewing Disclosure for Spin magazine, honored the EP as the duo's [...] "best and most varied" [...] release, noting its production to be [...] "yielding a high-end that’s filigreed with crystal and compression so pneumatic <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> suck the air from your lungs".|$|E

Props, too, for a behind-the-scenes doc that actually goes behind the scenes." [...] The Independent gave the release two out of five stars. The reviewer Andy Gill commented, [...] "For all the multitude of crotches spread about the stage, this is as unenticing as pop gets, utterly lifeless despite the fervent activity." [...] Mayer Nissim from Digital Spy felt that [...] "Despite its absurd charm, this CD won't provoke the rediscovery of Hard Candy <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> nudge towards. That said, it's still an entertaining blast from start to finish. And with the DVD record of her outstandingly outlandish tour bundled in, this is definitely worth the entry price for anyone who still has even half {{an interest in the}} Queen Mum of Pop." [...] Mark Beech from Bloomberg Television said that [...] "It’s intriguing how note-perfect Madonna is while running around and doing splits." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album three and a half out of five stars and wrote that it [...] "featured stirring remixes, like a fresh mash-up of [...] "Vogue" [...] with the brassy funk of Hard Candys [...] "4 Minutes"." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{church was}} found to have been free-standing, so any other monastic {{buildings}} must have stood apart. In 1966, archaeologists discovered the foundations of what they identified as probably a medieval building, rectangular and on an east-west axis, with its eastern wall aligned with that of the church precinct, which it pre-dated. Extending over and in contact with the western end of a Roman bath house, it stood a few yards east of the south-eastern corner of the 13th-century chancel. This building was not recorded by William Boys, who drew a plan of the Roman fort and the church in 1781. Otherwise no such buildings have been found, but they may all have been in the area {{to the north of the}} church, which has been lost to the sea. In this connection Peers noted that the cloisters of the early Canterbury churches of St Augustine's and Christ Church were both on their northern sides, and that St Augustine's had also been free-standing in the 7th century. A building that stood west-northwest of the church may have had an Anglo-Saxon doorway and the dimensions of an Anglo-Saxon church, and had [...] "the appearance of having been part of some monastic erection". It was demolished after the sea weakened its foundations during storms in the winter of 1782. Leland reported another building outside the churchyard, where it was believed that a parish church had stood while the main church at Reculver was still a monastery: this building, formerly a chapel dedicated to St James, was later known as the [...] "chapel-house", and stood in the north-eastern corner of the fort until it collapsed into the sea on 13October 1802. Peers noted further <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have had brick arches.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} widespread acclaim. Kate Stables {{wrote in}} Sight & Sound: [...] "Elegant restraint is the film’s watchword ... In this enjoyably deliberate film, each shot and scene is carefully composed {{to pay homage}} to 50s cinema, yet infused with an emotional ambiguity which feels decidedly contemporary." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said: [...] " [...] has made a serious melodrama about the geometry of desire, a dreamy example of heightened reality that fully engages emotions despite the exact calculations with which it's been made... 'Carol's' lush but controlled visual look is completely intoxicating. This is filmmaking done by masters, an experience to savor." [...] A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, 'Carol' is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows." [...] Amy Taubin from Film Comment said: [...] "The narrative, precisely chiseled by Phyllis Nagy from the ungainly novel, is deceptively simple ... What's remarkable about Carol is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> exist entirely in the present moment—to be precise, in that electric, elastic, heart-stopping/heart-racing present of romantic desire. It is a film composed of gestures and glances, its delicacy a veiled promise of abandon. And it could not exist without the extraordinary performances of Blanchett and Mara." [...] David Stratton of The Australian wrote: [...] "The meeting of these two women is an electrifying scene; their eyes make contact, and nothing of significance is said, apart from the usual interaction between shopper and shop assistant, but Haynes and his wonderful actors make it very clear that something momentous has occurred — love at first sight." ...|$|E
