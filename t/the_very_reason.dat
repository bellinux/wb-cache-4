The Wolof inhabitants of this kingdom united under their own emperor and formed the Jolof Empire around 1360 during a succession crisis that followed the death of Mansa Suleyman. It is unknown exactly why the Wolof broke away, but the destructive reign of Suleyman’s predecessor and nephew Maghan I {{may have played a}} role in Jolof’s motives if not <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> why future mansas could not do anything about it.|$|E
25|$|The omnipotent being cannot {{create such}} a stone because its power {{is equal to}} itself—thus, {{removing}} the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, {{it is possible for}} non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> that He is omnipotent.|$|E

I do remember that TV Guide did a quote that the three of us can be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I think that really captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why even bother otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all. I think Valene was headed to, and my sister’s like this, after years of doing everything for her husband and her children, Valene was going to further her achievements in the professional world. I think if you saw Valene today she’d be much more accomplished as a writer and would be very successful overall." [...] The actress also said: ...|$|E

500|$|From October 1455, Devon and {{his sons}} were {{committing}} acts of social disorder, seemingly intending to disrupt the administrative machinery of the county (of which Bonville, of course, was a part), for instance by preventing the local justices of the peace from holding quarterly sessions by force; they then proceeded to raise a small army at Tiverton {{under the leadership of}} Devon's eldest son, Thomas Courtenay. It was this force that was to be guilty of what R. L. Storey has called [...] "the most notorious private crime of the century," [...] due not only to the violence involved but {{the fact that it was}} [...] "so obviously premeditated." [...] This force made its way to Upcott on 23 October 1455, the home of Nicholas Radford, a close associate and legal advisor to Bonville, and a respected member of the community who had previously been recorder of the city of Exeter and member of parliament. Storey has suggested that being an experienced lawyer, he was most probably targeted by Devon {{and his sons}} for <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> that he had aided Bonville's escape from Devon's litigation in the past; and in January 1455 he had enfeoffed Bonville (and others) for land valued at £400.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics. Ramsey Isler of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "There {{was a time when}} [...] was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a peek into the show's creation." ...|$|E

While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, he said it is [...] "certainly something to aim for." [...] Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, [...] "I don't know that we'll keep to [...] every year", but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, [...] "so I {{think it would be}} fun to continue that sort of thing." [...] In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the [...] "rhythm" [...] that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like [...] "a big event or crossover series," [...] with Avengers films acting as [...] "big, giant linchpins." [...] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014, Feige stated, [...] "I think if you look at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> just laid out: it is about managing [...] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going." [...] After the titles were revealed in October 2014, Feige said, [...] "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [...] instead of just two, without changing our methods." ...|$|E

Kamboureli's stance is that long poem's readers and contributors should not preference one form of long poem over another. To extend this idea, it is also equally important {{to say that one}} type of author within this genre should not be privileged over another. The textual [...] "betweeness", an idea coined by Kamboureli and discussed in Keller's essay, provides a place where writers can create their art in a genre that is by its nature less restrictive than other poetic forms.

2500|$|Chad {{faced the}} same problem over {{ordination}} as Wilfrid, and so set off to seek ordination amid the chaos caused by the plague.

The most obvious reason for Chad's tortuous travels would be that he was also on a diplomatic mission from Oswiu, seeking to build an encircling alliance around Mercia, which was rapidly recovering from its position of weakness. From Canterbury he travelled to Wessex, where he was ordained by bishop Wini of the West Saxons and two British, i.e. Welsh, bishops. None of these bishops was recognised by Rome.

After George dies in the Battle of Waterloo, she brings up little George alone while living with her parents. She is completely dominated by her spendthrift father, who, it is revealed, sells the annuity Jos had provided to finance one of failing investment schemes and by her increasingly peevish mother. Amelia becomes obsessed with her son and the memory of her husband. She ignores William Dobbin, who courts her for years and treats him shabbily until he leaves.

2500|$|The Court did {{not simply}} take {{the city and}} the {{hospital}} at their word that their motivations were beneficent; rather, the Court examined all the evidence available to determine whether the special needs advanced were divorced from the generalized interest in law enforcement. [...] For example, in Railway Executives, the need to discover the cause of railway accidents justified the drug testing, and in Acton it was the need to promote a drug-free school environment. [...] In this case, however, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>reason</b> for the policy was to use the threat of arrest to motivate the women to abstain from using cocaine. [...] This fact was evident from the fact that police and prosecutors assisted the hospital staff in developing specimen collection and chain-of-custody procedures, the nature of possible criminal charges to which the patients would be subject, and how the police would be notified and the arrests would be accomplished. [...] "While the ultimate goal of the program may well have been to get the women in question into substance abuse treatment and off of drugs, the immediate objective of the searches was to generate evidence for law enforcement purposes in order to reach that goal." [...] Because the MUSC plan used the threat of arrest as the means to accomplish its overall goal of inducing pregnant women to abstain from using cocaine, [...] "this case simply does not fit within the closely guarded category of 'special needs.'"
