5|$|At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, {{many of them}} {{bearing the}} republic's vierkleur ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, {{independent}} republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then—Kruger persuaded them not <b>to,</b> <b>saying</b> this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.|$|E
5|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) confides in Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{that she}} is {{intending}} to stay in Tallahassee. Ryan interprets this as an invitation {{to hook up with}} her, so he attempts to seduce her by taking her to the empty kitchen to help her make a waffle. They hide under a table when the chefs return. After Ryan compliments Erin, she suggests that they could become roommates in Florida and possibly start dating in six months if things go well between them. Not wanting that long timeline, he resorts <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> he loves Kelly.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{relatively}} weak large cardinal axiom since it amounts <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> that ∞ is 1-inaccessible {{in the language of}} the next section, where ∞ denotes the least ordinal not in V, i.e. the class of all ordinals in your model.|$|E
25|$|This {{result is}} known as Cramér's {{decomposition}} theorem, and is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> that the convolution of two distributions is normal {{if and only if}} both are normal. Cramér's theorem implies that a linear combination of independent non-Gaussian variables will never have an exactly normal distribution, although it may approach it arbitrarily closely.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} the {{integral}} to be well-defined, the space S(X) must have the Radon–Nikodym property, and more specifically, the tangent space is restricted to those vectors that are square-integrable. Square integrability is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> that a Cauchy sequence converges to a finite value under the weak topology: the space contains it's limit points. Note that Hilbert spaces possess this property.|$|E
25|$|While Obama set a conciliatory {{tone for}} his {{relations}} with Venezuela during his candidacy, saying {{he would be willing}} to meet with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez without preconditions at a July 23, 2007, presidential debate, the Venezuelan leader had been fickle in his opinion of Obama.

25|$|While in {{principle}} the acceptable level of statistical significance {{may be subject}} to debate, the p-value is the smallest significance level that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This is logically equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic. Therefore, the smaller the p-value, the lower the probability of committing type I error.|$|E

25|$|A {{vector field}} on a {{manifold}} M {{can be defined}} as a function that inputs a point p of M and outputs an element of the tangent space of M at p. Equivalently, a vector field is a section of the tangent bundle of M. In the case where M is a Euclidean space, this definition is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> that a vector field is a function that inputs points and outputs vectors.|$|E
25|$|In the {{expression}} 6/x vision, the numerator (6) is the distance in meters between {{the subject and}} the chart and the denominator (x) the distance at which a person with 6/6 acuity would discern the same optotype. Thus, 6/12 means that a person with 6/6 vision would discern the same optotype from 12 meters away (i.e. at twice the distance). This is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> that with 6/12 vision, the person possesses half the spatial resolution and needs twice the size to discern the optotype.|$|E
25|$|During Savile's lifetime, {{sporadic}} {{allegations of}} child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but only became widely publicised after his death. Savile claimed {{the key to his}} success on Jim'll Fix It had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> this to deflect scrutiny of his personal life. He did not own a computer as he did not want anybody to think he was downloading child pornography. His autobiography As it Happens (1974, reprinted as Love is an Uphill Thing, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.|$|E

25|$|Using the {{standard}} definition from universal algebra, a free complete lattice over a generating set S {{is a complete}} lattice L together with a function i:S→L, such that any function f from S to the underlying set of some complete lattice M can be factored uniquely through a morphism f° from L to M. Stated differently, for every element s of S we find that f(s) = f°(i(s)) and that f° is the only morphism with this property. These conditions basically amount <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> {{that there is a}} functor from the category of sets and functions to the category of complete lattices and join-preserving functions which is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from complete lattices to their underlying sets.|$|E
25|$|When Fancourt retired {{at the end}} of the 1952–53 season, Adams {{became the}} company's {{principal}} bass-baritone, regularly playing Dick Deadeye in H.M.S. Pinafore, the Pirate King, Colonel Calverley, the Earl of Mountararat, the Mikado of Japan, Sir Roderic in Ruddigore, Sergeant Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Arac in Princess Ida (when that opera was revived in 1954). From 1961 to 1963, he also played Sergeant Bouncer in Cox and Box. Although he had admired Fancourt, when he took over the roles, Adams asked Bridget D'Oyly Carte if he could create his own characterisations, which she agreed <b>to,</b> <b>saying</b> she would tell him if he overstepped the mark. Adams continued as the principal bass-baritone of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company until 1969. In 1952 he married D'Oyly Carte soprano Muriel Harding (1920–90).|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was furious}} over the {{official}} decision and argued with the officials {{claiming that he}} should be declared the winner and not Austin. On the following night's Raw, Hart came to the ring unannounced {{at the beginning of the}} show and began venting his frustrations toward Vince McMahon over how he believed that the finish to the Royal Rumble was just another in a long string of screwings and broken promises that had been dogging Hart since he returned to the company. He demanded that he receive the title shot that the winner of the Royal Rumble is entitled <b>to,</b> <b>saying</b> that as far as he was concerned he won the match. McMahon simply ignored him and walked to his broadcast position, and an incensed Hart finally decided he had had enough and declared he was quitting the WWF.|$|E
