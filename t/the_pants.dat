5|$|USC first fielded an American {{football}} team in 1888. Playing its first game on November 14 {{of that year}} against the Alliance Athletic Club, in which USC gained a 16–0 victory. Frank Suffel and Henry H. Goddard were playing coaches for the first team which was put together by quarterback Arthur Carroll; who in turn volunteered to make <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> for the team and later became a tailor. USC faced its first collegiate opponent the following year in fall 1889, playing St. Vincent's College to a 40–0 victory. In 1893, USC joined the Intercollegiate Football Association of Southern California (the forerunner of the SCIAC), which was composed of USC, Occidental College, Throop Polytechnic Institute (Cal Tech), and Chaffey College. Pomona College was invited to enter, but declined to do so. An invitation was also extended to Los Angeles High School.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of 3 D virtual fitting technology when visualizing the fit and silhouette of <b>pants</b> by analyzing <b>the</b> similarities between real and virtual fit using 20 fit locations, 3 lower body shapes, and fit status was investigated. We produced 61 custom <b>pants</b> for <b>the</b> participants and virtually tried each on a personalized 3 D body scan avatar. The technology {{was not generally}} effective for visualizing <b>pant</b> fit. Especially, <b>the</b> waist placement of <b>the</b> virtual <b>pants</b> was lower than that for <b>the</b> actual <b>pants.</b> <b>The</b> virtual software indicated less ease than <b>the</b> actual <b>pants</b> and could not express stress folds due to slight misfit. The front silhouette of <b>the</b> virtual <b>pants</b> spread wider than <b>the</b> real <b>pants.</b> <b>The</b> virtual <b>pants</b> for females with a hip tilt shape had the greatest divergence from <b>the</b> actual <b>pants.</b> <b>The</b> virtual <b>pants</b> with good fit appeared more effectively than did those with poor fit...|$|R
30|$|Second, the {{manufacturing}} comparisons and contrasts of two pant styles (suit pants and casual <b>pants)</b> showed that <b>the</b> amount of seam allowance {{from the back}} crotch line to the waistline in <b>the</b> suit <b>pants</b> varied {{to allow for the}} alteration of the waist circumference. <b>The</b> casual <b>pants,</b> however, had <b>the</b> same amount of seam allowance throughout <b>the</b> <b>pant.</b> Also, results showed that <b>the</b> menswear <b>pants</b> lining was manufactured only in the front for suit <b>pants.</b> Occasionally, <b>the</b> back <b>pants</b> lining was necessary for casual pants.|$|R

25|$|The NFL added new Color Rush uniforms for all 32 teams {{during the}} 2016-17 season, {{specifically}} for Thursday Night Football games. The Vikings showed off an all purple look with gold numbers and stripes on <b>the</b> <b>pants,</b> debuting their own Color Rush uniform on December 1 versus the Dallas Cowboys at U.S. Bank Stadium.|$|E
25|$|A fly is a {{covering}} over an opening join concealing the mechanism, {{such as a}} zipper, velcro or buttons, used to join the opening. In trousers, this is most commonly an opening covering the groin, which makes <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> easier to put on or take off. The opening also allows men to urinate without lowering their trousers.|$|E

25|$|From 1980 to 1988, the Kings {{modified}} {{their uniforms}} {{to include a}} contrasting yoke that extends from sleeve to sleeve. White was also added to the socks, on the tail stripes, and {{at the bottom of}} the yoke, but the color was removed from <b>the</b> <b>pants.</b> The names and numbers were also modified to a standard NHL block lettering.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} {{problems}} with the uniforms themselves. <b>The</b> <b>pants</b> for chokuninkan were designated as being white, but in Europe white pants were only worn in court uniforms on special occasions. This issue was even pointed out by Otto von Bismarck when the Iwakura mission visited Germany. On September 18, 1877, an edict of the Dajō-kan brought these pants into line with the coats, changing them to the same black wool material.|$|E

In a surprise to both the players and the fans, Coach Danny Ford unveiled new orange uniform pants for the Tigers to wear. This {{was the first time in}} Clemson's history that they wore orange pants in any combination for a football game. Inspired by <b>the</b> <b>pants,</b> the underdog Tigers defeated the Gamecocks, 27–6.|$|E
25|$|For {{the college}} section, boys wear white shirts and long white pants while girls wear medium-sleeved, pleated white blouses and a short, pleated green skirt, with some {{choosing}} to wear shorts along with it. Uniform for Year 5-6 boys is largely {{similar to that}} for Year 1-4 boys, except in the pleats in <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> {{and the back of}} the shirt and the cotton material. The college badge is identical to RI's pre-1990s design; during that period RI slightly modified its badge design.|$|E

30|$|On {{the front}} pattern, as expected, all {{menswear}} brands kept the pleats when they developed the lining pattern of <b>the</b> one-pleat <b>pants</b> or <b>the</b> two-pleat <b>pants</b> designs. However, {{there was a}} slight change on the back pattern; 61.5 % of brands (8 out of 13) kept the dart, while 38.5 % (5 out of 13) converted the dart into one tuck. This change in construction increased when there were two darts on the back of <b>the</b> <b>pant.</b> 46.2 % of brands (6 out of 13) kept the two darts on the back of <b>the</b> <b>pant,</b> 15.4 % (2 out of 13) of brands merged the two darts into one dart, 7.7 % (1 out of 13) converted the darts into one tuck, and 30.8 % (3 out of 13) of brands converted the darts into two tucks.|$|R
25|$|In June 2013, the new dark navy uniform was {{introduced}} to all officers as the new standard. <b>The</b> <b>pants</b> are made from rip-stop fabric, the undergarment made from cotton stretch which can be short sleeved or long sleeved and is to be worn under the ballistic vest. Baseball caps remained, although they are darker in colour than pre 2013. The new dark uniform was designed to look more professional and to hide blood, dirt and sweat. The dark blue uniform was modelled after the Oxfordshire and Northumberland police attires.|$|E
25|$|Hot Springs Basin {{is located}} 15 miles (24km) {{north-northeast}} of Fishing Bridge and {{has one of}} Yellowstone's largest collections of hot springs and fumaroles. The geothermal features there release large amounts of sulfur. This makes water from the springs so acidic that it has dissolved holes in <b>the</b> <b>pants</b> of people who sit on wet ground and causes mounds of sulfur three feet (1 m) high to develop around fumaroles. The very hot acidic water and steam have also created voids in the ground that are only covered by a thin crust.|$|E
25|$|Trousers {{underwent}} a notable {{change in the}} 1820s. The new fit {{was a product of}} the French Revolution as it was considered uncouth to wear attire that looked wealthy. The length of the pant changed from below the knee to below the ankle and the fit of the pant loosened slightly from {{the first decade of the}} 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>pants</b> featured a small waistline and flared out slightly at the hip with small pleats, creating the image of fullness in the hip region. The introduction of straps that went under the foot, known as stirrup pants, also changed the shape and fit of these trousers.|$|E

The team commonly wore light blue pants on the road with the white jerseys from 1972 through 1994, {{with the exception of the}} 1980 season, and selected games in the mid 80s, when the team wore an all-white road combination. For selected games in 1973 and 1974, and again from 1981 through 1984, the Oilers wore their white jerseys at home. The light blue pants were discarded by coach Jeff Fisher in 1995.|$|E
