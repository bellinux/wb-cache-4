5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} between the various water hemlock species and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock has a single tap root. Another reliable method to identify water hemlock is to examine <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> veins. Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> tips, rather than extend {{to the tip of}} <b>the</b> <b>leaf,</b> as is found in <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> structure of other members of this family.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> surface.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.spinulosa has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> litter.

5|$|Most millipedes are detritivores {{and feed}} on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play {{important}} roles in the breakdown and decomposition of plant litter: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all leaf litter, depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> litter in a region. <b>The</b> <b>leaf</b> litter is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where earthworm populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes {{play an important role}} in facilitating microbial decomposition of <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> litter. Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi. A few species are omnivorous or occasionally carnivorous, feeding on insects, centipedes, earthworms, or snails. Some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to suck up plant juices.|$|E

In game five, he scored three goals and two assists to lead <b>the</b> <b>Leafs</b> to a 9-3 victory. He also scored the game-winning goal in game six. What makes his accomplishment more successful is that he was not put in the lineup until <b>the</b> <b>Leafs</b> were down 3-0; <b>the</b> <b>Leafs</b> won all four games in which he was dressed. Metz finished the series with four goals and three assists.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>leaf</b> {{blades of}} the summer rosettes of P. moranensis are smooth, rigid, and succulent, varying from bright yellow-green to maroon in colour.

5|$|The {{leaves of}} B. grossa are adapted to a dry climate.

Cladistic analysis suggests this species and its relatives in the series Abietinae developed long narrow leaves with inrolled margins as they invaded drier climates in Australia's southwest, having evolved from ancestors with broad leaves.|$|E

5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual leaf blade around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
5|$|Weaver ant (Oecophylla spp.) workers build nests {{in trees}} by {{attaching}} leaves together, first pulling {{them together with}} bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> edges.

5|$|All North American Drosera species {{except for}} D. anglica have a {{chromosome}} count of 2n=20.

Since <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> morphology of D. anglica is an intermediary between that of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis and the two occur sympatrically in several locations, Wood conjectured that D. anglica likely originated from a hybrid between these two.|$|E

5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge.

In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a {{backcross}} with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends at the base of <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> blade, the pinnae are more shallowly lobed and the enlargement of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of <b>the</b> <b>leaf</b> blade, the overall shape of the blade tends to be more distinctly lance-shaped, and the fronds are somewhat more deeply cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by chromosome doubling, is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi. On close examination, its spores are found to be abortive, and the sori are smaller and not do not become fused with each other as they grow, as they do in fertile A.bradleyi.|$|E
5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Rhytismataceae. A {{widespread}} species, particularly in temperate areas, it colonizes the dead fallen leaves of vascular plants, particularly oak and chestnut.
