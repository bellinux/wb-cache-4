5|$|The USB2.0 {{specification}} {{was released}} in April 2000 and was ratified by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) {{at the end of}} 2001. Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Lucent Technologies (now Nokia), NEC, and Philips jointly led <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> develop a higher data transfer rate, with the resulting specification achieving 480Mbit/s, 40 times as fast as the original USB 1.1 specification.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed when}} Sadat, {{in the face}} of protests from his senior commanders, ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, hoping to relieve Israeli pressure on the Syrians. The resulting offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, culminating in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any of its objectives. This gave the Israelis <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> launch a counteroffensive.|$|E

5|$|A {{bill was}} passed by both the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara on 19 and 20 January 1993 respectively. The bill, which {{proposed}} to remove legal immunity was approved by six out of nine sultans—but saw stiff opposition from three, two of which included the Ismail Petra, the Sultan of Kelantan and the Sultan Iskandar himself. Sultan Iskandar took up <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> obtain more royal support to stall {{the implementation of the}} proposed bill. The bill, which proposed to strip rulers and members of the royal families of legal immunity, would make them prosecutable by the law in any cases of proven criminal wrongdoings.|$|E
5|$|Biman Bangladesh Airlines was {{established}} on 4 January 1972 as Bangladesh's national airline under the Bangladesh Biman Ordinance (Presidential Order No. 126). <b>The</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> launch the flag carrier {{was taken by}} 2,500 former employees, including ten Boeing 707 commanders and seven other pilots of Pakistan International Airlines, who submitted a proposal to the government on 31 December 1971 following the independence of Bangladesh. The airline was initially called Air Bangladesh but was soon changed to its current name.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Norwegian {{authorities}} {{decided to}} extend its operations in Antarctica by establishing an all-year research station. By then, Norway was the only country with a territorial claim to Antarctica to not have an all-year research station on the continent. Construction was carried out from December 2004 through February 2005. To ease logistics, Norway took <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs. The permanent Troll Airfield was opened on 11 February 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, she was {{the leader}} of <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> {{challenge}} the constitutionality of the Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for anti-censorship campaigners; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. Krug warned that the filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the East African Legislative Assembly {{passed a}} {{resolution}} supporting {{the establishment of a}} UNPA, and urged the East African Community to take <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> promote the development of a common African position in support of the envisaged Parliamentary Assembly. The resolution, which argued that a UNPA would improve the U.N.'s transparency, accountability and effectiveness, was proposed by Mike Sebalu and supported by Makongoro Nyerere, Frederic Ngenzebuhoro, Adam Kimbisa, Dan Kidega, Nusura Tiperu, and Abubakar Zein Abubakar.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle is}} {{controversial}} because many historians and writers {{have concluded that}} it was failures by British divisional and corps commanders that squandered an opportunity to capture Caen, rather than the Germans achieving a defensive success. To resist the offensive, the Germans had committed their most powerful armoured reserves, which deprived them of the fighting power for a counter-offensive and forfeited <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> the Allies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} a citywide wireless internet network, initiated in 2003 by city councilmember Gary Schiff, aimed to both offer city residents with wireless access for around $20 per month, {{and also to}} improve city services such as fire and police by giving them greater access to information while en route or on-site anywhere in the city. Bridging the digital divide in the city was also a stated goal for the network.|$|E
5|$|The success {{achieved}} by Operation Badr surprised Egyptian commanders, whose confidence soared. Sadat came {{under pressure to}} press the offensive towards the Sinai Passes, but remained unyielding, holding to the original goal of waging a limited war. Ahmed Ismail and Shazly were also on par with Sadat's opinion. However, appeals from the Syrians, whose situation was desperate by October 9, ultimately forced Sadat {{to change his mind}} for political reasons, against the protests of his commanders. Consequently, Egypt would lose <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> Israel when it launched its unsuccessful attack eastwards on October 14.|$|E

50|$|In 1978, Proposition 13, <b>the</b> People's <b>Initiative</b> <b>to</b> Limit Property Taxation, was enacted, {{causing the}} free public {{education}} to be eliminated. (Since tuition was still banned under the act, {{the word was}} replaced with per-unit enrollment fees.) Though the costs were low, many taxpayers were very angered by it, though {{this might have been}} because of the direct effects of <b>the</b> People's <b>Initiative</b> <b>to</b> Limit Property Taxation.|$|R
5|$|To ease logistics, Norway took <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a {{cooperation between}} the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs. Having an airfield at Troll allows quicker transport to the research stations in western Queen Maud Land, which are located further away from the incumbent airfields at Henriksenskjera and Novolazarevskaya. The first flight that was a preliminary to DROMLAN was made in 2000 from Cape Town, South Africa, to Henriksenskjera, where a Twin Otter was used onwards to Troll.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person who}} {{took up the}} {{initiative}} in the late 1950s was Rangvald Iversen, who was plant manager at Norwegian Talc at Knarrevik. The plant had large costs freighting their products across the sound on the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry. In 1958, he took <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> conduct a traffic count, which along with estimates of increased traffic from other places that had replaced a ferry with a bridge, would give estimates for the revenue from tolls. Norwegian Talc also paid for a draft plan for a bridge. In 1959, Iversen presented an estimate that a bridge would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans. In 1960, the bridge {{was included in the}} road plan for Hordaland.|$|E
5|$|Count Horn {{directed}} the Prince of Holstein-Beck {{to take the}} village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action. The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain. Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn {{up in front of}} Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but soon came under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1536, the north of England was convulsed {{in a series of}} uprisings collectively known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the most serious {{opposition}} to Henry's policies. Cromwell and Cranmer were the primary targets of the protesters' fury. Cromwell and the king worked furiously to quell the rebellion, while Cranmer kept a low profile. After it was clear that Henry's regime was safe, the government took <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> remedy the evident inadequacy of the Ten Articles. The outcome after months of debate was The Institution of a Christian Man informally known from the first issue as the Bishops' Book. The book was initially proposed in February 1537 in the first vicegerential synod, ordered by Cromwell, for the whole Church. Cromwell opened the proceedings, but as the synod progressed, Cranmer and Foxe took on the chairmanship and the co-ordination. Foxe did most of the final editing and the book was published in late September.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only did}} Gibbons work {{to repair the}} damage to the company offices, he made it a {{priority}} to allow its staff to deal with their personal situations. He made staff members job descriptions more flexible, encouraging staff members to take <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> perform a wide range of tasks. A corporate day care system was established, allowing staff to bring their children to work. Staff members were allowed to take off as much time as needed to reestablish themselves and corporate dress codes were relaxed. The company brought in counselors, insurance experts, tax consultants, child care advisers and construction companies to help the staff reorient themselves. The company also {{went so far as to}} arrange emergency loans for its employees.|$|E
5|$|Puducherry {{sustained}} {{relatively minor}} damage in November as the depression largely remained offshore; some trees were downed and several banana and sugarcane plantations at Kuttchipalayam were severely damaged. Puducherry reported receiving 55.7mm of rainfall over the 24-hour period from 14–15 November. Water entered several houses in low-lying areas, while three houses collapsed in Uppalam. Mudaliarpet, parts of Rainbow Nagar, Muthialpet, Krishna Nagar and Lawspet Main Road were inundated, along with portions of roadways near Karuvadikkuppam and the Shivaji statue on the ECR, causing traffic problems. Several roads were badly damaged, hindering motorists, while {{some members of}} the public took <b>the</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>to</b> begin clearing areas of water without directions from the government. Chief Minister N Rangasamy stated the official machinery had been readied in preparation for any flooding, while local administration officials closed all schools and colleges in Puducherry and Karaikal districts on 16 November, anticipating further rainfall.|$|E
