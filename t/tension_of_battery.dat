Its charging profile forms the basis for an efficient battery charger design for the battery. As a remedial solution, this study proposes a mathematical model to capture the charging profiles <b>of</b> the lithium-titanate <b>battery</b> at different charging rates and ambient temperatures. In this aspect, the charging characteristic <b>of</b> lithium-titanate <b>battery</b> is represented by a transfer function, which is applicable for small-signal analysis and large-signal simulation <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> charger design.

The objective of this study was comparison of the ability of humic acids of different origin (soil, water, peat, lignite etc.) to influence the surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> their solutions, and identification of the structural characteristics of peat humic acids that determine their surfactant properties. Industrially produced humic materials demonstrated no or insignificant impact on the surface <b>tension</b> <b>of</b> their solutions.
