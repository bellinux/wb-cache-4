5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above the frequency of <b>the</b> <b>fluorescent</b> light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E

Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate <b>the</b> <b>fluorescent</b> dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} were to correlate <b>the</b> modified <b>fluorescent</b> method with <b>the</b> conventional Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) method {{for the detection}} of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and, also to study the efficacy and advantages of using the auramine-rhodamine stain on lymph node aspirates under fluorescent microscopy. Methods: In 108 consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of tuberculosis (TB) presenting with lymphadenopathy, fine needle aspirations were performed. Smears from the aspirates were processed for routine cytology, the conventional ZN method, and <b>the</b> modified <b>fluorescent</b> method. <b>The</b> significance of <b>the</b> modified <b>fluorescent</b> method over <b>the</b> conventional ZN method was analyzed using the chi-square test. Results: Out of 108 aspirates, 102 were studied and remaining 6 were excluded from the study due to diagnosis of malignancy in 4. 04 &#x 0025; (4 / 6) and inadequate aspiration in 2. 02 &#x 0025; (2 / 6). Among the 102 aspirates, 44. 11 &#x 0025; (45 / 102) were positive for AFB on the conventional ZN method, 58. 9 &#x 0025; (60 / 102) were indicative of TB on cytology, while the smear positive increased to 81. 37 &#x 0025; (83 / 102) on <b>the</b> modified <b>fluorescent</b> method. Conclusions: <b>Fluorescent</b> microscopy has <b>the</b> advantage of speed and ease of screening, and reduces observer fatigue. <b>The</b> modified <b>fluorescent</b> method was found to be more advantageous than routine cytology and conventional ZN method, particularly in paucibacillary cases. The bacillary positivity rates were higher in <b>the</b> modified <b>fluorescent</b> method than in the ZN method. Hence, <b>the</b> modified <b>fluorescent</b> method can be an adjuvant when used with routine cytology for the identification of AFB...|$|R

25|$|Fluorescent {{fragment}} linkage may {{alter the}} folding or {{structure of the}} protein of interest, leading to the elimination of an interacting protein's surface binding site.

25|$|Fluorescent light {{fixtures}} cannot {{be connected to}} dimmer switches intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts, and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in <b>the</b> <b>fluorescent</b> tube at low power levels. Dimming installations require a compatible dimming ballast. These systems keep the cathodes of <b>the</b> <b>fluorescent</b> tube fully heated even as the arc current is reduced, promoting easy thermionic emission of electrons into the arc stream.
