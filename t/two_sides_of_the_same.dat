25|$|An {{isosceles}} triangle has {{two sides of}} equal length. An {{isosceles triangle}} also has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles opposite to the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> length; this fact is {{the content of the}} isosceles triangle theorem, which was known by Euclid. Some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define an isosceles triangle as one with at least two equal sides. The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles. The 45–45–90 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is isosceles.|$|E

[...] "They all work under the implicit assumption that some people matter much less than others, and that all people are of interest {{only as long as}} they are needed to support the system or to justify it." [...] She notes that many prominent advocates for women's rights such as Jane Addams and Sylvia Pankhurst were pacifists.

500|$|In {{her efforts}} to vividly {{describe}} the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies. She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to [...] "capricious tyrants" [...] who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin. Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance. And like the rich, women's [...] "softness" [...] has [...] "debased mankind".|$|E
500|$|Alfredson has {{described}} the casting process as {{the most difficult part}} of making the film. He had particular concerns about the interaction between the two leads, and the fact that those who had read the book would have a preconceived notion of how the characters were supposed to look. He wanted the actors to look innocent, and be able to interact in front of the camera. They were supposed to be [...] "mirror images of each other. She is everything he isn't. Dark, strong, brave, and a girl. (...) Like <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin." [...] On another occasion, Alfredson stated that [...] "asting is 70 percent of the job; it's not about picking the right people to make the roles. It is about creating chords, how a B and A minor interact together, and are played together." [...] In the end, Alfredson expressed satisfaction with the result, and has frequently lauded Hedebrant and Leandersson for being [...] "extremely intelligent", [...] "incredibly wise", and [...] "unprecedentedly fantastic." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the start}} of her career Koda has been writing the lyrics to her songs. On her second studio album, Grow into One, Koda wasn't as much {{involved}} with {{the writing of the}} lyrics, as only four songs were written by her. Koda's control over the writing of the lyrics grew with her thirty-third single [...] "Yume no Uta / Futari de... The single was originally intended to be a single song about [...] "happy love", however Koda felt the melody had represented both the elements of happiness and sadness. She wrote the lyrics for both songs to represent the sadness and the happiness. In doing so Koda ended up creating two songs with the same melody. She remarked, [...] "It was a first time experiment for me, but I was able to convey how happiness and sadness are <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin." [...] Koda lists Janet Jackson, Christina Aguilera, and Beyoncé Knowles as her inspirations; she has also stated that when she produces, she [...] "is like a different person"; thus, she refers to herself in the third person and [...] "looks at [...] objectively".|$|E

500|$|VanAirsdale {{cited the}} release date and {{screening}} {{as the third}} and fourth reasons; he said there was confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that Toronto is [...] "a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month" [...] and that [...] "this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn’t travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and L.A. bows." [...] The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned Ty Burr's review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is [...] "ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization" [...] and that [...] "he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin.

500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{depictions of}} the death or murder of Troilus are on shield bands {{from the turn of}} the 7th into the 6th century BC found at Olympia. On these, a warrior with a sword is about to stab a naked youth at an altar. On one, Troilus clings to a tree (which Boitani takes for the laurel sacred to Apollo). [...] A crater contemporary with this shows Achilles at the altar holding the naked Troilus upside down while Hector, Aeneas and an otherwise unknown Trojan Deithynos arrive in the hope of saving the youth. In some depictions Troilus is begging for mercy. On an amphora, Achilles has the struggling Troilus slung over his shoulder as he goes to the altar. Boitani, in his survey of the story of Troilus through the ages, considers it of significance that two artifacts (a vase and a sarcophagus) from different periods link Troilus' and Priam's death by showing them on the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> item, {{as if they were the}} beginning and end of the story of the fall of Troy. [...] Achilles is the father of Neoptolemus, who slays Priam at the altar during the sack of Troy. Thus the war opens with a father killing a son and closes with a son killing a father.|$|E

2500|$|Neuroticism, also a Big Five {{personality}} trait, {{is defined}} as an enduring tendency to experience unpleasant emotions (e.g., anger, anxiety, depression) easily. [...] Those high in neuroticism react more negatively to stress, are prone to anxiety, and susceptible to feelings of helplessness. [...] Neuroticism, when examined as part of core self-evaluations, is conceptualized as its opposite, emotional stability (i.e., non-neuroticism). In fact, because neuroticism and emotional stability are simply labels for <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> trait, they are often used interchangeably in literature.|$|E
2500|$|The {{movement}} {{consisted of}} the boycott of foreign goods and also the social boycott of any Indian who used foreign goods. The Swadeshi movement {{consisted of the}} usage of natively produced goods. Once foreign goods were boycotted, there was a gap {{which had to be}} filled by the production of those goods in India itself. Bal Gangadhar Tilak said that the Swadeshi and Boycott movements are <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin. The large Bengali Hindu middle-class (the Bhadralok), upset at the prospect of Bengalis being outnumbered in the new Bengal province by Biharis and Oriyas, felt that Curzon's act was punishment for their political assertiveness. [...] The pervasive protests against Curzon's decision took the form predominantly of the Swadeshi ("buy Indian") campaign led by two-time Congress president, Surendranath Banerjee, and involved boycott of British goods.|$|E
2500|$|Cliff Curtis as Searle, the ship's {{doctor and}} {{psychological}} officer. He {{is obsessed with}} the Sun and how it looks when staring at it without any type of protection. The role of Searle was originally written to be a [...] "slightly stiff" [...] British character. Curtis {{was drawn to the}} role based on the script and also expressed interest in working with the director. Boyle was familiar with Curtis from Training Day (2001) and Whale Rider (2002), and Curtis's audition appealed to Boyle strongly enough to cast the actor as Searle. Curtis initially foresaw an esoteric approach for his character, but he later pursued a military and scientific approach based on the seriousness of the mission. The actor also compared Searle to the character of Pinbacker, noting their similarities and differences: [...] " [...] would sacrifice those beliefs and views, his life, for the greater good, whereas Pinbacker, who's come to a place he believes is right, would sacrifice the world for his beliefs. They're <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{meaning in}} English {{has changed over}} time, however, and came to mean an insincere flatterer. The common thread in the older and current {{meanings}} is that the sycophant is in both instances portrayed {{as a kind of}} parasite, speaking falsely and insincerely in the accusation or the flattery for gain. [...] The Greek plays often combined in one single character the elements of the parasite and the sycophant, and the natural similarities of the two closely related types led to the shift in the meaning of the word. [...] The sycophant in both meanings can also be viewed as <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin: the same person currying one's favor by insincere flattery is also spreading false tales and accusations behind one's back. [...] In Renaissance English, the word was used in both senses and [...] meanings, that of the Greek informer, and the current sense of a [...] "flattering parasite", with both being cast as enemies—not only of those they wrong, but also of the person or state that they ostensibly serve.|$|E
2500|$|Sumner was {{a friend}} of Samuel Gridley Howe and a guiding force for the American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, started in 1863. He {{was one of the most}} {{prominent}} advocates for suffrage for blacks, along with free homesteads and free public schools. His uncompromising attitude did not endear him to moderates and his arrogance and inflexibility often inhibited his effectiveness as a legislator. [...] He was largely excluded from work on the Thirteenth Amendment, in part because he did not get along with Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and did much of the work on it. Sumner introduced an alternative amendment that combined the Thirteenth Amendment with elements of the Fourteenth Amendment. It would have abolished slavery and declared that [...] "all people are equal before the law." [...] During Reconstruction, he often attacked civil rights legislation as inadequate and fought for legislation to give land to freed slaves and to mandate education for all, regardless of race, in the South. [...] He viewed segregation and slavery as <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin. He introduced a civil rights bill in 1872 to mandate equal accommodation in all public places and required suits brought under the bill to be argued in the federal courts. The bill failed, but Sumner revived it in the next Congress, and on his deathbed begged visitors to see that it did not fail.|$|E
