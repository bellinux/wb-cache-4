5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant {{version of the same}} meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs as well as how longer they <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> to prepare it. The chefs are then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.|$|E

Saying he would appear if asked, Ahern defended his record while in government, attributing the crisis in banking to international factors and the banks’ over-exposure to borrowing on international markets. [...] "By and large we all know what happened. The banks borrowed money on the open market in the short-term. And as soon as things went, they had to pay that money up but they hadn’t got it to pay," [...] he said. [...] "That's what happened.

[...] He continued saying, [...] "The greater issue was the protection and the regulation of the bank rather than consumers’ interests." [...] Mr Ahern also said that people were [...] "jumping over developers" [...] but also needed to remember they employed 200,000 people. He said that {{one of the first things}} that Brian Cowen had done when he became minister for finance was to abolish many of the property tax incentives. He also stood over many of the incentives that benefited property developers. [...] "When they were brought in, the place was in a disastrous way. Look at the quays in Dublin. There were reports around for 40 years that said the quays needed something done about them and nothing happened until we brought in the urban renewal status and gave the tax incentives." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of research into the opinion of peasants on whether agriculture in Yugoslavia can be socialized, their attitudes towards socialization and their opinion as to whether self-management can replace the »feeling of ownership« over the land as a possible condition for its successful cultivation. The answers of peasants from different republics and provinces are compared, of younger and older peasants, »richer« and »poorer« peasants, and especially the answers of peasants who are and who are not members of the League of Communists. Research showed the most numerous to be those pesants who consider that socialization <b>will</b> <b>take</b> place because the peasants themselves will see that is the best solution for them. The number of those who subjectively desire socialization to take place is larger than the number of those who think that socialization <b>will</b> <b>take</b> place, but the number of those who do not desire socialization is also greater than the number of those who <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not <b>take</b> place. There is a more or less similar number of those who think that a »feeling of ownership« is necessary for successful land cultivation as those who <b>think</b> <b>it</b> does not matter who the land belongs to. About two thirds of the peasants who insist on the need of a »feeling of ownership« think that such a feeling can be replaced by self-management, and one third <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> cannot. Furthermore, younger respondents on an average have a more positive stand towards socialization and a more realistic relationship towards the »feeling of ownership«. There is more polarization in attitudes concerning socialization among the »richer« peasants than among those with less land. Finally, members of the League of Communists have a somewhat more positive attitude towards socialization and self-management, but some of the peasants- -Communists expressed attitudes towards the Party policy of socializing expressed attitudes towards the Party policy of socializing agriculture that are more negative than the attitudes of a great number of non-members of the League of Communists...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the amount of homework assigned to sophomore and senior high school students of White Plains High School, White Plains, New York, during a typical school day, and to determine certain parent, teacher and student reactions and expectations relative to those assignments. The subject areas for which homework assignments were studied in detail, and upon which correlations were made, were English, mathematics, social studies, and science. Instruments, specifically developed to correlate responses from three different groups were completed by 159 parents of students involved in the study, 54 teachers of the four subject areas indicated above, 505 sophomores, and 408 seniors. Two hundred and eighteen student response sheets which were electronically rejected because of deviations in responding techniques, were hand scored to obtain responses to specific questions. All other response sheets were tabulated electronically. Because of an insufficient number of responses, data gathered from the parent instruments were not used for statistical analysis. Data obtained from the various instruments were applied to the chi-square test of independence to determine rejection of null hypotheses. In applying data obtained from questionnaires to the chisquare formula, eight hypotheses were rejected and five hypotheses were not rejected. There was insufficient data to allow application of this formula to one of the hypotheses; one hypothesis, therefore, remains untested. The hypotheses that were rejected are:There is no significant difference in the amount of time that English teachers <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There is no significant difference in the amount of time that mathematics teachers <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There is no significant difference in the amount of time spent on homework between college-bound and non college-bound students. There is no significant difference in the amount of time spent on homework between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the amount of time spent on homework between boy and girl populations. There is no significant difference in the amount of time spent on homework in the subject of English between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the amount of time spent on homework in the subject of mathematics between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the amount of time spent on homework in the subject of science between sophomore and senior populations. The hypotheses that were not rejected are:There is no significant difference in the amount of time that social studies teachers <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. There is no significant difference in the amount of time that homework is worked on in school between boy and girl populations. There is no significant difference in the amount of time that homework is worked on in school between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the amount of time spent on homework in the subject area of social studies between sophomore and senior populations. The hypothesis that was not tested because of insufficient data is:There is no significant difference in the amount of time that science teachers <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> takes students to complete assignments and the amount of time that students actually work on those assignments. In general, the data indicate that girls tend to spend more time on homework than boys, sophomores spend more time on homework than seniors, college-bound students spend more time on homework than non college-bound students, and that there is a disparity between the length of time that teachers <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> students to complete an assignment and the length of time that students work on those assignments.

60|$|Here, then, {{you have}} pictorially represented, {{the system of}} manly education, {{supposed}} in old Florence to be that necessarily instituted in great earthly kingdoms or republics, animated by the Spirit shed down upon the world at Pentecost. How long do you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> you, or ought to take, to see such a picture?

Well, of your half-hour for Santa Maria Novella,--after Ghirlandajo's choir, Orcagna's transept, and Cimabue's Madonna, and the painted windows, have been seen properly, there will remain, suppose, at the utmost, {{a quarter of an hour}} for the Spanish Chapel. That will give you two minutes and a half for each side, two for the ceiling, and three for studying Murray's explanations or mine. Two minutes and a half you have got, then--(and I observed, during my five weeks' work in the chapel, that English visitors seldom gave so much)--to read this scheme given you by Simon Memmi of human spiritual education. In order to understand the purport of it, in any the smallest degree, you must summon to your memory, in the course of these two minutes and a half, what you happen to be acquainted with of the doctrines and characters of Pythagoras, Zoroaster, Aristotle, Dionysius the Areopagite, St. Augustine, and the emperor Justinian, and having further observed the expressions and actions attributed by the painter to these personages, judge how far he has succeeded in reaching a true and worthy ideal of them, and how large or how subordinate a part in his general scheme of human learning he supposes their peculiar doctrines properly to occupy. For myself, being, to my much sorrow, now an old person; and, to my much pride, an old-fashioned one, I have not found my powers either of reading or memory in the least increased by any of Mr. Stephenson's or Mr. Wheatstone's inventions; and though indeed I came here from Lucca in three hours instead of a day, which it used to take, I do not think myself able, on that account, to see any picture in Florence in less time than it took formerly, or even obliged to hurry myself in any investigations connected with it.|$|E

6000|$|I {{believe that}} no fault can {{be pointed out}} in that argument; {{assuming}} {{the truth of the}} premises, the conclusion, so far as I have capacity at all to understand it, follows inevitably. There is a fault in it as I think, but the fault is not in the reasoning; but the falsehood in fact is a fault of the premises. I believe that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, and Judge Douglas thinks it is. I believe that the Supreme Court and the advocates of that decision may search in vain for the place in the Constitution where the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed I say, therefore, that I think one of the premises is not true in fact. But it is true with Judge Douglas. It is true with the Supreme Court who pronounced it. They are estopped from denying it, and being estopped from denying it, the conclusion follows that, the Constitution of the United States being the supreme law, no constitution or law can interfere with it. It being affirmed in the decision that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, the conclusion inevitably follows that no State law or constitution can destroy that right. I then say to Judge Douglas and to all others that I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> a better answer than a sneer to show that those who have said that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution, are not prepared to show that no constitution or law can destroy that right. I say I believe it will take a far better argument than a mere sneer to show to the minds of intelligent men that whoever has so said is not prepared, whenever public sentiment is so far advanced as to justify it, to say the other. This is but an opinion, and the opinion of one very humble man; but it is my opinion that the Dred Scott decision, as it is, never would have been made in its present form if the party that made it had not been sustained previously by the elections. My own opinion is, that the new Dred Scott decision, deciding against {{the right of the people}} of the States to exclude slavery, will never be made if that party is not sustained by the elections. I believe, further, that it is just as sure to be made as to-morrow is to come, if that party shall be sustained. I have said, upon a former occasion, and I repeat it now, that the course of arguement that Judge Douglas makes use of upon this subject (I charge not his motives in this), is preparing the public mind for that new Dred Scott decision. I have asked him again to point out to me the reasons for his first adherence to the Dred Scott decision as it is. I have turned his attention to the fact that General Jackson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a Supreme Court decision. I have asked his attention to the fact that Jefferson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a Supreme Court decision. Jefferson said that [...] "Judges are as honest as other men, and not more so." [...] And he said, substantially, that whenever a free people should give up in absolute submission to any department of government, retaining for themselves no appeal from it, their liberties were gone. I have asked his attention to the fact that the Cincinnati platform, upon which he says he stands, disregards a time-honored decision of the Supreme Court, in denying the power of Congress to establish a National Bank. I have asked his attention to the fact that he himself was one of the most active instruments at one time in breaking down the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois because it had made a decision distasteful to him,--a struggle ending in the remarkable circumstance of his sitting down as one of the new Judges who were to overslaugh that decision; getting his title of Judge in that very way.|$|E
