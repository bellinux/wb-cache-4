50|$|In {{the age of}} sail, cargo {{and ships}} became lost more often than today. This bill proved that cargo {{expenses}} were paid, but became mainly a proof that the cargo was really on board and thus become a negotiable property title. Under this type of carriage, the bill of lading assumes two main tasks, as cargo receipt and property title. In liner shipping it assumes a triple identity: property title, cargo receipt and carriage contract. In <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping,</b> object of this wiki entry, the carriage contract is the charter party.|$|E
50|$|With {{the end of}} the war in the Pacific, Moose {{reported}} to the Atlantic Fleet at Norfolk, Virginia, on 4 February 1946. She decommissioned there 19 April 1946, was returned to the War Shipping Administration on 27 April 1946, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 May 1946. She entered the National Reserve Defense Fleet as Mason L. Weems. In 1948 she was sold to <b>Tramp</b> <b>Shipping</b> & Oil Transportation Corporation for service as Yankee Pioneer. Resold to Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company in 1951, the ship was renamed Y. L. McCormick.|$|E
5000|$|The tramp trade {{first took}} off in Britain around the mid 19th century. The {{dependability}} and timeliness of steam ships {{was found to be}} more cost-effective than sail. Coal was needed for ships' boilers, and the demand created a business opportunity for moving large amounts of best Welsh coal to various seaports in Britain. Within a few years <b>tramp</b> <b>ships</b> became the workhorses of trade, transporting coal and finished products from British cities {{to the rest of the}} world. [...] The size of <b>tramp</b> <b>ships</b> remained relatively constant from 1900 to 1940, at about 7,000 to 10,000 deadweight tons (dwt.). During the Second World War, the United States created the Liberty Ship; a single design that could be used to carry just about anything, which weighed in at 10,500 dwt. [...] The U.S. produced 2,708 Liberty Ships and they were used on every international trade route. [...] After the Second World War, economies of scale took over and the size of <b>tramp</b> <b>ships</b> exploded to keep up with a booming supply and demand cycle. During this time the bulk carrier became the tramp of choice for many owners and operators. The bulk carrier was designed to carry coal, grain and ore, which gave it more flexibility and could service more ports than some of its ancestors, which only carried a single commodity. [...] Today the tramp trade includes all types of vessels, from bulk carriers to tankers. Each can be used for a specific market, or ships can be combined like the oil, bulk, ore carriers to accommodate many different markets depending where the ship is located and the supply and demand of the area. <b>Tramp</b> <b>ships</b> often carry with them their own gear (booms, cranes, derricks) in case the next port lacks the proper equipment for loading or discharging cargo.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{types of}} cargo vessels include {{container}} ships and bulk carriers (technically tankers {{of all sizes}} are cargo ships, although they are routinely {{thought of as a}} separate category). Cargo ships fall into two further categories that reflect the services they offer to industry: liner and tramp services. Those on a fixed published schedule and fixed tariff rates are cargo liners. <b>Tramp</b> <b>ships</b> do not have fixed schedules. Users charter them to haul loads. Generally, the smaller shipping companies and private individuals operate <b>tramp</b> <b>ships.</b> Cargo liners run on fixed schedules published by the shipping companies. Each trip a liner takes is called a voyage. Liners mostly carry general cargo. However, some cargo liners may carry passengers also. A cargo liner that carries 12 or more passengers is called a combination or passenger-cum-cargo line.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between markets for shipping services {{on the one hand}} and networking organisation and behaviour on the other. It focuses on two Glasgow-based groups - one, the Donaldson Group, engaged in liner trades and the other, the Hogarth Group, engaged principally in <b>tramp</b> <b>ship</b> trades - which are representative of Clyde shipping as a whole. Public sources and company records are used to explore the ideas and arguments advanced by Gordon Boyce about the significance of networking for shipping firms, and the conclusion is drawn concludes that these need to be extended and modified in certain ways - in particular, to refine the analytical distinction between local level and inter-organisational networks, to recognise the possibility of longer-term decay in network arrangements, and to account for a greater reliance on network organisation by liner than <b>tramp</b> <b>ship</b> owners and managers. ...|$|R
50|$|Furness Withy was {{incorporated}} {{as a company}} in 1891 upon the amalgamation of Christopher Furness' business in West Hartlepool and London with Edward Withy's shipbuilding yard in Hartlepool. By 1914 the company had acquired interests {{all over the world}} in liner and <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> and in shipbuilding, but from 1920 they concentrated on liner services. In addition to the North Atlantic service, they developed other American routes based principally on New York and including Bermuda and the West Indies. The Furness family sold its interests in the Company to a consortium led by Frederick Lewis, a Director in the business, in 1919.|$|E
50|$|Mattson {{bought his}} first steam ship, 4,600-GRT Naxos in 1925. The ship was {{operated}} via Helsinki-based company called Ab Naxos Prince which {{was owned by}} Mattson family. During the following couple of years the tonnage was grown by three more vessels, {{and at the end}} of the 1920s the company became with its 20,000-GRT craft the second biggest line shipping company of Helsinki after FÅA. All of Mattson's ships were over 20 years old and they were used in <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> which was sensitive to economic fluctuations. During the whole time of its operation the company created heavy losses.|$|E
50|$|Beluga Shipping {{was founded}} in Bremen in December 1995 by {{entrepreneur}} Niels Stolberg, initially as a cargo operator. In 1998, the company acquired its first vessel, the multipurpose heavy-lift carrier MV Beluga Obsession. In 1999, the company built its first new vessel, the MV Werder Bremen. Beluga Shipping grew significantly during the following years. By May 2010, 69 multipurpose heavy-lift carriers were in service for the company, with crane capacities reaching 1,400 tons in tandem usage (P-series). The fleet further increased to 70 units by end of 2010. The company offered trade lane management but concentrated on <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping,</b> meaning each transport was organised individually {{according to the requirements}} of the cargo and the port of loading and destination.|$|E

She was scrapped at Onomichi, Japan in 1968. , also built in 1943, had become the Mill Hill with CSM, and unlike other transferred ships retained her CSM name with LOF. LOF sold her in 1951 and her subsequent owners renamed her Educator. [...] had been built in 1944 and sold in 1947 to a CSM company, <b>Tramp</b> <b>Shipping</b> Development Co, which renamed her Bisham Hill.

50|$|Due to the {{explosion}} of liner services, and in large part, due to containerisation since the 1960s, the tramp trade has decreased, but {{is by no means}} ended. A contemporary trend in the shipping business has resulted in renewed interest in <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping.</b> To increase profits, liner companies are looking at investing into tramp ships to create a buffer when the market is down. For example, Mitsui OSK Lines possesses a large fleet with tramp ships and liners. With both types of shipping covered they are able to service a world economy even in a down market. The advantage of tramp ships is they are relied upon at a moment's notice to service any type of market. Even in a down economy there will be a market for some type of commodity somewhere and the company with the ships able to exploit that market will do better than the company relying on liner services alone.|$|E
5000|$|Voyage charter: The {{voyage charter}} {{is the most}} common charter in <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping.</b> [...] The owner of the tramp is obligated to provide a {{seaworthy}} ship while the charterer is obligated to provide a full load of cargo. [...] This type of charter is the most lucrative, but can be the riskiest due to lack of new charterers. During a voyage charter a part or all of a vessel is leased to the charterer for a voyage to a port or a set of different ports. There are two types of voyage charter - net form and gross form. [...] Under the net form, the cargo a tramp ship carries is loaded, discharged, and trimmed at the charterer's expense. Under the gross form the expense of cargo loading, discharging and trimming is on the owner. The charterer is only responsible to provide the cargo at a specified port and to accept it at the destination port. Time becomes an issue in the voyage charter if the tramp ship is late in her schedule or loading or discharging are delayed. If a tramp ship is delayed the charterer pays demurrage, which is a penalty, to the ship owner. The number of days a tramp ship is chartered for is called lay days.|$|E

The first standard to be used was the PF(B) of about [...] These incorporated one 30-ton, two 10-ton and eight 5-ton derricks for cargo handling.|$|R
50|$|A liner {{will have}} a regular run and operate to a schedule. The {{scheduled}} operation requires that such ships are better {{equipped to deal with}} causes of potential delay such as bad weather. They are generally higher powered than <b>tramp</b> <b>ships</b> with better seakeeping qualities, thus they are significantly more expensive to build. Liners are typically built for passenger and container operation though past common uses also included mail and general cargo.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tramp</b> <b>ship</b> is a {{contract}} carrier. Unlike a liner, often called a common carrier, {{which has a}} fixed schedule and a published tariff, the ideal tramp can carry anything to anywhere, and freight rates are influenced by supply and demand. To generate business, {{a contract}} to lease the vessel known as a charter party is drawn up between the ship owner and the charterer. There are three types of charters, voyage, time and demise.|$|R

40|$|On 18 October 2006, <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> pools became {{subject to}} the {{enforcement}} powers of the European Commission by the adoption of Council Regulation 1419 / 2006. The changes brought about by Council Regulation 1419 / 2006 generated huge waves in the shipping industry. Council Regulation 1419 / 2006 repealed Council Regulation 4056 / 86 and amended Council Regulation 1 / 2003 by including in its scope international tramp services. As arguably {{the most common type}} of arrangement in the tramp sector, it is interesting to see which challenges <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> pools now face. The Guidelines on the application of Article 101 TFEU (previously Article 81) to maritime transport services provide some assistance to <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> pool participants needing to determine whether their arrangement is in compliance with competition law rules by conducting a self assessment of their arrangement. This thesis will exclusively focus on self assessments of <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> pools. Whilst the Guidelines on the application of Article 101 TFEU to maritime transport services will be to a certain extent assessed, this will only be done in the prevailing analysis of typical clauses of a <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> agreement. These clauses will be the subject of an assessment under Article 101 TFEU and the step by step analysis required to determine whether they infringe Article 101 TFEU. The second chapter of this thesis will expand on the rationale behind self assessments as evidenced by the enforcement and investigative powers of the European Commission along with possible enforcement actions by individuals. The third chapter of this thesis will analyse the legal framework necessary to conduct a self assessment as conducted in the fourth chapter which will examine typical clauses of a <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> pool agreement. The fifth chapter will go into the structural alternatives to <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> pools and best practice options that need to be considered during the course of a self assessment...|$|E

50|$|The Royal Mail Case {{criminal}} prosecution of Lord Kylsant, {{director of the}} Royal Mail Steam Packet Company (RMSP), in 1931 led to the liquidation of that company in 1932.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an effort to {{understand}} how the <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> industry works, which is considered to work close to perfect competition model, where the atomicity, homogeneity and information transparency are evident. Many small shipping companies compete for a volatile and unpredictable demand. Despite there are some entry barriers to the market, these can be easily mitigated by the way this market works. <b>Tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> companies co-operate among them in pools, in order to bid for large contracts of affreightment, which otherwise, shipowners could not perform on their own. <b>Tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> pools raise competition concerns, and under the EU Competition Rules, these agreements shall be assessed on case-by-case basis in order to determine whether an agreement may jeopardise competition within common market. To do so, an assessment under Article 101 TFEU is required. Normally, <b>tramp</b> <b>shipping</b> pools created for the right purposes, do not entail competition restrictions. Conversely, those agreements that have a combined market share considerably high or involve hardcore restrictions, are prohibited under Article 101 (1). These agreements have three options: terminate their agreement; demonstrate that economic efficiencies brought by the agreement outweigh restrictions under Article 101 (3); and lastly and most appealing, try to restructure the agreement creating a full-function joint venture in order to fall under a more certain legal framework, the EC Merger Rules...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a model for}} the <b>Tramp</b> <b>Ship</b> Scheduling problem including berth allocation considerations, motivated by a real case of a shipping company. The aim is to determine the travel schedule for each vessel considering multiple docking and multiple time windows at the berths. This work is innovative due to the consideration of both spatial and temporal attributes during the scheduling process. The resulting model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, and a heuristic method to deal with multiple vessel schedules is also presented. Numerical experimentation is performed to highlight the benefits of the proposed approach and the applicability of the heuristic. Conclusions and recommendations for further research are provided.
