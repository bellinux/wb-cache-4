In an August interview with Weekend America, he explained his platform, [...] "e want to have protected borders and keep our gun rights and a lot of conservative things, but <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> help America realize that 95 percent of violent crime is connected with alcohol." ...|$|E

Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} at Liverpool, Voronin heavily criticized the {{standard}} of lifestyle in England and Great Britain in general {{and in particular the}} city of Liverpool. Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent and sometimes I have absolutely no clue what the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff {{was known}} for his {{technical}} ability, speed, acceleration, dribbling and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. Despite his unimpressive stature and strength, Cruyff's tactical brain and reading of the game were exceptional. “Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina,” he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff. [...] "There are some people who might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, I think I just have more than most other players." [...] On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: [...] "Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate." [...] As Van Basten noted, “Johan is so technically perfect that even as a boy he stopped being interested in that aspect of the game. He could do everything when he was 20. That’s why he’s been very interested in tactics since he was very young. He sees football situations so clearly that he was always the one to decide how the game should be played.” In 1997, Dutch journalist Hubert Smeets wrote, [...] "Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports." [...] Sports writer David Miller believed Cruyff superior to any previous player in his ability to extract the most from others. He dubbed him [...] "Pythagoras in boots" [...] for the complexity and precision of his passes and wrote, [...] "Few have been able to exact, both physically and mentally, such mesmeric control on a match from one penalty area to another." ...|$|E
