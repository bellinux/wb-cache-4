5|$|Whenever {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it {{should always be}} on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker in the hall or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere in the hall, it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of <b>the</b> <b>onlookers</b> facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold, {{on holiday}} in Paris, wants to visit Monte Carlo, {{but does not}} have time for the seventeen-hour express train ride between the two cities. He happens upon an {{automobile}} maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours. The King agrees and sets off in the car, with the auto maker acting as chauffeur. A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House, including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world. After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a pancake. The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off. <b>The</b> <b>onlookers</b> set to the work with gusto, {{so much so that}} the overinflated policeman ends up exploding.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Journal {{wrote that}} {{a crowd of}} men, women, and {{children}} arrived on foot, in cars, and on horses, and that souvenir hunters cut away parts of his shirt sleeves. According to The New York Times, one of <b>the</b> <b>onlookers,</b> Robert E. Lee Howellrelated to Clark Howell, editor of The Atlanta Constitutionwanted to have the body cut into pieces and burned, and began to run around, screaming, whipping up the mob. Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, {{and asked for a}} vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.|$|E

5|$|When the Indian flag is {{displayed}} with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state {{that if the}} flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India {{should be in the}} middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of <b>the</b> <b>onlookers,</b> or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must be {{in front of the other}} poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, it must be the uppermost flag.

One of <b>the</b> <b>onlookers</b> bought ribbons from a nearby millinery store to pin on Williams' players, and the only color available was purple.

50|$|A set {{of honey}} bees, called swarm, can {{successfully}} accomplish tasks through social cooperation. In the ABC algorithm, there are three types of bees: employed bees, onlooker bees, and scout bees. The employed bees search food around the food source in their memory; meanwhile they share the information of these food sources to <b>the</b> <b>onlooker</b> bees. <b>The</b> <b>onlooker</b> bees tend to select good food sources from those found by the employed bees. The food source that has higher quality (fitness) will have a large chance to be selected by <b>the</b> <b>onlooker</b> bees than <b>the</b> one of lower quality. The scout bees are translated from a few employed bees, which abandon their food sources and search new ones.|$|R

25|$|There is a {{widespread}} myth that Rudolf Berthold was throttled to death with the ribbon of his Pour le Merite as ligature. The truth is more prosaic and more brutal. Berthold doubled back through the school when <b>the</b> <b>onlookers</b> attacked. As he exited the back door his Pour le Merite was spotted. The war cry was sounded. A swarm of people overpowered Berthold. His handgun was taken from him and used to shoot him twice {{in the head and}} four times in the body as the mob mauled him. His paralyzed right arm was ripped from its socket. His face was stomped into bloody mush. His corpse was robbed of his decorations, overcoat, and shoes.|$|E

25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for <b>the</b> <b>onlookers.</b> The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E
500|$|Lice {{have been}} intimately {{associated}} with human society throughout history. In the Middle Ages, they were essentially ubiquitous. At {{the death of}} Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1270, it was recorded that [...] "The vermin boiled over like water in a simmering cauldron, and <b>the</b> <b>onlookers</b> burst into alternate weeping and laughing". A mediaeval treatment for lice was an ointment made from pork grease, incense, lead, and aloe.|$|E
30|$|Communication between <b>the</b> {{employed}} and <b>onlooker</b> bees {{happens when the}} employed bees present promising solutions to <b>the</b> <b>onlooker</b> bees in <b>the</b> hive. Cooperation happens when <b>the</b> <b>onlooker</b> bees explore <b>the</b> solutions presented by the employed bees. If the solution cannot be improved in a predefined number of iterations (defined as a parameter called limit), the employed bee becomes a scout bee in order to explore a new solution. At this point, the newly discovered solution is memorised and the old solution is abandoned. The ABC algorithm has exploration and exploitation capabilities, where scout bees are able to globally explore the search space and {{employed and}} onlooker bees are able to locally explore the search space.|$|R

500|$|Nearly a {{year later}} on May 5, 1951, the Nimrod computer—created by {{engineering}} firm and nascent computer developer Ferranti—was presented at the Festival of Britain, and then showcased for three weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled. Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively {{to play the game}} of Nim; moves were made by players pressing buttons which corresponded with the lights. Nimrod could play either the traditional or [...] "reverse" [...] form of the game. The machine was twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall.
