5|$|Arctic terns are {{considered}} <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> {{a species of}} concern in certain states. They are also among the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies. The species reduced population in New England in the late nineteenth-century because of hunting for the millinery trade. Exploitation continues today in western Greenland, where {{the population of the}} species has been reduced greatly since 1950.|$|E
5|$|Bird species {{native to}} the acacia koa–ōhia forest include the Hawaiian crow (Corvus hawaiiensis), the akepa (Loxops coccineus), Hawaii creeper (Oreomystis mana), ʻakiapōlāʻau (Hemignathus munroi), and Hawaiian hawk (Buteo solitarius), {{all of which are}} endangered, <b>threatened,</b> <b>or</b> near threatened; the Hawaiian crow in {{particular}} is extinct in the wild, but there are plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau reserve.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} {{are mostly}} silent but make high-pitched mewing or hissing notes at the nest and screeching noises when squabbling at a carcass. Young birds {{have been heard}} making a hissing croak in flight. They also hiss or growl when <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> angry.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs have {{recently}} experienced habitat loss, chytrid diseases, and collection for the pet trade. Some {{are listed as}} <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> endangered as a result. Zoos have tried to counteract this disease by treating captive frogs with an antifungal agent {{that is used to}} cure athlete's foot in humans.|$|E
5|$|The nunatak {{areas have}} a {{scarcity}} of flora, limited to lichen, bryophyte and algae. Flowering plants are not found there. The Norwegian Polar Institute has not registered the occurrence of any <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> rare plants or animals in Queen Maud Land, the known ones thus existing in healthy populations.|$|E
5|$|The song is a short, fast, {{bubbling}} {{series of}} chip notes that can accelerate near the end, and the calls include a nasal chur {{and a thin}} tsi. When <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> separated from its mate, the sparrow makes a dear-dear-dear call.|$|E

5|$|While {{many species}} of pigeons and doves have benefited from human {{activities}} and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) {{are two of the}} most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.|$|E
5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are gregarious. While they {{sometimes}} live solitarily, {{they are more}} commonly found in groups of around 10–20 individuals, with two to four adult males, four to seven adult females, and the remainder juveniles. Capybara groups can consist {{of as many as}} 50 or 100 individuals during the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources. Males establish social bonds, dominance, or general group consensus. They can make dog-like barks when <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> when females are herding young.|$|E

5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E
5|$|In {{a threat}} display, the mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and {{sometimes}} hisses. It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation for being formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> cornered. The black mamba is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5|$|Native fish in Fossil Creek include {{headwater}} chub, roundtail chub, speckled dace, longfin dace, Sonora sucker, {{and desert}} sucker. Between 2007 and 2010, the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added native spikedace, loach minnows, Gila topminnows, and razorback suckers {{as well as}} more longfin dace above the barrier. All except speckled dace are special-status fish listed as endangered, <b>threatened,</b> <b>or</b> sensitive by federal or state agencies. In addition, more than 100 macroinvertebrate species live in the Fossil Creek watershed. One, the fossil springsnail, is listed sensitive by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|E

5|$|Predators of the {{red panda}} include the snow leopard, mustelids, and humans. If they feel <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> sense danger, they may try to escape by {{climbing}} a rock column or tree. If {{they can no longer}} flee, they stand on their hind legs to make themselves appear larger and use the sharp claws on their front paws to defend themselves. A red panda, Futa, became a visitor attraction in Japan for his ability to stand upright for ten seconds at a time.|$|E
5|$|Sea lions are {{particularly}} intelligent, {{can be trained}} to perform various tasks and display limited fear of humans if accustomed to them. Because of this, California sea lions are a popular choice for public display in zoos, circuses and oceanariums, and are trained by the United States Navy for certain military operations. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as Least Concern due to its abundance. Predation by California sea lions on <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> endangered salmon species at Bonneville Dam has resulted in more than 50 of them being killed by state officials.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature {{currently}} {{assesses the}} orca's conservation status as data deficient {{because of the}} likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species. Some local populations are considered <b>threatened</b> <b>or</b> endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with human fisheries. In late 2005, the Southern Resident Killer Whales, the population that inhabits British Columbia and Washington state waters, {{were placed on the}} U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
