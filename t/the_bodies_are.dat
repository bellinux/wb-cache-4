5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder investigates a small town plagued by deaths in which <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> found covered in cockroaches. Working from home, Scully has {{scientific}} explanations for all of them, but Mulder—at the crime scene with an attractive bug expert—suspects the insects may not be organic, or earthly.|$|E
5|$|Detective Ybarra (Kelly) {{travels to}} a ranch in Wineville, Riverside County, {{to arrange the}} {{deportation}} of 15-year-old Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson) to Canada. The boy's uncle, Gordon Northcott (Harner), has fled after a chance encounter with Ybarra, who mentions his business there being a juvenile matter. Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder around twenty children, and identifies Walter as one of them. Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark's deportation, but Ybarra takes Clark to the murder site and tells him to dig where <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> buried. Clark hesitates, but soon uncovers body parts. Briegleb secures Christine's release by showing Steele a newspaper story about the Wineville killings that names Walter as a possible victim. Under interrogation by Ybarra, Walter's impostor reveals his motive was to secure transport to Los Angeles to see his favorite actor, Tom Mix, and says the police told him to lie about being Christine's son. The police capture Northcott in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Christine's attorney (Pierson) secures a court order {{for the release of}} other unjustly imprisoned women who the police wanted to silence.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> no longer decomposing properly. They have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{first put}} {{on display in}} the Eden Museum. Because it drew such large crowds city {{authorities}} insisted that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>be</b> moved and closed <b>the</b> exhibit. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> then became part of a freak show in a Montreal circus. When the show went bankrupt <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> abandoned and left in a warehouse. In 1907, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found by a group of children. It was subsequently claimed by the University of Montreal for research purposes. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> later mummified and put on display in a glass case.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found {{buried in}} a wooden coffin, wrapped in lead sheet.

25|$|When they die, the Reveilles {{are buried}} in a special {{cemetery}} located outside {{the north end of}} Kyle Field. <b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> laid facing the south end zone and the scoreboard. After the addition to Kyle Field was built at the north end, blocking the view of the scoreboard, a small scoreboard was placed outside the stadium, named the Reveille Scoreboard, so the tradition could live on.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Geake {{noted that}} <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} supine, being either extended or slightly flexed, while the arms are typically {{at the sides}} of the body or folded across it. There is nevertheless variation in the use of structures within and around the graves, which include beds or chambers inside the grave, as well as mounds, postholes or boat parts outside of it.|$|E

25|$|Three Fiat-built 'Littorina' railcars {{survived the}} civil war and two are in working order. They are Art Deco in style, with large Fiat {{radiators}} on the front. <b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> painted in creamy white with grey underneath and roofs with red 'bumpers' on the ends and a red stripe separating the body color from the grey below. They are intended for tourist service; new vehicles will be built or bought for regular passenger service.|$|E
25|$|Every ninth {{year there}} is a blót of nine days, a common feast for {{everyone}} in Sweden. Then they sacrifice nine males of each species, even men, and <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> hung from {{the branches of a}} grove near the temple.

25|$|The {{overlapping}} {{boundaries of}} the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: {{the territory of the}} Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Conflicts about jurisdiction between <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> resolved by the Constitutional Court of Belgium. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.|$|E

5000|$|In Pinagbayanan, the {{cremation}} burials were secondary burials. In {{the first}} phase, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> {{let alone to}} decompose. It is then followed by a ritual performance. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> burned because, according to the belief of ancient people, the “spirit is as clean as though washed in gold" [...] once <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> set on fire.|$|R
50|$|To prepare <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> {{protective}} clothing <b>is</b> recommended per usually {{with a second}} pair of thick rubber gloves. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> and <b>the</b> area around it is sprayed with 1:10 bleach solution. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> placed in a “body bag” (mortuary sack) and it <b>is</b> closed securely. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> bag <b>is</b> sprayed with 1:10 bleach solution. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> then transported to the burial site as soon as possible. Any person who must touch or carry <b>the</b> <b>body</b> during transport should wear the same {{protective clothing}} as is worn in the isolation area. The grave {{should be at least}} 2 meters deep. Viewing <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> not possible and the burial ceremony should be limited to family only. The interior of the vehicle where <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>was</b> carried should be rinsed with 1:10 bleach solution.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to organ transplants in Jinzhou, Gutmann notes that security agencies in Dalian city were supplying human cadavers to two major plastination factories, where <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> filled with plastics {{to be sent}} on display {{around the world as}} bodies exhibitions. According to an informant interviewed on the program 20/20, the plastinated cadavers came from executed prisoners. Again, however, Gutmann notes a disparity in the numbers: the body plastination factories operating in Dalian processed thousands of cadavers—far more than could be expected to be donated or taken from legally executed prisoners. The establishment of the body plastination factories coincided with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong.|$|E
25|$|When {{viewed from}} an {{inertial}} frame, two orbiting bodies trace out distinct trajectories. Each of these trajectories has its focus at the common center of mass. When viewed from a non-inertial frame centred {{on one of}} the bodies, only the trajectory of the opposite body is apparent; Keplerian elements describe these non-inertial trajectories. An orbit has two sets of Keplerian elements depending on which body is used as the point of reference. The reference body is called the primary, the other body is called the secondary. The primary does not necessarily possess more mass than the secondary, and even when <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> of equal mass, the orbital elements depend on the choice of the primary.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> {{built around}} a control chassis, {{featuring}} a full roll cage, originally designed by PACE Innovations but which can be made, or partially made, by other accredited builders, including certain race teams. Many safety features are utilised to protect the driver {{in the event of}} a crash. The fuel tank is positioned in front of the rear axle to prevent it from being damaged or ruptured in a rear end impact. The driver is seated towards the centre of the car and extra reinforcement is used on the roll cage on the driver's side to lessen the risk of injury in a side-on collision. The cars also feature a collapsible steering column and a fire extinguisher system.|$|E

50|$|In 1946, Borremose man was {{discovered}} by peat diggers in the southernmost part of Borremose.

50|$|At many {{institutions}} {{the person responsible}} for handling, cleaning, and moving <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> called a diener, the German word for servant. In the UK this role is performed by an Anatomical Pathology Technologist who will also assist the pathologist in eviscerating <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and reconstruction after the autopsy. After <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> received, it is first photographed. The examiner then notes the kind of clothes and their position on <b>the</b> <b>body</b> before they <b>are</b> removed. Next, any evidence such as residue, flakes of paint or other material is collected from the external surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Ultraviolet light may also be used to search body surfaces for any evidence not easily visible to the naked eye. Samples of hair, nails and the like <b>are</b> taken, and <b>the</b> <b>body</b> may also <b>be</b> radiographically imaged. Once the external evidence <b>is</b> collected, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> removed from <b>the</b> bag, undressed, and any wounds present <b>are</b> examined. <b>The</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> then cleaned, weighed, and measured in preparation for the internal examination. The scale used to weigh <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> often designed to accommodate the cart that <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> transported on; its weight is then deducted from the total weight shown to give the weight of <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
25|$|Carcetti {{watches a}} news {{report about the}} exhumed bodies and {{discusses}} the political implications with his staff. Norman Wilson remarks that <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> attributable to the Royce administration and Michael Steintorf, the new chief of staff, states that the silver lining {{of the story is}} that it draws attention away from the massive school deficit. Steintorf counsels that they should use this as cover to avoid dealing with the deficit as it would hamstring Carcetti's plans to run for governor and that Carcetti will have the funds to address the city's education problems when he becomes governor. Wilson is disappointed to see that Carcetti is willing to trade fulfilling his responsibilities as mayor with increasing his chances of becoming governor.|$|E
25|$|In theory, {{the loss}} of energy through {{gravitational}} radiation could eventually drop the Earth into the Sun. However, the total energy of the Earth orbiting the Sun (kinetic energy + gravitational potential energy) is about 1.14 joules of which only 200 watts (joules per second) is lost through gravitational radiation, leading to a decay in the orbit by about 1 meters per day or roughly the diameter of a proton. At this rate, {{it would take the}} Earth approximately 1 times more than the current age of the Universe to spiral onto the Sun. This estimate overlooks the decrease in r over time, but the majority of the time <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> far apart and only radiating slowly, so the difference is unimportant in this example.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{federal law}} does not dictate any {{container}} requirements for cremation. Certain states, however, may require an opaque or non-transparent container of all cremations. This can be a simple corrugated-cardboard box or a wooden casket (coffin). Most casket manufacturers provide lines of caskets that are specially built for cremation. Another option is a cardboard box that fits inside a wooden shell, {{which is designed to}} look like a traditional casket. After the funeral service, the box is removed from the shell before cremation, permitting the shell to be re-used. Funeral homes may also offer rental caskets, which are traditional caskets used only during the services, after which <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> transferred to other containers for cremation. Rental caskets are sometimes designed with removable beds and liners, which are replaced after each use.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the death}} {{occurs in a}} hospital, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> taken to <b>the</b> funeral parlor or home before the funeral.

25|$|Daniels {{answers the}} call leaving ASA Rhonda Pearlman alone to field {{questions}} from Deputy Commissioner William Rawls and Commissioner Ervin Burrell. She reports that forensics teams are attending each crime scene {{and they are}} recovering 9mm bullet casings, vacuuming for hair and fiber and laser printing for footprints. Daniels returns and is asked to confirm that <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> linked to one organization. He tells Burrell that Marlo Stanfield's drug organization is their prime focus and is then asked what they have on Stanfield. He explains that Major Crimes was building a case against Stanfield until three months ago when their wiretaps were pulled by Lieutenant Marimow. Burrell offers Daniels whatever support he needs. Daniels tells Burrell that he needs the patrol division to begin searching for houses. Daniels leaves to begin organizing a citywide search.|$|E
