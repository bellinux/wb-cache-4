5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went {{to live and work}} on a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists. During this time, he became {{convinced}} that <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Bible and its teachings were quite different than what he had been raised to understand, but he accepted their religion entirely.|$|E
5|$|A {{mirror on}} the back wall {{reflects}} the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King PhilipIV(10) and Queen Mariana(11). The most common assumption is that the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the scene.|$|E
5|$|Two {{circling}} B-29s {{observed the}} test, with Shields again flying the lead plane. They carried members of Project Alberta, who would carry out airborne measurements during the atomic missions. These included Captain Deak Parsons, the Associate Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory {{and the head}} of Project Alberta; Luis Alvarez, Harold Agnew, Bernard Waldman, Wolfgang Panofsky and William Penney.

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state for personal gain. De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E
5|$|The factual {{accuracy}} of the series is often criticised by legal professionals and journalists; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury {{not to let the}} series influence <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> trials—referring to an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury service. A complaint was made by a viewer about one episode claiming biased and incorrect information about the MMR vaccine, leading the BBC to unilaterally ban repeats of it in its original form. All six series (with the exception of the two banned episodes from Series Five) have been released on DVD in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Curriculum {{integration}} is much misunderstood. As a curriculum design and a pedagogy, {{it requires a}} commitment to power sharing when making curriculum decisions with students. When teachers negotiate curriculum with students, the learning and teaching is of direct relevance {{to the world of}} young people in diverse settings. In the hands of talented teachers, curriculum integration engages students in deep level learning which can have lasting effects on <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the world and <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> themselves as active learners...|$|R
25|$|While {{there are}} ancient {{relations}} between the Indian Vedas and the Iranian Avesta, the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences, especially in their implications for the human being's position in society and <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> man's role in the universe.|$|E
25|$|Protestants too see the {{authority}} {{given to the}} apostles as unique, proper to the apostles alone, {{to the extent that}} they generally reject the idea of a succession of bishops to the apostles in governing the Church. <b>Their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical authority is accordingly different.|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} differ in <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> narcissism, {{with the former}} treating it as a disorder, thus as discrete, and the latter treating it as a personality trait, thus as a continuum.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of the teaching of the Protestant Reformers (Luther, Calvin, and the Puritans) toward issues of wealth, work, interest, and calling. The purpose is to highlight some of the teachings that could be said to lead to a “Protestant Work Ethic. ” The Reformers were not uniform in <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> economic matters and in some cases <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> economic matters were influenced by the society around them. While much of the teaching continued in the Catholic tradition, the reformers did elevate the <b>views</b> <b>of</b> calling and work; what had been toil was elevated to Divine calling and service to God...|$|R

25|$|Marriage {{problems}} soon {{developed and}} the Foster family initially blamed Jane for not making Stephen happy. They later changed <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Jane and praised her {{for keeping the}} family together despite the decline in Stephen's income and his lack of responsibility. Even though marital life was difficult, some of Stephen Foster's best songs were reflective of their first years of marriage.|$|E
25|$|The Talmud {{represents}} the written {{record of an}} oral tradition. It {{became the basis for}} many rabbinic legal codes and customs, most importantly for the Mishneh Torah and for the Shulchan Aruch. Orthodox and, to a lesser extent, Conservative Judaism accepts the Talmud as authoritative, while Samaritan, Karaite, Reconstructionist, and Reform Judaism do not. This section briefly outlines past and current movements and <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Talmud's role.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships among students’ background information and their in-school and after-school literacy activities, {{as well as the}} relationships between students’ background and <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT). The results showed that students’ literacy activities could be grouped into three types: e-literacy, traditional literacy, and creative literacy. Furthermore, results showed that categorization of literacy activities depended on whether the activities were conducted in English or in another language. Gender predicted certain types of literacy activities. Compared with English-as-a-first-language (L 1) students, English-as-a-second-language (L 2) students’ background influenced more <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the test...|$|R

25|$|In the film, Max {{periodically}} plays Go {{with his}} mentor, Sol. This game has historically stimulated {{the study of}} mathematics and features a simple set of rules that results in a complex game strategy.

25|$|The Brut's {{significance}} is now {{seen as being}} in {{the fact that it was}} written by laymen, for laymen, and also that the latter portion, at least, was one of the first chronicles written in the English language; it also occasionally provides historical details not found in other contemporaries' writings.

25|$|The {{concept of}} the polysporangiophytes, more {{formally}} called Polysporangiophyta, {{was first published in}} 1997 by Kenrick and Crane. (The taxobox at the right represents <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the classification of the polysporangiophytes.) The defining feature of the clade is that the sporophyte branches and bears multiple sporangia. This distinguishes polysporangiophytes from liverworts, mosses and hornworts, which have unbranched sporophytes each with a single sporangium. Polysporangiophytes {{may or may not have}} vascular tissue – those that do are vascular plants or tracheophytes.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{response}} to the SDI during the period March 1983 through November 1985 provided indications of <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the program both as a threat and {{as an opportunity to}} weaken NATO. SDI was likely seen not only {{as a threat to the}} physical security of the Soviet Union, but also as part of an effort by the United States to seize the strategic initiative in arms controls by neutralizing the military component of Soviet strategy. The Kremlin, however, masked their real concerns, advocating that space-based missile defenses would make nuclear war inevitable.|$|E
25|$|Conservative and Reform Judaism {{have altered}} the text to varying degrees to bring it into {{alignment}} with <b>their</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> modern needs and sensibilities.

Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism, consistent with their views that {{the rhythm of the}} ancient sacrifices should no longer drive modern Jewish prayer, often omit some of the Amidah prayers, such as the Mussaf, omit temporal requirements, and omit references to the Temple and its sacrifices.|$|E
