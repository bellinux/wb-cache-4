500|$|Gillan was {{roommates}} with Ritchie Blackmore in the 1970s, {{but left}} the band in 1973 amid tensions with Blackmore and overall exhaustion. In a 2006 interview, Gillan said of Blackmore's final 1993 departure from Deep Purple, [...] "he {{turned into a}} really weird guy, and the day {{he walked out of}} the tour was the day the clouds disappeared and the day the sunshine came out and we haven't looked back since." [...] He added that [...] "there are certain personal issues that I have with Ritchie, which means <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> speak to him again. Nothing I'm going to discuss publicly, but deeply personal stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|For Key's second visual novel Air, Maeda {{admitted}} {{he felt he}} was able to write what he wanted to for the game's scenario, but he later discovered that Air was difficult for players to receive and experience. Due to this, Maeda felt that for Key's next work Clannad, he had a sense of duty to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible. In any case, he wanted to make it an entertaining game, and started planning on Clannad almost immediately after Airs completion. From the start of Clannads planning, Maeda did not want to write a story like in Air, but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the 'people and the town', and 'humanity'. Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in Clannad, and equates Clannads writing process as a [...] "wall <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> be able to get over again." [...] While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared, the entire game's story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted, and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length. Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game's base scenario which caused the 'branch' scenarios to increase as well.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{indictment}} was handed down, Reverend Moon was in Korea. His lawyers recommended {{that he not}} come back to America, {{since there is no}} extradition treaty between the United States and the Republic of Korea. However, he did not follow their advice. He was, after all, a man of God, not a criminal fleeing the law. He immediately returned to the United States. He told his counsel: [...] "I will not abandon my mission in America. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> do." ...|$|E

[...] She added, [...] "I will do everything possible to make my mark on this industry, and Danity Kane and [...] provided me with this amazing opportunity to go out and really touch people's hearts.

[...] They could do little, very little…. [...] I saw that night St. Mary, Aldermanbury; St. Vedast-alias-Foster, my own church—I saw them all burn, {{and it was a}} sensation <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget—hearing the bells fall down the tower, hearing the organs burn, because the hot air blowing through the organ pipes almost sounded as if the poor old organs were shrieking in agony in their destruction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{was eight}} {{years old at the time}} of the bombing and both a classmate and friend of Carol Denise McNair. On the day of the bombing, Rice was at her father's church, located a few blocks from the 16th Street Baptist Church. In 2004, Rice {{recalled}} her memories of the bombing: I remembered the bombing of that Sunday School at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963. I did not see it happen, but I heard it happen and I felt it happen, just a few blocks away at my father's church. It is a sound <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> forget, that will forever reverberate in my ears. That bomb took the lives of four young girls, including my friend and playmate [...] Denise McNair. The crime was calculated, not random. It was meant to suck the hope out of young lives, bury their aspirations, and ensure that old fears would be propelled forward into the next generation.|$|E

2500|$|.....under no {{circumstances}} whatever will I be in connexion with Mr Pitt. It {{is sufficient for}} a man's life to have been duped once. I hesitate no less to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> hold communication with the Duke of Portland until he has made that amende honorable to those...whose weight and consideration in Ireland he has made subservient to his own purposes and views in this country. ...my inclinations, my private attachments, the habits of my life, all combine to make me anxious to see the moment when I {{may be able to}} give the members of opposition honourable assistance. ... But in stating this it certainly is not in my contemplation to become again an active member of an opposition. Those days are over—circumstances have happened that make me think that I can be no more usefully so...but, in one word, should circumstances ever present to me the opportunity of doing essential injury to Mr Pitt's power, or of rendering effectual service to Mr Fox, I will not fail to seize it.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{was widely}} {{considered}} {{by those who}} knew him as a likeable and friendly person; a person who wanted to be liked. He said of himself when appointed captain of Australia, [...] "The one thing in my favour is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> change. I hope I will always be a likeable enough, easy-to-get-along-with type of person." [...] His biographer noted, [...] "riends, team-mates, coaches, teachers, officials, close observers. Almost all mentioned Kim's niceness. He addresses people by their first name. He loves being around and encouraging children. He likes being people's best friend." [...] As captain Hughes was popular and obliging with the press and the public. English journalist Frank Keating said [...] "Pulled this way and that by photographers, fringers, high commissioners, low commissioners, book commissioners, and hall-porter commissioners, [...] never stopped being softly obliging." [...] The journalist Adrian McGregor said of Hughes, [...] "He was almost too amenable, too nice a guy. He was great with the media, would answer all sorts of questions, never told people to piss off. [...] It was almost like he didn't have the appropriate personality [...]" ...|$|E
