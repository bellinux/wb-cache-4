5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the Orient Express over And Then There Were None. These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And Then There Were None, characters had to rotate their entire bodies <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another, whereas in Murder on the Orient Express, characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E

In {{the early years of}} primary education, Mandarin becomes the sole language of instruction, although students typically continue <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another in Chaozhou. Mandarin is widely understood, however minimally, by most younger Chaozhou speakers, but the elderly usually do not speak Mandarin since teaching was done in the local vernacular in the past.|$|E

In his essay [...] "The African Writer and the English Language", he {{discusses}} how the process of colonialism– for all its ills– provided colonised people from varying linguistic backgrounds [...] "a language with which <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another". As his purpose is to communicate with readers across Nigeria, he uses [...] "the one central language enjoying nationwide currency". Using English also allowed his books to be read in the colonial ruling nations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{friendship}} between Zappa and Van Vliet {{over the years}} was sometimes expressed {{in the form of}} rivalry as musicians drifted back and forth between their groups. Van Vliet embarked on the 1975 Bongo Fury tour with Zappa and the Mothers, mainly because conflicting contractual obligations made him unable to tour or record independently. Their relationship grew acrimonious on the tour {{to the point that they}} refused <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> another. Zappa became irritated by Van Vliet, who drew constantly, including while on stage, filling one of his large sketch books with rapidly executed portraits and warped caricatures of Zappa. Musically, Van Vliet's primitive style contrasted sharply with Zappa's compositional discipline and abundant technique. Mothers of Invention drummer Jimmy Carl Black described the situation as [...] "two geniuses" [...] on [...] "ego trips".|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{communication}} of a certain company, to identify its weaknesses and to suggest improvements of the current state. To analyze the communication, standardized dialogues with kingpins in the firm, questionnaire research and {{a study of the}} company documentation were used. Owing <b>to</b> <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the employees, after familiarization with the operating and fundamental processes of the company, all employees were sent an online questionnaire, which was answered by 21 of the complete number of 24. Simultaneously, dialogues with other four persons were made. Results of the dialogues and questionnaire research were analyzed and the state of communication inside and outside the firm was described. The communication inside the firm is not on a low level, but there are significant reserves in some areas conducive to improvement. Recommendations for improving the situation are described in a separate chapter...|$|R
