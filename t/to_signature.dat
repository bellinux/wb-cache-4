5|$|The German army {{attacked}} Russia on 18 February. The offensive {{led to a}} rapid {{collapse and}} retreat of the Russian troops and <b>to</b> <b>signature</b> of the first Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the Bolsheviks on 3 March 1918. Finland, the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine were transferred to the German power sphere. The Civil War of the Finns opened an easy access with low costs to Fennoscandia, where the geopolitical status altered as a British Naval squadron invaded the harbour of Murmansk on the northwestern coast of Russia by the Arctic Ocean on 9 March 1918. General Erich Ludendorff wanted both to chain Petrograd through Narva - Viipuri and German-led monarchy for Finland.|$|E

500|$|Box Car Racer was {{recorded}} over six weeks beginning in December 2001, primarily at Signature Sound in San Diego, California. Sessions commenced quickly, with producer Jerry Finn having sent one whole load of equipment <b>to</b> <b>Signature</b> {{ahead of his}} arrival. Barker and DeLonge worked out [...] "80 percent" [...] of the completed album in Barker's warehouse in Corona, California, two weeks prior to recording. When the musicians entered the studio, little was changed aside from certain lyrics, according to assistant engineer Sam Boukas. Barker completed his drum tracks in one day at two recording facilities in Los Angeles prior to the Signature sessions. DeLonge invited musician David Kennedy, whom he had met in the San Diego music circuit some years prior, to perform lead guitar parts on the album. Roger Joseph Manning Jr. plays keyboards on the record.|$|E
2500|$|From 1980 to 1986, Lifeson used four identically {{modified}} Stratocasters, {{all of them}} {{equipped with}} the Floyd Rose bridge. As a joke, he called these Hentor Sportscasters – a made-up name inspired by Peter Henderson's name, who was the producer of Grace Under Pressure. He also played a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion. By 1987, Lifeson switched <b>to</b> <b>Signature</b> guitars (Canadian-made) which, while [...] "awful to play—very uncomfortable--...had a particular sound I liked." [...] Lifeson primarily used PRS guitars in the later-half of the 1990 Presto tour, and again during the recording of Roll The Bones in 1990/1991. He would continue to play PRS for the next sixteen years through the recording and touring of Counterparts, Test for Echo and Vapor Trails {{as well as the}} R30 tour.|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} Universal Designated-Verifier Signatures was {{put forth by}} Steinfeld et. al. in Asiacrypt 2003. This notion allows a <b>signature</b> holder <b>to</b> {{designate}} the <b>signature</b> <b>to</b> a desired designated-verifier. In this paper, we extend this notion <b>to</b> allow a <b>signature</b> holder <b>to</b> designate the <b>signature</b> <b>to</b> multi verifiers, and hence, we call our scheme as Universal Designated Multi Verifier Signatures. We provide security proofs for our schemes based on the random oracle model...|$|R

60|$|Personally I have {{attached}} less stern importance <b>to</b> <b>signature</b> as an unvarying rule {{than did}} my predecessor; though, even he was compelled by obvious considerations of convenience {{to make his}} chronique of current affairs anonymous. Our practice has been signature as the standing rule, occasionally suspended in favour of anonymity when {{there seemed to be}} sufficient reason. On the whole it may be said that the change from anonymous to signed articles has followed the course of most changes. It has not led to one-half either of the evils or of the advantages that its advocates and its opponents foretold. That it has produced some charlatanry, can hardly be denied. Readers are tempted to postpone serious and persistent interest in subjects, to a semi-personal curiosity about the casual and unconnected deliverances of the literary or social star of the hour. That this conception has been worked out with signal ability in more cases than one; that it has made periodical literature full of actuality; that it has tickled and delighted the palate--is all most true. The obvious danger is lest we should be tempted to think more of the man who speaks than of the precise value of what he says.|$|E
