5|$|The idea {{going in}} was to {{juxtapose}} my singing style with a hardcore hip-hop sensibility {{and have the}} finished product still sound like a Madonna record. I began the process by meeting with <b>the</b> <b>hip-hop</b> producers whose work I most admired. It was important, if I were to {{use a variety of}} collaborators, that the end product sound cohesive and thematically whole. I wasn't interested in the variety pack approach.|$|E
5|$|A {{departure}} from <b>the</b> <b>hip-hop</b> and R {{sound of her}} previous studio albums, the track is a country and pop ballad revolving around body image and female empowerment. Media outlets had varying opinions of the song's genre, describing it as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune influences. In the lyrics, Fantasia narrates a tragic story about a woman, while providing commentary on social class, marriage, and alcoholism. Inspired by her past, she recorded the single {{as a way to}} empower women and reconcile with her childhood insecurities.|$|E

5|$|Escape is {{the second}} studio album by <b>the</b> <b>hip-hop</b> group Whodini.

Whodini member Jalil Hutchins convinced Smith, his friend, to produce the album when Smith needed money after a friend's hospitalisation. Although the group originally intended to record more rock-oriented material for the album, its music has a predominantly synthesizer-based backing, with a rhythm and blues influence.|$|E
5|$|If {{you guys}} think I'm a diva and I have {{requirements}}, Snoop is the next level. He's <b>the</b> <b>hip-hop</b> king! So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E

HHDC provides a formal curriculum with dance classes (breaking, freestyle, locking, etc.) and academic classes (dance theory, physiology, kinesiology, etc.) to people who want to pursue hip-hop dance as a career. It is the only educational institution in the United States that is exclusively dedicated to hip-hop dance instruction. HHDC does not grant degrees. It is a non-profit organization and repertory company that grants certifications to dancers that complete the three-year program.|$|E

However, the album did not fare as well commercially as his debut, seemingly because of the state of <b>the</b> <b>hip-hop</b> industry. The album saw a change in Obie Trice's style, whose first album was considered to be a little light-hearted. Second Round's on Me was considered to be a more serious, dark album, mainly showing the grittiness of Obie Trice's life and surroundings.|$|E
