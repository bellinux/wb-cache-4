5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E
5|$|Settlement {{continued}} {{to follow the}} river down the valley. At the confluence with Castle Creek, the valley widened and offered a flood plain conducive {{to the development of}} a town. The slopes of the surrounding mountains proved to have the silver deposits the prospectors had anticipated, and very soon the mining camp became a small city, named Aspen after the trees <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> surrounding forests. It grew rapidly, becoming the seat of the newly created Pitkin County, named after the governor its earliest settlers had disobeyed by coming there.|$|E
5|$|The present-day cone of Mount Baker is {{relatively}} young; {{it is perhaps}} less than 100,000years old. The volcano sits atop a similar older volcanic cone called Black Buttes, which was active between 500,000 and 300,000years ago. Much of Mount Baker's earlier geological record eroded away during {{the last ice age}} (which culminated 15,000–20,000years ago), by thick ice sheets <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> valleys and surrounded the volcano. In the last 14,000years, the area around the mountain has been largely ice-free, but the mountain itself remains heavily covered with snow and ice.|$|E

5|$|Two {{shipboard}} accidents {{occurred during}} Tritons post-launch fitting-out. On 2 October 1958, {{prior to the}} nuclear reactor fuel being installed, a steam valve failed during testing, causing a large cloud of steam <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> number two reactor compartment, and on 7 April 1959, a fire broke out during the testing of a deep-fat fryer and spread from the galley into the ventilation lines of the crew's mess. Both incidents, neither nuclear related, were quickly handled by ship personnel, with Lt. Commander Leslie B. Kelly, the prospective chief engineering officer, being awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his quick action during the incident on 2 October.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, McGovern {{joined the}} 741st Squadron of the 455th Bombardment Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, {{stationed}} at San Giovanni Airfield near Cerignola in the Apulia region of Italy. There {{he and his}} crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far worse off than anything they had seen back home during the Depression. Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger. Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the Dakota Queen after his wife Eleanor. His targets were in Austria; Czechoslovakia; Nazi Germany; Hungary; Poland; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either oil refinery complexes or rail marshalling yards, all {{as part of the}} U.S.strategic bombing campaign in Europe. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared to earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> sky with flak bursts.|$|E
5|$|Several {{accidents}} occurred which {{threatened the}} station's safety, {{such as the}} glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a malfunction occurred in the backup Vika system, a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The Vika malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} newer modules were immovable.|$|E

5|$|The fire, {{caused by}} the {{malfunction}} of a backup solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} modules were immovable. The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which would have prevented escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier Mir expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Schuster also {{assisted}} Birkenhead in {{his attempts}} to reform {{the administration of the}} court system, particularly in his preparation of the Supreme Court (Consolidation) Act 1925. A committee was also set up to look into the reform of the Supreme Court, the County Courts and the Probate Services, divided into a subcommittee for each institution. Schuster served {{as a member of the}} committee, with his primary goal being to end the patronage and nepotism <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> judicial system. Although the Supreme Court was resistant the committee did succeed in making some changes, such as introducing mandatory retirement ages for masters and clerks; they were unable, however, to end the patronage. Schuster also attempted to reform the County Courts by increasing their jurisdiction, and a Committee on County Court Procedure (known as the Swift Committee after its chairman Rigby Swift) was set up in 1920, with Schuster serving as a member. The commission concluded that HM Treasury had mismanaged the County Courts, and on 1 August 1922 the Lord Chancellor's Office instead became responsible for the courts, with Schuster becoming Accounting Officer. The committee's final report was used as the basis for the County Courts Act 1924, which did much to correct the problems with the County Courts. Schuster was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 1920 New Year War Honours.|$|E

25|$|A Jäger corps {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Colonel Karl Adolf Christoph von Creutzburg was among the units in the Hesse-Hanau contingent.

They were selected for their marksmanship, and were all volunteers, in contrast with the drafted or pressed soldiers <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> ranks of the Hesse-Hanau infantry. The pay was higher than for ordinary troops. The British government especially requested Jägers for the American campaign, as they were perceived as better able to endure the North American wilderness.|$|E
25|$|In 1674, Shivaji Bhosale carved an {{independent}} Maratha zone around Pune, Maharashtra, from the Bijapur Sultanate and, with that began {{the emergence of}} the Marathas as the most important power in India <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> vacuum created by the decline of the Mughal Empire. Shivaji established an effective civil and military administration. After a lifetime of conquest and guerrilla warfare with the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Shivaji died in 1680, leaving behind a kingdom of great but ill-defined extent. This was followed by a period of instability ending with Aurangzeb's death.|$|E

25|$|The {{two main}} sources {{regarding}} the legendary life of Perseus—for {{he was an}} authentic historical figure to the Greeks— are Pausanias and the Bibliotheca. Pausanias asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand {{side of the road}} from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called Persea. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> citadel's underground cistern. He states also that Atreus stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why Heinrich Schliemann named the largest tholos tomb the Treasury of Atreus.|$|E
25|$|The band also {{embarked}} on a second Progressive Nation tour, including the tour's first performances in Europe. Opeth, Unexpect and Bigelf supported Dream Theater in Europe, while Zappa Plays Zappa, Pain Of Salvation, and Beardfish were slated to perform on the North American leg. However, Pain of Salvation and Beardfish were unable to tour with Dream Theater and Zappa Plays Zappa because of financial troubles within their respective record labels. The two new bands <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> vacated slots for the Progressive Nation 2009 tour in North America were Bigelf and Scale the Summit with Bigelf performing on both European and North American legs.|$|E
25|$|The {{deposition}} of aquifer material dates back {{two to six}} million years, from the late Miocene to early Pliocene ages when the southern Rocky Mountains were still tectonically active. From the uplands to the west, rivers and streams cut channels in a generally west to east or southeast direction. Erosion of the Rockies provided alluvial and aeolian sediment <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> ancient channels and eventually covered the entire area of the present-day aquifer, forming the water-bearing Ogallala Formation. In that respect, the process is similar to those currently prevailing in other modern rivers of the area, such as the Kansas River and its tributaries. The major differences are time and depth.|$|E

25|$|The 1967 models {{received}} {{nothing more}} than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked {{much in the way of}} trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, and front shoulder belt anchors, were included in all 1967 models.|$|E
25|$|Tinson's first {{design for}} Sage was a two-seat fighter aircraft, the Sage Type 2. It {{was a small}} wood-and-fabric tractor biplane (in fact the two-seat Sage was smaller than many single-seaters of the time), with single-bay wings. The pilot and gunner sat in an enclosed, glazed cabin <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> gap between the {{fuselage}} and upper wing. Because {{of the lack of}} effective gun synchronising gear to allow a fixed gun to fire through the propeller disc, a hole was cut in the upper wing above the gunners seat, so the gunner could stand with head and shoulders above the wing, giving him a good allround field of fire for his Lewis gun, including forward over the propeller. The aircraft was powered by a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine driving a four-bladed propeller.|$|E
25|$|When {{a friend}} (Bernard F. Burke, Prof. of Physics at MIT) told Penzias about a {{preprint}} paper {{he had seen}} by Jim Peebles {{on the possibility of}} finding radiation left over from an explosion <b>that</b> <b>filled</b> <b>the</b> universe at the beginning of its existence, Penzias and Wilson began to realize the significance of their discovery. The characteristics of the radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson fit exactly the radiation predicted by Robert H. Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton University. Penzias called Dicke at Princeton, who immediately sent him a copy of the still-unpublished Peebles paper. Penzias read the paper and called Dicke again and invited him to Bell Labs to look at the horn antenna and listen to the background noise. Dicke, Peebles, Wilkinson and P. G. Roll interpreted this radiation as a signature of the Big Bang.|$|E
