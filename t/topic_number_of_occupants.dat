40|$|One {{problem in}} today’s {{indoor air quality}} lies within {{insufficient}} ventilation. Dynamic ventilation {{can be obtained by}} implementing a Demand-Controlled ventilation (DCV) system. DCV systems adjust the ventilation in a building by calculating the impact made by its’ occupants. This is done by sensors, the most common one are carbon dioxide sensors. A different solution would be to calculate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> and then calculate the carbon dioxide levels from that number. This paper describes the development of a sensor fusion system for presence detection. The system will be using sensors that have been proved being able to detect human presence.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{effects of}} age, {{body mass index}} (BMI) and gender on motor vehicle crash (MVC) {{injuries}} are not well understood and current prevention efforts do not effectively address variability in occupant characteristics. Objectives 1) Characterize the effects of age, BMI and gender on serious-to-fatal MVC injury 2) Identify the crash modes and body regions where the effects <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> characteristics onthe <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> with injuryis largest, and thereby aid in prioritizing the need forhuman surrogates that the represent different types <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> characteristics and adaptive restraint systems that consider these characteristics. MethodsMultivariate logistic regression was used to model the effects <b>of</b> <b>occupant</b> characteristics (age, BMI, gender), vehicle and crash characteristics on serious-to-fatal injuries (AIS 3 +) by body region and crash mode using the 2000 - 2010 National Automotive Sampling System (NASS-CDS) dataset.

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the reason}} that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> in {{high-rise}} building is usually very large, the evacuation process of the building would cost a lengthy time, which threats the life safety <b>of</b> the <b>occupants</b> under the circumstance of serious disaster such as fire. Thus to ensure the safety <b>of</b> <b>occupants,</b> different evacuation strategies have been proposed. One of the recently proposed strategies is that fire elevators should be used to aid evacuation so that the congestion level in the stairwell would be reduced. To explore the efficiency of elevator aided evacuation process, a network model for building evacuation is established in the present paper. Factors including the building plan component, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupants</b> and the configuration of the elevator status which affect the evacuation efficiency have been numerically investigated. A first principle for elevator aided evacuation has been summarized. Results also indicate that there is a top limit of the optimization process of the elevator aided evacuation...|$|R
