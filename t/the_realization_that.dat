5|$|General {{relativity}} can {{be understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.|$|E
5|$|When Billy Sunday was {{ten years}} old, his impoverished mother sent him and an older brother to the Soldiers' Orphans Home in Glenwood, Iowa, and later to the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home in Davenport, Iowa. At the orphanage, Sunday gained orderly habits, a decent primary education, and <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> {{he was a good}} athlete.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this presentation, {{we review}} an {{alternative}} technique called splitting, which accelerates {{the rate of}} occurrence of the rare events of interest. Here, we do not change the probability laws driving the model. Instead, we use a selection mechanism to favour the trajectories deemed {{likely to lead to}} those rare events. The main idea is to decompose the paths to the rare events of interest into shorter subpaths whose probability is not so small, encourage <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> take these subpaths (leading to the event of interest) by giving them a chance to reproduce (a bit like in selective evolution), and discourage <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> go in <b>the</b> wrong direction by killing them with some positive probability...|$|R

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States. It is {{the most common type of}} fatal poisoning in many countries. In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year. Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since ancient history. <b>The</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Kansas, Beilhart obsessively {{investigated}} a variety of beliefs, including Christian Science, Divine Science, Spiritualism, and Theosophy. He found, however, {{that none of these}} religions held his interest. In time, he came to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> he would not adhere to any one denomination, but develop a faith of his own by combining aspects of several different religions.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> our Solar System {{is located}} in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E
50|$|The {{acceptance}} of a human (as well as a divine) nature for Christ by many Christians allowed {{the pursuit of the}} goal of the imitation of Christ, but with <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> it had inherent limits, e.g. that Christ's death in obedience to the will of the Father had a redemptive value beyond human potential.|$|R

50|$|Forced {{displacement}} has accompanied persecution, {{as well as}} war, {{throughout human}} history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention {{is the result of}} greater ease of travel, allowing displaced persons to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of Africa, the Middle East, south and central Asia, ripple out well beyond the immediate region.|$|R
5|$|In 1959, {{observations}} {{in the microwave}} part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1–10GHz) led {{to the discovery of}} the Jovian decimetric radiation (DIM) and <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> it was synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons trapped in the planet's radiation belts. These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.|$|E
5|$|The {{last three}} decades have seen a {{proliferation}} of subfamily names, {{as a result of}} three factors: (1) <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> some subfamilies were assemblages of unrelated taxa; (2) abandonment of paraphyletic taxa, and (3) the discovery of novel fossil taxa. Seventeen extant subfamilies of ants are currently recognized, along with four extinct subfamilies. One of the fossil taxa, Armaniinae, is often given family rank within the superfamily Formicoidea. About 13 genera are incertae sedis (of uncertain placement), and are not assigned to any subfamily.|$|E

5|$|Villagers {{gathered}} around the burning windmill cheer the apparent death of the Monster (Boris Karloff). Their joy is tempered by <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is also apparently dead.

He falls into a flooded pit underneath the mill, where the Monster– having survived the fire– strangles him. Hauling himself from the pit, the Monster casts Hans' wife (Mary Gordon) to her death. He next encounters Minnie (Una O'Connor), who flees in terror.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> the National Park Service {{does not represent}} the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E
5|$|Dax confides in Sisko {{that she}} knows she {{is in love with}} her former wife. He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support either way. Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E
50|$|A notable {{excursion}} into hypostasis {{is featured}} in Tom Stoppard's screenplay for the 1990 movie, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, {{in which two}} minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet wrestle with <b>the</b> growing <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> they are undifferentiated minor characters in a work of fiction.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Bồng Sơn was {{the second}} major battle for the US 1st Cavalry Division, an airmobile unit of {{division}}al strength, during the Vietnam War. The battle was part of Operation Masher, also known as Operation Whitewing. A month earlier in 1965, in the Battle of the Ia Drang, the 1st Cavalry used all the division infantry, but one brigade at a time. One of <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> affected Bong Son was that with adequate helicopter lift, the traditional need to keep a strong reserve was less required—the least involved unit usually could break away and go where it was needed.|$|R
50|$|Although she {{is angry}} at being deceived by Danny, his {{departure}} brings Glenda to <b>the</b> stark <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> {{she has been}} deceiving herself as well. She finally admits to herself that her life is at a dead end and she decides it's time for a change.|$|R
5|$|Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned {{offensive}} began, {{and after}} two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. Finnish General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> he neither the Finnish nor the German high command is going to provide him with additional forces or substantial reinforcements, he slowed down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point the Finnish 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.|$|E
5|$|For a while, he was {{uncertain}} {{whether he would}} attend college, but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where a friend had also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused {{than he had been}} in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, Abdullah leaves Afghanistan and Mr. Wahdati suffers a stroke, {{prompting}} Nila to take Pari {{and move to}} Paris, France. Nabi, while assuming the role of Wahdati's primary caregiver, finds a number of sketchbooks in Wahdati's closet filled with pictures of him drawn before the stroke. Unnerved by the discovery that Mr. Wahdati loves him, he resolves to leave but decides against it after {{he is unable to}} find someone suitable to take over for him. Nabi subsequently spends the next 50 years working for Mr. Wahdati. He develops a deep bond with his employer, and Nabi comes to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> his purpose is to take care of Mr. Wahdati. Later Mr. Wahdati's health deteriorates further, and Nabi helps him commit assisted suicide by kissing him on the lips and pressing a pillow over his face.|$|E

50|$|Subsequent {{isolation}} of two strains of M. ferrooxydans, PV-1 and JV-1, along with <b>the</b> increasing <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> a phylogenetically distinct group of Proteobacteria (the Zetaproteobacteria) {{could be found}} globally as dominant members of bacterial communities led to the suggestion {{for the creation of}} this new class of the Proteobacteria.|$|R
5|$|In this episode, Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{look into}} the mysterious {{disappearance}} of a wealthy heiress and college board trustee, Selma Rose (Patty Hearst). The pair eventually find her in hiding {{in order to avoid}} a complex scam in which her husband would cheat her out of money in a divorce settlement. Meanwhile, Veronica investigates and eventually finds out some startling information related to the radical feminist Lilith House—that they faked several of the rapes supposedly perpetrated by the Hearst serial rapist. In addition, Logan and Veronica's relationship becomes even more tumultuous, with Logan eventually coming to <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> they need to break up.|$|E
5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood of the picture turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: They Knew What They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Senate grew {{increasingly}} alarmed at the slave-army's depredations and continued military successes. Eventually Rome fielded {{an army of}} eight legions under the harsh but effective leadership of Marcus Licinius Crassus. The war ended in 71 BC when, after a long and bitter fighting retreat before the legions of Crassus, and <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> the legions of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus were moving in to entrap them, the armies of Spartacus launched their full strength against Crassus' legions and were utterly defeated. Of the survivors, some 6,000 were crucified along the Appian way.|$|E
5000|$|Insight (prajna, kensho, satori, gnosis, theoria, illumination), {{especially}} enlightenment or <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> of <b>the</b> illusory {{nature of}} the autonomous [...] "I" [...] or self, {{is a key element}} in modern western nondual thought. It is <b>the</b> personal <b>realization</b> <b>that</b> ultimate reality is nondual, and is thought to be a validating means of knowledge of this nondual reality. This insight is interpreted as a psychological state, and labeled as religious or mystical experience.|$|R
50|$|A notable {{inclusion}} in the Ekottara Āgama is a discourse that includes meditative instructions on Mindfulness of Breathing given by the Buddha to his son Rāhula. In it, the Buddha gives Rāhula instructions on how he can practice this form of meditation to enter into samādhi. After an unknown length of time, Rāhula enters samādhi, passes through the four stages of dhyāna, and attains complete perfection and liberation. Rāhula then returns to the Buddha as an arhat, giving a full report of his practice, his experiences in meditation, and <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>that</b> he has had. This discourse corresponds to the Theravadin Maha-Rahulovada Sutta in the Majjhima Nikaya (MN 62).|$|R
