40|$|An {{evaluation}} of a virtual training environment for testing UK gas pipeline emergency response plans. Interviews, observations and desk research were used to identify current methods for <b>testing</b> <b>plans.</b> A virtual training environment was developed and evaluated with industry experts using participatory design techniques. Key themes relating to both the current methods for <b>testing</b> <b>plans</b> and for a virtual training environment were identified using thematic analysis. Improved training performance, remote participation and evidence of decision testing are benefits a virtual training environment can bring to current practice. It is suggested that a virtual training environment can enhance, rather than replace the current process of <b>testing</b> emergency response <b>plans.</b> Analysis of the virtual training environment being used to <b>test</b> <b>plans</b> in a live context would give further ecological validity to the findings. A study of the prototype used to <b>test</b> <b>plans</b> for incidents involving sectors outside the gas industry would further validate the findings. The application of a virtual training environment to facilitate <b>testing</b> <b>plans</b> and the decision making processes for major incidents involving high-pressure gas pipelines and storage sites, {{is yet to be}} documented.

The general equivalence theorem (GET) is used to verify the global optimality of the numerically optimized <b>test</b> <b>plans.</b> Optimum plans usually provide insight for constructing compromise plans {{which tend to be}} more robust and practically useful.

40|$|Abstract: With the {{motivation}} of developing more realistic <b>test</b> <b>plans,</b> an attempt is made in this paper to construct reliability <b>test</b> <b>plans</b> for the components of series systems under the assumptions that • the component lifetimes are independent, identically distributed exponential random variables, • the failure rates of these exponential random variables depend on covariates, such as room temperature, humidity etc. through linear and exponential relationships. Our <b>test</b> <b>plans</b> differ from the <b>test</b> <b>plans</b> proposed by Altinel and Özekici (1997) and Alitnel et al. (2001, 2002) {{in the sense that}} the former assume dependence on covariates through explicit relationships, while the latter make a very general assumption concerning dependence on covariates. It should be noted that as far as the construction of reliability <b>test</b> <b>plans</b> on component level is concerned, this is the first instance of the use of the penalty function methodology. It should also be highlighted that the numerical results given in this paper illustrate that the use of covariates-related information in the linear case leads to more than 90 % savings in total testing cost...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{directed}} toward {{the development of the}} methodology needed to evaluate cost effective vibroacoustic <b>test</b> <b>plans</b> for Shuttle Spacelab payloads. Statistical decision theory is used to quantitatively evaluate seven alternate <b>test</b> <b>plans</b> by deriving optimum test levels and the expected cost for each multiple mission payload considered. The results indicate that minimum costs can vary by as much as $ 6 million for the various <b>test</b> <b>plans.</b> The lowest cost approach eliminates component testing and maintains flight vibration reliability by performing subassembly tests at a relatively high acoustic level. Test <b>plans</b> using system <b>testing</b> or combinations of component and assembly level testing are attractive alternatives. Component testing alone is shown not to be cost effective...|$|R
40|$|Software metrics {{plays an}} {{important}} role in measuring attributes that are critical to the success of a software project. Measurement of these attributes helps to make the characteristics and relationships between the attributes clearer. This in turn supports informed decision making. The field of software engineering is affected by infrequent, incomplete and inconsistent measurements. Software testing is an integral part of software development, providing opportunities for measurement of process attributes. The measurement of software testing process attributes enables the management to have better insight in to the software testing process. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the metric support for software <b>test</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>test</b> design processes. The study comprises of an extensive literature study and follows a methodical approach. This approach consists of two steps. The first step comprises of analyzing key phases in software testing life cycle, inputs required for starting the software <b>test</b> <b>planning</b> and design processes and metrics indicating the end of software <b>test</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>test</b> design processes. After establishing a basic understanding of the related concepts, the second step identifies the attributes of software <b>test</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>test</b> design processes including metric support for each of the identified attributes. The results of the literature survey showed that there are a number of different measurable attributes for software <b>test</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>test</b> design processes. The study partitioned these attributes in multiple categories for software <b>test</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>test</b> design processes. For each of these attributes, different existing measurements are studied. A consolidation of these measurements is presented in this thesis which is intended to provide an opportunity for management to consider improvement in these processes. 00 92 51 443032...|$|R
