Reports used to be {{collected}} and sent to the Weather Bureau in Sydney. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> electronically now.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Exif tag {{contains}} metadata {{about the}} photo, it can pose a privacy problem. For example, a photo {{taken with a}} GPS-enabled camera can reveal the exact location and time it was taken, and the unique ID number of the device - <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> by default - often without the user's knowledge. [...] Many users may be unaware that their photos are tagged by default in this manner, or that specialist software {{may be required to}} remove the Exif tag before publishing. [...] For example, a whistleblower, journalist or political dissident relying on the protection of anonymity to allow them to report malfeasance by a corporate entity, criminal, or government may therefore find their safety compromised by this default data collection.|$|E
6000|$|Thus roughly summoned, {{the young}} lady came timidly downstairs and into the {{presence}} of her lover. [...] "Dearest!" [...] she cried, throwing her arms round him, [...] "I know <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> for my sake! It is a RUSE {{in order to see}} me." ...|$|E
50|$|Ellen created {{programs}} {{inside the}} prison and outside {{as well to}} help the women achieve their goals. Johnson developed a system of indenture for house service in houses outside the prison walls. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> under sympathetic supervision.|$|R
50|$|In {{the heyday}} of the Pump Room, guests would arrive early in the morning from 7 am until about 9.30 am in order to drink one or two glasses of water. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> before they had any breakfast.|$|R
50|$|On August 24, 1967, PPEP {{was awarded}} a $19,000 grant from the Committee for Economic Opportunity. Dr. John David Arnold was able to provide {{practical}} educational preparation to southern Arizona farm labor camps. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> aboard a 1957 Chevy bus. PPEP was officially incorporated on December 10, 1969.|$|R
60|$|And when <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done,</b> we may {{hope that}} crooked spines, pimpled faces, sallow complexions, stooping shoulders, {{and all other}} signs {{indicating}} an undeveloped physical vitality, will, {{in the course of}} a few generations, disappear from the earth, and men will have bodies which will glorify God, their great Architect.|$|E
50|$|Axial inserters used {{to consist}} of a {{stand-alone}} sequencer machine which cut and sequenced the parts onto a reel. That reel was then transferred over to a standalone axial inserter to insert the components. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> on one machine today.|$|E
50|$|About 100 m up {{the hill}} {{there used to be}} a weather station, a mother station for Montague Island in the south and South Solitary Island in the north.

500|$|The runway {{was another}} major {{construction}} task. The airfield in northern Maine {{was subject to}} freeze-thaw cycles and had bogs and various types of groundcover; 2.1 million cubic yards of material was removed. The foundation of the runway was constructed {{to a depth of}} [...] of a flexible bituminous-concrete pavement. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> on a runway that was [...] in length and [...] wide.|$|R
5000|$|Alliance {{still wanted}} {{both of them}} to keep working. It said that Mr Bryant should still give his {{services}}. Mr Foster argued that Mr Bryant's services should be contracted out through their company still, not a separate one. But he lost the argument. Mr Bryant, fully funded by Alliance, {{set up a new}} company. However <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> {{a few days before the}} resignation had actually taken effect.|$|R
50|$|Kenya has in {{the past}} {{continued}} to have dealings with Iran, which haven't always been viewed favourably by the West. Kenya has signed numerous deals with the Middle Eastern country including a deal to export 4m tonnes of oil to Kenya annually, direct flights between Tehran and Nairobi and scholarships for Kenyans to pursue higher education in Iran. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> in the visit by Iran's President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Kenya in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Meldonium is {{believed}} to exert its cardioprotective effects through its ability to cause vasodilation in the coronary arteries via increased nitric oxide synthesis, reducing blood glucose concentrations through increased oxidation of glucose and also by preconditioning the heart to handle ischaemic situations, among other effects. It also has been implicated {{in the use of}} cerebral ischaemia. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> through its inhibition of carnitine synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|Larkburger is an American {{restaurant}} chain that makes its food from [...] "all-natural ingredients". It first opened in Edwards, Colorado in 2006. Many of the restaurant's ingredients are made on-site. The restaurant {{is known for}} using wooden trays instead of plastic ones, wrapping burgers in brown paper, and placing side dishes inside cardboard boxes. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> to make the restaurant as organic and as eco-friendly as possible. The store currently has 13 branches.|$|E
5000|$|Working {{with the}} media on behalf of an {{organization}} allows for awareness of the entity to be raised {{as well as the}} ability to create an impact with a chosen audience. It allows access to both large and small target audiences and helps in building public support and mobilizing public opinion for an organization. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> through a wide range of media and can be used to encourage two-way communication.|$|E
50|$|In 1544, the {{printing}} press was transported from Goražde to Târgoviște, the capital of Wallachia, thus becoming the second such facility in the territory of present-day Romania. Its relocation and reactivation was accomplished by Dimitrije Ljubavić, Božidar's grandson, who brought with him Hierodeacon Mojsije. In Târgoviște, Dimitrije printed a euchologion {{at the beginning of}} 1545, and an apostolarium in 1547. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> under the auspices of Serbian-born Metropolitan Anania of Wallachia at the time.|$|R
50|$|Roy Moore {{was elected}} as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court on November 7, 2000. He {{was sworn in}} on January 15, 2001. It was {{revealed}} on August 1, 2001 that Moore had commissioned and placed a 5280 lb granite replica of the Ten Commandments in the lobby level of the Judicial Building's rotunda the night before. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> without the prior knowledge or consent of the other eight justices of the Supreme Court.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, Victor Value had 217 stores, and {{was sold}} to Tesco for £1.75 million. Tesco {{converted}} many larger branches to their own brand including some to Tesco Home n' Wear, and closed a number of smaller branches which were in close proximity of an established Tesco store. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> fairly quickly, and within around eighteen months, the name Victor Value had disappeared from the high street, however some of its fleet of dark blue lorries were still liveried Victor Value into the early seventies.|$|R
50|$|The routers then {{store the}} nature of the flow, and also police it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> in soft state, so if nothing is heard for a certain length of time, then the reader will time out and the {{reservation}} will be cancelled. This solves the problem if either the sender or the receiver crash or are shut down incorrectly without first cancelling the reservation. The individual routers may, at their option, police the traffic to check that it conforms to the flow specs.|$|E
5000|$|To {{elaborate}} {{further on}} the role of authentication with iVisher as drawn out by Song et al. (2014), masked caller identities can effectively be pinpointed without significantly slowing down the time to set up the call (p. 865). [...] In turn, if suspicious calls arise, a warning message is delivered to the one receiving the call regarding the matter. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> to check if IP spoofing occurs. In turn, authentication improves efficiency through informing the callers of whether or not their privacy is being compromised.|$|E
5000|$|Paulina {{said that}} the reason {{she wanted to do}} a Spanglish album is that she wanted to mix the {{language}} of her home Mexico and the United States. [...] "I grew up in Mexico, but I've always been between the United States and my country. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> with a wink and a nod to 'Spanglish' culture, which continues to grow and has a foot in both worlds," [...] the singer said. She stated on a radio interview that this album would be different from all her other albums because being a mother and the death of her father have inspired her tremendously.|$|E
50|$|The Hai-Genti as {{they are}} {{currently}} are far different from what their species <b>were</b> originally. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> because of the years in gene engineering and organic evolution which has, in essence, created a synthetic species that uses living beings as tools for different tasks. The Hai-Genti have become masters in bio-weaponry and its usage in conquering the environment which allows them to use the native flora as well as fauna to their advantage. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> so {{in an effort to}} achieve a single racial goal - survival of their kind.|$|R
2500|$|In 2012, Debbie Cook, {{who ran the}} [...] "spiritual Mecca" [...] for {{seventeen}} years, {{came forward}} and accused the church of repeated accounts of [...] "screaming, slapping" [...] and being [...] "made to stand in a trash and water's poured over you" [...] in efforts to confess her sins. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> in [...] "The Hole", located at Scientology's International base in the California Desert. She claims that she was taken there against her will and forced to stay for seven weeks. The church states that she [...] "voluntarily" [...] participated in their program of [...] "religious discipline".|$|R
50|$|Juraj Thurzó {{also carried}} out some {{important}} repairs. One {{of the first}} was the building of a tunnel between both castle gates, above which was formed a large terrace. After <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> he moved the living-quarters and the building of the Chapel started using parts of some old architecture. The interior furnishing of the Chapel was later arranged in a taste which suited the new owners of the Castle. One of the most well-known features is the Renaissance grave tomb of Juraj Thurzó {{from the beginning of the}} 17th century and the Baroque altar from 1751 - 1752.|$|R
5000|$|Ready Steady RocKwiz - Early {{series of}} RocKwiz often opened with this {{pre-recorded}} segment, however more recently <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> off air. Brian Nankervis runs {{three or four}} rounds of questions to find four finalists from 24 players {{to make up the}} two teams later for the TV episode recording. After the footage has been shown and the guests introduced, Julia Zemiro will usually ask the four guests what the first album they ever bought was, and/or what the first concert they ever went to was. The title of this segment is an allusion to the 1960s British pop music TV show Ready Steady Go!.|$|E
50|$|FreeTrack uses {{a camera}} to collect {{real-time}} {{information on the}} point model worn by the user. Specifically the image coordinates of the model points, which are either received directly from the camera or extracted from a video stream. These coordinates are used to generate {{an estimate of the}} real head pose, which can be transformed by the user {{in a number of ways}} to create a virtual pose. One of the most fundamental transformations involves amplifying rotation so that only small head movements are required. Finally, the virtual pose is sent to the user's choice of outputs. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> in the background, with tracking status displayed in the system tray.|$|E
50|$|Romayne {{returns to}} his Yorkshire home, called Vange Abbey. Even in his own home, the Frenchman's younger brother's awful cries follow him. He finally leaves for London, to visit his old friend Lord Loring, who is the patriarch of a well-heeled Catholic family. While there, he meets Stella Eyrecourt, {{who falls in love}} with him. A Catholic priest named Father Benwell, who serves as a spiritual leader for the Lorings, determines that he will convert Romayne to the church, {{employing}} the services of young priest, Arthur Penrose, to this end. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> in an attempt to bring Romayne's family home, Vange, back to the church, who owned it before Romayne's family.|$|E
50|$|In {{the pages}} of Infinite Crisis, it was {{revealed}} by Alexander Luthor, Jr. that he had sent Superboy-Prime to recover the black diamond and that the Psycho-Pirate delivered it to Loring on Alex's orders and manipulated Eclipso into manipulating the Spectre. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> {{in the interests of}} breaking magic down into raw magical energy, which Alexander could use for his own ends. The death of Shazam was particularly useful, as his various champions then became a tether of power. All Alex had to do was capture one of them, make them say 'Shazam' and they would summon their lightning bolt to power his machine.|$|R
50|$|According to legend, a {{rivalry with}} Odessa College (OC) got {{underway}} {{from the very}} beginning, when OC students taunted the UTPB students that they were too old to produce a streaker. A student finally agreed, and with only his head covered, streaked across the campus. It was a planned media event as all three television stations were present as was most of the faculty and administration including the University President, Dr. Armstead. The student jumped from the side door of a Volkswagen campmobile {{and ran to the}} crowd and camera. He then turned left and ran past the berms and out the back of the small courtyard. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> to great cheers. He escaped by jumping back into the Volkswagen which drove off unimpeded.|$|R
50|$|In 1973 Buffel was decommissioned. In 1974, {{the vessel}} {{was sold to}} the city of Rotterdam to be {{modified}} into a museum ship. From 1979 she was opened for visitors. The ship was moved to Hellevoetsluis in 2013 in order to cut costs. Buffel arrived in Hellevoetsluis on 5 October and was moored temporarily in the brick-built Jan Blanken dry dock. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> on a three-year lease. On 7 February 2015 she arrived at her final berthing place at the Koningskade 2, in Het Groote Dock in Hellevoetsluis where a historic naval quarter has been developed. Positioned here are: Buffel, Bernisse, an old minesweeper, and Noord Hinder a former lightship on the North Sea. The ship is now operated by volunteers from Stichting Museumschip de Buffel.|$|R
50|$|Walton Rural Life Center was {{the first}} public {{elementary}} school in the United States to add agriculture to its curriculum. The teachers design projects based on subjects that interest the students. Math, science, and agriculture are the main concepts studied. Instead of reading from a textbook, students experience hands-on learning. The school has farm animals and Kindergarten through fourth graders take turns doing chores and feeding the animals. For example, the students gather eggs, clean them, and check them for cracks. When <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done,</b> they sell the eggs and {{decide what to do}} with the money they earned. The school also has a greenhouse where the students grow flowers, plants, and vegetables.|$|E
50|$|At Custer University, Ray Blent (Anthony Perkins) is {{an honor}} student and college {{basketball}} star. June Ryder (Jane Fonda) {{has come to the}} university to study home economics and to find a husband. Both students and faculty are scandalized by Ryder's unashamed pursuit of Blent. She joins the pom-pom girls and attends all the classes taken by Blent to ensure she has maximum contact with him. Everyone is aware of her designs on the sexually naive Blent, except for him. She succeeds in convincing him that she has an intelligent, inquiring mind that he admires, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> through deception. She eventually gets Blent to fall for her and propose marriage. However, they need several thousand dollars to set up a home.|$|E
50|$|Law Enforcement has adapted several {{methods to}} prevent the use of {{excessive}} force. There are tools like tasers, batons and OC Spray (Pepper spray {{is likely to get}} someone to comply in a majority. However, if an individual is high on a drug like PCP; this drug can help an individual essentially have no sense of pain rendering the use of the above named methods useless and an ultimate resort to a firearm if this individual ultimately refuses to cooperate. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> with the interest of safety in mind for both the officers and the civilians involved in a particular situation. Additionally, officers are trained in negotiation tactics {{in order to avoid the}} use of the above named tools entirely.|$|E

Further regulatory and ethical approvals were not required because <b>this</b> <b>was</b> already included in the initial trial design. (2) Adding New Therapy: An application to add a new research arm was approved by the funder, (who also organized peer review), industrial partner and regulatory and ethical bodies. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> in advance of any decision to stop current therapies. Conclusions: The STAMPEDE experience shows that recruitment to a MAMS trial and mid-flow changes its design are achievable with good planning. This benefits patients and the scientific community as research treatments are evaluated in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. (Continued on next page) * Correspondence...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} many C-ITS {{innovation}} {{projects have been}} implemented and early commercial deployment is starting. Simultaneously, automated driving is gaining momentum. Both developments can benefit greatly from simulations for impact assessment. Previous projects struggled with using the same systems from the real-world in simulation and suffered from unrealistic driver behaviour with respect to C-ITS information supplied. The paper first presents a high-level system decomposition to determine the system boundaries and scope. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> followed by an intersection and vehicle specific hardware oriented architecture, which emphasizes where functionality specific for C-ITS and automated driving is implemented. Using that knowledge a simulation architecture was derived, explaining which components were not required or replaced by simulation specific ones. Lastly, different interfacing methods are discussed comparing them with respect to ease of use, compatibility and computational speed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> keeping maximum compatibility between real-world and simulation systems while optimizing simulation speed...|$|R
50|$|Indonesia {{declared}} its independence on August 17, 1945 after {{the surrender of}} Japan to the Allies. The president of the newly formed Republic of Indonesia ordered that <b>all</b> governmental services <b>be</b> taken over from the Japanese. Lasut {{and a few other}} Indonesians were able {{to take control of the}} Geological Service peacefully in September 1945 and renamed it the Mining and Geological Service (Jawatan Pertambangan dan Geologi). As the Dutch returned to Indonesia to regain its control of Indonesia, the offices of the Mining and Geological Service had to be moved several times. From its original headquarters in Bandung, the offices moved Tasikmalaya, Magelang, and Yogyakarta. In addition to managing the mining and geological activities of the new nation during this unstable period, the service also established schools for training new geologists. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>done</b> under the leadership of Lasut as head of the service.|$|R
