5|$|Worldwide {{production}} of thorium {{is a few}} tens of tons per year. The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of {{production of}} other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as <b>thorite</b> contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge {{of the distribution of}} thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on Løvøya island, Telemark county, Norway. He was a Norwegian {{priest and}} amateur {{mineralogist}} {{who studied the}} minerals in Telemark, where he served as vicar. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as this one, to his father, Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Oslo. The elder Esmark determined {{that it was not}} a known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample by reducing KThF5 with potassium metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source mineral <b>thorite.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Later on, Miguel {{discovers that}} an arrogant {{scientist}} at Alchemax called Jordan Boone is conducting [...] "Virtual Unreality" [...] experiments {{to create a}} doorway into another dimension. These experiments lead {{to the release of}} two mysterious figures: the Net Prophet, called [...] "the prophet of Thor" [...] by the <b>Thorites,</b> and a powerful megalomaniac called Thanatos. The Net Prophet becomes a new ally to Miguel. Since the Net Prophet is believed to be Thor's prophet, his association with Spider-Man 2099 leads more people to believe that Miguel's alter ego is the harbinger of Thor.|$|R
5000|$|Realizing {{that there}} is now a person with {{abilities}} similar to Spider-Man, Tyler Stone sends agents to hunt this person. To conceal his identity while he fights his pursuers, Miguel dons a bodysuit with a mask that he once wore for the Mexican Day of the Dead festival. Miguel chooses this costume in particular because it is the only clothing he has that is made from [...] "UMF" [...] (Unstable Molecule Fabric), meaning it is the only clothing he owns that will not be torn or shred by the spider-talons that now occupy his hands and feet. After seeing him operate in public, a group of <b>Thorites</b> (worshipers of the Marvel hero Thor) come to believe that Miguel is the legendary Spider-Man back from the dead, and that he is the harbinger of Thor's eventual return.|$|R
5000|$|Spider-Man 2099 has a small, {{web-like}} airfoil {{attached to}} the back of his costume. The material for the air foil was obtained from a <b>Thorite's</b> hang-glider and is made from a material called [...] "Lyte Byte" [...] which is specially made to capture and direct air currents and gives off a low-level of anti-gravity particles. This allows Spider-Man 2099 limited gliding abilities, valuable since the New York City of 2099 has massive skyscrapers that are often too far away for him to fire a web-line for travel. The Lyte Byte material also allows him to shift direction while in free fall and is very good at slowing down his descent, allowing him to fall from great distances without reaching terminal velocity. However, this does not grant Spider-Man 2099 actual flight. By the second volume of Spider-Man 2099 series however, he had added anti-gravity material {{to the back of}} his costume that enables him to fly.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} xenoliths occur in Lascar's rocks; {{a large amount}} of the phenocrysts are {{ultimately}} derived from them. Hornfels, skarn, and rocks derived from Lascar's lava dome ridge form these xenoliths. Minerals encountered in xenoliths include andradite, anhydrite, anorthite, apatite, biotite, calcite, diopside, fassaite, garnet, gypsum, ilmenite, magnetite, monazite, orthopyroxene, perovskite, plagioclase, prehnite, quartz, sphene, <b>thorite,</b> wilkeite, wollastonite and zircon. A number of such xenoliths formed from carbonate rocks that were influenced by magma from Lascar and from other volcanoes such as Tumisa.|$|E
500|$|The most {{abundant}} [...] are thorianite (ThO2), <b>thorite</b> (ThSiO4) and monazite, ((Th,Ca,Ce)PO4). Most thorium minerals contain uranium and vice versa; {{and they all}} have significant fraction of lanthanides. Rich deposits of thorium minerals are located in the United States (440,000 tonnes), Australia and India (~300,000 tonnes each) and Canada (~100,000 tonnes).|$|E
500|$|Thorium dioxide {{occurs as}} the rare mineral thorianite. Due to its being isotypic with uranium dioxide, these two common {{actinide}} dioxides can form solid-state solutions {{and the name}} of the mineral changes according to the ThO2 content. <b>Thorite</b> (chiefly thorium silicate, ThSiO4), also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered. In thorium silicate minerals, the Th4+ and [...] ions are often replaced with M3+ (where M = Sc, Y, or Ln) and phosphate (...) ions respectively. Because of the great insolubility of thorium dioxide, thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released. The Th4+ ion is soluble, especially in acidic soils, and in such conditions the thorium concentration can reach 40ppm.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Thorite</b> is an {{important}} ore of Uranium. A variety of <b>Thorite</b> often called [...] "Uranothorite", [...] rich in Uranium, is highly radioactive.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thorite</b> is {{currently}} an important ore of uranium. A variety of <b>thorite,</b> often called [...] "uranothorite", is particularly rich in uranium {{and has been}} a viable uranium ore at Bancroft in Ontario, Canada. Other varieties of <b>thorite</b> include [...] "orangite", an orange variety, and [...] "calciothorite", an impure variety with trace amounts of calcium.|$|E
50|$|Huttonite is dimorphic with <b>thorite.</b> <b>Thorite</b> {{crystallizes}} in {{a higher}} symmetry and lower density tetragonal form in which the thorium atoms coordinate to one less oxygen atom in an octahedral arrangement. <b>Thorite</b> is stable at lower temperatures than huttonite; at 1 atmosphere, the thorite-huttonite phase transition occurs between 1210 and 1225 °C. With increasing pressure the transition temperature increases. This relatively high transition temperature is thought to explain the relative rarity of huttonite on the Earth's crust. Unlike <b>thorite,</b> huttonite is not affected by metamictization.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thorite,</b> (Th,U)SiO4, {{is a rare}} nesosilicate {{of thorium}} that {{crystallizes}} in the tetragonal system and is isomorphous with zircon and hafnon. It {{is the most common}} mineral of thorium and is nearly always strongly radioactive.

It has also been reported from Mont Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, Canada and from Mineville, Essex County, New York. Other occurrences include the Inagli massif, Yakutia, Russia,around Langesundsfjord, Norway, in the Ilimaussaq intrusive complex, southern Greenland and the Vico volcano, Lazio, Italy.|$|E
50|$|Auerlite {{is a rare}} North Carolina mineral variety, remarkably rich in thoria, {{named after}} Carl Auer von Welsbach, the {{inventor}} of the Welsbach incandescent gas mantle. It {{is considered to be a}} phosphorus bearing variety of <b>thorite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because <b>thorite</b> {{is highly}} radioactive, {{specimens}} are often metamict. This {{is a condition}} found in radioactive minerals that results from the destructive effects of its own radiation on its crystal lattice. The effect can destroy a crystal lattice completely while leaving the outward appearance unchanged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thorite</b> is {{commonly}} metamict and hydrated, making it optically isotropic and amorphous. Owing {{to differences in}} composition, the specific gravity varies from 4.4 to 6.6 g/cm3. Hardness is 4.5 and the luster is vitreous or resinous. The color is normally black, but also brownish black, orange, yellowish-orange and dark green.|$|E

50|$|Specimens of <b>thorite</b> {{generally}} {{come from}} igneous pegmatites and volcanic extrusive rocks, hydrothermal veins and contact metamorphic rocks. It {{is also known}} to occur as small grains in detrital sands. Crystals are rare, but when found can produce nicely shaped short prismatic crystals with pyramidal terminations.It is commonly associated with zircon, monazite, gadolinite, fergusonite, uraninite, yttrialite and pyrochlore.|$|E
50|$|It was {{originally}} {{described as a}} hydrous silico-phosphate of thorium, ThO2(SiO2,⅓P2O5)+2H2O, i.e. <b>thorite</b> in which part of the silica is replaced by phosphoric acid. The crystals are tetragonal, lemon-yellow to brown-red in color, and sub-translucent to opaque. The mineral is very brittle; its hardness is 2.5 to 3, and its specific gravity 4.422 to 4.766, the darker crystals having the greatest density.|$|E
50|$|Hitchins {{helped to}} {{determine}} the atomic weight of lead based on measurements of radioactive ores, work that was important in developing an understanding of isotopes. The samples of distilled lead which Hitchins prepared from Ceylon <b>thorite</b> were used by Frederick Soddy and supplied by him to Otto Hönigschmid, who did important work confirming that the atomic weight of thorium lead is {{higher than that of}} common lead.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the island}} of Løvøya, Norway, his son, Hans Morten Thrane Esmark, found the first {{specimens}} of a black mineral, <b>thorite,</b> from which the element thorium is derived. His son also provided him with a new mineral which he found in Arendal, Norway. In 1806 he named datolite, from the Greek word meaning [...] "to divide". This was {{a reference to the}} granular structure of the first specimens studied.|$|E
50|$|Huttonite is a thorium nesosilicate mineral {{with the}} {{chemical}} formula 4 and which crystallizes in the monoclinic system. It is dimorphous with tetragonal <b>thorite,</b> and isostructual with monazite. An uncommon mineral, huttonite forms transparent or translucent cream - colored crystals. It was first identified in samples of beach sands from the West Coast region of New Zealand by the mineralogist Colin Osborne Hutton (1910-1971). Owing to its rarity, huttonite {{is not an}} industrially useful mineral.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1954 for an occurrence at the La Sal No. 2 Mine, Beaver Mesa, Mesa County, Colorado, US, and named for American geologist Reuben Clare Coffin (1886-1972).It has widespread global occurrence in Colorado Plateau-type uranium ore deposits of uranium and vanadium. It replaces organic matter in sandstone and in hydrothermal vein type deposits. It occurs {{in association with}} uraninite, <b>thorite,</b> pyrite, marcasite, roscoelite, clay minerals and amorphous organic matter.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a metamict mineral is zircon. The {{presence}} of uranium and thorium atoms substituting for zirconium in the crystal structure {{is responsible for the}} radiation damage in this case. Unaffected specimens are termed high zircon while metamict specimens are termed low zircon. Other minerals known to undergo metamictization include allanite, gadolinite, ekanite, <b>thorite</b> and titanite. Ekanite is almost invariably found completely metamict as thorium and uranium are part of its essential chemical composition.|$|E
5000|$|Soddy {{indicated}} that Hitchins also {{worked on the}} actual analyses, in his published report of 1917: [...] "According to analyses by Miss A. F. R. Hitchins and myself, the 20 kilos of selected <b>thorite</b> worked upon contained 0-4 per cent, of lead, 57 per cent, of thorium, 1-03 per cent, of uranium, and 0-5 c.c. of helium per gram." [...] This work proved that atomic weight was not a constant. Chemically pure elements could be mixtures of isotopes with differing atomic weights.|$|E
