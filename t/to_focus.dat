40|$|In {{a recent}} study in younger adults (19 - 29 year olds) we showed {{evidence}} that distributed audiovisual attention resulted in improved discrimination performance for audiovisual stimuli compared <b>to</b> <b>focused</b> visual attention. Here, we extend our findings to healthy older adults (60 - 90 year olds), showing that performance benefits of distributed audiovisual attention in this population match those of younger adults. Specifically, improved performance was revealed in faster response times for semantically congruent audiovisual stimuli during distributed relative <b>to</b> <b>focused</b> visual attention, without any differences in accuracy. For semantically incongruent stimuli, discrimination accuracy was significantly improved during distributed relative <b>to</b> <b>focused</b> attention. Furthermore, event-related neural processing showed intact crossmodal integration in higher performing older adults similar to younger adults. Thus, there was insufficient evidence to support an age-related deficit in crossmodal attention...|$|R
