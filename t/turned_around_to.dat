5|$|The Natchez had {{prepared}} by seizing the galley of the West India Company anchored on the river, {{so that no}} Frenchmen could board it and attempt to escape. They had also stationed warriors {{on the other side}} of the river to intercept those who might flee in that direction. The commandant at the Yazoo trading post of Fort St. Pierre, Monsieur du Codère, was visiting Fort Rosalie with a Jesuit priest when they heard gunshots. They <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> return to their ship, but warriors caught up with them, killing and scalping them.|$|E
5|$|With {{the weather}} worsening, Lütjens {{attempted}} to detach Prinz Eugen at 16:40. The squall was not heavy {{enough to cover}} her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. Prinz Eugen was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. Bismarck <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing Suffolk to turn away at high speed. Prince of Wales fired twelve salvos at Bismarck, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted Prinz Eugen to slip away.|$|E
5|$|However, the Japanese retreated beyond Port Arthur's gunfire support range, and {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by main forces of six battleships. At 0850, Makarov <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> {{head back to the}} harbor and join with three other battleships that had just left. After the squadron had united and turned back towards the enemy, about two miles from the shore, on 9.42 Petropavlosk detonated a Japanese-laid mine on her port side. Petropavlovsk sank, taking 27 officers and 652 men, including Admiral Makarov and war artist Vasily Vereshchagin with her. A monument was constructed in Saint Petersburg in 1913 to honor Stephan Makarov after Japanese divers identified his remains inside the wreck of Petropavlovsk and gave him a burial at sea.|$|E

5|$|At around 09:30, {{the four}} CH-46 {{helicopters}} arrived in Ngok Tavak, {{and they were}} able to unload Makowski and about 45 soldiers of the 12th MSF Company. However, the VC demonstrated their domination of the landing zone when the first helicopter was hit with anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to land on the ground, intact, though with damages to the fuel line. Moments later, the third helicopter was struck by a rocket propelled grenade as it <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> rescue the crews of the first downed helicopter, and it was destroyed immediately. Now, with two downed helicopters blocking the landing zone, the remaining helicopters were prevented from landing on the ground, so the wounded men had to be evacuated while the helicopters were still hovering. As the last helicopter took off, two Nungs and one stranded U.S. soldier grabbed the helicopter skids to get out of Ngok Tavak, but they all fell to their deaths. Shortly after his arrival, Makowski placed the 12th MSF Company under the command of his Australian counterpart, as the situation continued to worsen.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Australia around the former German colonies, {{combined with the}} likelihood of Japan declaring war on Germany, prompted von Spee to withdraw his ships from the region. On 13 August, the East Asia Squadron—with the exception of , which was sent to prey on British shipping in the Indian Ocean—had begun to move eastwards. After appearing off Samoa on 14 September, then attacking Tahiti eight days later, von Spee led his force to South America, and from there planned to sail for the Atlantic. Patey was ordered on 17 September to head back north with Australia and Sydney to protect the Australian expeditionary force. On 1 October, Australia, Sydney, Montcalm, and Encounter headed north from Rabaul to find the German ships, but <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> return at midnight, after receiving an Admiralty message about the Tahiti attack. Although Patey suspected that the Germans were heading for South America and wanted to follow with Australia, the Admiralty was unsure that the intelligence was accurate, and tasked the battlecruiser with patrolling around Fiji in case they returned. Australia reached Suva on 12 October, {{and spent the next}} four weeks patrolling the waters around Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia: despite Patey's desires to range out further, Admiralty orders kept him chained to Suva until early November.|$|E

25|$|No {{one could}} argue that the Australian team wasn't {{in the middle of a}} slump.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues of the 2006 elections is the economy. The high external debt and internal debt have inhibited growth. Around 75% of the population lives on less than US$2 a day, unemployment and underemployment are close to 50%, and income inequality is very pronounced. However, there have been some recent improvements. Real economic growth declined from 7.4% in 1999 to 1% in 2002, then <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> grow back to 2.3% in 2003, and about 4% in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Cable needles are a {{specific}} design, {{and are used}} to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable. They are made in different sizes, which produces cables of different widths.

25|$|In the Town of Poughkeepsie, {{just after}} the {{northern}} terminus of NY9D, 9 passes another distressed mall, South Hills and its healthier, newer counterpart, the Poughkeepsie Galleria. A mile further north, NY113 swings to the west at a cloverleaf interchange near the IBM plant, once the region's major employer. Entering the city of Poughkeepsie, at Sharon Drive, 9 returns to expressway status once again. Two miles (3.2km) north of Sharon, the highway connects to the US44/NY55 concurrency at an interchange {{in close proximity to}} the Mid-Hudson Bridge. This creates some unusual left exits, as traffic from 44/55 east wanting to go north on 9 is routed into a U-turn south of the highway, and likewise northbound drivers on 9 must get <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> go west over the river.

25|$|Lozada and {{her partner}} split up while chasing the suspect. She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and waited at the lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect she pretended to be looking for a lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> look for the dog and Lozada pulled out her service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through her cheek. He then walked a short distance only to return after a few moments to shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E

25|$|Meeting no resistance, {{the column}} reached the second {{intersection}} at the Al-Arba'een square. A {{member of the}} militia, Mahmoud 'Awad, fired two RPG rounds at the lead tank. One round caused superficial damage, and the other missed. Further ahead, the militia had set up another ambush. Ibrahim Suleiman, positioned in a hideout between Cinema Royal and Cinema Egypt, heard the explosions, and asked his comrade, Mohamed Sarhan, to prepare an RPG round. At a range of 12 meters, Suleiman fired his RPG, hitting the turret ring. The tank blew up, and its cannon tilted to the ground. Moments later, Sarhan fired an RPG round against the APC trailing the lead tank. The APC, carrying paratroopers inside, caught fire. At this point, masses of civilians and soldiers began moving towards the square from the adjacent buildings and from roads leading to the square. The column came to a halt, and began receiving heavy small arms fire, also coming under attack by hand grenades. Within minutes, twenty out of the twenty-four Israeli tank commanders were hit. The Israelis panicked, and began disembarking their vehicles and taking cover in nearby buildings. One group of soldiers tried to enter Cinema Royal, but were repulsed at the entrance. One of the APCs that were hit was carrying the brigade's intelligence group. The group abandoned the APC, and all nine men entered a nearby building, where they were presumably killed. The remainder of the battalion <b>turned</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> retreat, which was disorderly. The retreating forces came under attack by small arms, grenades and Molotov cocktails. Four tanks came up behind Sidi Al-Arba'een Mosque, but were ambushed by soldiers from the 19th Division, forcing the tanks to retreat.|$|E

In the night, the High Seas Fleet successfully passed behind the British fleet and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June.
