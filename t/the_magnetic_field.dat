5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} {{is traditionally}} {{divided into three}} parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10RJ from the planet. <b>The</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) and outer (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the structure of}} <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> inside <b>the</b> neutron stars in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. In order to construct <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> we derive <b>the</b> relativistic Grad-Shafranov equation in EiBI, and numerically determine <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> distribution {{in such a way}} that <b>the</b> interior <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> should be connected to the exterior distribution. Then, we find that <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> distribution inside <b>the</b> neutron stars in EiBI is qualitatively similar to that in general relativity, where <b>the</b> deviation of <b>magnetic</b> distribution in EiBI from that in general relativity is almost comparable to uncertainty due to the equation of state (EOS) for the neutron star matter. However, we also find that <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in <b>the</b> crust region are almost independent of the coupling constant in EiBI, which suggests a possibility to obtain the information about the crust EOS independently of the gravitational theory via the observations of the phenomena associated with the crust region. In any case, since the imprint of EiBI gravity on <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> is weak, <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> could be a poor probe of gravitational theories, considering many magnetic uncertainties.

40|$|Aims: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> {{exist on}} all scales in our Galaxy. There is a {{controversy}} on whether <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in molecular clouds are preserved from <b>the</b> permeated <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in <b>the</b> interstellar medium (ISM). We {{want to check}} this controversy using available data {{in the light of}} <b>the</b> newly revealed <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> structure of <b>the</b> Galactic disk obtained from pulsar rotation measures (RMs). Methods: We collected the measurements of <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in molecular clouds, including Zeeman splitting data of OH masers in clouds and OH or HI absorption or emission lines of clouds themselves. Results: These Zeeman data show structures in the sign distribution of line-of-sight component of <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Comparing with <b>the</b> large- scale Galactic <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> from pulsar RMs we found that the sign-distribution show similar large-scale field reversals. Previous such examinations were flawed by the over-simplified global model for <b>the</b> large-scale <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in <b>the</b> Galactic disk. Conclusions: We conclude that <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in <b>the</b> clouds may still "remember" <b>the</b> directions of <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in <b>the</b> Galactic ISM to some extent, and could be used as completementary tracer for <b>the</b> large-scale <b>magnetic</b> structure.

5|$|An {{electron}} generates {{an electric}} field that exerts an attractive force on a particle {{with a positive}} charge, such as the proton, and a repulsive force on a particle with a negative charge. The strength of this force in nonrelativistic approximation is determined by Coulomb's inverse square law. When an electron is in motion, it generates a magnetic field. The Ampère-Maxwell law relates <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> to the mass motion of electrons (the current) with respect to an observer. This property of induction supplies <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> that drives an electric motor.

This {{distance}} was measured in 2007 near the solar activity minimum. Near the solar activity maximum it can be several times further from the planet. The magnetopause {{is located at the}} altitude of 300km. The upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) is near 250km. Between the magnetopause and ionopause there exists a magnetic barrier—a local enhancement of <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> which prevents solar plasma from penetrating deeper into the Venusian atmosphere, at least near solar activity minimum. <b>The</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in the barrier reaches up to 40nT. The magnetotail continues up to ten radiuses from the planet. It is the most active part of the Venusian magnetosphere. There are reconnection events and particle acceleration in the tail.

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of <b>the</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years.
