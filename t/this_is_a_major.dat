5|$|T.chatareus {{are known}} to occur in shaded areas with {{vegetation}} overhead, usually at {{the top layer of}} the water column. They are found only where there is an intact riparian area, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> source of their food. T.chatareus are usually not found in fast-flowing streams.|$|E
5|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{occurs in}} the cytoplasm; for very long transcripts, translation may begin at the 5'end of the RNA while the 3'end is still being transcribed. In eukaryotes, transcription {{occurs in the}} nucleus, where the cell's DNA is stored. The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase {{is known as the}} primary transcript and undergoes post-transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation. One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein. Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes.|$|E

5|$|In the Hindu religion, {{there has}} been partial success in terms of gender {{equality}} reform laws and family law. While <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> advancement relative to other religions in India, {{it is still not}} a complete triumph in terms of feminism and relieving oppression. Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts. It {{is important to note that}} both the deity of knowledge and the deity of wealth are female.|$|E
5|$|The paws of the cheetah are {{narrower}} {{than those}} of other felids. The slightly curved claws lack a protective sheath and are weakly retractable (semi-retractable). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> point of difference between the cheetah and the big cats, which have fully retractable claws, and a similarity to canids. Additionally, the claws of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter {{than those of}} other cats. Absence of protection makes the claws blunt; however, the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E

25|$|As far as topographically possible, {{the temples}} were {{freestanding}} {{and designed to}} be viewed from all sides. They were not normally designed with consideration for their surroundings, but formed autonomous structures. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> difference from Roman temples which were often designed {{as part of a}} planned urban area or square and had a strong emphasis on being viewed frontally.|$|E
25|$|American Motors was {{developing}} entirely new models for 1963 and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> capital drain. Entering {{a completely new}} market segment with an unproven car could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> costly mistake.|$|R

25|$|When Exodus recreates the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob {{offers to}} join but is quickly {{dismissed}} by Exodus, who considers him useless. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> blow to Dukes' already weak self-esteem, {{for which he}} seeks the counsel of therapist Sean Garrison. After a session, Blob attacks the Xavier Institute, though he is defeated by the combined efforts of the New Mutants and the Hellions. He is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
25|$|Two {{species of}} Banksia are found on Mount Henry Peninsula, B.attenuata (candlestick banksia) and B.menziesii (firewood banksia). B.attenuata flowers from spring into {{summer and the}} B.menziesii {{flowering}} occurs in autumn and winter, the presence of both these species on Mount Henry Peninsula means that {{at any time during}} an annual period, {{at least one of the}} species of Banksia will be in flower, <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> factor in the support of Mount Henry Peninsula's bird population.|$|E
25|$|The {{very fast}} growth {{rate and the}} weight of a St. Bernard can lead to very serious {{deterioration}} of the bones if the dog does not get proper food and exercise. Many dogs are genetically affected by hip dysplasia or elbow dysplasia. Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) {{has been shown to be}} hereditary in the breed. They are susceptible to eye disorders called entropion and ectropion, in which the eyelid turns in or out. The breed standard indicates that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> fault. The breed is also susceptible to epilepsy and seizures, a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, and eczema.|$|E
50|$|However, further work {{on making}} {{homes in the}} urban {{interface}} ignition resistant <b>is</b> needed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> topic at the NFPA Backyards and Beyond conference held in Salt Lake City in 2013.|$|R
50|$|At Taima-Taima, José Cruxent {{discovered}} El Jobo projectile points, {{which are}} believed to be the earliest such artefacts in South America, going back to 16,000 BP. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> discovery in Paleoindian archaeology.|$|R
50|$|A deal to {{sell the}} ground (and lease {{it back to the}} club) to cancel out the club's {{considerable}} debts in 2011 failed. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> factor in the club's folding in 2012.|$|R
25|$|The best current {{camera system}} designs can {{differentiate}} two separate point sources of gamma photons located at 6 to 12mm depending on {{distance from the}} collimator, the type of collimator and radio-nucleide. Spatial resolution decreases rapidly at increasing distances from the camera face. This limits the spatial accuracy of the computer image: it is a fuzzy image made up of many dots of detected but not precisely located scintillation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> limitation for heart muscle imaging systems; the thickest normal heart muscle in the left ventricle is about 1.2cm {{and most of the}} left ventricle muscle is about 0.8cm, always moving and much of it beyond 5cm from the collimator face. To help compensate, better imaging systems limit scintillation counting to a portion of the heart contraction cycle, called gating, however this further limits system sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{urban sprawl}} of Mexico City reached the borough of Tlalpan in the mid-20th century, {{but only the}} far north of the borough is urbanized. This area {{accounts}} for over 80% of the borough population, {{who live in a}} mix of middle class residential areas and large apartment complexes for the lower classes. This northern area is crossed by a number of major road arteries such as the Anillo Periférico, Calzada de Tlalpan, Viaducto-Tlalpan, Acoxpa, Division del Norte/Miramontes, which experience extremely heavy traffic during rush hour. The highway connecting Mexico City with Cuernavaca also passes through the borough. Intersections of these major roads have large commercial and retail complexes such as that of Avenida Insurgentes and Anillo Periferico, which has several of these complexes, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> highway connection for the south of the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} in forming a supermassive black hole {{resides in the}} need for enough matter {{to be in a}} small enough volume. This matter needs to have very little angular momentum in order for this to happen. Normally, the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards, and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> component of the theory of accretion disks. Gas accretion is the most efficient and also the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow. The majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion, which are observable as active galactic nuclei or quasars. Observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger, indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early. A major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars, which indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 2009, P. C. George {{faction of}} the Kerala Congress decided to merge with Kerala Congress (M). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> {{breakthrough}} in the Kerala politics since George abused and criticised Mani for many years.|$|R
25|$|Dredd {{was appalled}} {{to learn that}} the Mechanismo Programme had {{continued}} in secret, and openly demanded the Chief Judge's resignation.

25|$|From the {{north-western}} {{corner of}} the pyramid the connecting ridge to Kirk Fell runs out across the col of Beck Head (2,050ft). There is a small tarn in the depression, and sometimes a second after heavy rain. Both are blind, having no apparent inlet or ouflow. Gable Beck runs south from Beck Head, while an unnamed tributary of the Liza flows northward. The main spine of the Western Fells continues along the north east ridge to Green Gable, dropping to Windy Gap (2,460ft) as it rounds the end of Gable Crag. This ridge is rough and rocky, further worn by the boots of countless walkers. Stone Cove lies on the Ennerdale side while the rough gully of Aaron Slack runs down toward Styhead Tarn. The south-eastern ridge provides the connection to the Southern Fells, across the pass of Sty Head. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> crossroads for walkers and climbers, the summit being at around 1,560ft. On the opposite slope is Great End in the Scafells. Kern Knotts lies on this south-east ridge, as does the small pool of Dry Tarn. The south-western ridge gives to high level connection, dropping down Gavel Neese in the angle between Lingmell Beck and Gable Beck.|$|E

The 2018 Commodore {{will be offered}} with four or six-cylinder engine options, as well as front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> departure from the V8 and rear wheel drive variants available on the previous generation Commodore.|$|E
500|$|When the {{follicular}} {{cells are}} stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone, the follicular cells reabsorb thyroglobulin from the follicular space. The iodinated tyrosines are cleaved, forming the thyroid hormones T4, T3, DIT, MIT, and traces of reverse triiodothyronine. T3 and T4 are {{released into the}} blood. The hormones secreted from the gland are about 80–90% T4 and about 10–20% T3. Deiodinase enzymes in peripheral tissues remove the iodine from MIT and DIT and convert T4 to T3 and RT3. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> source of both RT3 (95%) and T3 (87%) in peripheral tissues.|$|E
25|$|With {{the lack}} of sociological theory being taught at the University of Chicago paired with the new {{foundations}} of statistical methods, the student’s ability to make any real predictions <b>was</b> nonexistent. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> factor in {{the downfall of the}} Chicago school.|$|R
2500|$|According to Norman Davies, the Khatyn {{massacre}} {{was deliberately}} exploited by the Soviet authorities {{to cover up}} the Katyn massacre, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> reason for erecting the memorial—it was done in order to cause confusion with Katyn among foreign visitors.|$|R
