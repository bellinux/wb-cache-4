5|$|Filming {{started in}} Austria in December 2014, with {{production}} {{taking in the}} area around Sölden—including the Ötztal Glacier Road, Rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station—and Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee, before concluding in February 2015. Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant, standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik, a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps. Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport. Various airplane models were used in filming, from a life-sized plane with detachable wings to film the crash in the woods, <b>to</b> <b>plane</b> fuselages either built atop snowmobiles or shot from nitrogen cannons. Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig, who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene, and later by an accident involving a filming vehicle that saw three crew members injured, {{at least one of them}} seriously.|$|E

25|$|The bit {{includes}} a center point which guides {{it throughout the}} cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers {{at the edge of}} the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. The tool in the image has a total of two cutting edges in this cylinder. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges <b>to</b> <b>plane</b> off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bit in the image has two radial edges. Other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.|$|E
25|$|The {{tendency}} towards abstraction in art {{corresponded with}} abstraction in architecture. Publication of Concerning the Spiritual in Art in 1912 by Wassily Kandinsky, his first advocacy of abstraction while still {{involved in the}} Blau Reiter phaze, marks a beginning of abstraction in expressionism and abstraction in expressionist architecture. The conception of the Einstein Tower by Erich Mendelson was not far behind Kandinsky, in advancing abstraction in architecture. By the publication of Kandinsky's Point and Line <b>to</b> <b>Plane</b> in 1926 a rigorous and more geometric form of abstraction emerged, and Kandinsky's work took on clearer and drafted lines. The trends in architecture are not dissimilar, as the Bauhaus was gaining attention and expressionist architecture was giving way to the geometric abstractions of modern architecture.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the death}} of Jules Roche, the Gleizes' had enough {{independent}} income and real estate to pursue their goals without bowing to material considerations, unlike many other artists. The Gleizes' spent {{more and more time}} at the family home in Serrières, in Cavalaire, and an even quieter location on the French Riviera, both associating with people more sympathetic to their social ideas. Gleizes became active in the Union Intellectuelle and lectured extensively in France, Germany, Poland and England, while continuing to write. In 1924–25 the Bauhaus (where certain ideals analogous to his own were practiced) requested a new book on Cubism (as part of a series which included Wassily Kandinsky's Point and Line <b>to</b> <b>Plane,</b> Paul Klee's Pedagogical Notebooks, and Kasimir Malevich's The Non-Objective World). Gleizes, in response, would write Kubismus (published in 1928) for the collection of Bauhausbücher 13, Munich. The publication of Kubismus in French the following year would bring Gleizes closer to Delaunay. In 1924 Gleizes, Léger and Amédée Ozenfant opened Académie Moderne.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate, by means of cephalometric appraisal, the {{vertical}} effects of non-extraction treatment of adult anterior open bite with clear aligners (Invisalign system, Align Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Methods: Lateral cephalograms of 30 adult patients with anterior open bite treated using Invisalign (22 females, 8 males; mean age at start of treatment: 28 years and 10 months; mean anterior open bite at start of treatment: 1. 8 mm) were analyzed. Pre- and post-treatment cephalograms were traced to compare the following vertical measurements: SN <b>to</b> maxillary occlusal <b>plane</b> (SN-MxOP), SN <b>to</b> mandibular occlusal <b>plane</b> (SN-MnOP), mandibular <b>plane</b> <b>to</b> mandibular occlusal <b>plane</b> (MP-MnOP), SN <b>to</b> mandibular <b>plane</b> (SN-MP), SN <b>to</b> palatal <b>plane</b> (SN-PP), SN <b>to</b> gonion-gnathion <b>plane</b> (SN-GoGn), upper 1 tip <b>to</b> palatal <b>plane</b> (U 1 -PP), lower 1 tip <b>to</b> mandibular <b>plane</b> (L 1 -MP), mesiobuccal cusp of upper 6 <b>to</b> palatal <b>plane</b> (U 6 -PP), mesiobuccal cusp of lower 6 <b>to</b> mandibular <b>plane</b> (L 6 -MP), lower anterior facial height (LAFH), and overbite (OB). Paired t-tests and descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze the data and assess any significant changes resulting from treatment. Results: Statistically significant differences were found in overall treatment changes for SN-MxOP, SN-MnOP, MP-MnOP, SN-MP, SN-GoGn, L 1 -MP, L 6 -MP, LAFH, and OB. Conclusions: The Invisalign system is a viable therapeutic modality for non-extraction treatment of adult anterior mild open bites. Bite closure was mainly achieved by a combination of counterclockwise rotation of the mandibular plane, lower molar intrusion and lower incisor extrusion...|$|R

25|$|On {{the right}} is an {{illustration}} of the electric field vectors of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. The electric field vectors have a constant magnitude but their direction changes in a rotary manner. Given {{that this is a}} plane wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Specifically, given that this is a circularly polarized plane wave, these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane <b>to</b> <b>plane,</b> has a constant strength while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better appreciate this. This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise circularly polarized if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an electromagnetic wave each electric field vector has a corresponding, but not illustrated, magnetic field vector that is at a right angle to the electric field vector and proportional in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.|$|E
25|$|Engineer William Rich Hutton was {{instrumental}} in getting the inclined plane built. Starting in 1875, a canal inclined plane was built two miles (3km) upriver from Georgetown, so that boats whose destination was downriver from Washington could bypass the congestion (and price gouging of independent wharf owners) in Georgetown. Originally the company planned to build a river lock, but then discovered that such a lock occasionally would consume more water than the level could provide. They then planned to make an inclined plane, much like the Morris Canal. The first boat went through in 1876; 1918 boats used the inclined plane that first year. Usage reports conflict: Hahn reports that was only really used for two years, and sporadically in 1889, yet Skramstad reports that due to flood damage in 1880 to the Rock Creek outlet, any boat until 1889 (when another flood wrecked the canal) going further down the Potomac than Georgetown, {{had to use the}} inclined plane. Although Hahn says it was the largest inclined plane in the world at that time, it was 600 feet long, which is short compared <b>to</b> <b>Plane</b> 9 West of the Morris Canal at 1,500 feet. It originally used a turbine to power it (like the Morris Canal) but was later switched to use steam power.|$|E

Since the core game mechanics were set, their feedback pertained to the level design. As their primary interests were in a [...] "unification of art, craft, and technology", the game had no public relations or marketing campaign and its creators expressed little interest in the app's business and marketing, though they did share the game directly with media outlets.|$|E
