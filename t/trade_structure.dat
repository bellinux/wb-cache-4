50|$|An {{important}} transformation {{occurred in}} Korea's trade {{policy in the}} sixth five-year plan, which witnessed the change in trend from heavy industry toward export - oriented consumer products, including electronics and high tech. Foreign investment policies were relaxed {{in response to a}} decrease in domestic investment, cross-border capital movement increased significantly. Restrictions on imports were removed, but a variety of non-tariff barriers complicated <b>trade</b> <b>structure.</b> In 1986, Korea for the first time achieved a favorable trade balance, a trade surplus of US$4.2 billion. However the transformations in the trade policy eventually lead to challenges in the 1990s. In 1990's domestic consumption of luxury goods increased including high tech and electronics products which reduced exports which resulted in Korea's trade deficit and current account deficit. In mid-1990's Korea reduced tariff rates and import restriction on autos, high tech products and financial services.|$|E
50|$|In {{recognition}} of the increasing importance of global resource use mediated by international trade for environmental accounting and policy, new perspectives have been and are currently being developed within environmental accounting. The most prominent among these are consumption-based accounts compiled using environmentally extended input-output analysis. Consumption-based indicators of material use are {{commonly referred to as}} “material footprints” (comparable to carbon footprints and water footprints) or as raw material equivalents (RME) for imported and exported goods. Raw material equivalents or material footprints of traded goods comprise the material inputs required along the entire supply chain associated with their production. This includes both direct and indirect flows: For example, the ore mined to extract the metal contained in a mobile phone as well as the coal needed to generate the electricity needed to produce the metal concentrates would be included. In order to allocate domestic extraction to exported goods, information on the production and <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> of an economy is required. In monetary terms, information on the production structure is contained in commonly available economy-wide input-output tables (IOT) which recently have been combined with trade statistics to form multi-regional IO (MRIO) tables.|$|E

In 1936, he passed the entrance examination into Yaba Higher College and he won a scholarship from UAC to study commerce at the college. However, just after 6 months left the college with his scholarship unused. He was offered employment by UAC as an assistant to the Ibadan district manager, an expatriate Adelabu had met a year earlier. His first assignment was a tour of the cocoa producing areas of Ibadan province. At the end of the tour, he presented a proposal about the reorganization of the Cocoa distribution and <b>trade</b> <b>structure.</b> The report earned him promotion as an Assistant Produce Manager with UAC.

It examines prevailing <b>trade</b> <b>structures</b> and <b>trade</b> types to study differences and similarities in trade specialization patterns between primary and processed agricultural and food products across product groups, over time and in comparison with some other European Union countries. We distinguish agricultural and food trade flows by the degree of processing on primary, processed and other agricultural and food products separately for direct household consumption and for industry. With this, we add to the existent literature for Slovenia and for other new European Union members this product classification. Most of Slovenian agricultural and food trade is in the processed products. One-way or inter-industry trade dominates Slovenian agricultural and food <b>trade</b> <b>structures.</b> Within the matched two-way or intra-industry trade the significance in specialization is on low-quality vertical intra-industry trade.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact that entry to the European Union has on the <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> of Eastern European countries. To narrow {{the scope of the}} the-sis, this study focuses on a {{comparative}} analysis of two Central Eastern Euro-pean countries (CEECs) explored by Bernard Hoekman and Simeon Djankov in their article "Determinants of the Export Structure of Countries in Central and Eastern Europe —Czech Republic and Romania". These member states were chosen because external factors such as Foreign Direct Investment, Out-ward Processing Trade, and Imports in Intermediate Consumption interact with their <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> in a similar way. This aids the comparison of their accessions to the European Union. By examining their import and export data to the EU, using the UN ComTrade database, we track <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> changes from 1999 - 2009. We look at the commodities that fall into the top 80 % of the total dollar values for each country's import and exports year by year to under-stand the structural changes in the country's <b>trade</b> <b>structure.</b> We then quantify these changes using the measure of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA). RCA analysis demonstrates that both Romania and the Czech Republic expe-rienced a decline in apparel manufacturing followed by a rise in heavy indus-tries production. Romania, however, experienced a much more drastic change in <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> than the Czech Republic. Romania's shift from apparel to heavy industries was much more pronounced between 1999 and 2009. To compare this shift within each country, we run a correlation analysis between the RCA values of 1999 and 2009. Our findings demonstrate that Romania underwent significant changes in over half of its <b>trade</b> <b>structure,</b> while the <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> of the Czech Republic remained largely unchanged over the same ten-year study period. Therefore, this study explores the changes in trade dy-namics Romania and Czech Republic underwent during their EU accessions. It disaggregates those differences to provide a comprehensive understanding of two EU accessions and lays a foundation for future research to explore the social, political and external factors driving these differences. Extrapolating the findings suggests that depending on different pre-accession conditions, a candidate's trade development may influence fundamental structural changes of primary trade sectors in Eastern European nations undergoing accession to the European Union...|$|E

Measuring transaction costs and the quantitative analysis of the relationship between transaction costs and other economic indicators has become a central theme of analysis in the NIE. By measuring China's macroscopic transaction costs since 1978 and utilizing a dynamic econometric model, this chapter analyzes the relationship between macroscopic transaction costs and China's economic growth and <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> changes. The findings suggest that in the mid- and long-term, growth in China's macroscopic transaction costs does stimulate exports while restraining domestic trade.

The issue becomes important as CEECs as candidates for EU membership will become subject to the same Single Market arrangements that regulate access of EU members to each other's markets. As compared to the current situation, compliance with EU regulations can be seen as enabling easier access of CEE producers to EU markets in the long run even though they might impose costs of adjustment in the short and medium run. This is the topic analysed in a quantitative manner. We start in this paper by reporting the most important facts on CEE-EU <b>trade</b> <b>structures</b> and their developments. We analyse the export structure of CEECs, the development of market shares and the CEECs' position with respect to export unit values. Second, we try to quantify the coverage of technical barriers to trade in the CEECs' <b>trade</b> <b>structures</b> with the European Union. All this is done at an industrial level based on product level information on TBTs. Finally, we make a tentative attempt to see whether a relationship may be established between the incidence of different types of trade barriers and the market performance of CEE exporters.

40|$|For much of {{the past}} thirty-face years Japan has {{imported}} a remarkably small share of the manufactured goods it consumes. This distinctive <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> is regularly cited by policy makes as evidence that, despite the absence of formal barriers, foreign manufacturers are systemically denied access to the Japanese market. Alternative explanations of Japan's distinctive <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> are possible. Using specifications directly derived from traditional models of comparative advantage, Japan's distinctive inter-industry <b>trade</b> <b>structure</b> can be largely explained by Japan's equally distinctive pattern of factor endowments. Scarcely any reference needs to be made at all to distinctive Japanese government trade policies. Japan's participation in intra-industry trade in manufactures is also distinctively low. Traditional models of comparative advantage do not explain intra-industry trade. Such trade can be explained, however, if allowance is made for product differentiation and economies of scale. While traditional models of comparative advantage explain net trade as a linear function of factor endowments, with intra-industry trade models gross trade in imports and exports can still be a function of factor endowments. Indeed, if expressed as a share of GNP, gross imports are still a linear function of factor endowments. Using this framework, it can be shown that Japan's intra-industry trade, like Japan's inter-industry trade, does conform to international patterns. The removal of the remaining distinctive Japanese barriers, both formal and informal, to the import of manufactures, while highly desirable from a diplomatic standpoint, may have little impact on Japanese <b>trade</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|E
