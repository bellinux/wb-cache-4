6000|$|I like Dr. Johnson's {{political}} pamphlets {{better than}} any other parts of his works:-particularly his [...] "Taxation no Tyranny" [...] is very clever and spirited, though he only sees half of his subject, and that not in a very philosophical manner. Plunder--Tribute--Taxation--are the three gradations of action by the sovereign on the property of the subject. The first is mere violence, bounded by no law or custom, and is properly an act only between conqueror and conquered, and that, too, in the moment of victory. The second supposes law; but law proceeding only from, and dictated by, one party, the conqueror; law, by which he consents to forego his right of plunder upon condition of the conquered giving up to him, of their own accord, a fixed commutation. The third implies compact, and negatives any right to plunder,--taxation being professedly for the direct benefit of the party taxed, that, by paying a part, he may through the labours and superintendence of the sovereign be able to enjoy the rest in peace. As to the right to tax being only commensurate with direct representation, it is a fable, falsely and treacherously brought forward by those who know its hollowness well enough. You may show its weakness in a moment, by observing that not even the universal suffrage of the Benthamites avoids the difficulty;--for although it may be allowed to be contrary to decorum that women should legislate; yet there can be no reason why women should not choose their representatives to legislate;--and if it be said that they are merged in their husbands, let it be allowed where the wife has no separate property; but where she has a distinct <b>taxable</b> <b>estate,</b> in which her husband has no interest, what right can her husband have to choose for her the person whose vote may affect her separate interest?--Besides, at all events, an unmarried woman of age, possessing one thousand pounds a year, has surely as good a moral right to vote, if taxation without representation is tyranny, as any ten-pounder in the kingdom. The truth, of course, is, that direct representation is a chimera, impracticable in fact, and useless or noxious if practicable.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxable amount}} of a gift is the {{fair market value}} of the {{property}} in excess of consideration received at the date of gift. The taxable amount of an estate is the gross fair market value of all rights considered property at the date of death (or an alternative valuation date) ("gross estate"), less liabilities of the decedent, costs of administration (including funeral expenses) and certain other deductions. State estate taxes are deductible, with limitations, in computing the federal <b>taxable</b> <b>estate.</b> Bequests to charities reduce the <b>taxable</b> <b>estate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Does {{taxation}} {{affect the}} timing of death? This is an interesting example of how behavior might be affected by economic incentives. We study how two changes in Swedish inheritance taxation 2003 / 04 and 2004 / 05 have affected mortality during the turns of the years. Our first main result is that deceased with <b>estates</b> <b>taxable</b> for legal heirs were 10 percentage points {{more likely to have}} died on New Year' Day 2005, from when the inheritance tax was repealed, rather than on New Year's Eve 2004, compared to deceased without <b>taxable</b> <b>estates</b> for legal heirs. The second main result is that deceased with <b>estates</b> <b>taxable</b> for a married spouse were 12 percentage points more likely to have died on New Year's Day 2004, from when the inheritance tax between spouses was repealed, rather than on New Year's Eve 2003, compared to deceased without <b>taxable</b> <b>estates</b> for a married spouse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{explores the}} {{behavioral}} response of tax-able bequests to estate taxation. To gauge its effects, {{the estate tax}} is converted to an equivalent income tax. This {{highlights the importance of}} expected rates of return, and also makes it possible to compare effective tax rates on saving over time. Using data on federal revenues from the estate tax over the past 50 years, and employing the equivalent income tax rate measure, the fi ndings suggest that estate taxes have a dampening effect on the reported size of <b>taxable</b> <b>estates.</b> Estate taxation seems to depress taxable bequests by almost ten percent...|$|R

50|$|If possible, {{the trustee}} of the {{insurance}} trust should be the original applicant {{and owner of the}} insurance. If the insured transfers an existing policy to the insurance trust, the transfer will be recognized by the Internal Revenue Service only if the insured survives the date of the transfer by not less than three years.

If the proceeds are used to pay the insured's estate taxes, it would at first appear that the proceeds could not be on hand to be taxed at the beneficiary's subsequent death. However, using insurance proceeds to pay the insured's estate taxes effectively increases the beneficiary's estate since the beneficiary will not have to sell inherited assets to pay such taxes.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (LL. M.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Estate duty in South Africa is levied {{in terms}} of the Estate Duty Act since 1955. Estate duty is {{currently}} calculated at a flat rate of 20 % on the amount of which the net worth of an estate exceeds a primary rebate of R 3, 5 million. Statistics show that {{only a small percentage of}} estates in South Africa is <b>taxable.</b> Furthermore, many <b>estate</b> owners – particularly those whose estates are liable for estate duty – have the financial means to afford estate planning services to reduce estate duty. This reality has the effect that estate duty is paid by a very insignificant number of estates. Similar to estate duty, capital gains tax has the tax incentive of constituting vertical equity – creating the outcome that taxpayers with greater capability to pay taxes should be taxed more severely. Capital gains tax is also a tax payable (among other instances) at the death of an estate owner. This gives rise to double taxation. Further matters that need to be considered are constitutional justification of estate duty and the question whether the categories of current <b>taxable</b> <b>estates</b> correlate with the <b>taxable</b> <b>estates</b> envisaged by the legislator in 1955. In amending fiscal policy, it is useful to consider international trends. In countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada estate duty has been abolished. This phenomenon demonstrates that estate duty is not an essential element of a tax system. The aim of this study is to investigate the contribution of the abolishment of estate duty to South African tax law. Master...|$|R

5000|$|For {{a person}} dying during 2006, 2007, or 2008, the [...] "applicable {{exclusion}} amount" [...] is $2,000,000, {{so if the}} sum of the <b>taxable</b> <b>estate</b> plus the [...] "adjusted taxable gifts" [...] made during lifetime equals $2,000,000 or less, there is no federal estate tax to pay. According to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, the applicable exclusion increased to $3,500,000 in 2009, and the estate tax was repealed for estates of decedents dying in 2010, but then the Act was to [...] "sunset" [...] in 2011 and the estate tax was to reappear with an applicable exclusion amount of only $1,000,000.|$|E

For aliens, residence for estate tax purposes is primarily based on domicile, but U.S. citizens are taxed regardless of their country of residence.
