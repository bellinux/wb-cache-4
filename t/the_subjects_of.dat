5000|$|The Washo {{language}} of California and Nevada exhibits a switch-reference system. When <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> one verb {{is the same}} as <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following verb, the verb takes no switch-reference marker. However, if <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> one verb differs from <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following verb, the verb takes the [...] "different subject" [...] marker, -š (examples from Mithun 1999:269): ...|$|R

50|$|The aspectual {{system of}} Ch'orti' {{language}} {{changed to a}} tripartite pronominal system which comes with different morphemes used for <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> transitive verbs, <b>the</b> object of transitive verbs and <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> intransitive completive verbs, and a third set of pronouns only used for <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> incompletive intransitive verbs.|$|R

5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a proposal to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The proposal was prepared by a group of five experts in <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The proposal means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
5|$|Animals, often mammals but {{including}} {{fish and}} insects among other groups, have been <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> {{art from the}} earliest times, both historical, as in Ancient Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave paintings at Lascaux and other sites in the Dordogne, France and elsewhere. Major animal paintings include Albrecht Dürer's 1515 The Rhinoceros, and George Stubbs's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> the genre the band is rooted in, {{regularly}} providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} sets of PNG affixes, one set marking <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> {{ordinary}} verb forms, and another set marking <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> imperatives.|$|R

5|$|During {{the years}} of World War II, {{evacuated}} and orphaned children were <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> studies that outlined their reactions to separation, including the ability to cope by forming relationships with other children. Some of this material remained unpublished until the post-war period and only gradually contributed to understanding of young children's reactions to loss.|$|E
5|$|Fish are an {{important}} resource for humans worldwide, especially as food. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have {{had a role in}} culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> art, books and movies.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, William Baziotes, David Hare, Robert Motherwell and Mark Rothko founded <b>the</b> <b>Subjects</b> <b>of</b> the Artist School, {{which held}} artists' discussions in a loft at 35 East Eighth Street, Manhattan {{which came to}} be known as Studio 35. A closed panel {{symposium}} took place from April 21 to 23, 1950. It was organised by Robert Goodnough and moderated by Richard Lippold, Robert Motherwell and Alfred H. Barr, Jr. director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The purpose was the framing of an art movement.|$|E

5|$|Milo's legendary {{strength}} and death have become <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> modern art and literature. His {{death was a}} popular subject in 18th-century art. In many images of this period his killer is portrayed as a lion rather than wolves. In Pierre Puget's sculpture Milo of Croton (1682), the work's themes are the loss of strength with age, and the ephemerality of glory as symbolized by an Olympic trophy lying in the dust.|$|E
5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor's {{version of the same}} or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E
5|$|Sesame Street {{has also}} been <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> many controversies {{throughout}} its long run on television. In 1970, a commission in Mississippi voted to exclude the show from its state educational TV programming. The controversy surrounding the show stemmed from cultural and historical reasons regarding children and television's effect on them. Latino and feminists groups criticized Sesame Street for its depictions of some groups, but its producers have worked to address their concerns throughout the years. By 2009, Sesame Street had received 118 Emmy Awards, {{more than any other}} television series.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the field}} of {{psychology}} Gafurov reduces <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> psychology to <b>the</b> analysis of experimental psychological data. Psychology out of experiment [...] "does not exist" [...] for Gafurov. <b>The</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> psychology, he said, is [...] "the higher nervous activity." [...] Gafurov {{is characterized by the}} reduction of mass psychology (although he denies the very existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> study in [...] "Social Psychology") in rational behavior and <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> research, he sees in the analysis of the hidden rationality in irrational at first glance, behavior of the masses. Gafurov's researches are in stark contrast to his own methodological orientations. Either there is a hidden rationality, but then <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> psychology is not only the analysis of experiments, or vice versa.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, he {{appeared}} in Studies in Motion: The Hauntings of Eadweard Muybridge; Eadweard Muybridge, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> that play, would also become <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> Eadweard <b>the</b> film.|$|R

5|$|Subjective {{ownership}} {{would occur}} if subjects knowingly chose the letters {{from their own}} name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests.

5|$|The ballad {{speaks of}} the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that {{occurred}} there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.|$|E
5|$|The text {{has five}} chapters, {{structured}} {{primarily as a}} discussion between Vishnu in his Varaha (boar) avatar and the sage Ribhu. The discussion covers <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>of</b> Tattvas, the nature and relationship between the individual soul (Self, Atman) and the Ultimate Reality (Brahman), the seven stages of learning, the characteristics of Jivanmukti (inner sense of freedom while living), and the four types of Jivanmuktas (liberated persons). The last chapter of the text is dedicated to Yoga, its goals and methods.|$|E
