5|$|Diefenbaker won {{the local}} people over through his success; {{in his first year}} in practice, he tried 62 jury trials, winning {{approximately}} half of his cases.

In late 1920, {{he was elected to the}} village council <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> three-year term.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipalities}} of Voss and Granvin {{wanted to use}} the right-of-way for a hiking and bicycle path, and NSB canceled their plans.

Prudentia Hogg, who was an Evangelical Christian, was shocked when she learned that her son was promoting atheism. She was further angered when she learned that her son had become a vegetarian, a decision that she attributed to Shelley's corrupting influence.|$|E

The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100–110 trains per day. The Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments involve grains and coal. There have been various proposals over the years to add passenger service. One, the Caprock Chief, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, Texas—Denver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.|$|E
5|$|At Shakur's {{sentencing}} {{hearing on}} April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33years in state prison (10 to 12 {{for the four}} counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster), to be served consecutively with her mandatory life sentence. However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the New Jersey Supreme Court had recently narrowed {{the application of the}} law. Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for contempt of court, concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom. To become eligible for parole, Shakur would have had <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> minimum of 25years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.|$|E
5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E

The government again guaranteed finance, this time under the Development Loans Guarantees & Grants Act, the project also quadrupling the tracks from Wembley Park to Harrow. The line was electrified with automatic colour light signals controlled from a signal box at Wembley Park and opened on 9 December 1932.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes {{during the}} Druze revolt, the authorities, {{with whom he}} always had a tense relationship, grew wary of his {{strength}} and subsequently arrested him in a nighttime raid. He was sent to Istanbul by sea and from there he was sent <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> prison sentence at the Widin fortress on the Danube River. Aqil was apparently loaned some money from the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had accompanied him on the ship ride to Istanbul, and Aqil used those funds to purchase a fake passport. With the passport and a disguise, he and an Albanian inmate named Hasan Agha escaped Widin in 1854 and reached Salonica. From there, Aqil departed to Anatolia and then Aleppo. Aqil resumed his Bedouin lifestyle of raiding and nomadic dwelling.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main {{offensive}} into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February. The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the manner in which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the American dead.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{the appeal}} did not engage foreign policy considerations. The treaty was a civil {{convention}} between two countries and {{an agreement to}} render mutual judicial assistance, and {{had nothing to do}} with foreign affairs other than that it was made between state parties. It also did not involve the policing of government conduct in international affairs, because it only implicated the procedures private litigants had to take to serve writs on defendants residing in Hong Kong. When interpreting the treaty, the Court only had to determine the domestic legal obligations of the respondents seeking <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> writ out of jurisdiction. Thus, the issue of whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong was justiciable, and the Ministry's letter was not decisive on the matter.|$|E
5|$|However, no {{progress}} was made with the airfield for over a decade. Instead, the water aerodrome at Bukta was upgraded. Initially the passengers were transported to the aircraft with a boat, {{but after a few}} years a floating dock was built. Services were only provided during five summer months, from May through September. During the rest of the year, Alta had no airline service; travel time to Oslo was then six days, largely by ship. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1954, who bought a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>a</b> route from Tromsø via Alta to Hammerfest, Kirkenes and Vadsø. In Tromsø, the routes connected with a Norwegian Air Lines' seaplane service to Oslo. Bukta had 2,000 annual passengers in 1957, and the summer route was flown daily beginning in 1960.|$|E
