5|$|Bethlehem {{now has a}} Muslim majority, but {{is still}} home to a {{significant}} Palestinian Christian community. Bethlehem's chief economic sector is tourism, which peaks during <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> when Christians make pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, as they have done for almost 2,000 years. Bethlehem has over 30 hotels and 300 handicraft workshops. Rachel's Tomb, an important Jewish holy site, {{is located at the}} northern entrance of Bethlehem.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E
5|$|Dickens was not {{the first}} author to {{celebrate}} <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had been lost in the modern world.|$|E
50|$|Bill Kenwright {{produced}} a remount {{of the original}} production which toured the UK and Ireland for <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>seasons</b> between 2003 and 2013 starring Tommy Steele {{in the title role}} (with the exceptions of Shane Richie in the 2005 and 2007 tours and Michael Barrymore in the 2006 tour.

5|$|In 1844, Davis met Varina Banks Howell, then 17 years old, whom {{his brother}} Joseph had invited for <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> at Hurricane Plantation. She was a granddaughter of New Jersey Governor Richard Howell; her mother's family {{was from the}} South and {{included}} successful Scots-Irish planters. Within a month of their meeting, the 35-year-old widower Davis had asked Varina to marry him, and they became engaged despite her parents' initial concerns about his age and politics. They were married on February 26, 1845.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd custom was {{performed}} during wither festivities, specifically around {{the dates of}} Christmas and New Year.

In 1997, the Spice girls dolls {{generated}} more than $200 million in retail sales {{and the success of}} the dolls earned toymaker Galoob $150 million in pretax cash. The dolls were the fifth best-selling toy - despite limited stock - in the UK for <b>the</b> 1997 <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> according to <b>the</b> British Association of Toy Retailers' annual Christmas best-seller chart. In 1998, they were the second best-selling toy of 1998 in the United States according to toy trade publication [...] Playthings' annual industry survey.|$|R
5|$|All {{episodes of}} the first season were written by Sam Egan and Kindler; Kindler hired Egan to assist in writing the first season, as he {{believed}} Egan to be creative, passionate, and talented. Several episodes {{of the first}} season were written throughout <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> in 2007. After the series was given the green-light, they were rewritten to establish a season-long storyline. Some of the episodes finished their writing stage as little as {{two and a half}} weeks before filming commenced. At times after the scripts were written, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern fed back to the writers, asking for certain elements to be explained so the audience could understand.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five {{movements in}} a symmetrical arrangement of two framing duets surrounding recitatives and a central aria. Bach scored {{the work for}} two vocal soloists (soprano (S) and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of originally two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes that the scoring for just two voices and strings was probably intended to ease the workload of musicians who had a busy time during <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season.</b> In the later version, Bach added a trio of two oboes (Ob) and taille (Ot). The duration is given as 17 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Celebrating <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> {{had been}} growing in {{popularity}} through the Victorian era. Although the Christmas tree had been introduced in Britain during the 18th century, its use was popularised by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and their practice was copied in many homes across the country. In the early 19th century {{there had been a}} revival of interest in Christmas carols, following a decline in popularity over the previous hundred years. The publication of Davies Gilbert's 1823 work Some Ancient Christmas Carols, With the Tunes to Which They Were Formerly Sung in the West of England and William Sandys's 1833 collection Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern led to a growth in the form's popularity in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris {{during the holiday}} season {{following}} their adventures with Nights. Though they both enjoy <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season,</b> they feel as if something is missing. Realising that the Christmas Star that usually sits {{at the top of the}} Twin Seeds Christmas tree is absent, the pair travel to Nightopia to find it. There, they reunite with Nights and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been decorated due to their dreams of the holiday season. The remainder of the story revolves around their attempts of defeating a revived Gillwing and retrieving the Christmas Star from his lair.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} album, Carey {{embarked}} {{on her first}} headlining concert tour, the Music Box Tour. Due to stage fright, Carey had not toured to promote her previous albums and did not originally plan a tour to support Music Box. However, after the continued success of the album and persuasion from Tommy Mottola, Carey agreed. Because Carey did not feel physically or emotionally ready for an extensive tour, six concerts were scheduled, each with many days in between, {{in order to give}} her voice time to rest. An extra performance at Proctor's Theatre was planned; there, Carey filmed the one-hour special Here Is Mariah Carey for release during <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new project in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season.</b> Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, {{producing}} the Noddy in Toyland pantomime {{in just two}} or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2660-seat Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London at Christmas. Its popularity resulted in the show running during <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> {{for five or six}} years. Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre {{three or four times a}} week. TV adaptations of Noddy since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by Richard Briers. In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the King's Head Theatre embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with The Famous Five Musical, to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 The Secret Seven Save the World was first performed at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|In early 1935, {{however, the}} company {{heard about the}} game's {{excellent}} sales during <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>season</b> of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City. On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a patent on it, and purchased his remaining inventory. By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an affidavit by Darrow to repeat his statements to the contrary, and thus bolster their claim to the game. Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 patent and the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to claim that it had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.|$|E
