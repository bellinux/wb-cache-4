5|$|George F. Veenker {{compiled}} {{the highest}} overall and highest Big Ten winning percentages of any coach {{in school history}} during his three years as coach. He earned 1st(tied), 3rd and 2nd(tied) finishes during his three seasons, which included the 1928–29 conference championship. During Veenker's first season his team compiled a 13–3 overall (10–2, Big Ten) record to win <b>the</b> <b>conference,</b> <b>and</b> Veenker {{continues to be the}} only coach in school history to win a conference championship in his first season. The championship team, which finished tied with Wisconsin, was captained by the schools third All-American Ernie McCoy. Veenker resigned to become the Iowa State Cyclones football head coach.|$|E
5|$|In August 1878, Walker {{represented}} the United States {{at the third}} International Monetary Conference in Paris while also attending the 1878 Exposition. Not only were the attempts by the United States to re-establish an international silver standard defeated, but Walker also had to scramble to complete the report on the Exposition in only four days. Although {{he returned to the}} U.S. in October disheartened by the failure of <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> exhausted by his obligations at the Exposition, the trip had secured Walker a commanding national and international reputation.|$|E
5|$|In January 1943, Ismay {{accompanied}} Churchill to the Casablanca Conference.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the strong finish at Los Angeles, who led the Western Conference and overall standings at the time, United failed to win any matches {{during the month of}} June, {{amassing}} three subsequent draws and a loss. The loss would come the following week on 11 June, where they would lose at home against San Jose Earthquakes. Consequently, the loss, along with a Columbus victory, saw United fall to fourth in <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> 11th in the overall standings.|$|E
5|$|International {{selection}} attracted scouts from Football League clubs, and Gill {{was invited}} to Birmingham City {{to take part in}} trial matches. Halfway through the season, Roberts had brought striker Howard Forinton to Yeovil from Oxford City; his 23 goals in 21 games did much to secure the Isthmian League title and promotion to <b>the</b> <b>Conference,</b> <b>and</b> also caught the eye of Birmingham manager Trevor Francis. A deal was struck which saw Gill and Forinton join the First Division side in August 1997 for a combined fee of £100,000, with Gill valued at £30,000 plus an additional £10,000 payable when he played ten first-team matches.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} day, Bahraini {{authorities}} summoned the Lebanese ambassador in Bahrain {{to file a}} complaint against a conference held by Bahrain Rebellion Movement in Beirut. In the conference, opposition activists called for civil disobedience and mass protests, the BNA reported. A number of Bahraini opposition politicians and human rights activists have based their activities in Beirut where they enjoy more freedom. The BNA added that the Lebanese ambassador said his government was not supportive of <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> {{that they did not}} wish to interfere in Bahraini internal affairs. A day earlier, the salafist Al Asalah Islamic Society had criticized Lebanon for hosting the conference.|$|E

Just inside the perimeter fence of the complex stands a line of flagpoles where the flags of all 193 UN member states, plus the UN flag, are flown in English alphabetical order.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Henry and Richard finally dissolved into violence shortly before Henry's death. Philip held {{a peace conference}} in November 1188, making a public offer of a generous long-term peace settlement with Henry, conceding to his various territorial demands, if Henry would finally marry Richard and Alice and announce Richard as his recognised heir. Henry refused the proposal, whereupon Richard himself spoke up, demanding to be recognised as Henry's successor. Henry remained silent and Richard then publicly changed sides at <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> gave formal homage to Philip {{in front of the}} assembled nobles.|$|E

5|$|Tulsa's offense focused heavily {{upon the}} running game; they {{finished}} ninth {{in the country}} in rushing yards (3440) and sixth {{in the country in}} rushing touchdowns (41). Tulsa had three running backs who achieved over 700 yards rushing: junior Trey Watts (959), junior Ja'Terian Douglas (857), and senior Alex Singleton (765). Singleton also led the team and <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> ranked sixth nationally with 21 rushing touchdowns. In the passing game, junior quarterback Cody Green totaled 2592 passing yards and 17 touchdowns, both of which {{were in the middle of}} the pack nationally. Green's leading receiver was sophomore Keyarris Garrett, who amassed 67 receptions for 845 yards and 9 touchdowns, all of which led the team.|$|E
5|$|Although the Potsdam Conference {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} with European affairs, {{the war against}} Japan was also discussed in detail. Truman learned of the successful Trinity test early in <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> shared this information with the British delegation. The successful test caused the American delegation to reconsider the necessity and wisdom of Soviet participation, for which the U.S. had lobbied hard at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. High on the United States' list of priorities was shortening the war and reducing American casualties—Soviet intervention seemed likely to do both, but {{at the cost of}} possibly allowing the Soviets to capture territory beyond that which had been promised to them at Tehran and Yalta, and causing a postwar division of Japan similar to that which had occurred in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Bill Perigo {{took over}} the Michigan {{coaching}} job after having served three seasons as Western Michigan basketball coach. Despite previous success as a conference basketball champion coach at Western and subsequent success as a Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) champion basketball coach, his Michigan teams endured several mediocre seasons. His best Big Ten records came in 1956–57 and 1958–59 when his teams compiled 8–6 conference records. The latter team was tied for second in <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> was 15–7 overall (8–6, Big Ten). It also had Perigo's only first-team All-Big Ten athlete in M. C. Burton. Team captain and two-time football consensus All-American Ron Kramer was third-team All-Big Ten in 1957 after being second-team All-Big Ten in both 1955 and 1956.|$|E

5|$|Having {{played for}} three {{counties}} as a child, Stansfield {{began his career}} in non-league with Cullompton Rangers and Elmore, and had unsuccessful trials at league teams. At the age of 23, he signed his first professional contract with Yeovil Town, after impressing their manager Gary Johnson in a match against them. In his first season, he helped them win the FA Trophy, scoring in the 2002 final. The following season, Yeovil won <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>and</b> promotion into The Football League, although Stansfield was ruled out with a broken leg in the first game. In 2004, he transferred to Hereford United, where he won promotion to The Football League via the 2006 play-offs, and repeated the feat with Exeter City a year later. He also helped Exeter earn promotion into League One in 2008. At international level, Stansfield played five matches and scored one goal for England's national semi-professional team, winning the 2005 Four Nations Tournament.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Hokies {{have had}} limited success. From 1892 to 1921, Tech competed as a {{football}} independent. The Hokies won several games against larger, better-funded teams during this time, but did not compete in many games outside the American South. From 1921 to 1964, Tech {{was a member of}} the Southern Conference and won the conference championship in 1963. The membership of the Southern Conference fluctuated wildly at times during Tech's tenure. When the conference was created in 1921, it boasted 23 teams. This number was reduced when the Southeastern Conference and Atlantic Coast Conference split away in 1932 and 1953, respectively. By the time Tech won the conference championship in 1963, the conference's membership had shrunk to less than 10 teams. Tech administrators, wanting to expand the football program, chose to leave <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>and</b> become a football independent once more.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 off-season, Lemaire {{once again}} retired and was {{replaced}} by former Florida Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer. DeBoer's new system helped develop a strong offense, which had seven 40-point scorers by the season's end and broke an NHL record for the best regular season penalty kill since before the Expansion Era. Four players – Kovalchuk, Elias, David Clarkson and newly named captain Zach Parise – scored 30 or more goals, with Kovalchuk and Elias also finishing the season among the NHL's top ten-point scorers. Rookie forward Adam Henrique totaled 51 points and earned a Calder Trophy nomination for rookie of the year. As the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Devils defeated Southeast champions Florida before overcoming both divisional rivals, the Flyers and Rangers, to win <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>and</b> return to the Finals after nine years. Facing the Los Angeles Kings in the Finals, the Devils lost the first three games, but won the next two while facing elimination. In Game 6, the Kings defeated the Devils and captured the series.|$|E

50|$|Previously {{known as}} <b>the</b> Clarence Campbell <b>Conference</b> (or Campbell Conference), {{it was created}} in 1974 when the NHL realigned its teams into two <b>conferences</b> <b>and</b> four {{divisions}}. Because <b>the</b> new <b>conferences</b> <b>and</b> divisions {{had little to do}} with North American geography, geographical references were removed. <b>The</b> <b>conferences</b> <b>and</b> divisions were re-aligned in 1981 to better reflect the geographical locations of the teams, but the existing names were retained with <b>the</b> Campbell <b>Conference</b> becoming <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> for <b>the</b> NHL's westernmost teams. <b>The</b> names of <b>conferences</b> <b>and</b> divisions were changed in 1993 to reflect their geographic locations. Then-new NHL commissioner Gary Bettman made the change to help non-hockey fans better understand the game, as the National Basketball Association, National Football League, and Major League Baseball all use geographic-based names for their <b>conferences</b> <b>and</b> divisions. However, <b>the</b> trophy awarded to <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> champion, <b>the</b> Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, retains some connection to the heritage of the league. In 2005, following the lockout, the league changed <b>the</b> Western <b>Conference</b> logo (along with <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Conference</b> <b>and</b> NHL logos) to its current form.|$|R
