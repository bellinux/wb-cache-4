5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new style {{to be much more}} open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique with a lot of character.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games were meant {{to have some of}} their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters. However, designers focused in adjusting the imbalance of certain characters without removing any move. In the end, creators of the series noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Art</b> of Fighting characters were the strongest ones in the game. Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were given new moves.|$|E

Characters such as Benimaru Nikaido and Chang Koehan were added to have an off-beat variety to the cast, which he has previously deemed to be too serious. SNK artist C.A.C Yamasaki commented that although the lead programmer thought the game would not sell well, he believed it would eventually become popular. Ten people arrived at the first location test, but larger numbers came to subsequent tests.

5000|$|The most {{hotly debated}} issue in {{evolutionary}} literary study concerns the adaptive functions {{of literature and}} other arts—whether there are any adaptive functions, and if so, what they might be. Proposed functions include transmitting information, including about kin relations, and by providing the audience with a model and rehearsal for how to behave in similar situations that may arise in the future. Steven Pinker (How the Mind Works, 1997) suggests that aesthetic responsiveness is merely {{a side effect of}} cognitive powers that evolved to fulfill more practical functions, but Pinker also suggests that narratives can provide information for adaptively relevant problems. Geoffrey Miller (The Mating Mind, 2000) argues that artistic productions in the ancestral environment served as forms of sexual display in order to demonstrate fitness and attract mates, similarly to the function of the peacock's tail. Brian Boyd (On the Origin of Stories, 2009) argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> are forms of cognitive [...] "play" [...] that enhance pattern recognition. In company with Ellen Dissanayake (Art and Intimacy, 2000), Boyd also argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> provide means of creating shared social identity and help create and maintain human bonding. Dissanayake, Joseph Carroll (Literary Darwinism 2004), and Denis Dutton (<b>The</b> <b>Art</b> Instinct, 2009) all argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> help organize <b>the</b> human mind by giving emotionally and aesthetically modulated models of reality. By participating in the simulated life of other people one gains a greater understanding of the motivations of oneself and other people. <b>The</b> idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> function as means of psychological organization subsumes <b>the</b> ideas <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> provide adaptively relevant information, enable us to consider alternative behavioral scenarios, enhance pattern recognition, and serve as means for creating shared social identity. And of course, <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> can be used for sexual display. In <b>that</b> respect, <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> are like most other human products—clothing, jewelry, shelter, means of transportation, etc. <b>The</b> hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> help organize <b>the</b> mind is not incompatible with the hypothesis of sexual display, but it subordinates sexual display to a more primary adaptive function.|$|R

5|$|The art was {{developed}} by Paul Drummond, Kevin Preston, Maria Drummond, Jeff Wall, and Karen Pinchin. This team were based at a studio in Manchester, rather than Birmingham, the central studio. Their work included character animations, developed in Autodesk Animator using its language POCO, which the graphics tools were built in. The artwork (including the sprites) was made as a selection of clips, and a final image was formed by pasting them together. The ability to use clips in multiple locations, and the colour information being stored separately and used on an as--needed basis meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> took much less space than was usual. The background artwork was sketched in black and white, and then scanned into a computer and colourised. The music is credited to Media Sorcery.|$|E

25|$|According to Walsh, Bradshaw art was {{associated}} with a period he called the Erudite Epoch, a time before Aboriginal people populated Australia. He suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> may be the product of an ethnic group who had likely arrived in Australia from Indonesia, only to be displaced by the ancestors of present-day Aboriginal people. Walsh based this interpretation on the sophistication of Bradshaw art when compared to other art in the Kimberley region, such as the much later Wandjina styles.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} ‘the arts’ in {{community}} development is increasingly being recognized. This paper contributes to emerging insights {{on the various}} impacts of <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> on communities by highlighting when {{and how they can}} have binding and dividing effects on a community. We draw on a participatory research project conducted in Pingjum, a village in <b>the</b> Netherlands <b>that</b> hosts many cultural activities and in which many artists live. We discuss how <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> in Pingjum influence the community in the village. In our discussion, we pay attention to the sense of community <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> generate, <b>the</b> meeting opportunities they provide and how the community is engaged by some artists. Our study shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> influence of <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> is context-dependent, with <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> having both binding and dividing effects on the community in Pingjum. In terms of the value of <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> for community development, we emphasize three key issues: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> (i) do not have only advantages for a community; (ii) do not engage the entire community; and (iii) could potentially contribute to community fragmentation. Given these issues, we argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> should be considered as one of several supportive means in community development processes. Ideally, they are integrated into a wider community development strategy and planning, and exist alongside other associations and activities in a community. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> can contribute to the robustness of a community and assist it in developing the capacity and resources to flourish...|$|R
50|$|From the 1930s, Seldes was {{wary of the}} {{transformation}} of popular culture to mass culture, which television and radio facilitated. He was concerned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> popular <b>arts</b> had lost their dynamism as 'passive observation' had, by then, replaced 'active participation' in <b>the</b> <b>arts.</b> Furthermore, he worried that American tastes were becoming uniform and undiscriminating. This concern increased in the 1950s, as he saw <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> were monopolized, homogenized, and of poor standard. In the second edition of <b>The</b> Seven Lively <b>Arts</b> (1957), he wrote, 'we are being engulfed in a mass-produced mediocrity'.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of Devnimori in Gujarat, dated to the 4th century CE, represented a Western Indian artistic tradition, based {{on the influence of}} the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, that was anterior to the rise of Gupta Empire art, and that it may have influenced it, and have influenced the art of the Ajanta Caves, Sarnath and other places from the 5th century onward. Devnimori may also have received some influence from Mathura art. At Ajanta, some connections with the art of Gandhara can be noted, and there is evidence of a shared artistic idiom.|$|E
25|$|Sasanian carvings at Taq-e Bostan and Naqsh-e Rustam were colored; so {{were many}} {{features}} of the palaces; but only traces of such painting remain.

25|$|Since {{the first}} {{operation}} of the oracle of Delphi Temple, {{it was believed that}} the god lived within a laurel (his holy plant) and gave oracles for the future with the rustling of the leaves. It was also said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of divination had been taught to the god by the three winged sisters of Parnassus, the Thriae, at the time when Apollo was grazing his cattle there. The Thriae used to have a Kliromanteion (oracle by lot) in that area in the past and it is possible that such was the first oracle of Delphi, i.e. using the lot (throwing lots in a container and pulling a lot, the color and shape of which were of particular importance).|$|E
40|$|I {{conducted}} a practitioner research study at a Jewish {{high school in}} Toronto {{in order to understand}} how teaching and learning through arts can help facilitate more meaningful understandings of and connections to the Bible. I wanted to better understand why students’ best recollections of learned material {{at the end of the}} year were arts-based projects, especially given the existing research in arts-based Jewish education, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> are not emphasized in high school curricula. Students worked in groups of two or three and created arts-based interpretations of Numbers Chapter 12, and wrote explanatory paragraphs of their work. Following the completion of their projects, I interviewed students. In the interviews, students explained what they created, what motivated their work, and what they thought about learning through <b>the</b> <b>arts.</b> Drawing upon <b>the</b> projects and the interviews, three distinct themes emerged about what <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> offered students <b>that</b> conventional forms of teaching and assignments did not. <b>The</b> first theme <b>that</b> emerged was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> offered students <b>the</b> opportunity to take on the persona of a biblical commentator, and through this opportunity, students formed their own opinions and insights into the text, which resulted in the text becoming more meaningful. <b>The</b> second theme <b>that</b> emerged was <b>that</b> through <b>the</b> creative process students formed personal associations and connections with the narrative and its characters. As a result of these associations, students began to see the text as directly relevant to their lives, and therefore the text itself became more valuable to them. <b>The</b> third theme <b>that</b> emerged was that students felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> offered them valuable educational experiences, including the opportunity to express creativity and to experience genuine collaboration. Considering the three themes as a collective grouping, it is evident <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> offer students specific and tangible benefits in relation to textual knowledge, meaning-making, personal connections to text, and abilities to think critically and passionately about text. <b>The</b> study demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>arts</b> offer teachers a powerful tool to help students develop their love of Jewish texts and deepen their relationship with their Jewishness...|$|R
