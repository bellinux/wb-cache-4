50|$|The {{civil parish}} extends northwards to {{just north of}} the A15-B1177 junction, {{skirting}} the southern edge of Dunsby Hall Farm. The parish boundary extends due east, along the Hacconby Lode drain over Hacconby Fen, following Hacconby Drove to the south. To the north is the parish of Dunsby and Dunsby Fen. It reaches the South Forty-Foot Drain. The parish boundary (also with Pinchbeck and South Holland follows this drain for just under a mile south. It then follows Lane Dike due west which crosses the Car Dyke just north of Cardyke Farm. The parish boundary crosses the A15 next to a transmitter and extends westwards to reach the north of Spring Wood, where it meets the large parish of Edenham. Just south of <b>Thorny</b> <b>Wood</b> it meets the parish of Dunsby. The parish boundary follows the southern edge of Dunsby Wood, crossing the Stainfield-Kirkby Underwood road just north of Stainfield Spa.|$|E
50|$|The black {{rhinoceros}} is a herbivorous browser that eats leafy plants, branches, shoots, <b>thorny</b> <b>wood</b> bushes, and fruit. The optimum habitat {{seems to be}} one consisting of thick scrub and bushland, often with some woodland, which supports the highest densities. Their diet can reduce the amount of woody plants, which may benefit grazers (who focus on leaves and stems of grass), but not competing browsers (who focus on leaves, stems of trees, shrubs or herbs). It has been known to eat up to 220 species of plants. They have a significantly restricted diet with a preference for a few key plant species and a tendency to select leafy species in the dry season. The plant species they seem to be most attracted to when not in dry season are the woody plants. There are 18 species of woody plants known to the diet of the {{black rhinoceros}}, and 11 species that could possibly be a part of their diet too. Black rhinoceros also have a tendency to choose food based on quality over quantity, where researchers find more populations in areas where the food has better quality. In accordance with their feeding habit, adaptations of the chewing apparatus have been described for rhinos. D. Bicornis has a twophased chewing activity with a cutting ectoloph and more grinding lophs on the lingual side. The black rhinoceros can also be considered a more challenging herbivore to feed in captivity compared to its grazing relatives. It can live up to 5 days without water during drought. Black rhinos live in several habitats including bushlands, Riverine woodland, marshes, and their least favorable, grasslands. Habitat preferences are shown in two ways, the amount of sign found in the different habitats, and the habitat content of home ranges and core areas. Habitat types are also identified based on the composition of dominant plant types in each area. Different subspecies live in different bushlands including, Acacia bushlands, Euclea bushlands, mixed bushlands, and dense euclea bushland.They browse for food in the morning and evening. They are selective browsers but, studies done in Kenya show that they do add the selection material with availability in order to satisfy their nutritional requirements. In the hottest part of the day they are most inactive- resting, sleeping, and wallowing in mud. Wallowing helps cool down body temperature during the day and protects against parasites. When black rhinos browse they use their lips to strip the branches of their leaves. Competition with elephants is causing the black rhinoceros to shift its diet. The black rhinoceros alters its selectivity with the absence of the elephant.|$|E
50|$|Claudius Ptolemy {{located the}} Sicambri, {{together}} with the Bructeri Minores, at the most {{northern part of the}} Rhine and south of the Frisii who inhabit the coast north of the river. Strabo located the Sicambri next to the Menapii, â€œwho dwell {{on both sides of the}} river Rhine near its mouth, in marshes and low <b>thorny</b> <b>woods.</b> It is opposite to these Menapii that the Sicambri are situated". Strabo describes them as Germanic, and that beyond them are the Suevi and other peoples.|$|R
50|$|The floral {{vegetation}} in {{the wildlife}} of Haiti consists of Hispaniolan moist forests (about 200 km2 only of undisturbed rainforest), Hispaniolan dry forests, Hispaniolan pine forests (in {{parts of the}} two national parks), Enriquillo wetlands (remnants of an old marine channel), and Greater Antilles mangroves which cover an area of only 134 km2. Giant tree ferns, orchids, bayahondes (a variety of mesquite) on the hill slopes, cacti, acacias, and <b>thorny</b> <b>woods</b> on the dry plains, and mangrove forests on the coast line.|$|R
