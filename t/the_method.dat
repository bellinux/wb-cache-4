The paper reviews {{the state of}} <b>the</b> art of <b>methods</b> for tracking and capturing <b>the</b> interface. These <b>methods</b> are categorized as the implicit and <b>the</b> explicit <b>methods.</b> <b>The</b> implicit <b>methods</b> need to reconstruct the interface by reconnecting the markers on the interface. The implicit techniques implicitly describe the interface as a simple function. Thus, complicated topological changes of interface can be handled naturally and automatically. <b>The</b> implicit <b>methods</b> reviewed in this paper are <b>the</b> volume-of-fluid <b>method,</b> <b>the</b> phase-field <b>method,</b> <b>the</b> Lattice-Boltzmann <b>method</b> and <b>the</b> level-set <b>method.</b> <b>The</b> explicit <b>methods</b> mainly include <b>the</b> boundary-integral <b>methods</b> and <b>the</b> tracking <b>methods...</b>|$|R

Operational modal analysis aims to find the modal properties; natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes of a structure while it is under operating conditions using its vibration data. Several methods of operational modal analysis are developed and they can broadly be divided into time-domain and frequency-domain. Theory of operational modal analysis and <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> chosen are presented in this thesis. The main objective of this thesis was to develop MATLAB functions which implements several of these <b>methods.</b> <b>The</b> <b>methods</b> are performed on two case studies. A shear frame with low and high damping where the exact modal parameters are known, this is done to check that <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> work properly and to see how damping influences the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>methods.</b> Then <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> are used on the Hardanger Bridge, a bridge in operating conditions.
