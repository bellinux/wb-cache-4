Theoretically, it is to be over it; the true limit falling all the way along <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> thick line. The contest of Apelles with Protogenes consisted in striking this true limit within each other's lines, more and more finely.

After you complete the entire student study, you will discuss the results with the parents or guardians. In addition, you will use the information you learned to assist/share with your colleagues. You will also reflect on this process and discuss it online via dialoguing on our class website. Use the following headings to construct the student study. Introduction (IRA 3. 3) Use surveys and telephone conversations to gather information about the student. Several surveys can be found in <b>the</b> Literacy <b>Center</b> Companion.

40|$|Abstractin {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a modified segmentation method applied to image. An EM algorithm is developed to estimate {{parameters of the}} Gaussian mixtures. Recently, researchers are focusing more {{on the study of}} expectation of maximization (EM) due to its useful applications in a number of areas, such as multimedia, image processing, pattern recognition and bioinformatics. The human visual system can often correctly interpret images that are of quality that they contain insufficient explicit information to do so. The difficulty is mainly due to variable brain structures, various MRI artifacts and restrictive body scanning methods. The IBSR image segmentation data set is used to compare and evaluate the proposed methods. In this paper, we propose a modified expectation of maximization (MEM) based on the properties of likelihood, while reducing number of iteration for a sick of fast converge to <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> cluster and <b>your</b> application to image segmentation. The experiments on real images show that: (1) our proposed approach can reduce the number of iterations, which leads to a significant reduction in the computational cost while attaining similar levels of accuracy. (2) The approach also works well when applied to image segmentation. A methodology for calculate is presented for making use the error between the ground truth, human-segmented image data sets to compare, develop and optimize image segmentation algorithms. This error measure is based on object-by-object comparisons of a segmented image and a ground-truth (reference) image. Experimental results for segmented images demonstrate the good segmentation performance of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Most of the presbyopic patents (over 40 years) people {{purchase}} {{their glasses}} {{over the counter}} readers which are not made by prescription and custom made parameters: sphere power for each eye, cylinder, axis and monocular PD (distance between pupils). They are sold at just about every market, retail chain and boutiques. The cheap price and uninformed patient are the main reasons why {{most of the people}} purchase these non-prescribed glasses, mass-produced and poor quality and one size fits all. In the other side prescription glasses are designed specifically for you, <b>the</b> optical <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> each lens (where the lens will optically perform the best) are aligned with <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>your</b> eyes' pupils and could cover all refractive corrections. This work has been done {{as a part of a}} wider survey of OTC glasses in Republic of Macedonia. Following the previous results based on the small number of samples, additionally 50 pairs (100 lenses) of OTC glasses were investigated. They were controlled for two parameters: prescribed lens power which is for mostly non-symmetric for both eyes with the power of wearing OTC glasses; as well for PD of patients and optical centre of each lens. For 59 lenses of the total 100, the differences between prescribed and wearing power were obtained; ranged from 0. 250 to 3. 00 D. <b>The</b> optical <b>center</b> <b>of</b> a lens was shifted away from its expected position (front of the eye) in 90 cases resulted decentration from 1. 0 to 6. 5 mm. Consequently, induced prismatic effect was in range 0. 20 - 1. 80 Δ: with an average value of 0. 64 Δ. Furthermore, obtained results were compared with ANSI Z- 90 Standardization Tolerance Chart. In 59 cases, difference in lens power exceed limit of 0. 125 D and given limit of 0. 33 Δ prismatic effect was not satisfied for 66 lenses. Taking into account both criteria only 11 lenses were safe for using according to investigated parameters and only 3 pairs were pass tolerance standardization. It should be note that even they cannot damage eyes they will impaired the vision and made less productivity and safety in working with them. Vision is something that we should all take seriously, so never risk making eye problems worse by postponing a prescription. The results of this research indicate a necessity for standardizations as well regulations for ophthalmic lenses. Although prescription lenses are more expensive, if they are needed to correct a vision problem, it's advised to wear the prescription, rather than purchase non-prescription OTC glasses. ...|$|R

50|$|Intact {{stability}} calculations {{are relatively}} straightforward and involve taking all <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> mass of objects on the vessel {{which are then}} computed/calculated to identify <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel, and <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> buoyancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull. Cargo arrangements and loadings, crane operations, and the design sea states are usually taken into account. The photo at right illustrates a common misconception about vessels. In fact, {{in the vast majority}} <b>of</b> vessels, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity is well above <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> buoyancy. <b>The</b> ship is stable because as it begins to heel, one side of the hull begins to rise from the water and the other side begins to submerge. This causes <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> buoyancy to shift toward the side that is lower in the water. The job of the naval architect {{is to make sure that}} <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> buoyancy shifts outboard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> gravity as <b>the</b> ship heels. A line drawn from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> buoyancy in a slightly heeled condition vertically will intersect the centerline at a point called the metacenter.
