5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals have only one {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory <b>tie</b> <b>that</b> lasts for several minutes, as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and {{the timing of the}} births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E
5|$|The Challenge Cup is a {{knock-out}} tournament. Within a regionalised format, {{clubs are}} paired at random {{and the first}} club drawn listed as the home team. The winner of each match progresses to the next round and the loser is eliminated from the tournament. Every match, including the final, is a one-legged <b>tie</b> <b>that</b> lasts 90 minutes plus any additional stoppage time. If no clear winner has been determined after 90 minutes of normal time, 30 minutes of extra time is played. If the score is still level after extra time then the winner is decided by a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{competitions}} around the world, the Recopa Sudamericana {{do not use}} extra time, an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw, or away goals, a method of breaking ties in football and other sports when teams play each other twice, once at each team's home ground, to decide a <b>tie</b> <b>that</b> was level on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|The {{emergence}} of countryman Stanislas Wawrinka as a Grand Slam singles champion in 2014 renewed hope for Federer in his Davis Cup quest, and the pair both committed to playing each <b>tie</b> <b>that</b> year. Their commitment would pay off as wins over Serbia, Kazakhstan and Italy allowed the Swiss team {{to advance to}} the 2014 Davis Cup Final. Leading into the final, Federer was suffering from a back injury that threw serious doubt over Switzerland's chance to claim the title, and a second rubber straight sets loss to Gaël Monfils seemingly spelled the worst for Switzerland. However, a rejuvenated Federer returned the next day to help claim the doubles rubber, which set up a fourth rubber singles tie between Federer and Richard Gasquet. Federer defeated Gasquet in straight sets and in doing so handed Switzerland its first (and only to date) Davis Cup title.|$|E
5|$|Beardsley {{signed for}} League One club Preston North End on a free {{transfer}} on 12 August 2012, linking up again with manager Graham Westley. He {{had spent the}} pre-season ahead of 2012–13 training with the club, although the transfer had been held up while the club waited for confirmation from the Football League in accordance with new financial fair play rules. Beardsley made his Preston debut in a 2–0 home win over Huddersfield Town in the League Cup on 14 August 2012, assisting the club's second goal of the match, with his low cross being scored by Nicky Wroe. He scored his first goal for Preston on 4 September 2012 after converting David Amoo's cross in the third-minute of their 1–1 away draw with Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, a <b>tie</b> <b>that</b> Preston won 3–1 on penalties. Beardsley scored one further goal that month, heading in Jeffrey Monakana's cross on 64 minutes as Preston came from behind to beat Yeovil Town 3–2 at home. It proved to be Beardsley's last goal for five months, ending his goal drought in a 3–1 away loss to Yeovil on 12 February 2013, in what was Westley's last match {{in charge of the}} club. Beardsley made just two appearances under new manager Simon Grayson over the remainder of 2012–13, both all as a second-half substitute. Shortly after the season ended, he was told he could leave Preston if a suitable offer was received. He made 22 appearances during 2012–13, scoring 3 times, as Preston ranked in 14th-place in League One.|$|E

30|$|This section {{describes}} the methodology used to quantify edges, either exactly or as a lower bound, and then rank them, either exactly or approximately, by their importance {{as measured by}} gravity. The gravity labels are then used to isolate an edge set that we have nicknamed <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> bind. We also discuss how isolating the <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> bind helps to distinguish bridges of lesser importance, which we have nicknamed bridges to nowhere. We show that the algorithm produces its results very efficiently.|$|R

25|$|In {{case of a}} <b>tie</b> (<b>that</b> is, {{both teams}} scoring {{the same number of}} runs {{at the end of their}} {{respective}} innings), a Super Over would decide the winner.

This is applicable in all stages of the tournament, having been implemented during the 2009 tournament. During the 2007 tournament, a bowl-out was used to decide the loser of tied matches.|$|E

25|$|Externally focused theories, in contrast, {{suggest that}} reunion {{is a way}} for adoptees to {{overcome}} social stigma. First proposed by Goffman, the theory has four parts: 1) adoptees perceive the absence of biological ties as distinguishing their adoptive family from others, 2) this understanding is strengthened by experiences where non-adoptees suggest adoptive ties are weaker than blood ties, 3) together, these factors engender, in some adoptees, a sense of social exclusion, and 4) these adoptees react by searching for a blood <b>tie</b> <b>that</b> reinforces their membership in the community. The externally focused rationale for reunion suggests adoptees may be well adjusted and happy within their adoptive families, but will search as an attempt to resolve experiences of social stigma.|$|E
25|$|Despite an {{outstanding}} season, Paige {{had a strong}} competitor for best Negro league pitcher of 1934, the 21-year-old Slim Jones of the Philadelphia Stars, who went 22–3 in league games. In September, a four-team charity benefit doubleheader was played at Yankee Stadium, with the second game featuring a faceoff between Paige and Jones. Paige recalled driving all night from Pittsburgh and parking near the stadium, then falling asleep in the car. A batboy found and woke him, and he got into uniform {{just in time for}} his scheduled start. In a game that was sometimes described as the greatest game in Negro league history, Paige and Jones battled to a 1–1 <b>tie</b> <b>that</b> was called because of darkness. A rematch was scheduled, and this time Paige and the Crawfords beat Jones and the Stars 3–1.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of the US report was accompanied by two speeches, one from Smith and one from Senator Isidor Rayner (Democrat, Maryland).

These are choice pictures in the treasure house of the affections, but even these will sometime fade; the sea is the place permanently to honor our dead; this should be the occasion for a new birth of vigilance, and future generations must accord to this event a crowning motive for better things.|$|E

As such, these examples do not contain any bridges to nowhere, which can be easily verified by visual inspection of Figs.  9, 10, 11, and 12. Indeed, while the top-ranked <b>ties</b> <b>that</b> bind separate themselves significantly from the other edges, no edges stand out {{at the bottom of}} the ranking as being included in significantly fewer paths. Instead, the decline in path inclusion among the edges in these examples is gradual, except for the decline following the top-ranked edges (<b>ties</b> <b>that</b> bind).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{complexity}} of human social structures often masks the simplicity {{involved in their}} development. Social networks are a product of dynamic processes and feedback.
