Despite <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of two eminent medical practitioners, Dr Keith Fairley and Dr Reginald Webster, John succumbed to {{toxaemia}} and died in 1933, at the age of 10. The failure of modern medicine to save his son affected Downes deeply, and led him to abandon his medical career in favour of a military one.|$|E
5|$|Newton Heath LYR Football Club {{was also}} founded as a cricket club, and the North Road ground {{was used by}} both {{branches}} of the club. However, the cricket and football seasons often overlapped, causing conflicts between the two sports. The ground was barely adequate for football, despite <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of groundsmen Charlie and Ned Massey, but its use in the winter made it even less suitable for cricket in the summer.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark to light. In theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E

5|$|After the Spartans' first {{successful}} operation, John-117 is {{briefed on the}} threat posed by the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship. In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumns crew.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of {{his father}} to secure a {{favorable}} venue, judge, and defense team, on January 31, 1825, the jury convicted Isaac Desha of murder and sentenced him to hang. Rowan immediately requested a new trial upon grounds of jury interference, and Shannon granted the request on February 10. Jury selection proved problematic, occupying at least parts of four terms of the Harrison County Circuit Court. In September 1825, a jury was finally empaneled. The judge, Harry O. Brown, had been temporarily appointed to his position by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. Desha was again found guilty, and sentenced to hang on July 14, 1826. Judge Brown overturned the verdict because the prosecution had not proven that the murder took place in Fleming County, as alleged in the indictment against Desha. The state argued that this was of no consequence, since a change of venue had already been granted, but the judge's ruling stood, and Governor Desha's reputation took a further hit.|$|E

It turns out that they are bandits who first attempt to rape her and then have her killed by infected dogs, only for her to unleash them unto her captors. On her travels, she finds a dead man's diary which states that there is an uninfected area in Alaska.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>the</b> problem of <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic {{delivery}} in 802. 11 e contention-based networks. Differently from most previous paper which {{focus on the}} support of quality of service (QoS) requirements, we study the tuning of the access parameters for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic. <b>The</b> contribution {{of this paper is}} threefold. First, we discuss the coexistence between legacy DCF and EDCA stations, since, for guaranteeing the backward compatibility, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service class defined in EDCA should correspond to the legacy DCF. We show what configurations of the access parameters are closer to the DCF protocol, by taking into account the slightly different backoff rules defined in EDCA. Second, we explore the optimizations that can be performed by dynamically tuning the access parameters, on a per-beacon basis, in the case of homogeneous <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> sources. We propose an effective algorithm able to maximize the system throughput, by adapting the minimum contention window to the network contention level. Finally, we analyze the amount of resources available for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic in presence of QoS traffic. We show that the dynamic adaptation of the minimum contention window {{as a function of the}} channel wasted times can be a valid solution to automatically regulate <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> offered load in the network...|$|R

5|$|The Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel {{was known}} as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the {{waterway}} that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines {{in the path of the}} tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube, and four in boring the second.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy {{casualties}} {{during the}} initial attack, the Germans were able to land reinforcements and {{the situation on the}} island quickly deteriorated for the Allies. The brigade had abandoned its initial positions and moved to a new location to the west of Galatas to eliminate the threat that it would become separated from the 5th Infantry Brigade. On 25 May, the 18th Battalion had to deal with a full-scale attack by Fallschirmjäger. This caused heavy casualties and a large portion of one of the battalion's companies was captured. Despite reinforcements arriving from the 20th Battalion and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of Gray in rounding up stragglers, the Galatas position was breached and the township captured. Some battalion personnel, led by Gray, along with the bulk of the 23rd Battalion, participated in an attack that briefly re-took the township but it later had to be abandoned again after further fighting. The battalion was then withdrawn to the east as the order to evacuate Crete was received, making its way towards Suda Bay, where Allied ships were taking troops off the beaches. Along the way, they were subjected to heavy air raids, one of which killed a company commander, Captain Jack Lyon, the Member of Parliament for the Waitemata electorate.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E
