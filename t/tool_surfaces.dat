40|$|Sheet-bulk {{metal forming}} is an {{innovative}} process {{with a high}} potential to generate load-adapted parts with high precision. Bulk forming processes of sheet metals especially require high process forces, resulting in an intense contact pressure and, thus, in a very high abrasive and adhesive wear.

40|$|AbstractIn {{terms of}} {{increasing}} lightweight designs of car body parts, the machining of high strength steels in hot stamping processes becomes of particular interest. Due to high process forces at hot stamping, {{the surface of}} such tools {{in the area of}} maximal stress is subject wear, which necessitate some local increase of microhardness to enhance the mechanical performance. Especially laser beam alloying using filler wire and beam oscillation is some suitable method to modify the mechanical properties of <b>tool</b> <b>surfaces</b> to emcompass some continuous martensitic structure, featuring a certain microhardness. Nevertheless the thermal energy input during laser beam alloying induces tempering in the heat affected zone and reduces the hardness. This paper discusses the influence of alloying strategies on the thermal energy input and the resulting metallurgical structure of modified <b>tool</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Also the cooling behavior of alloyed lines for different energy inputs per unit length is of interest. Therefore, the metallurgical microstructure is analyzed regarding microhardness as well as formation of carbides.

These investigations permit the control of the spatiotemporal energy input to avoid tempering of the microstructure...|$|E

Surface soil moved in either of two modes: V-flow (upward and laterally {{in the shape of}} one leg of the letter V) or snowplow (initially moving upward and subsequently being buried in a wave of soil). Surface soil velocities were uncorrelated with velocities on the <b>tool</b> <b>surface,</b> indicating that soil flow paths over the sweep were not parallel. The ratio of vertical to lateral soil flow at the <b>tool</b> <b>surface</b> increased with larger rake angle and was greater than the ratio at the soil surface.

Thin ceramic PVD (physical vapor deposition) coatings applied on <b>tool</b> <b>surfaces</b> successfully reduce these effects. However, their performance is still not recognised for surfaces with various topographies. In this investigation, soldering tendency of Al-Si-Cu alloy toward EN X 27 CrMoV 51 steel, plasma nitrided steel, CrN and TiAlN duplex PVD coatings is evaluated using ejection test. The coatings were prepared {{to a range of}} surface roughness and topographies. After the tests sample surfaces were analysed by different microscopy techniques and profilometry. It was found that the ejection performance is independent of the chemical composition of investigated materials. After the ejection, the cast alloy soldering layer was found on surfaces of all tested materials. This built-up layer formed by effects of mechanical soldering, without corrosion reactions. Coated samples displayed a pronounced dependence of ejection force on surface roughness and topography. By decreasing roughness, ejection force increased, which is a consequence of intensified adhesion effects.

In the present investigation, experiments were conducted using a pin-on-plate inclined sliding tester to study the effect of the surface {{texture of the}} tool on the coefficient of friction and the transfer layer formation in tin–steel tribo-system. 080 M 40 steel plates were ground to attain surfaces of different texture with varying roughness. Pins made of pure tin were then slid against the prepared steel plates. Scanning electron micrographs of the contact surfaces of pins and plates were used to reveal the morphology of transfer layer. It was observed that the coefficient of friction, formation of transfer layer, and the presence of stick–slip motion depend primarily on the surface texture of <b>tool</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and independent of surface roughness (Ra) of <b>tool</b> <b>surfaces.</b> However, it is seen that a single surface roughness parameter, namely, average slope of the profile, ‘Del a’, of the tool surface plays an important role in determining the frictional behavior of the surfaces studied.

40|$|An {{important}} mechanism {{reducing the}} lifetime of the deepdrawing tools is material transfer from the workpiece to the tool, resulting in the buildup of lumps on the <b>tool</b> <b>surface.</b> In this study, a lump growth model, based on transfer mechanisms observed in experiments, is developed. The development of the summit height distribution of the <b>tool</b> <b>surface</b> is calculated from the growth behavior of the individual lumps. Important parameters influencing material transfer are determined from the calculated summit height distributions. It follows that lump growth can be decreased and, under certain conditions prevented, by a higher (surface) hardness of the workpiece, a lower roughness of the <b>tool</b> <b>surface,</b> a lower nominal contact pressure, and a lower shear strength of the interface.

40|$|The {{light weight}} {{property}} {{as well as}} high corrosion resistance of aluminium alloy has increased their demand especially in automobile industries. Aluminium alloy {{as a matter of}} fact has a low melting point and high ductility that severely adhere to the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>surface</b> and cause deterioration of chip evacuation.

In this paper, in order to impart functions of anti-adhesion, we propose a technique by controlling the grinding marks micro texture on the <b>tool</b> <b>surface</b> by using the blast polishing treatment without any coating technologies. The results show that the tool which underwent polishing treatment reduces the cutting force as well as the aluminium adherence during the initial cutting process, and become worst as the process cutting continues. These results indicate that grinding mark texture improves the anti-adhesion by reducing the contact area during cutting and provide storage for the lubricant. In addition, too much polishing on the <b>tool</b> <b>surface</b> may remove these textures and resultantly worsen the tool performance...|$|R

Since SMF tools represent high economical value, {{it is clear that}} improvement and prediction of tool life is of high industrial importance. Therefore, models are required that can predict friction and wear related phenomena in SMF-processes, in particular galling. This paper demonstrates the application of a wear model, which is able to predict the initiation of galling in lubricated sheet metal forming processes, to laboratory results gained with the TNO slider-on-sheet tribometer. Experiments are conducted with different (coated) <b>tool</b> <b>surfaces,</b> in sliding contact with stainless steel sheet, using two lubricants. By comparing the critical temperature of the generated boundary layer with the flash temperature at the interface of the sheet and individual tool summits, it is possible to predict whether or not galling initiation will occur.

40|$|In Finite Element (FE) {{simulations}} of {{sheet metal forming}} (SMF), the coefficient of friction is generally expressed as a constant Coulomb friction. However in reality, the coefficient of friction at the local contact spot varies with the varying operational, deformation and contact conditions. Therefore, {{it is important to}} calculate the coefficient of friction under local contact conditions to better evaluate the formability of the sheet metal product. Friction at the local contact spot is largely influenced by the micro-mechanisms occurring at asperity level like shearing in the boundary layer, ploughing, surface deformation of the sheet metal surface and hydrodynamic lubrication. In this paper, a multi-scale contact model is developed for predicting the friction occurring in the SMF processes. The model describes the asperity flattening and ploughing phenomenon between the sheet metal and the tool which is predominant amongst the other friction mechanisms. The change occurring in the surface topography of the sheet metal during the deep drawing processes influences the ploughing process. An asperity flattening model for pure plastic conditions is used to describe this phenomenon. The developed model is analyzed with various sheet metal and <b>tool</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The result shows that the coefficient of friction is very much dependent on the surface topography of the interacting surfaces at low nominal contact pressures. At high nominal contact pressures, the surface topography influences less the friction.
