5|$|Some Heathens {{celebrate}} the eight festivals found in <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, {{a tradition that}} they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked Wheel of the Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that this system is of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world.|$|E
5|$|During the trip, Homer {{falls asleep}} and wakes up {{abruptly}} at <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truck due to taking {{a combination of}} pep pills and sleeping pills that he bought at a general store. He awakes {{to discover that the}} truck drove by itself with its Navitron Autodrive System. He informs other truck drivers, who inform him that he cannot let anyone know about the Autodrive system because it would make all truck drivers lose their jobs. However, Homer tells the passengers of a passing bus about the system, which causes an angry mob of truckers to go after Homer. But even after the Autodrive system ejects itself from Homer's semi, Homer is able to escape from the angry trucker mob. Homer and Bart arrive in Atlanta to finish Red's shipment on time, and then commandeer a train full of napalm so they can return to Springfield.|$|E

25|$|Wiccans use {{the name}} Beltane or Beltain for their May Day celebrations. It {{is one of}} the yearly Sabbats of <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year, {{following}} Ostara and preceding Midsummer. Unlike Celtic Reconstructionism, Wicca is syncretic and melds practices from many different cultures. In general, the Wiccan Beltane is more akin to the Germanic/English May Day festival, both in its significance (focusing on fertility) and its rituals (such as maypole dancing). Some Wiccans enact a ritual union of the May Lord and May Lady.|$|E

25|$|According to the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), {{there are}} {{approximately}} 30,000 druids in the United States. Modern Druidism came to North America first {{in the form of}} fraternal Druidic organizations in the nineteenth century, and orders such as the Ancient Order of Druids in America were founded as distinct American groups as early as 1912. In 1963, the Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA) was founded by students at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota. They adopted elements of Neopaganism into their practices, for instance celebrating the festivals of <b>the</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Year.|$|E

The main topic of this sutta is the Four Noble Truths, which refer to and express the basic orientation of Buddhism in a formulaic expression. This sutta also refers to the Buddhist concepts of the Middle Way, impermanence, and dependent origination.|$|E

25|$|Although ostensibly {{retired from}} racing since 1962, Moss {{did make a}} number of one-off {{appearances}} in professional motorsport events in the following two decades. He also competed in the 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally in a Mercedes-Benz, but retired from the event in the Algerian Sahara. The Holden Torana he shared with Jack Brabham in the 1976 Bathurst 1000 was hit from behind on the grid and eventually retired with engine failure. Moss, at <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Torana when the V8 engine let go, was criticised by other drivers for staying on the racing line for over ⅔ of the 6.172km long circuit while returning to the pits as the car was dropping large amounts of oil onto the road. He also shared a Volkswagen Golf GTI with Denny Hulme in the 1979 Benson & Hedges 500 at Pukekohe Park Raceway in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{adjoining}} is Church Lane at {{the corner}} of which is a bank built on the site of a Royal Irish Constabulary barracks that was burned down by Anti-Treaty IRA forces in September 1922 during the Irish Civil War. In the lane is an old blocked up doorway of an early eighteenth century type. Church Lane leads to Woodview cottages, which are built partly on the site of an old paper mill. The mill race previously mentioned passed under Butterfield Lane to the paper mill and continued on below Ashfield to turn <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ely Cloth Factory. It was later turned into the Owen Doher River at Woodview Cottages. Until recently, when the new road was made to Templeogue, the old mill race could still be traced through the grounds of Ashfield where its dry bed was still spanned by several stone bridges.|$|E
25|$|The Eagle Mk1 {{made its}} race debut at the 1966 Belgian Grand Prix, {{with a single}} car entered for Dan Gurney. The Eagle made an instant visual impact, with its {{gracefully}} crafted chassis clothed in dark blue paint, with a white-lipped radiator opening and a single white stripe running {{the length of the}} car's dorsal surface; an elegant interpretation of the USA national racing colours. Unfortunately for the team the car, despite its good looks, failed to finish. For the introduction of the new V12 engine at the 1966 Italian Grand Prix, Gurney took <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new car, and was joined by compatriot Phil Hill in the older Eagle-Climax. Once again it was an inauspicious start, with Hill failing to qualify, and Gurney retiring during the race. Gurney did score points during the season, at both the French and Mexican events, but on both occasions this was with the Climax-powered car.|$|E
