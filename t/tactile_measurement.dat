The majority of the lens quality characteristics are tool-bound. This means that lenses, whichare pressed with the same tool and process, usually have only insignificantly small deviations. For example, an important characteristic of a lens is {{the form of the}} optical surface. In the case of aspherical lenses the measurement of optical surfaces is very difficult and connected to high efforts. Additionally, when working with <b>tactile</b> <b>measurement</b> systems there is always a risk that the optical surface might be scratched. For precision moulded lenses such measurements are only necessary for a small amount of sample lenses in order to qualify the tool. The series production can then be executed without further need for measurements. In this case, only the cleanliness of the optical surface has to be monitored. Another advantage is that the lens' center thickness can be estimated from the easily measurable edge thickness or by applying a contactless measurement system.|$|E
40|$|The {{high level}} of surface {{roughness}} of additively manufactured (AM) parts post challenges to the applicability of different dimensional measurement techniques, including tactile, optical and XCT. <b>Tactile</b> <b>measurement</b> is traditionally considered {{to have the best}} accuracy and traceability. However, <b>tactile</b> <b>measurement</b> can be significantly affected by the mechanical filtering effect. This work sets out to investigate the influence of the mechanical filtering effect of <b>tactile</b> <b>measurement</b> on AM parts.

Particularly the numerical simulation based on the morphological method allows the single influence factor, i. e., the tip diameter to be investigated. The maximum measurement errors caused by the stylus tip mechanical effect are determined by the convex hull points of the measurement profile, which is equivalent to using an infinitely large stylus tip.

40|$|Abstract Background Fracture-healing {{depends on}} interfragmentary motion. For {{improved}} osteosynthesis and fracture-healing, the micromotion between fracture fragments is undergoing intensive research. The detection of 3 D micromotions at the fracture gap still presents {{a challenge for}} conventional <b>tactile</b> <b>measurement</b> systems. Optical measurement systems may be easier to use than conventional systems, but, as yet, cannot guarantee accuracy. The {{purpose of this study}} was to validate the optical measurement system PONTOS 5 M for use in biomechanical research, including measurement of micromotion. Methods A standardized transverse fracture model was created to detect interfragmentary motions under axial loadings of up to 200 N. Measurements were performed using the optical measurement system and compared with a conventional high-accuracy tactile system consisting of 3 standard digital dial indicators (1 μm resolution; 5 μm error limit). Results We found that the deviation in the mean average motion detection between the systems was at most 5. 3 μm, indicating that detection of micromotion was possible with the optical measurement system. Furthermore, we could show two considerable advantages while using the optical measurement system. Only with the optical system interfragmentary motion could be analyzed directly at the fracture gap. Furthermore, the calibration of the optical system could be performed faster, safer and easier than that of the tactile system. Conclusion The PONTOS 5 M optical measurement system appears to be a favorable alternative to previously used <b>tactile</b> <b>measurement</b> systems for biomechanical applications.

This paper explores neural networks and vision-based and <b>tactile</b> <b>measurement</b> strategies to investigate the intricate processes of acquisition and mapping of properties characterizing deformable objects. An original com-posite neural network framework is applied to guide the tactile probing by clustering measurements representing uniform elastic-ity regions and, therefore, direct sensors toward areas of elasticity transitions where higher sampling density is required. The net-work characterizes the relationship between surface deformation and forces that are exemplified in nonrigid bodies. Beyond serving as a planner for the acquisition of measurements, the proposed composite neural architecture allows the encoding of the complex force/deformation relationship without the need for sophisticated mathematical modeling tools.

40|$|Optical {{designs in}} various {{applications}} {{profit from the}} increasing use of freeform elements. However, freeform optics always challenges the manufacturing process. The complexity of the fabrication derives from the missing symmetry in freeform surfaces. Ultra-precision machining is an appropriate method to realize complex optical freeforms. Surface deviations can be reduced in a deterministic process by a test and correction loop to achieve shapes with sub-μm deviations. But freeform elements do not only require the optical performance, they also depend on tight tolerances of the surface position with respect to reference structures. Due to the absence of rotation symmetry in freeform elements, all six degrees of freedom have to be constrained. Diamond machining allows to machine reference structures on the optical part. They can be used for alignment while testing or during the assembly processes. This paper shows a deterministic approach to manufacture optical freeform surfaces with sub-?m surface deviations by fly-cut-machining and servo assisted diamond turning.

In a previous investigation {{of an animal}} model of CIBP, we have observed that changes in intrinsic membrane properties and excitability of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptive neurons correspond to mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia. Objectives:. To investigate the mechanisms underlying changes in nonnociceptive sensory neurons in this model, we have compared the electrophysiological properties of primary nonnociceptive sensory neurons at 2 weeks after CIBP model induction with properties in sham control animals. Methods:. Copenhagen rats were injected with 106 MAT-LyLu rat prostate cancer cells into the distal femur epiphysis to generate a model of CIBP. After von Frey <b>tactile</b> <b>measurement</b> of mechanical withdrawal thresholds, the animals were prepared for acute electrophysiological recordings of mechanically sensitive neurons in the DRG in vivo. Results:. The mechanical withdrawal threshold progressively decreased in CIBP model rats. At 2 weeks, the Aβ-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMs) in CIBP model rats exhibited a slowing {{of the dynamics of}} action potential (AP) genesis, including wider AP duration and lower AP amplitude compared with sham rats. Furthermore, enhanced excitability of Aβ-fiber LTM neurons was observed as an excitatory discharge in response to intracellular injection of depolarizing current into the soma. Conclusion:. After induction of the CIBP model, Aβ-fiber LTMs at > 2 weeks but not < 1 week had undergone changes in electrophysiological properties. Importantly, changes observed are consistent with observations in models of peripheral neuropathy. Thus, Aβ-fiber nonnociceptive primary sensory neurons might be involved in the peripheral sensitization and tumor-induced tactile hypersensitivity in CIBP...|$|E

The tribological properties are much different compared to room temperature conditions and the use of lubricants is lim ited. Additionally thermal shock conditions and the increase of sticking workpiece material are leading to severe wear. A recently developed new concept is using wear resistant coatings with adapted lubricants. Recent studies address the investigation in application near forging tests with forging tools under varied lubrication conditions. The obtained results show the high potential of the coatings developed on the base of ternary Ti-B-N systems in a special multilayer design. Additionally different lubrication formulas were tested in interaction with the optimized tool surfaces.

It is the latest field of coordinate measuring technique what makes many aspects of its accuracy and possible applications still open. The paper presents information on the functioning and measurement using computed tomography X -ray 3 D. Results of comparative tests carried out on a coordinate measuring machine (CMM), optical scanner, and metrology computed tomography X -ray 3 D are presented. The results allow us to conclude that computed tomography {{makes it possible to}} obtain comparable results with CMM and the optical scanner. Conducted investigations show areas where the use of the devices is appropriate and those in which the device is not adequate. In the case of X- ray 3 D CT considerable versatility is presented which allow to describe the measured part with a cloud of points. Obtained information has an equal density of the part exterior and interior. This allows to reliably assess the test characteristics. The difference in presented results do not exceed 0. 05 mm.

40|$|Sheet-bulk {{metal forming}} {{is a new}} {{production}} process capable of performing deep-drawing and massive forming steps in a single operation. However, due to the high forming forces of the forming process, continuous process control is {{required in order to}} detect wear on the forming tool before production quality is impacted. To be able to measure the geometry of the forming tool in the limited space of forming presses, a new inspection system is being developed within the SFB/TR 73 collaborative research center. In addition to the limited space, the process restricts the amount of time available for inspection. Existing areal optical measurement systems suffer from shadowing when measuring the tool's inner elements, as they cannot be placed in the limited space next to the tool, while <b>tactile</b> <b>measurement</b> systems cannot meet the time restrictions for measuring the areal geometries. The new inspection system uses the fringe projection optical measurement principle to capture areal geometry data from relevant parts of the forming tool in short time. Highresolution image fibers are used to connect the system's compact sensor head to a base unit containing both camera and projector of the fringe projection system, which can be positioned outside of the moving parts of the press. To enable short measurement times, a high intensity laser source is used in the projector in combination with a digital micro-mirror device. Gradient index lenses are featured in the sensor head to allow for a very compact design {{that can be used in}} the narrow space above the forming tool inside the press. The sensor head is attached to an extended arm, which also guides the image fibers to the base unit. A rotation stage offers the possibility to capture measurements of different functional elements on the circular forming tool by changing the orientation of the sensor head next to the forming tool. During operation of the press, the arm can be travelled out of the moving parts of the forming press. To further reduce the measurement times of the fringe projection system, the inverse fringe projection principle has been adapted to the system to detect geometry deviations in a single camera image. Challenges arise from vibrations of both the forming machine and the positioning stages, which are transferred via the extended arm to the sensor head. Vibrations interfere with the analysis algorithms of both encoded and inverse fringe projection and thus impair measurement accuracy. To evaluate the impact of vibrations on the endoscopic system, results of measurements of simple geometries under the influence of vibrations are discussed. The effect of vibrations is imitated by displacing the measurement specimen during the measurement with a linear positioning stage. The concept of the new inspection system is presented within the scope of the TR 73 demonstrational sheet-bulk metal forming process. Finally, the capabilities of the endoscopic fringe projection system are shown by measurements of gearing structures on a forming tool compared to a CAD-reference. © 2015 SPIE...|$|E

The basic formulation is the multi-rate Kalman filter with the contact force vector as its process input, and the visual observation as its measurement output signal which is the down-sampled and delayed version of the configuration of the target object. Experimental tests are conducted for the case of planar object manipulation as well as the non-centroidal rotation under gravity using a robotic hand, and their results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed estimation scheme.|$|R

However, {{there are very few}} examples in the literature of systems that use tactile information any more complex than binary contact/no-contact sensors. This paper approximates a direct mapping between hand-object state and high-dimensional <b>tactile</b> <b>measurements</b> based on training data. Although it can be precise, tactile data provides only partial state information at any given time. Therefore, we integrate tactile information over time using a particle filter. Several variations on a basic measurement model are considered and the paper evaluates the relative utility of each one. Since we create our model from a training data set rather than building a geometric model of the manipulation interaction, the approach works well localizing difficult-to-model objects such as flexible materials or fabrics. We demonstrate that the approach can localize a haptic feature in a piece of flexible plastic to within one tenth of an inch using sensors mounted on the phalanges of human-sized fingers. All demonstrations are performed using Robonaut 2...|$|R

One approach {{for the next generation}} of production metrology devices aims at ensuring the quality of the process technologies in every single process step, therefore measuring in-process. One example of today's production metrology devices is the measurement of shafts in the production. Shafts are vital for every mechanical device that translates rotational energies and the tolerances based on diameter or roundness are in the range of microns. Those shaft measurement devices are either based on <b>tactile</b> <b>measurements</b> or on visible light which cannot be utilized as an in-process device. A novel idea is to use X-rays instead of tactile or visible light methods to be able to acquire robust measurement data despite of distorting debris like water, oil or dust. One focus is set on algorithms that allow robust measurement s of diameter and roundness despite of distorting debris like water, oil or dust. The measurement uncertainty of the new method has been investigated and results will be introduced...|$|R
