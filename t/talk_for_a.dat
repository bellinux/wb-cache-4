5|$|Mulder and Scully rent a {{boat and}} head out onto the lake; their boat is quickly struck by {{something}} and sinks. The two find a large rock to climb up on and <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while about Mulder's quest to catch Big Blue, and the book Moby-Dick. When Dr. Farraday walks by the two realize they were close to shore all along. Mulder thinks the drop in the frog supply has caused Big Blue to move closer to shore and seek alternative food sources. Farraday is soon attacked but manages {{to make it out}} alive. Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing it to be an alligator. Mulder is disappointed that the killer ended up being an alligator and not Big Blue. As the agents leave, Big Blue swims nearby in the lake, unnoticed.|$|E
25|$|The Prince wanders {{for some}} time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat {{appointed}} by Aglaya as their meeting place. Her laughter wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastassya Filippovna, and they <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time about the letters Aglaya has received. In the letters, Nastassya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin, but Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastassya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastassya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is not in love with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters back in her face, and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters with dread, and later that day Nastassya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her.|$|E
500|$|After the group's breakup, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford {{decided to}} stay {{together}} and find a new vocalist. [...] "There was <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while of us becoming Ozzy Osbourne's backing band, and even Macy Gray's", said Morello. [...] "We informed them that losing our singer was actually a blessing in disguise, and that we had bigger ambitions than being somebody's hired musicians." [...] They eventually teamed up with then-former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell to form Audioslave. The first Audioslave single, [...] "Cochise", was released in early November 2002, and a self-titled debut album followed to mainly positive reviews. Compared to Rage Against the Machine, most of Audioslave's music was apolitical, although some songs touched on political issues. Their second album Out of Exile debuted at the number one position on the Billboard charts in 2005. Audioslave released its third album Revelations on September 5, 2006, but an accompanying tour did not occur as Cornell and Morello were working on solo albums. After months of inactivity and rumors of a breakup, Audioslave disbanded on February 15, 2007, after Cornell announced he was leaving the band.|$|E

500|$|The adult fandom {{has been}} {{perceived}} negatively by others, with {{coverage of the}} brony fandom overshadowing the show itself. Much of the fandom's ridicule from others comes from {{the perception of the}} mostly adult male fanbase enjoying a show that is marketed to the young female demographic. Through this, the brony community has encountered ridicule through trolling on internet forums, not only from its inception at 4chan, but after moving away from the site. This has also been called out in popular media. The Fox News Channel comedy talk program Red Eye poked fun at the fandom because it largely consists of young adult males. Kurt Schlichter of BigHollywood.com called the phenomenon a [...] "terrifying new trend", and wrote, [...] "Hollywood, do you really need to enable the creepy immaturity of these geebos? No. It's time to stop the insanity." [...] Commenting on Schlichter's article, Greg Pollowitz of the National Review Online wrote that considering the target audience he could not understand the show's appeal to adult men. Jerry Springer attempted to bring bronies onto his <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> segment on [...] "Outrageously Guilty Pleasures", though the fandom warned others about the potential ridicule.|$|E

2500|$|In January, Ford {{introduced}} a weekly lecture series via the Chicago Culture Club {{on the subject}} of French literary figures, Flaubert and Goncourt brothers, that continued into February, and [...] "A Talk on Dickens" [...] for a benefit. Only a day later Ford gave a <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> school board, and the next day, on Thackeray, Dickens' Pickwick, George Eliot, Eugene Field, and James Whitcomb Riley. By mid-February Ford had taken up another new topic - silk - and gave a <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> benefit, and another about Emile Zola. And then, for the first time, Ford solos presenting her talks at a theatre with tikets and she does so with a talk on literary figures, an event that drew hundreds as part of a series. Finally it came time for the Arché Club's prize exhibition [...] "Salon". The talks progressed and the last talk of February was before the Culture Club as part of an ensemble of women talking on Charles Baudelaire and similar poets, as well as another ensemble about artful clothing.|$|E

2500|$|The opera {{opens with}} Dido in her court with her attendants. Belinda {{is trying to}} cheer up Dido, but Dido is full of sorrow, saying 'Peace and I are strangers grown'. Belinda {{believes}} {{the source of this}} grief to be the Trojan Aeneas, and suggests that Carthage's troubles could be resolved by a marriage between the two. Dido and Belinda <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time—Dido fears that her love will make her a weak monarch, but Belinda and the Second Woman reassure her that [...] "The hero loves as well." [...] Aeneas enters the court, and is at first received coldly by Dido, but she eventually accepts his proposal of marriage.|$|E
2500|$|William Miller's mother figured {{prominently}} in the film as well (often admonishing, [...] "Don't take drugs!"). The character was based on Crowe's own mother, who even {{showed up at the}} film sets {{to keep an eye on}} him while he worked. Though he asked her not to bother Frances McDormand, who played her character, the two ended up getting along well. Also in the film he showed his sister, portrayed by Zooey Deschanel, rebelling and leaving home, and in real life, his mother and sister Cindy did not <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decade and were still estranged to a degree when he finished the film. The family reconciled when the project was complete.|$|E

2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing Machines Bill. If your readers ask me why Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – I mean it was daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the honourable member for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|E
