5|$|<b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units (Système {{international}} d'unités or SI) is {{the current}} international standard metric system and is also the system most widely used around the world. It {{is an extension of}} Giorgi's MKSA system—its base units are the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, candela and mole.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational metric systems use the {{kilogram-force}} (kilopond) as a {{base unit}} of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl, Technische Mass Einheit (TME), mug or metric slug. Although the CGPM passed a resolution in 1901 defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980.665cm/s2, gravitational units {{are not part of}} <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units (SI).|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Quantities (ISQ) is {{a system}} based on seven base quantities: length, mass, time, {{electric}} current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. Other quantities such as area, pressure, and electrical resistance are derived from these base quantities by clear non-contradictory equations. The ISQ defines the quantities that are measured with the SI units. The ISQ is defined in the international standard ISO/IEC 80000, and was finalised in 2009 {{with the publication of}} ISO 80000-1.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units.|$|E
5|$|The uncoordinated use of {{the metric}} system by {{different}} scientific and engineering disciplines, particularly in the late 19th century, resulted in different choices of base units even though all {{were based on the}} same definitions of the units of the metre and the kilogram. During the 20th century, efforts were made to rationalise these units, and in 1960, the CGPM published <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units, which has since then been the internationally recognised standard metric system.|$|E

5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E
5|$|On 10 February 1964, the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it was to use SI except where this would have an obvious detrimental effect. In 1968 Congress authorised the U.S. Metric Study, the emphasis of which {{was to examine the}} feasibility of adopting SI. The first volume was delivered in 1970. The study recommended that the United States adopt <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of units, and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for the increased use of the metric measurement system in the United States. Metrication was voluntary and to be coordinated by the United States Metric Board (USMB).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units {{standardized}} its unit of time, the second, on {{the properties}} of cesium in 1967. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. The cesium atomic clock, maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is accurate to 30billionths of a second per year. Atomic clocks have employed other elements, such as hydrogen and rubidium vapor, offering greater stability—in the case of hydrogen clocks—and smaller size, lower power consumption, and thus lower cost (in the case of rubidium clocks).|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>international</b> {{financial}} <b>system</b> {{might be}} said to be in crisis. It requires frequent intervention by central banks and other national and international bodies to reduce fluctuations of currencies. It does not tend to eliminate current account deficits and surpluses; exchange rate fluctuations do not lead to movements toward balanced trade, nor do they appear to follow from flows of international reserves: some countries run persistent surpluses while others run persistent deficits. This paper first examines the functioning of <b>the</b> modern <b>international</b> financial <b>system</b> in order to design a reformed system that will make it to deal with {{some of the problems that}} face <b>the</b> <b>international</b> financial <b>system</b> today. <b>The</b> paper advocates reformation of <b>the</b> <b>international</b> financial <b>system</b> today. <b>The</b> paper advocates reformation of <b>the</b> <b>international</b> financial <b>system</b> along <b>the</b> lines of Keynes's famous bancor proposal. Most importantly, the reform would eliminate the current bias toward "austerity" that results from the way in which existing international financial institutions operate. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{usage of}} the metric system varies around the world. According to the US Central Intelligence Agency's Factbook (2007), <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>System</b> of Units has been adopted as the {{official}} system of weights and measures by all {{nations in the world}} except for Myanmar (Burma), Liberia and the United States, while the NIST has identified the United States as the only industrialised country where the metric system is not the predominant system of units. However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric system.|$|E
