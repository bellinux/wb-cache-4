500|$|Dragojlo Nikolić, nicknamed Bajo Pivljanin, {{was born}} around 1630 in Piva (modern-day northwestern Montenegro), {{at that time}} part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Herzegovina. According to oral {{tradition}} {{he was born in}} the village of Rudinice (in Plužine), while there are two versions as to which family he belonged. According to one tradition, found in Kosta Radović's novel Vrtijeljka (1922), he was born in the village of Rudinice (now in Plužine) in Piva to his father Nikola and his mother Ruža, of the Ruđić brotherhood. Radović claims that he was born on 22 May 1622, while it is estimated that he was born in [...] 1630. His godfather, the monk Ivanović, named him Dragojlo, while the nickname Bajo (derived from baja, [...] "snake", a common nickname in Piva which was thought <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>children</b> <b>from</b> evil) was given to him by his grandfather Simo. This version was also mentioned by Blagojević, who stated that Bajo Pivljanin belonged to the Nikolić family in Gornje Rudinice, descending from the old brotherhood of Ruđić. The Ruđić brotherhood from Rudinice, which later dispersed elsewhere, is one of two family trees in Piva from which many Pivan families descend.|$|E
