500|$|Dragojlo NikoliÄ‡, nicknamed Bajo Pivljanin, {{was born}} around 1630 in Piva (modern-day northwestern Montenegro), {{at that time}} part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Herzegovina.

According to one tradition, found in Kosta RadoviÄ‡'s novel Vrtijeljka (1922), he was born in the village of Rudinice (now in PluÅ¾ine) in Piva to his father Nikola and his mother RuÅ¾a, of the RuÄ‘iÄ‡ brotherhood. RadoviÄ‡ claims that he was born on 22 May 1622, while it is estimated that he was born in [...] 1630.

This version was also mentioned by BlagojeviÄ‡, who stated that Bajo Pivljanin belonged to the NikoliÄ‡ family in Gornje Rudinice, descending from the old brotherhood of RuÄ‘iÄ‡. The RuÄ‘iÄ‡ brotherhood from Rudinice, which later dispersed elsewhere, is one of two family trees in Piva from which many Pivan families descend.|$|E
