500|$|Vonnegut's {{difficulties}} materialized {{in numerous}} ways; most distinctly though, was the painfully slow progress {{he was making}} on his next novel, the darkly comical Breakfast of Champions. In 1971, Vonnegut stopped writing the novel altogether. When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak's book American Literature on Stage and Screen, Breakfast of Champions was called [...] "funny and outlandish", but reviewers noted that it [...] "lacks substance {{and seems to be}} an exercise in literary playfulness." [...] Vonnegut's 1976 novel Slapstick, which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In The New York Timess review of Slapstick, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said Vonnegut [...] "seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> less effort into [...] than ever before", and that [...] "it still seems as if he has given up storytelling after all." [...] At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors' complaints.|$|E

Nor dare I {{give this}} {{description}} otherwise than thus, {{because there is}} a real distinction <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> between that righteousness by which we should be just before God, and that which is in us a principle of sanctification; the first being the obedience of the Son of God without us, the second being the work of the Spirit in our hearts.

500|$|Nelson {{mounted a}} loose {{blockade}} {{of the combined}} fleet, keeping most of his fleet out of sight, but with a line of frigates and larger ships stationed at intervals between himself and Cadiz. On 19 October the combined fleet was observed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> to sea, and the signal was passed down the line of ships. William Pryce Cumby, Bellerophons first lieutenant, was first in the main fleet to spot the signal, flying from the last ship in the communication link, HMS Mars. The British began to pursue the combined fleet as it made its way towards the Straits of Gibraltar, and came in sight {{of it on the}} morning of 21 October. The officer and sailors of Bellerophon prepared for battle, some of the gun crews chalking the words [...] "Victory or Death" [...] on their gun barrels. At 11 am Bellerophons signal midshipman, John Franklin, noted that Nelson had hoisted the signal [...] "England expects that every man will do his duty", and {{an hour and a half}} later Bellerophon entered the battle as the fifth ship in Collingwood's lee column. She was astern of the 80-gun HMS Tonnant and ahead of the 74-gun , with the 74-gun [...] close by her port side.|$|E
2500|$|According to a BBC source {{reporting}} to The Sun, Ricky was dropped because he [...] "wasn’t going anywhere as a character. And Sid didn’t seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> {{his heart and}} soul into it any more either. He’s gutted. But deep down he knows he wasn’t pulling his weight." [...] The character was written out in scenes that aired in February 2004, Owen being one of many actors to quit or be axed by Louise Berridge that year.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the initial}} {{developments}} {{leading to the}} 4–2–4 were devised by Márton Bukovi, the credit for creating the 4–2–4 lies with two different people: Flávio Costa, the Brazilian national coach in the early 1950s, as well as another Hungarian, Béla Guttman. These tactics seemed to be developed independently, with the Brazilians discussing these ideas while the Hungarians seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> them into motion. The fully developed 4–2–4 was only [...] "perfected" [...] in Brazil, however, in the late 1950s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{situation}} escalated {{over the}} weekend as executive producer, Mike Ryan, then jumped in to defend Le Batard where he buried Rapaport, pointing out the actor's many forgettable role's in his movies. After a lengthy back and forth, Rapaport still insisted on attacking Ryan, and eventually, another of the show's producer's, Roy Bellamy, jumped into the discussion. The twitter beef reached its climax with Rapaport posting a racist photo of Bellamy, and resulting in Ryan and Bellamy finishing their war with Rapaport. Following the weekend, Le Batard briefly discussed the events that had occurred {{over the weekend}} on his show, and proclaimed the end of Rapaport's guest appearances at ESPN. Le Batard stated, [...] "These things are all about value. How much value {{do you have to}} the company? Not enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> up racist stuff on Twitter. He doesn’t work for the company. He’s on The Jump every once in awhile. So I’m guessing this is gonna cause him a problem. He doesn’t have enough value to the company, I don’t think, to withstand something like this.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Baltimore office, the {{released}} video lets viewers hear O'Keefe {{saying that}} he and Giles were bringing up thirteen girls from El Salvador [...] "like 15" [...] years of age to live in their house and work as prostitutes [...] "just to get them on their feet so they can do this type of thing." [...] Giles remarks, [...] "they are kind of dependent." [...] Although the Baltimore ACORN staffer pointed out their plans were illegal, after O'Keefe says, [...] "we are going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> a roof over [...] head", the ACORN employee states, [...] "well then {{you know what you}} can always claim them as dependents." [...] Later, the employee says, [...] "you are gonna use three of them they are gonna be under 16 so you is eligible to get child tax credit and additional child tax credit." [...] When O'Keefe asks, [...] "what {{if they are going to}} be making money because they are performing tricks too?" [...] the employee replies, [...] "but if they making money and they are underage, then you shouldn't be letting anybody know anyway." [...] The Baltimore employees were fired by ACORN after the video was released.|$|E
2500|$|In Bădărău's view, {{the main}} {{characteristics}} setting Ion Creangă's account {{apart from its}} sources of inspiration is its treatment of the other characters: [...] "With Creangă, the characters are no longer symbolic, abstract (as they are in popular fairy tales), but display a psychological, peasant-like [...] individuality, within a framework that blends the supernatural and the real." [...] He sees this as being especially true for the prince's [...] "five fabulous friends" [...] (Ochilă, Setilă, Gerilă, Flămânzilă, Păsări-Lăţi-Lungilă), whose choice of names, [...] "defining the character trait which individualizes them", is [...] "a particularity of Creangă's fairy tale [...]" [...] Braga underlines the serendipitous nature of these characters' presence within the story, which he also believes is relevant for Holy Sunday and Harap Alb's horse: [...] " [...] are nothing but 'helpers', with more or less unnatural powers, they appear to us as forces whose exercise is invoked by the very development of the 'ordeal'." [...] In Vernică's interpretation, they may also represent anthropomorphized manifestations of the hero's own [...] "energies", which he is supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> to use. Critic Simona Brânzaru places the representations of Flămânzilă and Setilă, both of whom [...] "seem somewhat content to have gotten their friend out of trouble", {{in connection with the}} ideas of Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin on the [...] "philosophy of the Gaster" [...] (that is, belly), while noting: [...] "As in any fairy-tale, be it in its cultivated variant, nothing is accidental." ...|$|E
