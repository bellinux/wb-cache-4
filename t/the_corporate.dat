5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company.

It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in <b>the</b> <b>corporate</b> strategy formulation process.

The evolving plot led to the promotion of an eight-man elimination tag team match between both groups at Over the Edge. In this bout, the team that eliminated all of its opponents would win.|$|E
