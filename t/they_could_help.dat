5|$|The Dreamtime {{story of}} the black swans tells how two {{brothers}} were turned into white swans so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> an attack party during a raid for weapons. It is said that Wurrunna used a large gubbera, or crystal stone, to transform the men. After the raid, eaglehawks attacked the white swans and tore feathers from the birds. Crows who were enemies of the eaglehawks came {{to the aid of}} the brothers and gave the black swans their own black feathers. The black swan's red beak {{is said to be the}} blood of the attacked brothers, which stayed there forever.|$|E

25|$|Before Hall left Trinidad in 1970 Gerard Pantin—a Catholic {{priest in}} the Holy Ghost Fathers order—asked {{him if he}} would assist Pantin in forming a {{humanitarian}} program to assist the poor and marginalised residents of the Laventille community. Hall agreed and together the two men walked through the dangerous neighbourhood, simply asking the residents how <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> them. This mission grew to become the SERVOL (Service Volunteered For All) voluntary organisation that now operates throughout Trinidad and Tobago and elsewhere in the Caribbean. While Hall returned to Barbados three months after the program started, he is recognised as one of SERVOL's co-founders.|$|E
25|$|During {{her junior}} and senior years, she lived with the family of medical writing {{consultant}} Marilyn K. Hauk and her then-husband, former Des Moines Register assistant managing editor Randy Essex. Hauk and Essex already knew Jones through the Des Moines Area Youth Track Club. Knowing that she showed such tremendous promise, they asked Des Moines youth coach Phil Ferguson if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>help.</b> They became {{part of a community}} that nurtured her, which included teachers at Roosevelt High School who made sure that she put together the right classes to be ready for college, an orthodontist who reduced the cost of her braces and an attorney who handled paperwork pro bono to assure she was covered by health insurance. Jean and Kim Walker and later Janis Caldwell also welcomed her into their homes. Jones went on to receive college degrees in economics and Spanish.|$|E
25|$|The Druze {{had already}} made contact on several {{occasions}} with Yishuv agents and following their defeat at Ramat Yohanan, the Druze officers offered to defect and to {{join the ranks of}} Haganah. This proposition was discussed with Yigael Yadin, who refused the proposal but suggested that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> to carry out sabotage operations behind the backs of the Arabs and to influence their comrades into deserting the army. By the start of May, 212 Wahab soldiers deserted. Taking into account the attitude of his men, Wahab met with Jewish liaison officers on 9 May and agreed to cooperate with Haganah. The two parties avoided clashes, and Wahab created a neutral enclave in the centre of Galilee. Wahab's army did not respond to calls for it to help fight Haganah's occupation of Acre, and avoided being present while Haganah occupied the police fortress of Shefa-'Amr during its evacuation by the British.|$|E

2500|$|Alstat was {{an early}} {{champion}} {{of the rights of}} women, including their education and their place in academia. In the 1930s, he worked with Trude Weiss-Rosmarin, teaching courses on Jewish History and Modern Jewish Problems at [...] "The School of the Jewish Woman," [...] the institution she created on New York's Upper West Side, under the auspices of Hadassah. Weiss-Rosmarin, and those who worked with her, felt that [...] "Jewish women had been short-changed...and saw education was the remedy." [...] "As an intellectual feminist," [...] Weiss-Rosmarin promoted the study of the liturgy, learning the meaning and history of the prayers, [...] "to stimulate attendance of women at synagogue." [...] Through classes in history, philosophy, customs, and ceremonies, Alstat, along with the other well-known rabbis who taught at this school, helped promote this vision of increased education, not only for the women of that time, but also so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> their children. As Weiss-Rosmarin put it, [...] "If you want your children to grow up as educated Jews, you yourself must become educated." ...|$|E

2500|$|Johnson & Johnson {{received}} positive {{coverage for}} its {{handling of the}} crisis; for example, an article in The Washington Post said, [...] "Johnson & Johnson has effectively demonstrated how a major business ought to handle a disaster". The article further stated that [...] "this is no Three Mile Island accident in which the company's response did more damage than the original incident", and applauded the company for being honest with the public. In addition to issuing the recall, the company established relations with the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, and the Food and Drug Administration. This way it could have a part in searching {{for the person who}} laced the capsules and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> prevent further tamperings. [...] While {{at the time of the}} scare the company's market share collapsed from thirty-five percent to eight percent, it rebounded in less than a year, a move credited to the company's prompt and aggressive reaction. In November, it reintroduced capsules but in a new, triple-sealed package, coupled with heavy price promotions and within several years, Tylenol had the highest market share for the over-the-counter analgesic in the U.S.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} early-modern {{mercenary}} armies muster fraud was endemic in the States Army. This {{was due to}} the difficult position of the captains as entrepreneurs. They were paid according to the effective strength of their companies as established at the regular musters that the provinces held for the units on their repartitie. That effective strength was usually far below the nominal strength of the company due to processes of attrition, like losses due to sickness, desertion, battle casualties, including prisoners of war and missing, and [...] "poaching" [...] by other captains of personnel. There was little the captains could do to prevent this natural attrition process, yet they were held responsible for replenishing the ranks, generally without compensation for the extra costs. These could be substantial as the captains had to organize their own regular recruitment drives. On the other hand, the captains had little incentive to keep their units at fighting strength, because they (and their men) had little intention of actually fighting, if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> it, so they did not see a personal advantage in keeping their units at optimum readiness. This dilemma understandably motivated them to make it appear to the muster commissioners that their units were up to strength.|$|E
2500|$|At Rome, the Campanian ambassadors were {{admitted}} {{to an audience}} with the Senate. In a speech, they proposed an alliance between Rome and the Campanians, noting how the Campanians with their famous wealth could be of aid to the Romans, and that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> to subdue the Volsci, who were enemies of Rome. They pointed out that nothing in Rome's treaty with the Samnites prevented them from also making a treaty with the Campanians, and warning {{that if they did}} not, the Samnites would conquer Campania and its strength would be added to the Samnites' instead of to the Romans'. [...] After discussing this proposal, the senate concluded that while there was much to be gained from a treaty with the Campanians, and that this fertile area could become Rome's granary, Rome could not ally with them and still be considered loyal to their existing treaty with the Samnites, and for this reason they had to refuse the proposal. After being informed of Rome's refusal, the Campanian embassy, in accordance with their instructions, surrendered the people of Campania and the city of Capua unconditionally into the power of Rome. Moved by this surrender, the Senators resolved that Rome's honour now required that the Campanians and Capua, who by their surrender had become the possession of Rome, be protected from Samnite attacks.|$|E

2500|$|Images {{dated to}} the [...] Unified Silla period are {{relatively}} more plentiful than their [...] counterparts from the Three Kingdoms period. [...] There are several dated [...] images which serve as important markers {{that show the}} evolution of [...] Korean sculpture during this era. [...] The first set of important dated [...] images are a group of Buddhist stele excavated from former Baekje [...] territory with dated inscriptions. [...] One {{of the most important}} examples, [...] shown below, is a stele dated to 673, thirteen years after the defeat of [...] the Baekje Kingdom. [...] This image has an important inscription which [...] states that the statue was carved by artisans from the former Baekje [...] Kingdom and funded by former Baekje aristocrats. [...] This image, and the [...] others from group, suggest that Baekje nobility were incorporated into [...] the Silla political system so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>help</b> their new overlords [...] govern subjugated territory. [...] The stele, reminiscent of a single [...] mandorla triad, has a close analogue to the famous Sakyamuni Triad in [...] the Horyu-ji [...] cast by a Korean sculptor in 623. [...] Not only does the stele provide a [...] clue that suggests that the Sakyamuni Triad may have been based on [...] styles from Baekje specifically, this suggests also that Silla art [...] incorporated the styles and practices of their conquered subjects in [...] subsequent art.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the Texian disbelief, by {{the evening}} of February 20 many of the {{residents}} of Bexar began to pack their belongings in preparation for leaving. [...] The next day, fifteen of the Tejano volunteers at the Alamo resigned.

Santa Anna had crossed the Rio Grande on February 16. The next night, his army camped on the Nueces River, [...] from Bexar. Texians had previously burned the bridge over the Nueces, forcing the Mexicans to build a makeshift structure of branches and dirt in the pouring rain. The delay was brief, and on February 19 the vanguard of the army camped along the Frio River, [...] from Bexar. The following day they reached Hondo, less than [...] away. By 1:45 pm on February 21 Santa Anna and his vanguard had reached the banks of the Medina River, [...] from Bexar. Waiting there were dragoons under Colonel Ramirez y Sesma, who had arrived the previous evening. With no idea that the Mexican army was so close, all but 10 members of the Alamo garrison joined about 2000Bexar residents at a fiesta to celebrate George Washington's birthday. Centralists in Bexar soon alerted Santa Anna to the party, and he ordered General Ramirez y Sesma to lead a cavalry force to take the Alamo while the garrison celebrated elsewhere. [...] The raid had to be called off when sudden rains made the Medina unfordable. The next night, Santa Anna and his army camped at Leon Creek, [...] west of what is now Downtown San Antonio.|$|E
