5|$|The {{design that}} Pei {{developed}} for the Bank of China Tower was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The tower was planned around a visible truss structure, which distributed stress to {{the four corners of}} the base. Using <b>the</b> <b>reflective</b> glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.|$|E

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for characterizing {{the time and}} frequency response of an ultrasonically reflective contrast agent is disclosed. An ultrasonically reflective contrast agent is injected, under constant pressure, into a fluid flowing through a pump flow circuit. The fluid and <b>the</b> ultrasonically <b>reflective</b> contrast agent are uniformly mixed in a mixing chamber, and the uniform mixture is passed through a contrast agent chamber. The contrast agent chamber is acoustically and axially interposed between an ultrasonic transducer chamber and an acoustic isolation chamber. A pulse of ultrasonic energy is transmitted into the contrast agent chamber from the ultrasonic transducer chamber. An echo waveform is received from <b>the</b> ultrasonically <b>reflective</b> contrast agent, and it is analyzed to determine the time and frequency response of <b>the</b> ultrasonically <b>reflective</b> contrast agent...|$|R

40|$|Disclosed herein is {{a method}} of {{determining}} the near angle scattering of a sample <b>reflective</b> surface comprising <b>the</b> steps of: a) splitting {{a beam of light}} having a coherence length of {{greater than or equal to}} about 2 meters into a sample beam and a reference beam; b) frequency shifting both the sample beam and the reference beam to produce a fixed beat frequency between the sample beam and the reference beam; c) directing the sample beam through a focusing lens and onto <b>the</b> sample <b>reflective</b> surface, d) reflecting the sample beam from <b>the</b> sample <b>reflective</b> surface through a detection restriction disposed on a movable stage; e) recombining the sample beam with the reference beam to form a recombined beam, followed by f) directing the recombined beam to a detector and performing heterodyne analysis on the recombined beam to measure the near-angle scattering of <b>the</b> sample <b>reflective</b> surface, wherein <b>the</b> position of the detection restriction relative to the sample beam is varied to occlude at least a portion of the sample beam to measure the near-angle scattering of <b>the</b> sample <b>reflective</b> surface.

25|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>reflective</b> 5-dimensional uniform polytopes {{are done}} through a Wythoff {{construction}} process, and represented through a Coxeter diagram, where each node represents a mirror.

Uniform 5-polytopes are named in relation to the regular polytopes in each family. Some families have two regular constructors and thus may have two ways of naming them.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{degradation}} of the dye, failure of a CD-R can be due to <b>the</b> <b>reflective</b> surface. While silver is less expensive and more widely used, it is more prone to oxidation resulting in a non-reflecting surface. Gold on the other hand, although more expensive and no longer widely used, is an inert material, so gold-based CD-Rs do not suffer from this problem. Manufacturers have estimated the longevity of gold-based CD-Rs to {{be as high as}} 100 years.|$|E
25|$|During early {{experiments}} with LORAN's skywaves, Jack Pierce noticed that at night <b>the</b> <b>reflective</b> layer in the ionosphere was quite stable. This {{led to the}} possibility that two LORAN stations could be synchronized using skywave signals, at least at night, allowing them to be separated over much greater distances. Accuracy of a hyperbolic system {{is a function of the}} baseline distance, so if the stations could be spread out, the system would become more accurate, so fewer stations would be needed.|$|E

25|$|Low {{temperature}} ionic liquids (below 130K) {{have been}} proposed as the fluid base for an extremely large diameter spinning liquid mirror telescope {{to be based on}} the Earth's moon. Low temperature is advantageous in imaging long wave infrared light which is the form of light (extremely red-shifted) that arrives from the most distant parts of the visible universe. Such a liquid base would be covered by a thin metallic film that forms <b>the</b> <b>reflective</b> surface. Low volatility is important in lunar vacuum conditions.|$|E
25|$|Mirrors are {{manufactured}} by applying a reflective coating to a suitable substrate. The most common substrate is glass, {{due to its}} transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a smooth finish. <b>The</b> <b>reflective</b> coating is typically applied to the back surface of the glass, so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass {{on one side and}} the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.|$|E
25|$|The bioluminescent {{organs of}} Dolichopteryx and Opisthoproctus, {{together}} with <b>the</b> <b>reflective</b> soles of the latter, {{may serve as}} camouflage {{in the form of}} counterillumination. This predator avoidance strategy involves the use of ventral light to break up the fishes' silhouettes, so that (when viewed from below) they blend in with the ambient light from above. Counterillumination is also seen in several other unrelated deep-sea families, which include the marine hatchetfish (Sternoptychidae). Also found in marine hatchetfish and other unrelated families are tubular eyes, such as telescopefish and tube-eye.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, polarization effects can also occur at <b>the</b> (<b>reflective)</b> interface between two materials of different refractive index. These effects are {{treated by the}} Fresnel equations. Part of the wave is transmitted and part is reflected, with the ratio depending on angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. In this way, physical optics recovers Brewster's angle. When light reflects from a thin film on a surface, interference between the reflections from the film's surfaces can produce polarization in the reflected and transmitted light.|$|E
25|$|Three other {{survivors}} {{managed to}} board a small liferaft. One was the duty radio officer who had sent the distress message. The others were a badly wounded DEMS gunner, EG Elliot RN, and a passenger called Frank Brothers. After they had drifted for four days they sighted a submarine and used <b>the</b> <b>reflective</b> surface of a tobacco tin as a heliograph to attract her attention.

25|$|Other {{challenges}} {{to the design of}} the facilities were presented by the museum’s sustainability initiatives. The use of natural light whenever possible challenged exhibit designers relying on carefully controlled light levels; this was solved by using curtains and glare-reducing paint colors. Other conflicts between construction and energy use included the glass in the Observatory, which would have presented a problem in cooling the building on warm days. This was overcome by adding fritted glass to the windows in thin horizontal lines through the panes to decrease the transparency without affecting the views. The fritting also makes <b>the</b> <b>reflective</b> surfaces of the Bay Observatory safe for birds.|$|E
