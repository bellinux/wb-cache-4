Although largely overlooked by most recent studies on leaving home, life-course theory suggests that age norms and age grading infl uence life-course decisions in general and leaving home in particular. We use Fishbein and Ajzen’s model of “reasoned behavior” to integrate this strand of research with the more individualistic view that dominates current thinking. Using data from a Dutch panel survey, we use a Cox regression model with a control for sample selection to estimate {{the association between}} perceived age norms and the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> home.

40|$|Background : Although Black and Hispanic {{young adults}} in the U.

Objective : This study examines the ability of racial/ethnic disparities in life course transitions, socioeconomic resources, and family connectivity to account for racial/ethnic differences in leaving and returning home. Methods : Using data from the 2005 - 2011 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics' Transition into Adulthood study (N= 1, 491, age 18 to 26), we estimated discrete-time event history models predicting the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> moving out of and back into the parental home. Results : Although no single factor completely explained racial-ethnic differences in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> and returning to the parental home, the bulk of the Black-White differences in both home-leaving and home-returning was explained by group differences in transitions into adult roles, the ability to afford independent living, and connections to the origin family. These factors also explained most of the Mexican-White difference in home-leaving. However, only a small portion of the Hispanic-White difference in returning home was attributable to the proposed explanatory variables. Conclusions : Explanations for racial and ethnic differences in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> and returning to the parental home need to consider a broad array of life course characteristics in which Black, Hispanic, and White youth differ. The factors that explain Black-White differences in home-leaving and home-returning may differ from those that explain Hispanic-White differences in these behaviors...|$|R

Lifetime, interpreted in terms of age, assumes a twofold interpretation. Years of age are an objective concept but the definition of age groups to study youth is a social construction. Object: We focus on <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> parental home in Italy and France. The transition <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> parental home is a complex process calling for both a quantitative description and a qualitative explanation. The subjective dimension is intrinsically associated with lifetime perception and definition of future choices. Method: The research problem calls for an explanatory mixed-method design. The quantitative analyse is carried out employing EU SILC cross-sectional analyses (2005 and 2011 panel) to identify which predictors affect the time <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> home according to levels of education, social origin and gender. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews of Italian and French people aged 20 - 35 will help identify mechanisms and individual strategies in leaving the parental home. Results: Main results show how French young people feels to be late in achieving residential autonomy compared to previous generation. Social and familial norms are pushing factors to move out earlier, despite precarious job conditions and readiness. Italian young people use longer time at parent’s home as strategic choice, especially for highly educated young men. In both countries, young people around thirty perceive to be “out of time” as if a mismatch occurs at a global level between what young-adult people are and what they should achieve. Conclusion: The comparative mixed-method analysis puts light both on cross-national difference in achieving residential autonomy and on how young people perceive the mark of adulthood as age based structure.

40|$|Objective: This thesis {{examines}} the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> having {{the first child}} in relation to when Swedish men and women leave the parental home. The aim is to explain if any childbearing trends can be detected based on whether one leaves the parental home at a younger or older relative age than the current age norms. The <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> having the first child might be affected by either a speed up/slow down effect (one continues to experience other stages of adulthood faster or slower relative to people of the same age) or an age-norm effect (one tries to counter-act deviation from the home-leaving norm by speeding up or delaying childbearing to align with people of the same age).   Method and Data: Event history analysis is applied using a multivariate piece-wise constant hazard model. The data comes from Swedish register data based on records of the entire Swedish population between 1 January 1953 and 31 December 2012.   Results: The results indicate that Swedish women who leave the parental home younger than the norm run {{a greater risk of}} having their first child sooner after leaving the parental home relative to women of the same age. Swedish men who leave the parental home younger than the norm, on the other hand, run a greater risk of having the first child later after leaving the parental home relative to men of the same age. Swedish men who leave the parental home later than the norm run a greater risk of having their first child sooner after leaving the parental home relative to men of the same age while the opposite is true for women. However, the effects <b>of</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> the parental home are relatively small, which {{can be explained by the}} very long and stable mean durations found. The peak durations of intensities, i. e. number <b>of</b> years between <b>leaving</b> the parental home and having the first child, for men and women can be found after 10 – 12 years. The peak durations of intensities are remarkably similar between the genders.   Conclusion: Swedish women who leave the parental home earlier than the norm are more likely to experience a speed-up effect in terms of childbearing and a slow down effect when leaving the parental home later than the norm. Thus, women stick to breaking the normative <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the life course events once they have started. Swedish men, on the other hand, are more likely to try and catch up with age norms and instead postpone having the first child when leaving the parental home earlier than the norm and speed up having a child when leaving the parental home later than the norm.

40|$|The purple {{sandpipers}} (Calidris maritima) are {{the most}} common waders in the high arctic archipelago of Svalbard, Norway. There they have to cope with a very short summer season and high metabolic costs of migrating far north and breeding in an arctic environment. The food on land is usually scarce, whereas there are rich feeding grounds in the littoral zone, such as in the intertidal zone of river flats. These feeding grounds are though only available to the purple sandpipers during low tide {{and as long as the}} estuary is not covered by sea ice. One of these intertidal flats was used as the fieldwork area in this study. To study when the birds are coming to this intertidal flat for feeding, a count study was performed during the entire stay of the purple sandpipers in Svalbard in summer 2010. Point counts were performed at low tide during 118 different days. Additionally, point counts were performed at twenty days during the six hours of the entire low tide period, to study when during the tidal cycle most sandpipers were feeding at the estuary. Most sandpipers were counted at the intertidal flat at the beginning of June with the highest number, 921 individuals, on 8 th June. When the tundra was free of snow and the birds could start breeding, numbers where rapidly declining with very few sandpipers left in the estuary in July and the first part of August. From the end of August numbers were increasing again with a second but lower peak in the end of September and beginning of October. By the end of October all sandpipers had left the estuary. The study on the appearance of purple sandpipers at the estuary at the different periods of low tide showed that there were significantly more sandpipers between low tide and half an hour later than at the rest of the low tide period. This might be due to better access to their prey at that time. This knowledge could be used in future studies aiming at recording the maximum numbers. The result of the phenologic study could be included in a long term monitoring to see if the numbers and the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> purple sandpipers are stable in this area or not: Are the peak numbers differing significantly? Is the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the arrival, the stay on the tundra and the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> the archipelago in the fall changing?

40|$|Both {{fertility}} and marriage behaviour have changed considerably throughout Western Europe. While fertility has declined {{across the continent}} {{there has been an}} increase in the age of marriage, accompanied by an increase in cohabitation rates and marriage dissolution. These cross-national trends have been suggested to be indicative of a second demographic transition.

However, in this paper we argue that in trying to provide a universal theory to understand the second demographic transition {{it is important not to}} overlook important cross-national differences. Previous comparative research has established that in the South young people tend to marry later, but have children earlier in partnerships. While in the North, marriage and leaving home occur earlier but the link between marriage and childbirth is weaker.

Previous studies of semi-evergreen species found that variation in leaf life span {{was caused by}} variation in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> leaf emergence, <b>Leaves</b> that appeared just before winter over-wintered, while leaves appearing earlier were shed, However, {{it is unclear whether}} <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> the same cohort (i. e., leaves that appear at the same time within a single site) show variation in life span under the effect of strong seasonality.

Using single leaf diagrams, our study revealed that Akebia leaves within a cohort showed substantial variation in life span, with some over-wintering and some not. In addition, leaves on small ramets in the understory showed great variation in life span, while leaves on large ramets, which typically reach higher positions in the forest canopy, have shorter lives, As a result, small ramets were semi-evergreen, whereas large ramets were deciduous, The longer lives <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> on small ramets can be interpreted as a shade-adaptive strategy in understory plants...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the process <b>of</b> {{children}} <b>leaving</b> home and its interactions with the household economy in preindustrial society. A theoretical model <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> home is outlined and then analyzed multivariately, using a longitudinal micro-level dataset for a sample of parishes in western Scania, Sweden, for the period 1829 - 1866. In a first introductory part {{the social and economic}} background as well as the household and family system of the time is analyzed, showing the highly different character of the household, depending on access to land and the type of land farmed. While peasant households functioned both as production and consumption units to a very high extent, landless and semi-landless households mostly worked only as consumption units. The empirical analysis of the age at leaving home for the first time, using event-history analysis, indicates that the household context regarding demand for household labor, the level of family dependency and the individual’s position within the household played important roles in explaining differences between children in the age at leaving home for the first time. Children of landed peasants left home considerably later than children in semi-landless and landless families, which points to the important role played by the family’s productive resources in the demand for household labor and the decision to leave home. First-born children left home later than children of higher birth order, and children in households with more servants stayed at home longer, which shows the role played by the servant institution in complementing family labor in household production. Using new series of local harvest yields and grain prices, the effect of short-term economic fluctuations on the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> home is also analyzed. The general picture that emerges from the analysis is one of great variety, depending on age and sex of the child as well as social status and position in the household. In times of unfavorable market conditions (low prices) more well-to-do peasants seem to have economized on hired labor by keeping particularly their younger sons at home longer. In the landless and semi-landless groups the leaving home response to economic fluctuations generally appears to have been much weaker than for peasants, which is explained by the more compressed and structurally determined leaving home process in these groups. A very large majority of landless and semi-landless children left home around the age of 16, which, together with a rather low demand for younger servants, gave much less opportunity for these families to use leaving home as a strategy of consumption smoothing in times of economic stress. All children, except younger boys, also seem to have been affected by the death of one of their parents. For most children the effect of parental death was disruptive, making children leave the household prematurely. In conclusion, this study underlines both the important role played by the leaving home process in understanding the functioning of the preindustrial household economy, and the highly important role played by the household and family in determining leaving home for individual children...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Tropical oceans play an {{integral}} role in global climate dynamics, yet past tropical hydrologic variability is poorly constrained, as many established climate proxies are {{better suited to}} higher latitudes. Hydrogen isotope ratios (2 H/ 1 H) of leaf waxes are a promising new proxy. Previous field assessments have been conducted in temperate regions or in continental interiors. On tropical coastlines, mangroves are {{a major source of}} organic matter to sediments. Unlike other higher plants, mangroves grow in saline water, which is known to influence 2 H fractionation in algal lipids. In order to use 2 H/ 1 H ratios of leaf lipids in coastal tropical sediments, it was thus necessary to assess salinity's effect on 2 H fractionation in mangroves. In field calibrations of Avicennia marina from subtropical Australia and Rhizophora spp. from Micronesia, salinity strongly affected net 2 H fractionation in mangrove lipids. A unit increase in salinity resulted in an increase of 1. 5 ± 0. 3 / in n-alkane fractionation in A. marina (Chapter 2) and 0. 9 ± 0. 2 / in the Rhizophora biomarker taraxerol (Chapter 4). In the same A. marina n-alkanes, carbon isotope fractionation decreased by 0. 2 ± 0. 05 / PSU- 1 (Chapter 3). 2 H/ 1 H and 18 O/ 16 O ratios of leaf and xylem water from Micronesian Rhizophora and from a 9. 5 -month time series of 3 mangrove species from subtropical Australia were used to investigate mechanisms responsible for the H-isotope response. Salinity does not cause changes in leaf water enrichment. Rather, changes in net 2 H fractionation are best explained by biochemical responses to salinity, such as compatible solute production or increased use of stored carbohydrates, or by the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> production <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> and leaf lipids (Chapters 4 and 5). Mangroves and algae have opposite H isotope responses to salinity. By pairing 2 H/ 1 H ratios of mangrove and algal biomarkers, it is possible to calculate past changes in salinity and water isotopes. Initial applications of this approach to an 800 -year sedimentary record from Palau demonstrate significant drying during the Little Ice Age (~ 1400 - ~ 1800 AD) (Chapter 6) ...|$|R

Conversely, green ash has been considered susceptible to ice damage (Hauer et al. 1993; Sisinni et al. 1995), but the absence <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> on trees {{in the current study}} reduced the probability of snow-induced failure.|$|R
40|$|Endemic {{maternal}} health {{has been a}} major concern in sub-Saharan Africa with Nigeria occupying a position among the countries with the highest maternal and child mortality rates in the world. Although there are numerous studies on {{maternal health}}, there is no consensus on the implications of urban health conditions on safe motherhood. This paper, therefore, examines the influence of working conditions on maternal health in the face of poor provision of amenities and infrastructural decay pervading urban centres in sub-Saharan Africa using Nigeria as a case study. The study specifically investigated the plight of women in Lagos State, Nigeria. The data for the study were obtained from a survey conducted between 2011 and 2012 using a structured questionnaire and key informant interviews. Issues relating to working conditions were measured by the nature of work, time for rest, means of transportation, duration and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> maternity <b>leave,</b> relationship with boss and a host of others. The data ware analysed using univariate and binary logistic regression analysis. The findings show that socio-environmental conditions including poverty, inefficient transportation system, gender bias, work stress and poor quality of life expose a large proportion of women to morbidities, poor nutrition and repeated pregnancies that can increase maternal mortality in the study area. The paper concludes that adverse working condition is positively related to maternal health complications and this calls for urgent policy intervention to address work related pressures on potential mothers. The authors suggest that employers of labour must develop humane health-friendly policies in the work place that favour maternal well-being before, during and after pregnancy.

40|$|This {{model is}} the first to solve for the optimal <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> {{childbirth}} and number of children in a continuous time framework simultaneously. The model depicts how changes in wage at different stages of an individual 2 ̆ 019 s life influence the <b>timing</b> decision <b>of</b> childbirth and the optimal number of children. When a woman wants to have more children, she decides to have them at a younger age. Medical research that extends the fecund life span induces women to have fewer children. A reduction <b>of</b> the parental <b>leave</b> due to daycare centers or a reduction in the costs <b>of</b> <b>leave</b> due to child benefits increase the number of children. Women value labour more, when they face the risk of an unknown divorce. This paper also shows that divorce does not change the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> childbirth directly, it influences the number of children negatively and the reduced number of children delays the timing. The model can be used to predict upper bound fertility rates, when the expected divorce rate continues to increase...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{clearing}} of floodplain forests potentially reduces {{organic matter}} available to floodplain wetlands. Furthermore, on rivers regulated to provide irrigation water in summer, floodplain wetlands {{that were previously}} inundated in spring, now flood in summer/autumn. In the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia, this has changed the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> organic matter entering the aquatic phase, since leaf fall peaks in summer. Field surveys and mesocosm experiments on floodplain wetlands on the River Murray revealed faster processing rates <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> in summer/autumn than spring, and no difference between cleared and forested wetlands. Temperature and leaf carbon : nitrogen ratio could not explain these differences, and instead, changes to leaf chemistry associated with ‘terrestrial ageing’ between peak leaf fall in summer and inundation in spring is more likely. The {{results indicated that the}} reduction of input of organic matter through riparian tree clearing and changing the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> inundation interact to alter organic-matter standing stocks and rates of decomposition in floodplain wetlands. Restoring both natural <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> high flows and riparian vegetation might be required for recovery of these wetlands. <br /...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we aim to study how Dutch children’s {{individual}} destinies result from the complex interplay of family setting and local conditions in a rural environment. We focus on their final move from the parental home, and we will analyse not only <b>timing</b> and incidence <b>of</b> <b>leaving,</b> but also the destinations. To do this, we propose a multi-level competing risk analysis of migration destinations. We focus on two groups: the children of farmers and those of rural workers. Dutch farmers and workers differ {{in the type of}} family economy in which children were integrated, and contrasting them will allow us to explain the speed, the directions, and the individual and family backgrounds of the process <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> agriculture. We make use of the Historical Sample of the Netherlands to analyse last migrations of 8, 338 children of farmers and rural workers. As we cover the entire country, we can study the full impact of regional differences on type of agriculture and inheritance, in combination with the family composition. Our results indicate significant effects of specialised versus traditional, mixed farming on the migration behaviour of farmers’ and rural workers’ children, as well as the importance of the number of siblings of the same sex and birth order. The variations in the effects of the sibship among regions with different agricultural systems demonstrate the importance of gender-specific divisions <b>of</b> labour on <b>leaving</b> home. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a systemic functional description of English discursive resources for representing and regulating the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> social practices. Four key categories are distinguished: the time summons, which imposes timing on social activities by decree; social synchronisation, {{in which the}} <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> social activities is synchronised with the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> other social activities; natural synchronisation, in which the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> social activities is synchronised with the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> natural events; and mechanical synchronisation, in which the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> social activities is synchronised with the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> artificially created events. A number of more delicate categories and other aspects <b>of</b> <b>timing</b> are discussed, together with their realisations. Two texts are analysed {{to demonstrate the utility}} of this descriptive framework for the critical discourse analysis of texts in which the management of time is a key issue...|$|R
40|$|A {{priority}} for the field vegetable grower {{is to be able}} to schedule a regular supply of product throughout the growing season. This requires a predictive framework, based on the identification of key developmental events of the crop, and an understanding of how genotypic and environmental factors interact to determine plant development. Four globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus) cultivars, representing the existing phenological range, were grown in a field experiment, and a range of environmental conditions was imposed by varying both the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the first irrigation (which determines the initiation of regrowth) and by repeating the experiment across two locations and 2 years. The <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the appearance of the main stem capitulum was sensitive to both the growing environment and the cultivar. These differences persisted till flowering and were correlated with final leaf number. As the plant developed, the phyllochron decreased, resulting in three values of phyllochron, each of which was responsive to genotype, and hardly to environment. The <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the first change in phyllochron was associated with the final leaf number and the appearance of the capitulum. For all the cultivars, the rate of development fell and the final leaf number increased as the length of the photoperiod increased. The later flowering cultivars shared a similar vernalisation requirement, but 'Spinoso sardo' did not require a cold period to flower. Leaf length reached a peak before the beginning of stem elongation, and maximum leaf length was correlated with final leaf number. The sensitiveness of the phyllochron to the genotype, and of the number <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> and the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the appearance of the capitulum to both genotype and environment makes them suitable as variables in developmental models. The importance of the final number <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> is not only because of its phenological significance, but also because of its effect on the ability of the canopy to intercept radiation...|$|R

40|$|Factors that {{influence}} the longevity and senescence of photosynthetic tissues of Arabidopsis were investigated. To {{determine the influence of}} reproductive development on the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> somatic tissue senescence, the longevity <b>of</b> rosette <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> the Landsberg erecta strain and of isogenic mutant lines in which flowering is delayed (co- 2) or sterile flowers are produced (ms 1 - 1) were compared. No difference in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> senescence <b>of</b> individual <b>leaves</b> was observed between these lines, indicating that somatic tissue longevity is not governed by reproductive development in this species. To examine the role of differential gene expression in the process of leaf senescence, cDNA clones representing genes that are differentially expressed in senescing tissues were isolated. Sequence analysis of one such clone indicated homology to previously cloned cysteine proteinases, which is consistent with a role for the product of this gene in nitrogen salvage. RNA gel blot analysis revealed that increased expression of senescence-associated genes is preceded by declines in photosynthesis and in the expression of photosynthesis-associated genes. A model is presented in which it is postulated that leaf senescence is triggered by age-related declines in photosynthetic processes...|$|R
