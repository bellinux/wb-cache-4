40|$|In {{the centuries}} of {{conflict}} between the Ottoman Empire and various European states, polemical manuscripts, pamphlets and books on Turkish topics were common in Europe. Some texts reappeared at intervals, adapted to different circumstances. A certain category consisted of texts that were allegedly written by the Ottoman sultan himself. This paper deals with one such text, which proclaims to be an instruction from the sultan to his subjects on ceremonies and processions to be performed in order <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>Allah.</b> Variations of this text appeared in 1686 – 87, 1697 – 98 and 1716 – 17, in manuscripts and printed pamphlets in different languages. It was translated into Russian twice: in 1697 and 1716. The 1697 translation was only recently discovered among documents from Peter I’s Grand Embassy. This paper examines the textual relationships between the versions that appeared in different decades and their historical contexts, and contains an edition of the previously unpublished 1697 Russian translation...|$|E
40|$|Muslim {{consumers}} purchase halal foods {{as a way}} {{of maintaining}} observance of religious teachings and from personal preferences. Consumption of halal products shows a person’s commitment to the Islamic faith and its teachings. This study however recognizes that declaring the intention to purchase halal foods based on this commitment is not a guarantee one will purchase and consume halal. Purchase and consumption is a result of personal perceptions of halal foods. New Zealand is home to approximately 41, 000 Muslims who form the internal halal market as opposed to the export halal market. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the attitudes and perceptions of Muslim consumers in New Zealand toward purchase of halal foods. The study sought to determine whether attitudes and perceptions toward halal foods play a significant role in purchase or whether religion is the overriding factor. The study followed a mixed methods approach using qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. The qualitative data collection technique was three focus group discussions, with a sample of 15 men aged 20 years and over. The participants came from Auckland, Wellington, and Dunedin, which are three cities with large Muslim populations. The quantitative technique was survey with a sample of 80 male and female aged 20 years and over from the three cities mentioned Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin. Data analysis was completed using two computer software, NVIVO for qualitative data and SPSS for quantitative data. The research findings show factors that affect consumer attitudes and perceptions toward the purchase of halal food products, namely religious commitment and social pressure. Other important factors are the need <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>Allah,</b> getting approval from family and personal choice. Religious commitment and social pressure emerged as the overriding factors, with almost equal importance. The study also tested awareness and perception of halal food regulation showing that consumers belief halal products in New Zealand are halal, although a gap exists in behaviour of internal halal regulation compared to regulation of foods produced for the export market. From the findings, it is concluded that consumer attitudes and perceptions toward halal foods affect their purchase behavior and consumption. However, the study shows the need to understand in greater depth the role of religion versus social pressure. The study shows an almost equal level of importance but does not provide a clear distinction of which factor carries more impact on consumer behavior. Therefore, the study recommends a need for more research comparing these two factors. The findings have implications for marketing practice especially because the Muslim population is targeted to continue growing, which will create a larger halal market in New Zealand. The study provides elements that markets need to consider when promoting purchase of halal foods. These elements are food safety, endorsement from FIANZ, and consumer knowledge of the internal halal market and its regulation. To influence consumers, marketers need to understand the roles played by social pressure religious commitment, and the interplay with other elements including a need to commit to family beliefs, awareness of food regulation, and beliefs about food...|$|E
5000|$|Al-wala' wa-l-bara' [...] (...) is an Arabic term in Islam, meaning [...] "loyalty and disavowal". It signifies {{loving and}} hating {{for the sake}} of Allah. [...] Al-wala' wa-l-bara' is {{referred}} to as holding fast to all that is <b>pleasing</b> <b>to</b> <b>Allah,</b> and withdrawing from and opposing all that is displeasing to Allah; namely the Kafirs (non-muslims) who are to be hated, {{for the sake of}} Allah. This is for their calling towards something other than submission to Allah, whether on purpose or by nature of disbelief. Muslims cannot befriend or love disbelievers. Loving for the sake of Allah means to love Allah and to show loyalty to Him by following His Shariah. It means to love all that is good and permissible in the Quran and Sunnah. This type of love requires one to defend Allah's deen and to preserve it. It is to love those who are obedient to Allah and to defend and assist them. Hating for the sake of Allah signifies showing anger towards those who oppose Allah, His Messenger, His deen, and the believers. It is to struggle and fight against them in order to uphold and spread the way of Allah and His Messenger.|$|R

40|$|To the teleological {{ethics of}} Islamist {{terrorism}} (whose main author was the philosopher Sayyid Qutb, who was, in turn, {{inspired by the}} ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood and the reflections of Ibn Taymiyya and Abul alla Maududi) the ultimate goal in a person’s life is <b>to</b> <b>please</b> <b>Allah,</b> and the main means to obtaining this goal is the full application of sharia or God’s law. &# 13; This full application of sharia, which shapes a true Muslim’s life, supposedly only took place between the years 622 and 660, during the period of the Prophet and the first four caliphs (the so-called «Pious Predecessors» or «Salaf»). Islamist terrorism’s ethics, then, foreshadow a regressive utopia featuring as enemies both infidels (the distant enemy) and apostates (the close enemy). &# 13; The internalization of the principles of this ethical code and, in general, of the central ideas that form its basis (the so-called «Qutbism», which is derived from the name of its main representative, Sayyid Qutb) correlates with certain cognitive, emotional and behavioural distortions presented by terrorists, specifically: feeling like and perceiving themselves as soldiers belonging to a vanguard (taliah) of true Muslims fulfilling the religious duty (the divine man-date) of fighting those that through their ideas and practices contribute to the degradation of Islam’s -values as outlined in the sacred texts. To the soldiers of the vanguard it is a just war because, even though it may look like an offensive war, in reality it is waged in defense of true Islam, which is threatened in its very essence by apostates and unbelievers. Therefore, it is believed that the alleged victims of Islamist Terrorism are actually aggressors of a lifestyle as lofty as the authentic Muslim. La ética teleológica del terrorismo islamista (obra principalmente del filósofo Sayyid Qutb, que hunde sus raíces, a su vez, en la ideología de los Hermanos Musulmanes y en las reflexiones de Ibn Taymiyya y Abul alla Maududi) fija como meta suprema de la vida del hombre la complacencia de Allah y como medio principal para alcanzar esta meta la aplicación plena de la sharía o legislación divina. &# 13; Se sustenta que esta aplicación, que configura la forma de vida del musulmán auténtico, sólo se realizó de forma adecuada entre el año 622 y el 660, en tiempos del Profeta y los primeros cuatro califas (los llamados «píos antepasados» o «salaf»). De modo que la ética del terrorismo islamista prefigura como futuro una utopía regresiva, para la que fijan ahora como enemigos tanto a los infieles (el enemigo lejano) como a los apóstatas (el enemigo cercano). &# 13; La interiorización de los principios de esta ética y, en general, de las ideas vertebradoras de la filosofía que constituye la base del terrorismo islamista (el denominado «qutbismo», del nombre de su principal representante, Sayyid Qutb) correlaciona con distorsiones cognitivas, emocionales y comportamentales que presentan los terroristas, en particular: percibirse y sentirse como soldados perte-necientes a una vanguardia de musulmanes auténticos, que cumplen con el deber religioso (el mandato divino) de combatir a quienes contribuyen con sus ideas y prácticas a la degradación de los valores del Islam, tal como se fijan en los textos sagrados. Se trata, consideran, de una guerra justa, porque, aun cuando tenga la apariencia de ofensiva, los soldados de la vanguardia la llevan a cabo en defensa del auténtico Islam, amenazado en su esencia por apóstatas e infieles. A sus aparentes víctimas, concluyen, habría que verlas, pues, como lo que realmente son: los verdugos de una forma de vida tan excelsa como la auténticamente musulmana...|$|E
