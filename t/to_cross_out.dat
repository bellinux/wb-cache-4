2500|$|The name The Salvation Army {{developed}} from {{an incident in}} May 1878. William Booth was dictating {{a letter to his}} secretary George Scott Railton and said, [...] "We are a volunteer army." [...] Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, [...] "Volunteer, I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!" [...] Railton was instructed <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> the word [...] "volunteer" [...] and substitute the word [...] "salvation". The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in [...] "God's Army" [...] would wear the Army's own uniform, 'putting on the armour,' for meetings and ministry work. He became the [...] "General" [...] and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as [...] "officers". Other members became [...] "soldiers".|$|E

[...] What she {{suffered}} she shook off [...] In the sunshine; what she sinned [...] She could pray on high, enough [...] To keep safe above the wind. [...] If reproved by God or you, [...] 'T was to better her, she knew; [...] And if crossed, she gathered still [...] 'T was <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> something ill.|$|E
6000|$|The scene now {{changes to}} the {{newspaper}} office. The writer of the article has discovered his mistake and wants to correct it by the next day: {{but the next day}} is Sunday. He cannot post a letter, so he rings up the paper and dictates a letter by telephone. He leaves the title to his friends at the other end; he knows that they can spell [...] "Gray," [...] as no doubt they can: but the letter is put down by journalistic custom in a pencil scribble and the vowel may well be doubtful. The friend writes {{at the top of the}} letter [...] "'G. K. C.' Explains," [...] putting the initials in quotation marks. The next man passing it for press is bored with these initials (I am with him there) and crosses them out, substituting with austere civility, [...] "Mr. Chesterton Explains." [...] But and now he hears the iron laughter of the Fates, for the blind bolt is about to fall&mdash;but he neglects <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> the second [...] "quote" [...] (as we call it) and it goes up to press with a [...] "quote" [...] between the last words. Another quotation mark at the end of [...] "explains" [...] was the work of one merry moment for the printers upstairs. So the inverted commas were lifted entirely off one word on to the other and a totally innocent title suddenly turned into a blasting sneer. But that would have mattered nothing so far, for there was nothing to sneer at. In the same dark hour, however, there was a printer who was (I suppose) so devoted to this Government that he could think of no Gray but Sir Edward Grey. He spelt it [...] "Grey" [...] by a mere misprint, and the whole tale was complete: first blunder, second blunder, and final condemnation.|$|E
5000|$|The dot-above diacritic, {{called a}} [...] or [...] (often {{shortened}} to [...] ), {{derives from the}} punctum delens used in medieval manuscripts to indicate deletion, similar <b>to</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>out</b> unwanted words in handwriting today. From this usage {{it was used to}} indicate the lenition of s (from [...] to [...] ) and f (from [...] to zero) in Old Irish texts.|$|R

500|$|Peggy meets Ted Chaough from Cutler Gleason and Chaough {{to discuss}} job {{opportunities}} and he praises her work. She writes her job requirements, [...] "Copy Chief $18,000/year", {{on a piece}} of paper and slides it across the table <b>to</b> him. Chaough <b>crosses</b> <b>out</b> $18,000 and writes $19,000.|$|R
50|$|Baroud thus {{issued a}} {{circular}} in February 2009 decreeing that every Lebanese citizen was now free <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> his/her religious identity from all official documents, {{and replace it}} with a slash sign (/) if they desire.|$|E
50|$|The test {{consisted}} of a list of words. A subject was instructed <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> the words on this list that they felt had unpleasant meanings. It was meant to measure strength and content of emotional responses.|$|E
5000|$|Let's {{see what}} happens if x < y. In that case, {{there will not be}} a [...] "1" [...] digit <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> after the {{addition}} since [...] will be less than [...] For example, (in decimal): ...|$|E
25|$|Pilots flying along or {{near the}} border were under orders not <b>to</b> <b>cross.</b> But they often got lost and strayed into Mexico. At times they went over deliberately, {{apparently}} {{on the spur of}} the moment. Occasionally, they <b>crossed</b> <b>to</b> carry <b>out</b> a special assignment.|$|R
5000|$|Tchaikovsky {{had written}} [...] "End of {{movement}} 1" [...] {{on the last}} page of the Allegro de concert. However, {{when he decided to}} publish only that movement, he apparently omitted <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> this <b>out.</b> This has caused some speculation about his true intentions, for example, whether he might have eventually expanded the concerto to a full three-movement work, or used the other movements in some other form, had he not died.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{stories are}} {{associated}} locally with the ruins, including one about {{a soldier who}} entered the [...] "Black Hole" [...] under an archway with his dog; only the dog returned. In another, a man who attempted <b>to</b> take the <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> of the old chancel had his brains dashed out.|$|R
50|$|A {{neuropsychological test}} {{used in the}} {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer’s disease.The subject gets one of more digits s/he has <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> {{from a list of}} numbers. The resulting score consists of the correctly crossed out numbers minus the incorrectly crossed out numbers.|$|E
5000|$|During the Sinestro Corps {{invasion}} of Earth, Superboy-Prime's first act was {{to visit and}} defile Bart's grave which was inscribed [...] "Bart Allen: The Flash". Superboy-Prime used his heat vision <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> [...] "The Fastest Man Alive" [...] and write in its place [...] "stupidest boy dead".|$|E
5000|$|Voting was {{voluntary}} throughout Australia and candidates were elected by a [...] "first past the post" [...] voting system. In South Australia, voters {{were required to}} mark the box opposite their preferred candidates, while in other states voters were required <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> the names of non-preferred candidates.|$|E
50|$|Only {{people with}} Palestinian ID, or foreign nationals, by exception, in certain categories, subject to Israeli oversight, were {{permitted}} <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> in and <b>out.</b> The PA should notify the Israeli authorities 48 hours {{in advance of}} the crossing of a person in the excepted categories.|$|R
50|$|Marianne is a {{young girl}} who is {{bedridden}} with a long-term illness. She draws a picture to fill her time, and finds that she spends her dreams within the picture she has drawn. As time goes by, she becomes sicker, and starts to spend {{more and more time}} trapped within her fantasy world, and her attempts to make things better by adding <b>to</b> and <b>crossing</b> <b>out</b> things in the drawing make things progressively worse. Her only companion in her dreamworld is a boy called Mark, who is also a long-term invalid in the real world.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, if a {{restraining}} clause {{is found to}} be unreasonable, then it will be void. In certain circumstances though the court may uphold it either by construing ambiguities or by severance. Severance consists of the application of {{what is known as the}} [...] "blue pencil test"; if individual words which make the clause excessively wide are able <b>to</b> be <b>crossed</b> <b>out</b> and the clause still makes grammatical sense, without altering the nature of the obligations, then the courts may be willing to sever the illegal aspects of the clause and enforce the remainder.|$|R
50|$|The {{list system}} used was made flexible, as voters were able <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> candidates' names {{and replace them}} with names from other lists. However, only 26.03% of voters made any changes to the lists. To {{register}} a list for the election parties needed only collect 100 signatures. A total of 141 lists were registered, although only 93 competed.|$|E
50|$|After Ryan Girdler {{had scored}} a try to level at 16-all which {{appeared}} to have included two knock-ons in the lead up, a furious Gorden Tallis confronted Bill Harrigan and was immediately dismissed after calling him a cheat. Six minutes later the Blues {{took advantage of the}} extra man for David Peachey <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> wide and secure a 20-16 win.|$|E
50|$|Nippleus Erectus was {{a drummer}} of Gwar (played by former White Cross member Rob Mosby), who {{did all the}} {{drumming}} for Hell-O. He is also credited for the drums on Scumdogs of the Universe, though it was Jizmak Da Gusha who played them. When Jizmak signs the Scumdogs album, he is known <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> the picture of Nippleus as well.|$|E
50|$|Object {{cancellation}} {{tasks are}} also {{used to determine the}} extent of potential deficit. During this task, patients are required <b>to</b> cancel <b>out</b> (<b>cross</b> <b>out)</b> all of the objects in a cluttered display (e.g. lines, geometric shapes, letters, etc.). Patients with damage primarily to the right parietal area fail in the detection of objects in the left visuospatial field, and these are often not <b>crossed</b> <b>out</b> by the patient. In addition, those patients who may be severely affected tend to fail in detecting their errors on visual inspection.|$|R
50|$|On 27 July 2014, Chris Cross was the last-ever act {{to perform}} at the {{original}} Spanish City Dome in Whitley Bay, before builders went underway with the re-developments. The Dome was a venue for many Entertainers and Bands over the last century, including The Animals. It was {{the inspiration for the}} Dire Straits Song Romeo & Juliet. Alan Clark (Keyboardist) even sent a message <b>to</b> <b>Cross</b> <b>to</b> read <b>out</b> on the evening of the last show.One year later, in 2015, an inflatable dome venue was inflated next to the actual dome to stage The Under the Dome Festival 2015 and Cross was the closing act here too.|$|R
5000|$|The {{manuscript}} {{appears to}} be the work of a single scribe. It is not work of a professional copyist but of a secretarial hand, consistent in its use of italics. Based on the idiosyncratic natures of letters such as [...] "e", [...] "r" [...] and [...] "c," [...] Cutts attributes an Italian influence to the scribe. An unusual attribute of this scribe is that he tends to write v for u, resulting in words such as [...] "thov" [...] (thou). The calligraphy is difficult due <b>to</b> many <b>cross</b> <b>outs</b> and obscuring of letters due to an unsharpened quill and smudging.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "blooper" [...] {{originates}} from wartime censorship, and {{is short}} for [...] "Blue Pencil" [...] - which was used <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> unacceptable parts of documents and letters by the [...] "blue-person". Jonathan Hewat {{was the first person}} in the UK to broadcast radio bloopers, on a Bank Holiday Show on BBC Radio Bristol {{at the end of the}} 1980s.|$|E

50|$|For the {{elections}} {{the country was}} divided into five constituencies, electing a total of 100 MPs using proportional representation. The list system used was made flexible, as voters were able <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> candidates' names {{and replace them with}} names from other lists, a system 35% of voters took advantage of. Although 103 lists registered for the election, the number of competing lists dropped from 66 to 46.|$|E
25|$|Third Feng Chang-hai Subjugation (September 1932): A {{force of}} 7,000 {{men of the}} Jilin Guard Army {{attacked}} 10,000 bandits who were retreating from their earlier defeat in July. They were attempting <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> the border <b>out</b> of Manchukuo into the Chinese province of Jehol. Although they were surrounded, {{the majority of the}} bandits were able to escape.|$|R
50|$|Barnes became {{noted for}} his assured {{performances}} at left-back, with his tidy distribution and effortless ability <b>to</b> cut <b>out</b> <b>crosses.</b> He soon found a regular {{place in the}} Arsenal side, and was part of their First Division Championship-winning side of 1947-48.|$|R
6000|$|Especially may this {{be said to}} be {{the case}} in a cold, raw night in November, when mankind has a {{tendency}} <b>to</b> become chronically <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> of doors, and nature, generally, looks lugubrious; for, just in proportion as the exterior world grows miserably chill, the world [...] "at home," [...] with its blazing gas, its drawn curtains, its crackling fires, and its beaming smiles, becomes doubly comfortable and cosy.|$|R
50|$|The 1870 US Census {{listed the}} area as the {{township}} of Azusa - El Monte Township and 1880 US Census listed {{the area as}} the township of San Josi and Azusa. There were a few corrections <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> the San Josi name {{on most of the}} census pages, but this was done sporadically and there remain many index errors in the online census due to these errors.|$|E
50|$|The {{list system}} used was made flexible, as voters were able <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> candidates' names {{and replace them}} with names from other lists. However, only 19.97% of voters made any changes to the lists. To {{register}} a list for the election parties needed only collect 100 signatures. A total of 88 lists registered, but only 43 contested the election. There was no voter roll, but instead passports were used to identify voters.|$|E
50|$|The {{test has}} been used in the {{evaluation}} of stroke where subjects were instructed <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>out</b> all groups of 4 dots on an A4 paper. The numbers of uncrossed groups of 4 dots, groups of dots other than 4 crossed, and the time spent (maximum, 15 minutes) were taken into account. The Group-Bourdon test, a modification of the Bourdon-Wiersma, is {{one of a number of}} psychometric tests which trainee train drivers in the UK are required to pass.|$|E
50|$|Lazarus Saturday {{is the day}} when, traditionally, hermits {{would leave}} their retreats in the {{wilderness}} {{to return to the}} monastery for the Holy Week services. In many places in the Russian Church, the vestments and church hangings on this day and on Palm Sunday are green, denoting the renewal of life. In the Greek Church, it is customary on Lazarus Saturday <b>to</b> plait elaborate <b>crosses</b> <b>out</b> of palm leaves which will be used on Palm Sunday.|$|R

5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} thoughts, {{and was soon}} writing to the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham's protégé, and {{that the old man}} resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. He is said <b>to</b> have <b>crossed</b> <b>out</b> all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the Discovery expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|R
