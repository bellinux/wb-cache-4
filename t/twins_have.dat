5|$|Of the 68 players picked in {{the first}} round by Minnesota, 30 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 22 of these were right-handed, while 8 were left-handed. Twelve outfielders were selected, while eleven shortstops, seven third basemen, four catchers, three first basemen and one player at second base were taken as well. Thirteen of the players came from high schools or {{universities}} in the state of California, and Florida follows with nine players. The <b>Twins</b> <b>have</b> drafted six players from Arizona, including five players from Arizona State University.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Twins</b> <b>have</b> made 16 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of}} the draft and have made the first overall selection twice (1983 and 2001). They have also had 18 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The <b>Twins</b> <b>have</b> six times failed to sign their first-round pick. Eddie Leon (1965), Dick Ruthven (1972), Jamie Allen (1976), and Tim Belcher (1983) all failed to sign with the Twins without the team receiving compensation. The Twins did, however, receive a compensatory pick when they failed to sign Jason Varitek (1993). Varitek did not sign and instead chose to enter the draft again the following year and was taken by the Seattle Mariners. Additionally, Travis Lee, the Twins' only selection in 1996 and the second-overall pick of that draft, did not sign with the team. Lee's agent, Scott Boras, did not communicate with the Twins for the first two weeks after the draft and then invoked a rarely used rule that a team was required to make a contract offer within 15 days of the draft or relinquish their rights to the player. As a result, Lee and 3 other 1996 first-round picks who were Boras clients were granted free agency and he ultimately signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
25|$|For example, a {{group of}} 10 <b>twins</b> <b>have</b> been pre-selected to have one {{affected}} member (of the pair). During {{the course of the}} study four other previously non-affected members become affected, giving a pairwise concordance of 4/(4+6) or 4/10 or 40%.|$|E

50|$|In January 2002, Deirdre Conroy was 39, {{the mother}} of two boys aged 10 and 12, and expecting twins. At 14 weeks pregnant, the initial results of an {{amniocentesis}} test revealed one of the <b>twins</b> <b>had</b> died. Three weeks later, full test results revealed the second <b>twin</b> <b>had</b> Edwards syndrome, a condition which usually ends in miscarriage or death shortly after birth because of heart abnormalities, kidney malformations, and other internal organ disorders.|$|R

25|$|Women {{who have}} a family history of fraternal <b>twins</b> <b>have</b> a higher chance of {{producing}} fraternal twins themselves, as there is a genetically linked tendency to hyper-ovulate. There is no known genetic link for identical twinning. Other factors that increase the odds of having fraternal twins include maternal age, fertility drugs and other fertility treatments, nutrition, and prior births.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause of}} {{difference}} between monozygotic twins is epigenetic modification, caused by differing environmental influences throughout their lives. Epigenetics refers {{to the level of}} activity of any particular gene. A gene may become switched on, switched off, or could become partially switched on or off in an individual. This epigenetic modification is triggered by environmental events. Monozygotic twins can have markedly different epigenetic profiles. A study of 80 pairs of monozygotic twins ranging in age from three to 74 showed that the youngest <b>twins</b> <b>have</b> relatively few epigenetic differences. The number of epigenetic differences increases with age. Fifty-year-old twins had over three times the epigenetic difference of three-year-old twins. Twins who had spent their lives apart (such as those adopted by two different sets of parents at birth) had the greatest difference. However, certain characteristics become more alike as twins age, such as IQ and personality.|$|E
25|$|Twinning is the intergrowth {{of two or}} more crystal of {{a single}} mineral species. The {{geometry}} of the twinning is controlled by the mineral's symmetry. As a result, there are several types of twins, including contact twins, reticulated twins, geniculated twins, penetration twins, cyclic twins, and polysynthetic twins. Contact, or simple twins, consist of two crystals joined at a plane; this type of twinning is common in spinel. Reticulated twins, common in rutile, are interlocking crystals resembling netting. Geniculated <b>twins</b> <b>have</b> a bend in the middle that is caused by start of the twin. Penetration twins consist of two single crystals that have grown into each other; examples of this twinning include cross-shaped staurolite twins and Carlsbad twinning in orthoclase. Cyclic twins are caused by repeated twinning around a rotation axis. It occurs around three, four, five, six, or eight-fold axes, and the corresponding patterns are called threelings, fourlings, fivelings, sixlings, and eightlings. Sixlings are common in aragonite. Polysynthetic twins are similar to cyclic twinning by the presence of repetitive twinning; however, instead of occurring around a rotational axis, it occurs along parallel planes, usually on a microscopic scale.|$|E

25|$|Arriving in Britain, the {{location}} of the second meeting, the Americans have brought the Killing Stone of the Maya, recovered from Mexico; Vulture brings one of the pillars, from the treasury of his family, the Royal House of Saud; and a representative of the British Royal Family, Iolanthe Compton-Jones, brings the pillar kept by her family. The pillars are cloudy diamond bricks with a liquid-filled void in the centre. After being 'cleansed' by the Philosopher's Stone, the pillars become clear and the liquid silver. It is also discovered that the pillars' markings reveal Iolanthe's as the fourth, and Vulture's as the first. The Killing Stone of the Maya is united with the Firestone, and it reveals the dates by which the pillars must be laid - the first on the next day, and the second some seven days later. The Adamson <b>twins</b> <b>have</b> correlated the data from Stonehenge, and found that the first Vertex is underneath Lake Nasser in Egypt, close to Abu Simbel. The team starts out, accompanied by Astro and Iolanthe, leaving the Adamson twins with Tank to continue their calculations and find the other Vertices.|$|E
500|$|The Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota <b>Twins</b> <b>have</b> {{played in}} the state since 1961. The Vikings were an NFL {{expansion}} team, and the Twins were formed when the Washington Senators relocated to Minnesota. The <b>Twins</b> <b>have</b> won 10 division titles (1969, 1970, 1987, 1991, 2002–04, 2006, 2009, and 2010), 3 American League Pennants (1965, 1987 and 1991) and the World Series in 1987 and 1991. The <b>Twins</b> <b>have</b> played at Target Field since 2010. [...] The Vikings have {{played in the}} Super Bowl following the 1969, 1973, 1974, and 1976 seasons (Super Bowl IV, Super Bowl VIII, Super Bowl IX, and Super Bowl XI, respectively), losing all four games.|$|E
500|$|The Minnesota Twins are a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} Minneapolis, Minnesota. They {{play in the}} American League Central division.

Officially known as the [...] "First-Year Player Draft", the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur clubs to its franchises. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick. In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the reasons}} this bat is in so much danger is its slow {{reproduction}} rate. The Eastern small-footed bat usually has only one offspring a year, although a few instances of <b>twins</b> <b>have</b> been noted. Mating most often occurs in autumn and the female stores the male’s sperm throughout hibernation in the winter. Fertilization occurs in the spring once the females are active again, and gestation occurs between 50–60 days with young being born in late May and early June. Mating has also been noted to occur throughout the hibernation period if individuals awake. [...] During the time of breeding large number of bats {{come together in a}} behavior commonly known as “swarming.” All bats of this species are polyandrous, meaning they mate with multiple partners throughout the mating period. This mating behavior allows them to increase the likelihood of copulation, and therefore increase their reproductive success.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to general skepticism among gynecologists, sexologists {{and other researchers}} that the G-spot exists, a team at King's College London in late 2009 suggested that its existence is subjective. They acquired the largest sample size of women to date – 1,800 – who are pairs of twins, {{and found that the}} twins did not report a similar G-spot in their questionnaires. The research, headed by Tim Spector, documents a 15-year study of the twins, identical and non-identical. Identical twins share genes, while non-identical pairs share 50% of theirs. According to the researchers, if one identical twin reported having a G-spot, it was more likely that the other would too, but this pattern did not materialize. Study co-author Andrea Burri believes: [...] "It is rather irresponsible to claim the existence of an entity that has never been proven and pressurise women and men too." [...] She stated {{that one of the reasons}} for the research was to remove feelings of [...] "inadequacy or underachievement" [...] for women who feared they lacked a G-spot. Researcher Beverly Whipple dismissed the findings, commenting that <b>twins</b> <b>have</b> different sexual partners and techniques, and that the study did not properly account for lesbian or bisexual women.|$|E
