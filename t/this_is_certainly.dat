5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Anita Shapira, {{there is}} a gap, at times quite wide, between the 'facts established by historical research' {{and the image of}} the battle as retained in collective memory. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the case for the battle of Latrun, which has become, in Israel, a founding myth.|$|E
5|$|Different {{camouflage}} methods {{employed by}} terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic animals, and in military usage, are compared in the table. Several methods are often combined, so {{for example the}} Bushbuck is both countershaded over its whole body, and disruptively coloured with small pale spots. Until the discovery of countershading in the 1890s, protective coloration {{was considered to be}} mainly a matter of colour matching, but while <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> important, a variety of other methods are used to provide effective camouflage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions would be completely determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E

25|$|Religious scriptures {{suggest that}} the Llü-bu were female shamans who practised divination, exorcism, and other rites in a trance. By the early nineteenth century, the Dongba priests had created a huge {{religious}} vocabulary accompanied {{by a variety of}} rituals, and had largely displaced the Llü-bu. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the case with Yi shamans, but the connection to dongba practices remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Infertility {{is often}} {{described}} as a characteristic of A-T. Whereas <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the case for the mouse model of A-T, in humans it may be more accurate to characterize the reproductive abnormality as gonadal atrophy or dysgenesis characterized by delayed pubertal development. Because programmed DSBs are generated to initiate genetic recombinations involved in the production of sperm and eggs in reproductive organs (a process known as meiosis), meiotic defects and arrest can occur when ATM is not present.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the neural}} {{connections}} of the receptors, the optical system is an equally {{key player in}} retinal resolution. In the ideal eye, {{the image of a}} diffraction grating can subtend 0.5 micrometre on the retina. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not the case, however, and furthermore the pupil can cause diffraction of the light. Thus, black lines on a grating will be mixed with the intervening white lines to make a gray appearance. Defective optical issues (such as uncorrected myopia) can render it worse, but suitable lenses can help. Images (such as gratings) can be sharpened by lateral inhibition, i.e., more highly excited cells inhibiting the less excited cells. A similar reaction is in the case of chromatic aberrations, in which the color fringes around black-and-white objects are inhibited similarly.|$|E

25|$|Because the P-array is 576 bits long, {{and the key}} bytes are XORed {{through all}} these 576 bits during the initialization, many {{implementations}} support key sizes up to 576 bits. While <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> possible, the 448 bits limit is here to ensure that every bit of every subkey depends on every bit of the key, as the last four values of the P-array don't affect every bit of the ciphertext. This point should be taken in consideration for implementations with a different number of rounds, as even though it increases security against an exhaustive attack, it weakens the security guaranteed by the algorithm. And given the slow initialization of the cipher with each change of key, it is granted a natural protection against brute-force attacks, which doesn't really justify key sizes longer than 448 bits.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> {{not entirely}} true. Gerard cannot have spent much, if {{any time in}} prison, as he was {{appointed}} permanent counsel by the City of London in October 1554, and represented Wigan in the English parliament {{for the third time}} in 1555. Nor can he have incurred the wrath of Mary, as he was made a Serjeant-at-law, one of a small and extremely powerful group of barristers with exclusive rights to work in the Court of Common Pleas towards the end of her reign - an appointment that lapsed on her death. He was made Justice of the Peace in five counties by 1559, many of them probably in Mary's reign: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire and Huntingdonshire. However, it is certainly true that Gerard was much favoured by Elizabeth and one of a small group of lawyers who were quickly installed in important offices to consolidate the new regime.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the Banach–Tarski paradox {{the number of}} pieces is finite and the allowed equivalences are Euclidean congruences, which {{preserve}} the volumes. Yet, somehow, they end up doubling {{the volume of the}} ball! While <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> surprising, some of the pieces used in the paradoxical decomposition are non-measurable sets, so the notion of volume (more precisely, Lebesgue measure) is not defined for them, and the partitioning cannot be accomplished in a practical way. In fact, the Banach–Tarski paradox demonstrates {{that it is impossible to}} find a finitely-additive measure (or a Banach measure) defined on all subsets of a Euclidean space of three (and greater) dimensions that is invariant with respect to Euclidean motions and takes the value one on a unit cube. In his later work, Tarski showed that, conversely, non-existence of paradoxical decompositions of this type implies the existence of a finitely-additive invariant measure.|$|E

500|$|Abraham Geiger, {{the founder}} of Reform Judaism, remarked the {{following}} concerning the claim that Jews believed Ezra to be the son of God: “According to the assertion of Muhammad the Jews held Ezra to be the Son of God. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> a mere misunderstanding which arose from the great esteem in which Ezra was undoubtedly held. This esteem is expressed in the following passage ‘Ezra would have been worthy to have made known the law if Moses had not come before him.’ Truly Muhammad sought to cast suspicion on the Jews’ faith in the unity of God, and thought he had here found a good opportunity of so doing.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} music S Club 7 {{normally}} falls under is pop, or more specifically bubblegum pop, {{as well as}} manufactured pop. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the case for their first album, S Club where simple lyrics, three-chord structures and danceable beats define it so. Their first two singles saw vocals shared equally amongst the seven members of the group, {{and it was not}} until their third single, [...] "Two in a Million" [...] that O'Meara became known as their lead vocalist. Although the band were to progressively change their style over the four years they were together, even their first album had many tracks atypical of the pop genre: [...] "You're My Number One" [...] ,"Love Train" [...] and [...] "Everybody Wants Ya" [...] were motown driven whereas [...] "Viva La Fiesta" [...] and [...] "It's A Feel Good Thing", were both [...] "bouncy, salsa-driven Latino songs".|$|E
500|$|... in the 1980s. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> {{the view}} of Superman {{producer}} Ilya Salkind and some who have interviewed him, {{as well as of}} film production assistant Brad Lohan. Other observers of film history tend to credit the resurgence of science fiction films simply to the Lucas and Spielberg productions, and see Superman as the first of the new cycle of films launched by the first two. Ilya Salkind denies any connection between Superman—which began filming in March 1977—and the other films, stating that [...] "I did not know about 'Star Wars'; 'Star Wars' did not know about 'Superman'; 'Close Encounters' did not know about 'Superman.' It really was completely independent—nobody knew anything about anybody." [...] Superman also established the superhero film genre as viable outside the production of low-budget Saturday matinee serials. Director Christopher Nolan cited Richard Donner's vision and scope of Superman when pitching the concept for Batman Begins to Warner Bros. in 2002.|$|E

500|$|Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 {{was given}} a 6 out of 10 by Newsarama's Richard Gray. He stated that [...] "despite the “Trinity War” tie-in banners, [...] {{scarcely}} essential reading for current DC fans" [...] adding that [...] "Pandora’s focus doesn’t appear to be as concerned with this bigger picture" [...] and the series {{requires a lot of}} backstory, only in its second issue. IGN's Jesse Schedeen gave the issue a 7.5 out of 10, commenting that [...] "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 improves on the first issue, but the series still lacks a clear, ongoing purpose" [...] and [...] "as a [...] "Trinity War" [...] tie-in, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> a more compelling read than Constantine #5." [...] Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 2 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 is an average comic book all the way around. It doesn't add much to the [...] "Trinity War" [...] story despite the logo on the cover and it certainly isn't going to stick with me until the next issue." ...|$|E
500|$|Compared {{with how}} {{important}} religious practice was in Mesopotamia, and {{compared to the}} number of temples that existed, very few cult figures at all have been preserved. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not {{due to a lack of}} artistic skill: the [...] "Ram in a Thicket" [...] (see image below) shows how elaborate such sculptures could have been, even 600 to 800 years earlier. It is also not due to a lack of interest in religious sculpture: deities and myths are ubiquitous on cylinder seals and the few steles, kudurrus, and reliefs that have been preserved. Rather, it seems plausible that the main figures of worship in temples and shrines were made of materials so valuable they could not escape looting during the many shifts of power that the region saw. The Burney Relief is comparatively plain, and so survived. In fact, the relief is one of only two existing large, figurative representations from the Old Babylonian period. The other one is the top part of the Code of Hammurabi, which was actually discovered in Elamite Susa, where it had been brought as booty (see image).|$|E

2500|$|.....a {{realistic}} estimate on {{the high}} side of bombing effectiveness (7–12 fatalities per ton of bombs) would yield a figure of perhaps 300–400 fatalities in Guernica. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> a bloody enough event, but reporting that a small town was bombed with a few hundred killed {{would not have had}} the same effect as reporting that a city was bombed with almost 1,700 dead".|$|E
