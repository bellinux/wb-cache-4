40|$|Measures of the {{spontaneous}} behaviour of animals commonly involve the repetitive counting of behavioural events over successive {{periods of time}} following some experimental treatment. An automated event-logging system has been designed for such applications. The system {{is based on an}} AIM 65 microcomputer with 4 Kbytes of random-access memory and facilities for manual event-logging through the keyboard, or automatic logging via a signal-conditioning buffer, connected to the backplane connector of the computer. The control program is written in 6500 machine code and stored in an onboard, read-only, memory chip. The software generates a simple interactive dialogue for the selection of operating options which include manual or automatic modes, configuration of active channels, duration and number of logging cycles, and the choice of printed or transmitted output. The microcomputer can also be instructed to pause and then <b>to</b> <b>restart,</b> <b>to</b> <b>print</b> out its current status, or to abort. The system has been used over a period of 18 months in numerous experiments in this laboratory, and has proved to be reliable, accurate and entirely suited to its application...|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} after the quake, Hana and the others slowly rebuild their lives. With help from Kano, Eiji is able <b>to</b> <b>restart</b> the <b>printing</b> company and publish The Prince and the Pauper in book form. Kayo starts her own cafe, and Renko and Daigo become advocates for oppressed women. Hana, however, is devastated when Ayumu dies of dysentery. She only recovers when she realizes the {{importance}} of her telling stories {{to the children of}} Japan. That she begins to do on the radio, in addition to print. In the meantime, Kichitaro announces his hope to marry Daigo, but Kempeitai officials prevent him from doing that. Momo suddenly appears in Tokyo, having fled Hokkaido after her husband died and she was mistreated by his family. In a family meeting, she confesses her resentment at the fact that Hana has seemingly received the best in life, a resentment Kichitaro could share. Sympathizing with her, a struggling artist named Akira proposes marriage to Momo.|$|R

40|$|The RESTART {{method is}} a widely {{applicable}} simulation technique for the estimation of rare event probabilities. The method {{is based on the}} idea <b>to</b> <b>restart</b> the simulation in certain system states, in order to generate more occurrences of the rare event. One of the main questions for any RESTART implementation is how and when <b>to</b> <b>restart</b> the simulation, in order to achieve the most accurate results for a fixed simulation effort. In this paper we investigate and compare, both theoretically and empirically, different implementations of the RESTART method. We find that the original RESTART implementation, in which each path is split into a fixed number of copies, {{may not be the most}} efficient one. It is generally better to fix the total simulation effort for each stage of the simulation. Furthermore, given this effort, the best strategy is <b>to</b> <b>restart</b> an equal number of times from each state, rather than <b>to</b> <b>restart</b> each time from a randomly chosen state. ...|$|R
