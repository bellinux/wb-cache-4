5|$|Andrei Rublev {{was invited}} to <b>the</b> <b>Cannes</b> <b>Film</b> Festival in 1967 {{as part of a}} planned {{retrospective}} of Soviet film on occasion of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The official answer was that the film was not yet completed and could not be shown at the film festival. A second invitation was made by the organizers of <b>the</b> <b>Cannes</b> <b>Film</b> Festival in 1969. Soviet officials accepted this invitation, but they only allowed the film to screen at the festival out of competition, and it was screened just once at 4 A.M. {{on the final day of}} the festival.

Soviet officials tried to prevent the official release of the film in France and other countries, but were not successful as the French distributor had legally acquired the rights in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics {{but did not}} score significant results at the box office.

5|$|An earlier, longer, {{work-in-progress}} {{version of}} the film was rejected for competition by <b>the</b> <b>Cannes</b> <b>Film</b> Festival, which offered that cut of Mr. Nobody an out-of-competition berth. Producer Philippe Godeau turned that down. The decision by <b>the</b> <b>Cannes</b> <b>Film</b> Festival not to exhibit the film created a national controversy. Eventually, the studio held the film's world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival on 12 September 2009. Six days later, Mr. Nobody screened as a special presentation during the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Additionally, the film was screened at the Sitges Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival before its theatrical release.

5|$|The Man from London was {{the first}} of Tarr's films to premiere in {{competition}} at <b>the</b> <b>Cannes</b> <b>Film</b> Festival, but despite being highly anticipated, it won no prize.
