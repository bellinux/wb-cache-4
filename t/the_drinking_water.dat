Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in drinking water in the area may rise in the future.

40|$|Fluorine {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{elements}} in the Earth’s crust. Fluoride is recognized to be the most eective caries-preventive agent. The main sources of fluoride for people are generally food and <b>drinking</b> <b>water.</b> For this reason, the fluoride and also the metal ion (Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and Zn) concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>waters</b> collected from <b>the</b> city center of Kayseri and its counties were investigated. In the determination of fluoride and of Na and K, an ion-meter with a combination-fluoride electrode and a flame photometer were used, respectively. The levels of Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Pb in <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>waters</b> were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) utilizing the method optimized previously, except for the Ca, Mg and Zn contents, which were measured directly by FAAS. According to the results obtained, the metal ion concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>waters</b> in <b>the</b> studied area are within <b>the</b> safe <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> regulation limits (TS 266) and also the fluoride levels (as mean 0. 17 mg L− 1) are lower than the permissible limit for fluoride (0. 8 - 1. 7 mg L− 1).

5|$|In 2009 {{there was}} another major fish kill, with over 200 dead fish found near the Fofanny water {{treatment}} works. There were approximately 150 trout and 55 salmon killed. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency investigated the incident and identified a potential source. It was revealed that an emergency discharge was carried out at Fofanny Water Treatment Work from 5am to 7am, due to a generator failure. The discharge was stopped as soon as personnel arrived at the site. Northern Ireland Water claimed the discharge was necessary to maintain <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> supply from Fofanny Dam.

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> {{genotoxicity}} of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> {{have received}} increased attention {{in recent years}} to assess aquatic ecosystem safety. The factors affecting <b>the</b> genotoxicity of <b>drinking</b> <b>water,</b> including sample preparation, the concentration of bromide and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N), were investigated using umu test. The result showed that sample preparation and bromide could significantly influence <b>the</b> genotoxicity of <b>drinking</b> <b>water.</b> During sample preparation, 1 and 2 L waters concentrated were suitable for umu test and the highest yield for genotoxic compounds was obtained from acid solution (pH 2) when ethyl acetate served as the eluant. Bromide could substantially increase <b>the</b> genotoxicity of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> after chlorine disinfection. <b>The</b> genotoxicity of <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> could not be increased with increasing NH 3 -N concentration...|$|R
5|$|Lead {{from the}} {{atmosphere}} or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water. It is also potentially in drinking water, e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder. Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals {{can be added to}} municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply. Chloramines, which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity. In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water. In 2004, a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> in Washington, D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination. In the Flint water crisis, a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.|$|E
5|$|The dam {{was built}} by the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company to meet the {{electrical}} energy needs for mining operations. The dam continues to be fully functional for hydroelectric generation, as one of <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> sources to Juneau city and for aquaculture and fishing. When built, adoption of the constant arch design for the dam reduced costs by 20% because less concrete was needed to construct the dam. Of the two hydroelectric power stations built at the initial stage (one at the upper level and the other at the lower level) – the latter one is still in use after a new powerhouse was built adjoining the old one – it produces the inexpensive electricity in Alaska while meeting 10% of the energy needs of Juneau city. When built, the dam and its two power plants were considered engineering wonders. Both are operated and maintained by the Alaska Electric Light & Power (AEL).|$|E
5|$|During a siege on {{the kingdom}} of Doma, Kefka grows {{impatient}} with fellow Imperial General Leo and poisons <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> in the castle of Doma, resulting in mass casualties and a swift victory for the Empire. After the alliance of Espers and revolutionaries invade and destroy Vector, Gestahl feigns sorrow for the Empire's evils, and to gain {{the trust of the}} protagonists, Gestahl has Kefka imprisoned, citing the poisoning of Doma. Kefka later goes to the village of Thamasa to kill the espers congregated there, killing Leo when he tries to intervene. Using the power of the espers, Kefka helps Gestahl raise the espers' homeworld and create the Floating Continent, where they intend to awaken three entities known as the Warring Triad. Upon being confronted by the protagonists, Gestahl freezes them except for former Imperial general Celes, whom he orders to kill her friends to show her loyalty to the Empire. She instead stabs Kefka, who becomes enraged. Kefka and the Emperor then get in an argument as to what degree they will wield the power of the triad—the Emperor taking a more conservative approach, since he only wants enough power to rule the world, while Kefka wants to unleash the Warring Triad's full potential. The Emperor tries and fails to kill Kefka, who retaliates by having the Warring Triad strike Gestahl down and unceremoniously boots him off the Floating Continent to his death. Kefka then moves the statues of the Warring Triad out of balance, unleashing enough raw magical energy to reshape the face of the planet and bringing about the second act of the game.|$|E
