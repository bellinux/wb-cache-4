5|$|The media {{tended to}} {{overlook}} the meaning behind Pussy Riot's feminism; the cultural context of it is vastly {{different from that of}} Western feminism. According to Elianna Kan in the American Reader, Pussy Riot's feminism focused on the repression of authoritarian regimes that created idealised ideas of sexism, sex and family life. Pussy Riot strove <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> feminism in Russia was still an issue and that post-feminism had not been achieved.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a matter}} of some dispute how much credit Dirichlet deserves for the modern {{definition}} of a function, in part because he restricted his definition to continuous functions....I believe Dirichlet defined the notion of continuous function <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> no rule or law is required even in the case of continuous functions, not just in general. This would have deserved special emphasis because of Euler's definition of a continuous function as one given by single expression-or law.

25|$|On 15 September 1917, {{shortly after}} promulgating the 1917 code, Benedict XV promulgated the motu proprio Cum Iuris Canonici, which forbade the Roman Congregations from issuing new general decrees {{unless it was}} {{necessary}} to do so, and then only after consulting the Pontifical Commission charged with amending the code. The congregations were instead to issue Instructions on the canons of the code, and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they were elucidating particular canons of the code. This was done so as not to make the code obsolete soon after it was promulgated. The 1917 Code was very rarely amended, and then only slightly.|$|E

Steven Soderbergh became involved in the film when Jonze's original cut ran over 150 minutes, and Soderbergh cut it down to 90 minutes. This was not {{the final version of the}} film, but it assisted Jonze in removing unnecessary sub-plots. Consequently, a supporting character played by Chris Cooper that was the subject of a documentary within the film was removed from the final cut.|$|E
500|$|Both East Slavs and Byzantines {{consistently}} made a {{clear distinction}} between Varangians and Kylfings, and Byzantines distinguished between them {{in the same manner as}} they separated Franks from Saracens. According to Holm such separations are indicative of clear ethnic differences between the two groups. Additionally, both East Slavic and Byzantine sources explicitly associate the Varangians with Baltic region, which they called Varangia, and in Arabic, the Baltic Sea was called Bahr Varank, i.e. the [...] "Varangian Sea". There are no comparable connections when they mention the Kylfings. Another difference is the fact that the Byzantine sources connect the word varangoi with rhōs in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the rhōs-varangoi and the varangoi originate in Baltic just like the rhōs, but do not establish the same associations for the koulpingoi.|$|E

500|$|Constantine sent Galerius an {{official}} notice of Constantius's death {{and his own}} acclamation. Along with the notice, he included a portrait of himself in the robes of an Augustus. The portrait was wreathed in bay. He requested recognition as heir to his father's throne, and passed off responsibility for his unlawful ascension on his army, claiming they had [...] "forced it upon him". Galerius was put into a fury by the message; he almost set the portrait on fire. His advisers calmed him, and argued that outright denial of Constantine's claims would mean certain war. Galerius was compelled to compromise: he granted Constantine the title [...] "Caesar" [...] rather than [...] "Augustus" [...] (the latter office went to Severus instead). Wishing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he alone gave Constantine legitimacy, Galerius personally sent Constantine the emperor's traditional purple robes. Constantine accepted the decision, knowing that it would remove doubts as to his legitimacy.|$|E
500|$|In December 1901, the MCC {{approved}} the scheme previously suggested—that the county captains should meet {{to discuss the}} fairness of suspected bowlers. It was proposed that any bowler who was judged to be unfair by a two-to-one majority of captains would be banned {{for at least a}} season. The MCC also recommended that the counties not play suspected bowlers and that any bowler called for throwing should be removed from the attack {{in the interests of the}} spirit of cricket. In the 1902 Wisden, Sydney Pardon wrote: [...] "Never in the last twenty years or more has there been so little unfair or doubtful bowling as in the season of 1901. Indeed the improvement was so marked as <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> if the captains stick to their guns, we shall soon be entirely free from the evil of which not very long ago it seemed impossible to get rid." [...] After 1901, there were only isolated incidents regarding illegal bowling actions until the Second World War, and throwing ceased to be an issue in English cricket, in which no cricketer was no-balled for throwing between 1908 and 1952.|$|E

500|$|Legal {{historian}} John Phillip Reid {{has written}} that {{the emphasis on the}} political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document—an indictment against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists. [...] Historian David Armitage has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's The Law of Nations, the dominant international law treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was [...] "continually {{in the hands of the}} members of our Congress". Armitage writes, [...] "Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was [...] "to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they were no longer dependent on Great Britain. [...] The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless it may help to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.|$|E
500|$|In {{the decade}} from 1910 to the {{aftermath}} of the First World War Shaw wrote four full-length plays, the third and fourth of which are among his most frequently staged works. Fanny's First Play (1911) continues his earlier examinations of middle-class British society from a Fabian viewpoint, with additional touches of melodrama and an epilogue in which theatre critics discuss the play. Androcles and the Lion (1912), which Shaw began writing as a play for children, became a study of the nature of religion and how to put Christian precepts into practice. Pygmalion (1912) is a Shavian study of language and speech and their importance in society and in personal relationships. To correct the impression left by the original performers that the play portrayed a romantic relationship between the two main characters Shaw rewrote the ending <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the heroine will marry another, minor character. Shaw's only full-length play from the war years is Heartbreak House (1917), which in his words depicts [...] "cultured, leisured Europe before the war" [...] drifting towards disaster. Shaw named Shakespeare (King Lear) and Chekhov (The Cherry Orchard) as important influences on the piece, and critics have found elements drawing on Congreve (The Way of the World) and Ibsen (The Master Builder).|$|E
500|$|Rejtan was {{a deputy}} to that Sejm, from the {{constituency}} of Nowogródek, {{and the local}} sejmik gave him very explicit instructions to defend the Commonwealth. On the Sejm's first day (19 April), and possibly even in the discussions on the previous days, Rejtan, working together with the Stanisław Bohuszewicz and Samuel Korsak, strongly protested against the proposal of Adam Poniński who wanted to form a confederated sejm (such as sejm would be immune {{to the threat of}} liberum veto). Rejtan's arguments were primarily legal; he argued that Poniński had no right to be the Sejm Marshal, and that there are no grounds to form a confederated sejm. He also appropriated one of the two Marshal's staffs. During a discussion with another deputy, Rejtan stated that he was aware that the foreign powers can force the issue, but his intention was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> any treaty they force through the Sejm would not be unanimously accepted. [...] Rejtan was thus able to disrupt the proceedings on that day. He would attempt to delay and disrupt the proceedings, but he was ignored, overruled and threatened by other deputies, as on 20 April Poniński returned to the Sejm with an escort of Russian and Prussian soldiers. A quickly convened Sejm court begun deliberating on the potential illegality of Rejtan's actions, but little discussion occurred on that day.|$|E
