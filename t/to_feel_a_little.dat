5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with {{the tone of the}} film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E
500|$|Travis Fickett of IGN {{said the}} episode {{included}} some good laughs but [...] "never kicks into high gear" [...] {{and said the}} themes might have worked better as subplots than a full episode: [...] "'Fishsticks' {{is one of those}} episodes that typically occur around now in the South Park season. It's not great, not bad – hovering somewhere around amusing towards forgettable." [...] Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said he was disappointed by the episode and thought the message about celebrity self-delusion might have been better if it focused on only West or Mencia, rather than both. Although O'Neal liked the West song in the episode's final scene, O'Neal said [...] "cramming (West and Mencia) together — even mixed in with Cartman's very funny fantasy sequences — felt too cobbled to me, and the time limits imposed by cutting back and forth between it all made the respective digs start <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too one-note." ...|$|E

Later, on November 21, 2002 they appeared on MTV's TRL for Spankin' New Music Week where they also {{performed the}} song. In 2009, Beyoncé performed an abbreviated version of [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] during her I Am... Yours revue, {{held at the}} Encore Las Vegas Theatre in July and August. The song was later included on the 2009 live album [...] which was chronicling the revue. In August 2011, Beyoncé performed [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] again during her revue 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé and included the song on the DVD [...] released in November 2011. During the concerts, Beyoncé announced the song by saying, [...] "It's 2002… I started <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lonely till one day…". [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] was included on Jay-Z's live album Live in Brooklyn released on October 11, 2012 after he performed the song during eight shows in Brooklyn. In 2013, Jay-Z included the song on the set list of his Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour.|$|E

500|$|Viking Invasion {{received}} [...] "favorable" [...] reviews, albeit {{slightly less}} than the original Medieval: Total War, according to Metacritic. Reviewers felt the new gameplay features for the Vikings {{were the most important}} enhancement of the expansion pack, with Eurogamer commending the Vikings' raiding system as something that fixes what [...] "the original Medieval lacked". ActionTrip praised the new campaign as being a challenge for players: [...] "even on the normal difficulty setting, Viking Invasion is a very challenging game", a view shared by other critics. The pre-battle screen was commended by GameSpot, calling it a [...] "handy new feature." [...] GameSpot also praised the new additions to the original campaign, mentioning they have [...] "made castle sieges more interesting". The main criticism for Medieval: Total War – Viking Invasion was the graphics, with both ActionTrip and Eurogamer stating that they were [...] "starting <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit creaky". A lack of new multiplayer options was considered by GameSpot to be [...] "unfortunate", mentioning that [...] "a multiplayer campaign option would have been a great new feature". Overall, the expansion was received well by critics in the industry. IGN concluded by saying fans [...] "won't be disappointed with the Viking Invasion", while Actiontrip finished stating; [...] "the graphics are beginning to look old" [...] but the challenge made the expansion [...] "worth it". The review by GameSpot finished by saying [...] "overall, the expansion is a great addition to Medieval", and Eurogamer concluded with praising the addition it made to Medieval: Total War: [...] "It's a worthy expansion pack to a truly excellent game".|$|E
2500|$|Utley had a {{slow start}} to spring training. [...] He was hitting only [...]175 (10 for 57), {{including}} 1 double and 3 RBIs with just two games remaining. [...] Utley remained confident for the 2014 season. [...] "For younger guys, I think results make you feel better," [...] Utley said. [...] "But as you go, you realize they're not quite as important this time of year. Physically, I feel good. Early in the spring, I felt pretty decent at the plate. There were some times in the middle when I felt a little uncomfortable and {{a little out of}} sorts. The last four or five days, I've started <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more comfortable at the dish. For a guy that has done this for a few years, your game plan for Spring training is different than it would be during the regular season." [...] Despite a poor spring training, over {{the first two weeks of}} the season, he was [...] "the hottest hitter in baseball", and as of April 13, possessed a 1.314 on-base plus slugging (OPS) average.|$|E
2500|$|Scenes {{shot at the}} United Palace theater {{created new}} {{challenges}} for the series' stunt team due to {{not being able to}} drill holes in the historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts. The crew had to find other ways to weigh down the equipment to remain safe for the actors and stunt doubles. For the explosion at the restaurant [...] "Genghis Connie's", a practical explosion was created in the storefront on location, which was extended with visual effects to show the destruction of the building. A set showing the inside of the rubble of the destroyed building was then created on a soundstage, while a lot was found that [...] "feels" [...] similar to the original location, where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show the exterior. The lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence, with the production having to negotiate with the NYPD to have the vehicles moved elsewhere. Looking back on the filming style of the season, and comparing it to the previous Marvel Netflix series, Weeks said,"You want it to feel like it's all in the same city, all in the same time frame, but you want each show, each character <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different. Have its own visual identity. Some of that is lighting, and of course, some of that is production design and location work ... We embraced Harlem for exactly what it is. The color, the life, the activity on the streets. There's so much character to the neighborhood… I think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in the real place". The series' production sound mixer Joshua Anderson, who worked on Daredevil and Jessica Jones as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over lavaliers to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in [...] "naturalistic sound". He noted that Ali's Cottonmouth laugh and many of Colter's lines in particular sounded [...] "incredible on the boom". Anderson also talked about Luke Cage adding a new layer of sound that the other series did not—music. The captured sound had to be clear to be properly mixed in with music later, and live performances in Harlem's Paradise had to be recorded for which Anderson and his team had experience after working on the musical series Smash.|$|E

5000|$|As noted above, the {{majority}} of the songs were pre-recorded by the cast. Music producer Mike Higham, who had previously worked with Sondheim on Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, recorded the film's score with the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic. Music supervisor and conductor Paul Gemignani instructed the actors on how to sing, including singing live to a camera on set, to prerecorded music in studio, and with a live studio orchestra. Jonathan Tunick orchestrated Sondheim's original music. The key to the song, [...] "Hello, Little Girl," [...] was altered to better suit Johnny Depp's lower vocal range. In regards to the song's musical arrangement, Higham explained; [...] "we emphasized the woodwinds <b>to</b> make it <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lighter, especially the flutes. And we just made it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> jazzier — played more on the walking bass line. Inherently, when it has <b>a</b> jazz <b>feel,</b> it just feels lighter."
