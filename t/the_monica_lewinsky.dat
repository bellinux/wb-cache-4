5|$|In 1998 and 2000, Moran faced Republican {{and flat}} tax {{advocate}} Demaris H. Miller. In the 1998 campaign Miller accused Moran of flip-flopping in {{his support of}} President Bill Clinton, after Moran, {{who had been a}} vocal supporter of the Clinton White House, voted in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry following <b>the</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal.|$|E
5|$|The {{missiles}} were launched {{three days after}} Clinton testified on <b>the</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E

25|$|The 1997 Asian {{financial}} crisis began as the property bubble in the Far East began to burst in Thailand, causing large financial losses {{in those countries}} that greatly affected foreign investors.

However, after each country agreed to be bailed out by the IMF, foreign investors immediately pulled their money out of those countries, leaving their taxpayers with enormous debts and triggering massive economic disasters.|$|E

Ralph Applebaum, the chief exhibit designer for the center, said that Clinton was heavily involved in the alcove's design, and that Clinton [...] "insisted on a transparent and illuminating exhibition". The scandal is portrayed as a power struggle between Republicans in Congress and Clinton after the Republican Party took control of both the House of Representatives and Senate in 1994.|$|E

500|$|During {{the final}} years of the Clinton administration, Moran was {{critical}} of the President: In 1998, during <b>the</b> <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal, Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. He told Time magazine that [...] "This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It's like a novel that just became too full of juicy parts and bizarre, sleazy characters." [...] Moran is also reported to have told First Lady Hillary Clinton that if she had been his sister, he would have punched her husband in the nose. Moran eventually decided not to vote for impeachment, explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country's security, and that he still respected him for what he had accomplished as President. Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of [...] "dishonest and illegal conduct" [...] surrounding his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.|$|E

By applying these offerings to the highly detailed examinations of <b>the</b> Whitewater and <b>Monica</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandals, this study argues that the academic theories, thus far, are found to have limitations when faced with complex, modem political scandals in the United States. While this study does not offer a theory on political scandal of its own, it suggests that, although important contributions have been made, that more academic work is required to gain a greater understanding to potentially develop a new theory on political scandal...|$|R

The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of quid pro quo sexual harassment." [...] The ruling was appealed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal.
