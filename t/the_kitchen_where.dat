5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a beige digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>where</b> the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the beige digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble into two {{different}} holes and meet two different fates: Finn becomes the guest of the unstable King Huge (voiced by Jones), who insists that Finn remain with him and stare at his idiosyncratic cuckoo clock; whereas Jake meets Seven (voiced by Isaak), a bear whose makeshift air raft has been falling down the hole for years. Eventually, {{it turns out that}} the hole Jake and Seven are falling through is the chimney to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>where</b> Finn is being held captive.

On {{their way back to}} Scranton, they stop at Jessica's family's log cabin, where they encounter a bunch of Jessica's friends having a bachelorette party and drinking. Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from her morning run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>where</b> she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy told her he did not think Erin was relationship material. Andy does not deny saying that, instead opting to claim that he is gay and leaves awkwardly with Erin. In the car, Andy says he made those comments about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to head back to the cabin to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin back to the car. Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E

He then takes his shirt off, and starts to cover himself with a black tar-like substance. He puts on a fly mask, as he continues to cover himself with the tar, with Durst watching him in the background with a disgusted look on his face. The boy then exits his room and comes down the stairs, now mutated {{into some sort of}} human fly. He enters <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>where</b> his family simply ignores him. He jumps onto the kitchen table, and begins to throw around the food on the table, while rubbing some into his face.|$|E

500|$|As the {{shooting}} took place, ABC News was signing off from its electoral broadcast, while the CBS broadcast was already over. It {{was not until}} 21 minutes after the shots that CBS's coverage of {{the shooting}} would begin. [...] ABC's Howard K. Smith had signed off {{the air and the}} closing credits and advertisements were playing over a wide studio shot of the anchors and staff when a voice over alerted the audience several times to stay tuned for a special report. [...] More than four minutes passed before Smith came back on the air announcing [...] "a disturbing report that Senator Robert Kennedy had been shot". [...] During that four minutes of extended coverage, the studio camera broadcast the live panic and bewilderment in the ABC newsroom. The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy's win in the primary ended up crowding into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>where</b> he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC, all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white. CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident.|$|E
500|$|Elspeth learns {{from her}} premonitions, and her cat Maruman's prophecies, that a keeper from Obernewtyn, a feared {{institution}} where Misfits {{are sent to}} work, will come to take her there. Soon, when delivering tea to visiting Head Keeper of Obernewtyn, Madam Vega, Elspeth accidentally reveals she is a Misfit, though not to what extent, and is soon dispatched to Obernewtyn. Her first few weeks at Obernewtyn are spent in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>where</b> she is worked to the bone. The cook’s daughter delights in tormenting her. The favoured Misfit, Ariel, and farm overseer, Rushton, immediately dislike her. Later reassigned to the farm, an encounter {{with a pair of}} Misfits named Matthew and Dameon reveals she is not alone in her particular abilities. She also befriends Cameo, a delicate, pretty Misfit of whom Matthew is very fond. Elspeth, plagued by nightmares, begins to feel there is a dark secret underneath their everyday tasks. While working, Elspeth decides to test the range of her telepathic ability, [...] "farseeking", but beyond the boundaries of Obernewtyn, a strange machine, the Zebkrahn, traps her mind. She is only freed by combining her mental strength with another anonymous mind who offers assistance. Asked by Vega to look out for [...] "special" [...] Misfits, her interview reveals the Doctor is a defective simpleton; his [...] "assistant", Alexi, has no interest in Elspeth in his quest to find the [...] "right one" [...] who will lead him to what he desires. Elspeth and Matthew later deduce that tortuous experiments on their kind are occurring, and they resolve to escape. Cameo begins disappearing from her bed at nighttime, and Elspeth fearfully suspects that Cameo is the subject of some of these experiments.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sarah Chatfield, who {{wanted to do a}} Tom and Jerry-like video, where the human character is cut off at the waist. Hence Allen {{was not going to be}} part of it originally. However, she did appear on the video. The singer declared on her official blog that, I did a video shoot for the next single, which is Alfie, and that was quite a lot of fun, Alfie was played by a puppet and the whole thing looks like an episode of a mixture Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit, you'll understand when you see it. The whole day was a pleasurable experience [...] The video starts off with an opening title parodying Looney Tunes and shows Allen in the kitchen preparing a cup of tea, while Alfie, impersonated by a puppet, smokes in his miniature bedroom, watching television. The singer enters the room and takes away his bong, as he unsuccessfully tries to get it back. Next, Allen irons his tuxedo and marks a job announcement called [...] "The Puppet Show" [...] in the newspaper, as the lyric [...] "You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid" [...] is sung. Meanwhile, Alfie is in his bed, staring at a magazine in which there are undressed dolls, titled [...] "Roxy & Babs get it on!" [...] and proceeds to masturbate. Allen walks in on him with the newspaper and suit as he does so, but immediately exits out of embarrassment. With the start of the bridge, puppet birds sing outside the home, while Alfie sneaks out of his room and tries to get beer out of the refrigerator, but is ultimately caught by Allen. She then takes off his [...] "stupid fitted cap", as he scrawls a picture of her, which is also the cover of [...] "Littlest Things". The final scene happens at night, in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>where</b> Allen is lying on the floor, watching her brother dance. After the last lyrics, [...] "Please don't despair, my dear, mon frere" [...] is sung, he punches her and the video ends.|$|E

Justice Wargrave leads the group in determining that as of yet, none of them can definitively be ruled out as the murderer.

Twenty minutes later, Tina suddenly froze in mid-sentence, and ran up to Meier's room. Meier had hanged herself with a belt in the bedroom closet.

2500|$|There are {{multiple}} spheres {{within the family}} and household which are [...] "traditionally" [...] defined as in the purview of one gender or the other, making an intersection with gender studies manifest. The transmission of the folklore in these areas will run through either the male or the female lines. An obvious area of gender-related transmission is seen in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>where</b> food preparation and mealtime customs and forms are generally performed by the women. They are then transmitted from mother to daughter {{in the course of}} everyday meal preparation. A variant of this is seen when a man in the family has taken over the preparation of a special meal or special recipe. One common example of this practice is described by Thomas Adler in the article [...] "Making Pancakes on Sunday: The Male Cook in Family Tradition". Many families have some variation of this tradition: the BBQ ribs, grilled hamburgers, or deep-fat fried turkey prepared as a single specialty by the non-cook in the family.|$|E
