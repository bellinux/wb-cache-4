50|$|Due to {{the absence}} of any clear front-runner for the {{nomination}} and a political climate that seemed tilted heavily in <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> favor, a record number of Democrats competed for <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> presidential nomination in 1976. However, most of these candidates would drop out early in the race.|$|R
5000|$|Those {{people who}} {{identify}} {{with a party}} tend to vote for <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> candidate for various offices in high percentages. Those who consider themselves to be strong partisans, strong Democrats and strong Republicans respectively, {{tend to be the}} most faithful in voting for <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> nominee for office. In the case of voting for president, since the 1970s, party identification on voting behavior has been increasing significantly. By the late 1990s, party identification on voting behavior was at the highest level of any election since the 1950s. [...] When voting in congressional elections, the trend is similar. Strong party identifiers voted overwhelmingly for <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> nominee in the general election. It {{is important to note that}} each party respectively in certain elections, would have stronger voting behavior of <b>their</b> strongest <b>party</b> identifiers. For instance, in the years the Democrats dominated House and Senate elections in the 1970s and 1980s, it can be explained that <b>their</b> strong <b>party</b> identifiers were more loyal in voting for <b>their</b> <b>party's</b> nominee for Congress than the Republicans were.|$|R

5|$|In addition, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the GRC scheme merely provides an appearance of a united, multiracial Parliament. In fact, minority representatives are required to vote according to <b>their</b> <b>party</b> line; they are not allowed to vote specifically in the interests of their racial groups. The multiracial element in Parliament has been artificially imposed by way of a racial quota to ensure that the minorities are represented.|$|E

If the party dies in battle the group loses half of its gold and warps to the nearest save location where the hero is revived; players must then pay a priest or nun to revive <b>their</b> <b>party</b> members.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald {{was active}} in provincial Liberal Party {{organizational}} work during {{the latter part of}} the 1920s. In 1925, the party had suffered a crushing defeat after 43years in power.

5|$|Republicans {{nominated}} Judge Edward C. O'Rear {{to oppose}} McCreary. There were few {{differences between the}} two men's stands on the issues.

McCreary also changed his stance on the liquor question, now agreeing with Beckham's prohibitionist position; this also matched the Republican position. O'Rear claimed that Democrats should have already enacted the reforms <b>their</b> <b>party</b> platform advocated, but his only ready line of attack against McCreary himself was that he would be a pawn of Beckham and his allies.|$|E
