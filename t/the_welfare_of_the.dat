The study illustrates the potential {{advantages and disadvantages}} of forming a REPA for CARIFORUM. The paper estimates <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> REPA using the partial equilibrium framework developed by Greenaway and Milner in 2003. The results show a decline in <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trinidad and Tobago economy between 1998 and 2005. The paper then outlines a variety of policy suggestions that the Trinidad and Tobago economy can implement to benefit even more from <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a REPA...|$|R

5|$|Justinian {{selected}} one of {{his most}} trusted and talented generals, Belisarius, who had recently distinguished himself against the Persians and in the suppression of the Nika riots, to lead the expedition. As Ian Hughes points out, Belisarius was also eminently suited for this appointment for two other reasons: he was a native Latin-speaker, and was solicitous of <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local population, keeping a tight leash on his troops. Both these qualities would be crucial in winning support from the Latin-speaking African population. Belisarius was accompanied by his wife, Antonina, and by Procopius, his secretary, who wrote the history of the war.|$|E
5|$|Options for {{population}} control include fertility control, ground and helicopter shooting, and mustering and trapping.

As a result, more effective and efficient means of control have been called for.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem with}} which this {{investigation}} is concerned is that of ascertaining whether or not A. C.

The second is to examine <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> criterion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neoclassical tradition. The third {{is to develop a}} synthesis of classical and neoclassical into a modern welfare criterion. This study concludes that A. C.

It wasn't really surprising then that more than 50 players {{from around the world}} signed lucrative WSC contracts and a revolution was born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money.|$|E

5|$|Despite Singapore's growing importance, the {{administration}} governing {{the island was}} understaffed, ineffectual and unconcerned with <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, {{the size of the}} civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as cholera and smallpox caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas. As a result of {{the administration}}'s ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal secret societies (analogous to modern-day triads) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success.|$|E

He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E

He confronts Dalmasca's resistance movement with absolute ruthlessness, accepting no surrender. He even {{goes so far as}} to murder his own ailing father and frame the Imperial senators, to put an end to their scheming against himself and Larsa, and to level cities in nethicite testing experiments. Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have for centuries secretly meddled with the course of human history.|$|E

5|$|Manila—officially {{known as}} the City of Manila—is the {{national}} capital of the Philippines and is classified as a Special City (according to its income) and a Highly Urbanized City (HUC).

The members of the City Council are elected as representatives of specific congressional districts within the city. The city, however, {{have no control over}} Intramuros and the Manila North Harbor. The historic Walled City is administered by the Intramuros Administration, while the Manila North Harbor is managed by the Philippine Ports Authority. Both are national government agencies.

At the same time, he submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he heard the news while on the House floor and his first reaction was disbelief, his second sadness.|$|E
