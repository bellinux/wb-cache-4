They can be executed as a parallel algorithm in which each operation is performed by a parallel process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E
5|$|Several critics {{noted that}} Florida sounded {{too eager to}} coin terms {{and that some of}} the pop {{cultural}} references and anecdotes were awkward. Environmental psychologist Michael Dudley pointed out copy-editing errors such as misspellings, and complained that Florida ignored existing literature on the topic of <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> personalities and places. Likewise, Tom Hutton in the journal Economic Geography noted the absence of influential academics Allen Scott and Peter Hall in the text.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{promotes}} subjective experience, {{particularly in}} relation to nature, exploring <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> the sublime and sensibility. Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world. In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works. As in her previous writings, she champions the liberation and education of women. In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to {{the world with a}} commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December 2010, {{the mayor}} of Shanghai, Han Zheng, said that the city would crack down on unfair {{practices}} of construction companies and contracting firms. Han said {{that there is little}} regulation of the construction industry and that certain companies have had advantages over other companies when being awarded contracts. On 11 January 2011, Shanghai authorities placed into effect a new set of regulations aimed at better official supervision of construction companies. The city will also require that such companies will not be permitted to have any non-official relationship with local government offices after one year. Some media organizations had been questioning <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> Jing'an District's government and the contracting groups involved in the fire, leading to accusations of corruption.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, {{the main body of}} the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> vertebrae. The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as {{the main body of the}} vertebrae. This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} stories to {{entertain}} {{is evident in}} one of the most famous ones—Scheherazade—a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories. <b>The</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a gamelan orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show.|$|E
5|$|While some {{titles of}} the World of Mana series do share direct {{connections}} with other installments, the {{games of the}} series have few concrete links. There is no overall explicit in-game chronological order. Further, according to Koichi Ishii in 2006 the games do not take place {{in exactly the same}} world, and characters or elements who appear in different titles are best considered alternate versions of each other. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> each title are more abstract than story-based, linked only on the karmic level. Contradicting this assertion, Ishii has also {{said in an interview that}} Children is set ten years after Dawn, while Heroes is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, freeway {{approaches}} {{were planned}} {{for both sides}} of the Ben Franklin Bridge, which was completed in 1926 and served as a part of US 30. In Pennsylvania, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia to the Schuylkill River, while in New Jersey, the North-South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, this stretch of highway was a part of I-80S, with Interstate 680 continuing on the Schuylkill Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge. In 1964, the designations became I-76 and I-676, respectively, and in 1972 the two routes were switched onto their current alignments. I-676 in New Jersey was completed between I-76 and Morgan Boulevard by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s. The Vine Street Expressway was opened from the Schuylkill Expressway to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I-95 on January 10, 1991 after several obstacles to construction. However, there are grade-level intersections in <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> the Vine Street Expressway and the Ben Franklin Bridge.|$|E

5|$|After a {{continued}} lack of confirmation of a North American release, including it not being included in Nintendo's 2011 release schedule, a fan-based movement called Operation Rainfall started {{a campaign to}} raise awareness for The Last Story, Xenoblade Chronicles, and another Wii RPG titled Pandora's Tower. This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release. Despite acknowledging the effort, Nintendo stated {{that there were no}} plans for a North American release. Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought The Last Story would never make it to North America. At this point, Xseed Games, who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games, took an interest in publishing the title. Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they had no plans to publish the title themselves. After playing through a Japanese copy of the game, and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game's North American publishing rights. They were helped by <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>between</b> parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker. Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about The Last Story, and after being favorably impressed by their proposal, Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights. While a new localization for North America was considered, it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe's localization as it better fitted the game's atmosphere and aesthetic. It officially released in North America on August 14, but problems with stock caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward.|$|E
