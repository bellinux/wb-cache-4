[...] Prof. Trueblood is the {{inventor}} of the novel scheme, and his course, which has been hitherto shunned as one of the toughest at the university, now seems likely to become the most popular on campus... Early <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>he</b> hit upon the successful plan, and now the many visitors who attend his classes are spectators of thrilling love scenes. [...] Fifty times a day Prof. Trueblood is forced to kneel to some maiden and show his pupils the right way to declare their devotion to their sweethearts... Each budding orator takes his place before a blushing maid, and no matter how smoothly the pair may have progressed in private the professor finds some fault with the public demonstration. [...] 'No, kneel on both knees—now hold her hand, it impresses her more-so,' and the old professor again kneels and goes through it all over again." ...|$|E

500|$|In need of paid employment, Thorpe {{opted for}} the law, and in February 1954, after {{completing}} his pupillage, was called to the bar in the Inner Temple. [...] Initially he {{found it difficult to}} earn a living from his fees; he needed another source of income, and found it in the medium of television journalism. [...] Thorpe was employed by Associated Rediffusion, at first as chairman of a science discussion programme, The Scientist Replies, and later as an interviewer on the station's major current affairs vehicle This Week [...] Among various assignments for <b>This</b> <b>Week,</b> <b>he</b> travelled to Ghana in 1957 to cover the country's independence celebrations, and in 1958 he reported from Jordan on a plot to assassinate King Hussein. Thorpe was a skilled broadcaster, and in addition to his television work he became a regular guest on the BBC radio programme Any Questions? In 1959 he was offered the post of chief commentator by Associated Rediffusion, but as the condition was that he gave up his parliamentary candidature, he declined.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{recorded}} {{sections of}} this {{early version of}} Tubular Bells as demo pieces, Oldfield attempted to persuade record labels {{to take on the}} Tubular Bells project. Nothing came of his efforts until September 1971, when as a session musician and bass guitarist for the Arthur Louis Band, he attended recording sessions at The Manor Studio in Kidlington, near Oxford, owned by a young Richard Branson and run by engineers Tom Newman and Simon Heyworth. Branson already had several business ventures and was about to start his own record label, Virgin Records, together with Simon Draper. [...] Newman and Heyworth heard some of Oldfield's demo music and took it to Branson and Draper, who eventually gave Oldfield one week's worth of recording time at The Manor. During <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>he</b> completed [...] "Part One" [...] of Tubular Bells; [...] "Part Two" [...] was compiled over a number of months.|$|E

2500|$|After the 2006 coup, the {{military}} junta appointed {{a committee to}} investigate the anti-drug campaign. Former Attorney General Kanit Na Nakorn led the committee. Concerning the committee's results The Economist reported in January 2008: [...] "Over half of those killed in 2003 had no links to the drugs trade. The panel blamed the violence on a government 'shoot-to-kill' policy based on flawed blacklists. But far from leading to the prosecutions of those involved, its findings have been buried. The outgoing interim prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, took office vowing to right Mr Thaksin's wrongs. Yet <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>he</b> said there was insufficient evidence to take legal action over the killings. It {{is easy to see}} why the tide has turned. Sunai Phasuk, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, a lobbying group, says that the panel's original report named the politicians who egged on the gunmen. But after the PPP won last month's elections, those names were omitted." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Monday, July 2, 2007, Chief Rusty Thomas {{told the}} CDC (which oversees NIOSH, the federal {{department}} that investigates firefighter fatalities) that his department {{would not allow}} federal investigators to interview firefighters about the Sofa Super Store fire. On Tuesday, July 3, 2007, the head of NIOSH wrote to Chief Thomas, asking him to reconsider. On Thursday, July 5, 2007, the city relented when Mayor Joe Riley called the CDC to say that interviews would be allowed. CDC spokesman Fred Blosser, {{in an interview with}} MSNBC said, [...] "This is a developing situation. This morning we were notified that the chief has said that he will grant access to the firefighters. Earlier <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>he</b> had indicated that he was denying access to the firefighters for interviews." [...] Mayor Riley replied that it was all a misunderstanding. He said that Chief Thomas was merely trying to minimize the number of interviews of his weary and grieving firefighters, not to block any investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Boyzone manager Louis Walsh {{is quoted}} as saying: [...] "We're all {{absolutely}} devastated. I'm in complete shock. I was only with him on Monday at an awards ceremony. We don't know much about what's happened yet. I only heard after The X Factor (UK television talent show on which Walsh is a judge) and we will rally around each other <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> was a great man." [...] Walsh {{dropped out of the}} live results show of The X Factor on 11 October 2009 {{as a direct result of}} Gately's death. Simon Cowell addressed the issue at the start of the programme. He said: [...] "This is really, really tragic news I want to send out my condolences to the family, our thoughts are with Louis". That edition of the show attracted an [...] "absolutely huge" [...] audience which was said to have been seeking updates on the singer's death. Walsh also was absent from the second week of The X Factor which coincided with Gately's funeral,—later commenting: [...] "I never want to watch the show at home again. I've been shouting at the TV all night"—at which Walsh was too upset to speak. My First Time, a stage show which was set to star bandmember Keith Duffy, was cancelled entirely. Duffy, Graham, Keating and Lynch had memorial [...] "76 09" [...] tattoos (Gately's birth and death years) engraved on their bodies when they brought Gately's body home.|$|E

2500|$|The 1880 Dodge City census {{revealed}} that Masterson was then living with one Annie Ladue, age 19, who {{was described as}} his [...] "concubine". City Marshal James Masterson, Bat's younger brother, was listed on the same census as living with Minnie Roberts, age 16, also quaintly described as a concubine. Not long after this census was taken, Bat Masterson received a telegram from Ben Thompson asking Bat to save Ben's troublesome brother, Billy Thompson, from almost certain lynching in Ogallala, Nebraska. Billy Thompson had shot the thumb off a man named Tucker, who – despite missing a digit – managed to fire back and seriously wound Billy. Masterson took Billy Thompson out of Ogallala by a midnight train bound for North Platte, Nebraska. In North Platte, Masterson was provided with assistance by no less a personage [...] than William F. [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] Cody, who promptly offered to help. According to Masterson, both Billy Thompson and he [...] "were given a royal welcome and were immediately taken in charge by Colonel Cody, who found {{a safe place for}} us to remain until he could outfit us for the trip across the country to Dodge City." [...] The finale of the Billy Thompson episode was reported in the Dodge City Times, which noted that [...] "W.B. Masterson arrived from a visit to Ogallala, <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> <b>He</b> says Nebraska is dry and many people are leaving the state.

60|$|Two {{days and}} two nights passed {{without fear of}} fire, and then Harry Heathcote was again on the alert. The earth was parched as though no drop of rain had fallen. The fences were dry as tinder, and the ground was strewed with broken atoms of timber from the trees, each of which a spark would ignite. Two nights Harry slept in his bed, but on the third he was on horseback about the run, watching, thinking, endeavoring to make provision, {{directing}} others, and hoping to make it believed that his eyes were every where. In this way an entire week was passed, and now it wanted but four days to Christmas. He would come home to breakfast about seven in the morning, very tired, but never owning that he was tired, and then sleep heavily {{for an hour or}} two in a chair. After that he would go out again on the run, would sleep perhaps for another hour after dinner, and then would start for his night's patrol.

6000|$|It {{may not be}} {{improper}} {{to remind}} the reader that in his publication of Sept. 6th General Adams said that the assignment charge was manufactured just before the election; and that in reply I proved that statement to be false by Keys, his own witness. Now, without attempting to explain, he furnishes me with another witness (Tinsley) by which {{the same thing is}} proved, to wit, that the assignment was not manufactured just before the election; but that it was some weeks before. Let it be borne in mind that Adams made this statement--has himself furnished two witnesses to prove its falsehood, and does not attempt to deny or explain it. Before going farther, let a pin be stuck here, labeled [...] "One lie proved and confessed." [...] On the 6th of September he said he had before stated in the hand-bill that he held an assignment dated May 20th, 1828, which in reply I pronounced to be false, and referred to the hand-bill for the truth of what I said. <b>This</b> <b>week</b> <b>he</b> forgets to make any explanation of this.
