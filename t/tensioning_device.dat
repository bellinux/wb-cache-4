50|$|The {{drivetrain}} did not {{deviate from}} those of the Sport. So she was a primary drive with gears, a wet multi-plate clutch, a three-speed gearbox and a chain to the rear wheel. That chain was particularly long, and was led therefore a support gear with a <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> The rear brake was a brake band, which was operated by a pedal.|$|E
5000|$|On {{bicycles}} that do {{not have}} a derailleur or other chain <b>tensioning</b> <b>device,</b> rear horizontal dropouts allow adjustment of chain tension, and can accommodate a range of chain lengths or cog sizes. They were standard on most older derailleur bicycles from before the 1990s. An older derailleur-equipped bicycle with horizontal dropouts can be readily converted into singlespeed, fixed gear or to use an internally geared hub.|$|E

50|$|Inkle looms are {{constructed}} in both floor and table-top models. Either model {{is characterized by}} a wooden framework upon which dowels have been fastened. These dowels will hold the warp threads when the loom has been dressed. One of the dowels, or a paddle, is constructed so that its position can be adjusted.

50|$|Rear {{vertical}} dropouts {{have the}} slot facing downwards. The {{advantage is that}} the wheel axle cannot slip forward compared with horizontal dropouts. The disadvantage is that on a bicycle without a rear derailleur but with vertical dropouts, the chain tension cannot be adjusted by moving the wheel forwards or backwards, and needs another means of chain-tensioning, by a derailleur, chain tensioner, or eccentric bottom bracket or rear hub. Fixed wheel bicycles cannot use any form of chain <b>tensioning</b> <b>device,</b> because the lower run of chain is pulled very tight when using the transmission as a brake.|$|E
50|$|The V6 {{engine is}} fitted with four {{overhead}} camshafts driven by synchronous tooth belts. It has a single, long, serpentine belt {{at the front}} driving the inlet cams and also the coolant pump. The exhaust cams are driven by short link belts driven from {{the ends of the}} inlet cams {{at the rear of the}} engine. The system was a joint development between Dayco (belt supplier) and Rover.The rear link belts do not incorporate any <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> Belt tension is maintained by very careful control of belt length and the pulley pair is pre-tensioned during fitting. The front belt drive is tensioned by a spring-loaded tensioner pulley incorporating a hydraulic damping element.|$|E

50|$|A dynamic {{compression}} plate (DCP) is a metallic plate used in orthopedics for internal fixation of bone, typically after fractures. As the name implies, {{it is designed}} to exert dynamic pressure between the bone fragments to be transfixed. Dynamic compression is achieved either by attaching a <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> to a plate or by using a special {{dynamic compression}} plate. However, compression plating requires a longer surgical incision to allow insertion of the <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> and the possibility of refracture after the plate is removed. A neutralization plate is used to bridge a comminuted fracture; it also transmits bending or torsional forces from the proximal to the distal fragment. Plates used for buttressing prevent collapse by supporting an area of thin cortex or cancellous bone graft.|$|R
50|$|Post Spacing: Intermediate posts are posts {{which provide}} {{mounting}} {{for the top}} rail and have a vertical row of holes to support the cable as it passes through them. Since the post to post spacing is a primary driver of cable rigidity, the post to post spacing is very important. It is generally recommended that post spacing {{be no more than}} 5 ft on center Some manufacturers require as little as no more than 3 ft on center. The reason for post spacing is more about the cable end fittings' machine thread loading capacity (how much tension can be put on the threads before they fail), than anything else. The more cable drop in the middle, the more weight on the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device,</b> ergo the more load on the threads. Proof strength must be greater than load.|$|E
5000|$|His third son, Joseph Henry Horwood (1841 [...] - [...] 17 April 1913) {{worked at}} the Bendigo Iron Works {{constructing}} mining equipment. He returned to Adelaide in 1867 to supply the Montacute goldmine with a ten head stamp battery, which he bought back the following year and installed at the Echunga goldmine. He then {{spent some time with}} his mining engineer brother John William Horwood in Castlemaine, Victoria before returning to Adelaide in 1872. He built a crushing plant in the Barossa Valley, then moved to Moonta to work on the copper mines, but withdrew in 1874 after being singled out for retribution for his part in suppressing the miners' strike. On 18 March 1875 he married Maria Brooks, and in the same year started work for Francis Clark & Sons, managing their machinery dealership on Grenfell Street then Blyth Street which they sold in 1882. He took over Strapps' foundry in Currie Street, then, with Samuel Strapps (c. 1840-1913), founded a machinery manufacturing and sales business in Currie Street, bringing foreman Thomas Ward with him. Horwood's specialty was well-drilling and he built the first steam-powered rock drilling machine, as well as being a pioneer in tube-lined bores. His fence-wire <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> and windmills won several prizes at the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society shows. The business moved to Franklin Street in 1906 and became J. H. Horwood and Co. Ltd. in 1912.|$|E

40|$|The <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> is {{designed}} to pull the contact wire straight at all times. Pulling a contact wire straight ensures that smooth contact is maintained at all times between the contact wire and pantograph of an electric train, and this {{makes it possible to}} ensure a stable supply of electricity to the train. Normally, <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> are installed at two positions over a distance of 1 to 1. 6 km per line. Fig. 1 shows a conceptual view {{of the relationship between the}} contact wire and pulley type balancer. The <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> can be broadly classified into the two types; the wheel type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> that pulls the contact wire by concrete or iron weights and the spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> that use the force of a spring to pull it. Fig. 2 shows the wheel type balancer, while Fig. 3 represents the spring type balancer. The spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> comprises a spring and a sleeve for accommodating the spring. Only the sleeve portion is visible to the outside. The wheel depends on gravity acting on the weight to produce tension, so it is possible to pull the contact wire at an almost uniform force, regardless of the height of the weight. In the spring type The wheel type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> used in the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines of JR East requires much time and labor for maintenance including wire replacement and oil application. Further, parts become superannuated and in need of periodic replacement very quickly. So we found it necessary to develop a new type of maintenance-free <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> To accomplish this, we have been making efforts since 1999 to develop a new spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> for Shinkansen, making effective use of the spring type balancer technologies used in the narrow gauge lines, where the major target is to develop a maintenance-free <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> Thus, fairly satisfactory development results have been attained.
