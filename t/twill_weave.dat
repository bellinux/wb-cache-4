500|$|Sets of bed hangings {{embroidered}} in crewel wools {{were another}} characteristic {{product of the}} Stuart era. [...] These were worked on a new fabric, a natural <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> from Bruges with a linen warp and cotton weft. [...] Crewel wools of the 17th century were firmly twisted unlike the soft wools sold under that name today, and were dyed in deep rich shades of green, blue, red, yellow, and brown. Motifs of flowers and trees, with birds, insects, and animals, were worked at large scale {{in a variety of}} stitches. [...] The origins of this work are in the polychrome embroidery on scrolling stems of the Elizabethan era, later blended with the Tree of Life and other motifs of Indian palampores, introduced by the trade of the East India Company.|$|E
2500|$|A further, {{relevant}} {{difference was}} the deletion {{of the blind}} test, considered by some scholars as the very foundation of the scientific method. The blind-test method was abandoned because the distinctive three-to-one herringbone <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> of the shroud could not be matched in the controls, and a laboratory could thus identify the shroud sample. [...] Shredding the samples would not solve the problem, while making {{it much more difficult}} and wasteful to clean the samples properly.|$|E
2500|$|The blind-test {{method was}} abandoned, because the {{distinctive}} three-to-one herringbone <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> of the shroud {{could not be}} matched in the controls, and it was therefore still possible for a laboratory to identify the shroud sample. [...] Shredding the samples would not solve the problem, while making {{it much more difficult}} and wasteful to clean the samples properly. Professor Harry Gove, director of Rochester's laboratory (one of the four not selected by the Vatican), argued in an open letter published in Nature that discarding the blind-test method would expose the results – whatever they may be – to suspicion of unreliability. However, in a 1990 paper Gove conceded that the [...] "arguments often raised, … that radiocarbon measurements on the shroud should be performed blind seem to the author to be lacking in merit; … lack of blindness in the measurements is a rather insubstantial reason for disbelieving the result." ...|$|E

50|$|A satin fabric {{tends to}} have a high luster due to the high number of floats on the fabric. Because of this it is used in making bed sheets. Many {{variations}} can be made of the basic satin weave including a granite weave and a check <b>weave.</b> Satin <b>weaves,</b> <b>twill</b> <b>weaves,</b> and plain weaves are the three basic types of weaving by which the majority of woven products are formed.|$|R
50|$|Gota is a gold {{or silver}} ribbon and lace from Lucknow, various other {{coloured}} ribbons of varying width, woven in a satin or <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> {{may also be}} referred to as gota. It is used along with kinari work. The dresses with gota work are used for special occasions or religious occasions. Gota is crafted using appliqué technique with a strip of gold or silver or various other coloured ribbons of different widths woven in a satin or <b>twill</b> <b>weave.</b> It involves placing woven gold cloth onto fabrics such as georgette or bandhini to create different surface textures.|$|E
50|$|Woven wire cloth, {{typically}} {{produced from}} stainless steel, is commonly {{employed as a}} filtration medium for sieving {{in a wide range}} of industries. Most often woven with a plain weave, or a <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.|$|E
50|$|Kerseymere {{is a fine}} {{woolen cloth}} with a fancy <b>twill</b> <b>weave.</b> In {{printing}} fine work during the mid-19th century, the blankets that lay between the tympans were either fine kerseymere or superfine woolen cloth.|$|E

5000|$|Bras were {{originally}} made of linen, cotton broadcloth, and <b>twill</b> <b>weaves</b> and sewn using flat-felled or bias-tape seams. They are now {{made of a}} variety of materials, including Tricot, Spandex, Spanette, Latex, microfiber, satin, Jacquard, foam, mesh, and lace, which are blended to achieve specific purposes. Spandex, a synthetic fiber with built-in [...] "stretch memory", can be blended with cotton, polyester, or nylon. Mesh is a high-tech synthetic composed of ultra-fine filaments that are tightly knit for smoothness.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{used for}} mattresses and pillows, the material has found other uses, such as {{serving as a}} backing for quilts, coverlets, and other bedding. [...] It is sometimes woven with a <b>twill</b> <b>weave.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Twill</b> <b>weave</b> {{is often}} {{designated}} as a fraction, such as , in which the numerator indicates the number of harnesses that are raised (and thus threads crossed: in this example, two), and the denominator indicates the number of harnesses that are lowered when a filling yarn is inserted (in this example, one). The fraction [...] is read as [...] "two up, one down" [...] (the fraction for plain weave is [...]). The minimum number of harnesses needed to produce a twill can be determined by totaling the numbers in the fraction; for the example described, the number of harnesses is three. <b>Twill</b> <b>weave</b> can be identified by its diagonal lines.|$|E
50|$|The Cambodian ikat is a weft ikat woven of silk on a {{multi-shaft}} loom with {{an uneven}} <b>twill</b> <b>weave,</b> {{which results in}} the weft threads showing more prominently {{on the front of}} the fabric than the back.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} denim is indigo denim, {{in which the}} warp thread is dyed, while the weft thread is left white. As {{a result of the}} warp-faced <b>twill</b> <b>weaving,</b> one side of the textile is {{dominated}} by the blue warp threads and the other side is dominated by the white weft threads. This causes blue jeans to be white on the inside. The indigo dyeing process, in which the core of the warp threads remains white, creates denim's signature fading characteristics.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} fabrics and {{textiles}} in common use today need no further UV-blocking enhancement {{based on their}} inherent fiber structure, density of weave, and dye components, especially darker colors and indigo dyes. Good examples of these fabrics contain full percentages or blends of heavy-weight natural fibers like cotton, linen and hemp or light-weight synthetics such as polyester, nylon, spandex and polypropylene. Natural or synthetic indigo-dyed denim, <b>twill</b> <b>weaves</b> and canvas are also good examples. However, a significant disadvantage is the heat retention caused by heavier-weight and darker-colored fabrics.|$|R
50|$|The Sampot Phamuong (សំពត់ផាមួង ALA-LC: saṃbát phā muaṅ) {{are many}} {{different}} variations of traditional Khmer textiles. They are single colored and <b>twill</b> <b>woven.</b> There are currently 52 colors used in Sampot Phamuong. The Phamuong Chorabap is a luxurious fabric using up to 22 needles to create. Phamuong variation are rabak, chorcung, anlounh, kaneiv and bantok. It usually uses floral and geometric motifs. The most valued silk used to create the Phamuong is Cambodian yellow silk, known for its fine quality in the region. New designs draw inspiration from ancient patterns on old silk.|$|R
50|$|Flannel, flannelette, {{and cotton}} flannel can be woven {{in either a}} <b>twill</b> <b>weave</b> or plain weave. The weave is often hidden by napping on one or both sides. After weaving, it is napped once, then bleached, dyed, or {{otherwise}} treated, and then napped a second time.|$|E
5000|$|Sheer fabrics {{are seldom}} {{made with a}} <b>twill</b> <b>weave.</b> Because a twill surface already has {{interesting}} texture and design, printed twills (where a design is printed on the cloth) are much less common than printed plain weaves. When twills are printed, this is typically done on lightweight fabrics.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>twill</b> <b>weave,</b> each weft or {{filling yarn}} floats across the warp yarns in a {{progression}} of interlacings {{to the right}} or left, forming a pattern of distinct diagonal lines. This diagonal pattern {{is also known as}} a wale. A float is the portion of a yarn that crosses over two or more perpendicular yarns.|$|E
50|$|Karamiori or Japanese Leno Weave {{includes}} all loom techniques that {{make use of}} intertwining threads to create {{the structure of the}} weave. Karamiori is an old and highly respected textile production method. The Japanese divide karaori into three basic styles based on structure: sha (紗), ro (絽), and ra (羅). Sha is the basic leno weave, Ro adds additional areas of flat or <b>twill</b> <b>weaves</b> and Ra maintains the concept of twisted threads but allows both warp and weft to be freed and recombined to form highly intricate weaves.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of textiles is a craft whose speed and scale of production has been altered almost beyond recognition by industrialization {{and the introduction}} of modern manufacturing techniques.
