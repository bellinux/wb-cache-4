5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Third Circuit, a three-judge panel of Judge Robert Cowen, Judge Morton Ira Greenberg and Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie {{unanimously}} held for the city. In a decision issued in 2015, Judge Vanaskie, writing for the Court, reiterated Judge McNulty's finding that Heffernan's actions in picking up the sign for his mother did not constitute protected speech or association. He distinguished the case at hand from the Sixth Circuit's ruling in Dye by noting <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> case, the employers had inferred the employees' intent from their non-participation in partisan politics rather than an actual action they had taken, as had occurred in Heffernan's case.|$|E

In an attempt to persuade him to stay, the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Newcastle offered him the Duchy of Lancaster, in addition to the position of Attorney General, an extra £6,000 a year, and a pension, and finally attempted to blackmail him by saying that if he accepted the office of Lord Chief Justice, the government would refuse to grant him a peerage. It was customary for all Lord Chief Justices to be given a peerage, and Murray responded by saying <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> situation he would refuse to become either Lord Chief Justice or Attorney General. Newcastle gave in, and promised to allow him to become Lord Chief Justice and to recommend him for a peerage.|$|E

25|$|Brussels {{was limited}} to the current 19 municipalities.

A political rift developed because French-speakers considered the language facilities as an essential right, while the Flemings saw the facilities as a temporary, transitional measure to allow the French-speaking minorities time to adapt to their Flemish surroundings.|$|E
25|$|The then current {{theory of}} colour held that white light was elementary, and that colours arose from {{mixtures}} {{of light and}} dark. Newton criticised this theory by noting <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> case a printed page, with its juxtaposition of light and dark, would look coloured. In folio 122 he recorded {{for the first time}} his notion that white light is heterogeneous and colour arise, not through the modification of a homogeneous white light, but from the separation of this mixture into its components. Newton also mentions Hooke's theory of colour, including his idea that it is a wave. Newton dismisses this theory with the remark that then light should bend around edges of objects as sounds does.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{views on the}} Bulgarian strategy: the first, {{supported}} by Knyaz Alexander I, saw the general battle on the Ihtiman heights.

Peter Benjamin Golden points out the possibility that the khaghans of the Turkic Khaganate, the Ashina, were themselves originally Indo-Europeans (possibly Iranian peoples) who later adopted the Turkic language but continued to use titles from their earlier Indo-European languages. German Turkologist W.-E. Scharlipp points out that many common terms in Turkic are Iranian in origin.|$|E

25|$|Ferdo Šišić {{considered}} that is impossible it directly originated {{from a personal}} name of an Avar ruler because the title needs a logical continuity. He doubted its existence among Slavic tribes during the great migration, and within early South Slavic principalities. He strongly supported the Šafárik thesis about Avar descendants in Lika, now dismissed by scholars, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> territory they had a separate governor whom they called bajan, from which after Avar assimilation, became Croatian title ban. The thesis of alleged Avar governor title Šišić based on his personal derivation of bajan from the title khagan. Nada Klaić advocated the same claims of Avars descendants in Lika, and considered bans and župans as Avar officials and governors.|$|E

25|$|Classical {{figures have}} not {{discussed}} {{the subject as}} it has only {{come up in the}} 19th century. Contemporaries have come up with several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran. The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).|$|E
25|$|Before {{the service}} arrived in Croatia, the Sustainable Development of Croatia party, {{together}} with the major taxi service companies were against it, stating {{that the price of}} Uber service doesn't include the prices for gas, car maintenance, passenger insurance, nor health and retirement insurance for the driver, and Uber prices also don't include VAT nor surtax. Ekotaksi taxi company stated how Uber would be breaking state laws about offering passenger transport service, saying how Uber drivers have no obligation to maintain passenger safety and service quality. Cammeo taxi service stated how if they themselves invest in their drivers, issue fiscalized receipts, pay VAT, <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> case they consider Uber to be unfair competition that is breaking many laws. Večernji list reported ORaH and the taxi services were planning an open letter to the Zagreb city council to prevent Uber from coming to the Croatian capital. In October 2015, Uber initiated service in Zagreb. In June 2016, the service also started operating in the coastal cities of Split and Dubrovnik, two important tourist locations. In September 2016, Jutarnji list reported that a group of taxi drivers attacked a Uber driver who was waiting for a passenger at the Zagreb Airport. The Uber driver canceled the drive before the passenger arrived and drove away, with the attackers following him. The attack was filmed by the victim and reported to the police.|$|E
25|$|Clodius {{sought to}} become a plebeian tribune {{so that he could}} enjoy the powers of these tribunes to pursue his revenge against Cicero. These powers {{included}} presiding over the plebeian council and propose bills to its vote and the power to veto the actions of the officers of state and the senatus consulta (written opinions of the senate on bills, which were presented for advice and usually followed to the letter). However, Clodius was a patrician and the plebeian tribunate was exclusively for plebeians. Therefore, he needed to be transferred to the plebeian order (transitio ad plebem) by being adopted into a plebeian family. In some letters written in 62 BC, the year after Clodius’s trial, Cicero wrote that Herrenius, a plebeian tribune, made frequent proposals to the plebeian council to transfer Clodius to the plebs, but he was vetoed by many of his colleagues. He also proposed a law to the plebeian council to authorise the comitia centuriata (the assembly of the soldiers) to vote on the matter. The consul Quintus Metellus Celer proposed an identical bill to the comitia centuriata. Later in the year, Cicero wrote that Metellus Celer was ‘offering Clodius ‘a splendid opposition’. The whole senate rejected it. Cassius Dio, instead, wrote <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> year Clodius actually got his transitio ad plebem and immediately sought the tribunate. However, he was not elected due to the opposition of Metellus Celer, who argued that his transitio ad plebem was not done in accordance with tradition because this had to be done according to the lex curiata, which provided that adrogatio should be performed in the comitia curiata. In other words, Metellus Celer argued that the adoption was illegal. Cassius Dio wrote that this ended the episode. During his consulship Caesar effected this transitio ad plebem and had him elected as plebeian tribune with the cooperation of Pompey. Clodius silenced Calpurnius Bibulus when he wanted to make a speech {{on the last day of}} his consulship in 59 BC and also attacked Cicero.|$|E
