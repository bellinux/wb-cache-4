5|$|Although {{the episode}} {{primarily}} mocks the Republican Party, the writers included several jokes {{at the expense}} of the Democratic Party, liberal and conservative politics, to try to be as neutral as possible. Writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were very interested in <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> and based a lot of the second act on that. Mark Kirkland directed the episode.|$|E
5|$|California native Chris Carter {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to produce new shows for the Fox network in the early 1990s.

5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to fallout from <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Polls {{showed that}} the {{majority}} of the public still disapproved of Truman's decision to relieve MacArthur, and were more inclined to agree with MacArthur than with Bradley or Marshall.

25|$|Gray goes on {{to point}} out {{that at the time of}} this lunch the Attorney General was Richard Kleindienst, who was never implicated in any of <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandals.</b> Even if Smith meant that he was talking about John Mitchell, the former Attorney General, Gray further points out that no one (outside of the conspirators) knew of Mitchell's {{involvement}} until the following April, when John Dean admitted as much to special prosecutors.|$|R

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to Arkansas {{and became a}} law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal.</b> Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, Clinton was elected.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> of the Nixon administration.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal,</b> Kennedy pushed {{campaign}} finance reform; he was a leading force behind passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which set contribution limits and established public financing for presidential elections. In April 1974, Kennedy travelled to the Soviet Union, where he met with leader Leonid Brezhnev and advocated a full nuclear test ban as well as relaxed emigration, gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents, and secured an exit visa for famed cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Kennedy's Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees continued to focus on Vietnam, especially after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.|$|E
5|$|It {{was rumored}} that Douglas {{would be given}} a {{political}} appointment in the Truman administration, but the Nixon-Douglas race had made such an appointment too controversial for the President. According to Democratic National Committee vice-chair India Edwards, a Douglas supporter, the former congresswoman {{could not have been}} appointed dogcatcher. In 1952, she returned to acting, and eight years later campaigned for John F. Kennedy during Nixon's first, unsuccessful presidential run. She also campaigned for George McGovern in his unsuccessful bid to prevent Nixon's 1972 reelection, and called for his ouster from office during <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hatfield's {{re-election}} {{victory for}} governor in 1962 and successful Senate campaign in 1966 made him something of a national figure. In 1968, Hatfield was on Richard Nixon's short list for vice president, and received the strong backing of his friend, the Rev. Billy Graham. Hatfield was considered too liberal by many conservatives and Southern moderates, and Nixon chose the more centrist Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew. Hatfield would later find himself at odds with Nixon over Vietnam and other issues, including a threat by Hatfield to reduce funding for the White House's legal department in 1973 during <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>Scandal,</b> after Nixon had failed to use funds appropriated for renovating dams on the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the Soviet Union {{reached the}} peak of its {{political}} and strategic power {{in relation to the}} United States. The first SALT Treaty effectively established parity in nuclear weapons between the two superpowers, the Helsinki Treaty legitimised Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe, and the United States defeat in Vietnam and <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> weakened the prestige of the United States. Brezhnev and Nixon also agreed to pass the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned both countries from designing systems that would intercept incoming missiles so that neither the U.S. or the Soviet Union would be tempted to strike the other without the fear of retaliation. The Soviet Union extended its diplomatic and political influence in the Middle East and Africa.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{used the}} story {{as a means to}} reflect {{contemporary}} anxieties and to deconstruct and parody the superhero concept. Watchmen depicts an alternate history where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> <b>scandal</b> was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and moral struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.|$|E
