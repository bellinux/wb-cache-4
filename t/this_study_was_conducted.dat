5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E
500|$|There is {{only one}} study that has {{measured}} the prevalence (total number of cases in a population) and incidence (annual number of new cases) of hypopituitarism. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> in Northern Spain and used hospital records in a well-defined population. [...] The study showed that 45.5 people out of 100,000 {{had been diagnosed with}} hypopituitarism, with 4.2 new cases per year. 61% were due to tumors of the pituitary gland, 9% due to other types of lesions, and 19% due to other causes; in 11% no cause could be identified.|$|E

2500|$|Once formed, first {{impressions}} {{tend to be}} stable. A {{review of the literature}} on the accuracy and impact of {{first impressions}} on rater-based assessments found that raters' first impressions are highly correlated with later scores, but it is unclear exactly why. One study tested stability by asking participants to form impressions people based purely on photographs. Participants' opinions of the people in photographs did not significantly differ after interacting with that person a month later. One potential reason for this stability is that one's first impressions could serve as a guide for his/her next steps, such as what questions are asked and how raters go about scoring. More research needs to be done on the stability of first impressions to fully understand how first impressions guide subsequent treatment, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the halo effect. Assessment tools can influence impressions too, for example if a question provides only a dichotomous [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] response or if a rater uses a scale (ratio). Although <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> with the intention of improving rating methods in medical education, the literature review was sufficiently broad enough to generalize.|$|E
