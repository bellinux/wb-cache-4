5|$|It is {{not exactly}} known how many Jews were helped by Żegota, but {{at one point in}} 1943 it had 2,500 Jewish {{children}} under its care in Warsaw alone. At the end of the war, Sendler attempted to locate their parents but nearly all of them had died at Treblinka. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of the Jews who survived the war (thus over 50,000) were aided in some shape or form by Żegota.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN states <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of the {{estimated}} total population lives in protected areas and 30% on private land. Protected areas that support major populations include Omo (Ethiopia), Serengeti, Katavi, Ruaha and Selous-Kilombero (Tanzania), Kafue and North Luangwa (Zambia), Nyika (Malawi), Etosha (Namibia), Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (Botswana/South Africa) and Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park (South Africa). Most of these populations appear to be stable. Relatively large numbers of common eland now live on private land, particularly in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, reflecting its value as a trophy animal. Common elands have also been widely domesticated in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Kenya, {{as well as in}} Russia and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood {{and most of}} the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they are entering ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles are getting into the ship's stores, they are {{a threat to the}} grain aboard the station. He examines the holds but learns that it is already too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk is literally buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> the tribbles in the hold are dead and many of the rest are dying, alerting them that the grain has been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E

An official in Uzbekistan's Ministry of Environment estimated <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of the country's population lives in regions where the water is severely polluted. The government estimated in 1995 that only 230 of the country's 8,000 industrial enterprises were following pollution control standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of mitempfindung {{is difficult to}} determine exactly, because many individuals would not be aware of having referred itch until the phenomenon is explained to them. Consequently, variability exists within the scientific literature as to the actual {{prevalence of}} referred itch in humans. Mittelmann (1920) has reported that 8 out of 9 people questioned experienced referred sensations. In 1973, Sterling reported <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of 20 healthy individuals questioned had mitempfindung.|$|E

War wounded were estimated as at least 50,000, of which about 20,000 were serious injuries, but this estimate was expected to rise. However, there was no independent verification of the Health Minister's statement and, one month later, the NTC reduced the estimated number of killed to 25,000.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{study of}} seven trepanated crania from Monte Albán showed a {{combination}} of single and multiple elliptical holes drilled or worn into the cranial cap, performed exclusively on the upper Parietal bones. The sample crania were from {{both male and female}} adults, and evidence of healing around the perforations suggested <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> had survived the operation. Most of the skulls in the study showed signs of earlier cranial damage, indicating (as with the Andean examples) that the operations were an attempt to repair or alleviate this head-trauma.|$|E

25|$|The {{two major}} {{risk factors for}} esophageal squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} are tobacco (smoking or chewing) and alcohol. The combination of tobacco and alcohol has a strong synergistic effect. Some data suggest <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of all cases are due to tobacco and about one-third to alcohol, while over three-quarters of the cases in men are due to the combination of smoking and heavy drinking. Risks associated with alcohol appear {{to be linked to}} its aldehyde metabolite and to mutations in certain related enzymes. Such metabolic variants are relatively common in Asia.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} to single-man operation meant <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> of the company's workforce was suddenly surplus. Many employees {{found it hard}} to get work and were often forced to take strange shifts. One worker recorded having a 17-hour shift from 4:24p.m. on Sunday to 9:49a.m. on Monday. There was a company union, although it hadn't done much good. By October 1933, the workers had gained backing from Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson, St. Paul Mayor William Mahoney and the National Recovery Administration, among others. The next year, the workers voted to join the Amalgamated Transit Union.|$|E
25|$|It has {{traditionally}} been considered less problematic to eat dairy products before meat, {{on the assumption that}} dairy products leave neither fatty residue in the throat, nor fragments between the teeth. Many 20th century Orthodox rabbis say that washing the mouth out between eating dairy and meat is sufficient. Some argue that there should also be recitation of a closing blessing before the meat is eaten, and others view this as unnecessary. Ashkenazi Jews following kabbalistic traditions, based on the Zohar, additionally ensure <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> an hour passes after consuming dairy produce before eating meat.|$|E
