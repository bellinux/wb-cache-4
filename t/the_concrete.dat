On the Karuizawa Studio, workmen polished <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> with sand and straw to reveal the texture of the aggregate. Whilst at Nanzan University, the south facing facades were cast with checkerboard patterns, with applied metalwork casting abstract shadows on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Recently the Canning Dam {{has been}} {{subjected}} to considerable cracking of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that cracking was due to strong AAR (alkali aggregate reactivity) in <b>the</b> <b>concrete.</b> AAR results in swelling of <b>the</b> <b>concrete,</b> which may cause secondary compressive stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including Fontana Dam in Tennessee and Pian Telessio dam in Italy among others.|$|E

40|$|This {{experimental}} work investigates {{the impact of}} substituting part of the conventional aggregates with rubber aggre-gates on certain characteristics of <b>the</b> cement <b>concretes.</b> This incorporation of rubber aggregates resulting from cutting worn tires in practical sizes decreases the mechanical resistances of <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> while improving slightly the fluidity of the tested mixtures. The effect of these aggregates on the shrinkage of <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> {{at an early age}} is appreciable and even very interesting for <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> used, for example, in road construction. This technique of cutting worn tires without any further treatment makes it accessible to everyone which helps not only in saving the environment by getting rid of this cumbersome waste but also in saving traditional aggregates...|$|R

40|$|Fly ash based geopolymer is an {{emerging}} alternative binder to cement for making <b>concrete.</b> <b>The</b> cracking, spalling and residual strength behaviours of geopolymer concrete were studied {{in order to}} understand its fire endurance, which is essential for its use as a building material. Fly ash based geopolymer and ordinary portland cement (OPC) concrete cylinder specimens were exposed to fires at different temperatures up to 1000 °C, with a heating rate of that given in the International Standards Organization (ISO) 834 standard. Compressive strength of <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> varied in <b>the</b> range of 39 – 58 MPa. After the fire exposures, <b>the</b> geopolymer <b>concrete</b> specimens were found to suffer less damage in terms of cracking than <b>the</b> OPC <b>concrete</b> specimens. <b>The</b> OPC <b>concrete</b> cylinders suffered severe spalling for 800 and 1000 °C exposures, while there was no spalling in <b>the</b> geopolymer <b>concrete</b> specimens. <b>The</b> geopolymer <b>concrete</b> specimens generally retained higher strength than <b>the</b> OPC <b>concrete</b> specimens. <b>The</b> Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images of geopolymer concrete showed continued densification of the microstructure with the increase of fire temperature.

40|$|This {{study is}} to relate the {{mechanical}} and durability properties of high performance metakaolin (MK) and silica fume concretes to their microstructure characteristics. The compressive strength and chloride penetrability of the control and <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> incorporated with MK or silica fume (SF) at water-to-binder (w/b) ratios of 0. 3 and 0. 5 are determined. The pore size distribution and porosity of <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> are also measured. The effect of MK and SF on the interfacial porosity is discussed based on test results. It is found that MK concrete has superior strength development and similar chloride resistance to SF <b>concrete,</b> and <b>the</b> MK <b>concrete</b> at a w/b of 0. 3 has a lower porosity and smaller pore sizes than <b>the</b> control (plain) <b>concrete.</b> <b>The</b> resistance of <b>the</b> <b>concretes</b> to chloride ion penetration correlates better with <b>the</b> measured <b>concrete</b> porosity than with the paste porosity. The differences between the measured and calculated concrete porosity is smaller for MK and SF incorporated <b>concrete</b> than for <b>the</b> control <b>concrete,</b> indicating an improvement in the interfacial microstructure with the incorporation of the pozzolanas.
