Sixty cylinders of synthetic bone and 60 seven-hole 3. 5 mm locking reconstruction plates were used. Each cylinder of synthetic bone was equally divided to simulate a gap fracture of 10 mm. Two groups of bone-plate constructs were mounted: Group 1 - three monocortical screws in each fracture side, Group 2 - three bicortical screws in each fracture side. In both groups, the area of the fracture gap was maintained without screw. To establish the loads for fatigue testing, for each group nine bone-plate constructs were tested until failure, each three in compression, bending, and torsion.

40|$|Seventy eight {{measurements}} of Mg/Ca {{were obtained from}} <b>tests</b> of <b>G.</b> ruber white from the core GeoB 16204 - 2. The range of Mg/Ca results were from 4. 4 mmol. mol- 1 up to 5. 4 mmol. mol- 1. The mean value was 4. 8 mmol. mol- 1 with standard deviation, 0. 22 mmol. mol- 1. The range of d 18 O G. ruber results was from - 2. 3 per mil up to - 1. 4 per mil with mean value of - 1. 89 per mil and standard deviation of 0. 14 per mil. The d 13 C results range was from 0. 9 per mil to 1. 93 per mil with mean value of 1. 38 per mil and standard deviation of 0. 15 per mil. From {{the bottom of the}} core to 170 cm, the isotope values were obtained in the <b>tests</b> of <b>G.</b> ruber (s. s.) and from 170 cm up to the core top, the values were obtained from <b>tests</b> of <b>G.</b> ruber (s. l.) ...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of master}} plans at botanical gardens was studied {{for the purpose}} of {{identifying}} particular characteristics in successful master plan implementation. Twenty existing master plans were analyzed to provide background information about typical content, format, and professionals involved with development of master plans. In addition, fifty surveys were conducted with Directors of botanical gardens and arboreta. Twenty questions were posed to the Directors to define the extent of master plan implementation (i. e. use) at the garden and to identify the factors that affect implementation. Log-likelihood ratio <b>tests</b> (<b>G</b> <b>tests)</b> were performed to evaluate the data. Eighty-eight percent of the institutions surveyed reported that they implement a master plan at the garden. Significant relationships were observed between use of the master plan and the following factors: hiring a landscape architecture firm; involvement of staff, Boards of Directors, and the community; and inclusion of key sections, graphics, and the institution's mission statement. Based on these results, guidelines for master plan development and implementation are presented...|$|R
