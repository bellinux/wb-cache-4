40|$|We have {{identified}} a 55 kDa protein, named GRASP 55 (Golgi reassembly <b>stacking</b> protein <b>of</b> 55 kDa), as a component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golgi <b>stacking</b> machinery. GRASP 55 is homologous to GRASP 65, an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive membrane protein required for <b>the</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> Golgi cisternae in a cell-free system. GRASP 65 exists in a complex with the vesicle docking protein receptor GM 130 to which it binds directly, and the membrane tethering protein p 115, which also functions in <b>the</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> Golgi cisternae. GRASP 55 binding to GM 130, could not be detected using biochemical methods, although a weak interaction was detected with the yeast two-hybrid system. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that GRASP 65, like GM 130, is present on the cis-Golgi, while GRASP 55 is on the medial-Golgi. Recombinant GRASP 55 and antibodies to the protein block <b>the</b> <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> Golgi cisternae, {{which is similar to}} the observations made for GRASP 65.

25|$|A {{standard}} multi-layer {{ceramic capacitor}} has many opposing electrode layers stacked inside connected with two outer terminations. The X2Y ceramic chip capacitor however is a 4 terminal chip device. It is constructed like a standard two-terminal MLCC {{out of the}} stacked ceramic layers with an additional third set of shield electrodes incorporated in the chip. These shield electrodes surround each existing electrode within <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> the capacitor plates and are low ohmic contacted with two additional side terminations across to the capacitor terminations. The X2Y construction results in a three-node capacitive circuit that provides simultaneous line-to-line and line-to-ground filtering.|$|E

This creates a smaller square wall the length of about half of each stack, with walls extended away from each corner of the square.

25|$|Manufacturers {{of these}} items must take into {{consideration}} when creating these products whether the product {{could be construed as}} counterfeiting. Overlapping note images and/or changing the dimensions of the reproduction to be at least 50% smaller or 50% larger than the original is one way to avoid the risk of being considered a counterfeit. But in cases where realism is the goal, other steps may be necessary. For example, in <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> bank notes seat mentioned earlier, the decal used to create the product would be considered counterfeit. However, once the decal has been affixed to the resin stack shell and cannot be peeled off, the final product is no longer at risk of being classified as counterfeit, even though the resulting appearance is realistic.|$|E

Another trick he used was to magnetically print his account number on blank deposit slips and add them to <b>the</b> <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> real blank slips in the bank. This meant that the deposits written on those slips by bank customers entered his account rather than the accounts of the legitimate customers.|$|E
