In September 2012, Richard Seymour of The Guardian described how she [...] "fluffed her lines" [...] {{during an interview}} with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby following her announcement of Labour's public service policy review. Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, {{in which she was}} repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as [...] "articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. It would be unfair to condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; she ought to be applauded for it, but <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> we live in a sound-bite age." [...] Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, [...] "despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one, [...] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating."

500|$|Librarian Nancy Knapp {{pointed out}} the books' {{potential}} to improve literacy by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would. The seven-book series has a word count of 1,083,594 (US edition). Agreeing about the motivating effects, Diane Penrod also praised the books' blending of simple entertainment with [...] "the qualities of highbrow literary fiction", but {{expressed concern about the}} distracting effect of the prolific merchandising that accompanies the book launches. However, the assumption that Harry Potter books have increased literacy among young people is [...] "largely a folk legend." [...] Research by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the Harry Potter publishing phenomenon, nor has the broader downward trend in reading among Americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the Harry Potter books. The research also found that children who read Harry Potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres. NEA chairman Dana Gioia said the series, [...] "got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books. <b>The</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> that one Harry Potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading." ...|$|E
500|$|Not every 20th-century critic opined {{primarily}} {{on the quality of}} the final lines when discussing the success or failure of the poem; Sidney Colvin, in 1920, explained that [...] "while imagery drawn from the sculptures on Greek vases was still floating through his mind, he was able to rouse himself to a stronger effort and produce a true masterpiece in his famous Ode on a Grecian Urn." [...] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: [...] "Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. <b>The</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> that it is a little too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant to go... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has said more than he meant—or wished to mean." [...] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a [...] "tense ethereal beauty" [...] with a [...] "touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency" [...] of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, [...] "as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Troubles</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} within {{the fictional world}} {{represented}} in the American/Canadian supernatural TV series, Haven, which premiered on July 9, 2010, on Syfy. The series revolves around {{the resolution of the}} crises caused when a characters' <b>Troubles</b> <b>are</b> triggered, usually by emotional stress.

5000|$|Like Muldoon's, Carson's work is {{intensely}} allusive. In much of {{his poetry}} he has a project of sociological scope: to evoke Belfast in encyclopaedic detail.

2500|$|... "They {{see that}} the {{dominant}} feminist paradigm {{is based on an}} unacknowledged model of centre and periphery. In this model, Indigenous, African-descendent, and poor women occupy the periphery and must accept the ideas and conceptualization of feminism as defined by those at the centre. In other words, we Indigenous women are expected to accept the dominant picture of what constitutes women's oppression and women's liberation. [...] <b>The</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>is,</b> this picture is only a partial match with our own experiences. Elements of our experience that do not match this picture are denied or marginalized. This dominant model tries to homogenize the women's movement, claiming that all women have the same demands and the same access to the enjoyment of their rights. This flawed assumption denies the diverse cultural, linguistic and social needs and visions of distinct groups of women."Indigenous Feminist scholars have resisted the cooptation and exploitation of their scholarship as another result of colonialism. As a collective, various Indigenous feminist scholars have called for [...] "the profound need for transparency and responsibility in light of the traumatic histories of colonization, slavery, and genocide that shape the present" [...] in order to ensure Indigenous feminism is informed by decolonization.|$|E

2500|$|On June 2, 1924, Du Bois visited Fisk on the {{occasion}} of his daughter Yolanda's graduation, and gave a speech to Fisk students, alumni and guests in connection with the University's commencement exercises. Du Bois was an outspoken critic of Fisk Presidents. In spring 1908, Du Bois visited Fisk to give the university's commencement address, and used the opportunity to criticize President Merrill's addition of industrial coursework at Fisk. While Merrill had no intent to industrialize the Fisk curriculum, the fallout from Du Bois's speech and continued problems fund raising led him to drop the proposal and submit his resignation three months later. [...] Fisk had recently announced the one million dollar fund fully subscribed and irrevocable, and Du Bois sensed the timing to challenge the administration. In front of a packed Fisk Memorial Chapel, and with McKenzie and his wife sitting in the front row, Du Bois declared, [...] "I have come to address you and, I say frankly, I have come to criticize." [...] Asserting that [...] "I have never known an institution whose alumni on the whole are more bitter and disgusted with the present situation in this university than the alumni of Fisk University today." [...] Du Bois endeavored to inform the administration [...] "openly and before your face what so many of your graduates are saying secretly behind your back." [...] Du Bois attacked the Fisk administration as sinister. [...] "For a long time a powerful section of the white South has offered to give its consent and countenance to the higher training of Negroes only on condition that the white South control and guide that education." [...] Du Bois protested that Fisk sold out to Northern foundations and Southern White interests in pursuit of fiscal security. Du Bois remarked, [...] "Of all the essentials that make an institution of learning, money is the least." [...] "And it is possible that for a million dollars the authorities of Fisk University have been asked either openly or by implication to sell to the white South the control of this institution." [...] Du Bois challenged the Fisk code of student conduct and discipline. [...] "I do not for a moment doubt that the object which Fisk today wishes to gain by her discipline are in themselves perfectly good objects," [...] "but <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>is</b> that she is trying to accomplish her ends by methods which are medieval, and long since discredited." [...] Du Bois suggested students learned discipline through freedom, and lamented, [...] "self-expression and manhood are choked at Fisk in the very day when we need expression to develop manhood in the colored race." [...] Du Bois accused Fisk administrators allowing segregated ticket windows and seating at a Jubilee Singers concert, and of McKenzie leading female members of the Fisk Glee Club through the servants' entrance to sing for Southern White men. Du Bois called on alumni to reclaim Fisk's spirit, and proclaimed, [...] "the alumni of Fisk University are and of right ought to be, the ultimate source of authority in the policy and government" [...] of the University. He argued that alumni had no voice in the policies of Fisk, and complained alumni serving as board members were selected by McKenzie and other trustees and [...] "may not represent the opinion of the alumni." [...] Du Bois encouraged alumni to make public, [...] "what is happening at Fisk University," [...] to organize in order to save Fisk, and to demand elective representation on the board of trustees. Du Bois argued that until conditions at Fisk changed for the better, students should boycott the University.|$|E
