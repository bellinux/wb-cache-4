50|$|While the Karen {{people of}} the Pegu Hills had {{initially}} been unwilling to adopt the <b>taungya</b> <b>system,</b> increased enclosure and agreements with British Colonial authorities meant that by the 1890s most Karen {{had no choice but}} to adapt. These same people came to feel left in the lurch when the British Government began to shift its focus to cheaper and less labor-intensive methods of teak extraction in Upper Burma. Karen who had bought into the <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> felt sold out when they could no longer count on the government to pay them for their compliance. Those who had avoided adopting the system and continued shifting cultivation found that most was either under permanent cultivation or taungya. These feelings were heightened when taungya was phased out in 1935.|$|E
5000|$|While the <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> of {{simultaneously}} growing teak {{and other}} crops was espoused by the British, shifting cultivation was and has remained the norm in Burma. Due to its precolonial roots and perceived inefficiencies, it is often characterized as backwards. However, some scholars find this assessment to be flawed given the political independence that it gave to its practitioners [...] While the <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> did entail shifting cultivation, it ran counter to {{the goals of the}} Karen. The initial steps of logging and burning meant the destruction of the native forest. The forest, along with the hills, naturally isolated the Karen from the rest of Burma. Taungya also meant that the British or their agents would return to the previously cut areas after some years to harvest the newly planted teak. This increased traffic through their territory would also impact their secluded status. Given their suspicion of the lowland states they were isolated from, the British included, the Karen were reluctant to lose this protection.|$|E
50|$|Early {{efforts to}} {{introduce}} taungya to Burmese teak productions {{started in the}} Pegu Hills, between the Irrawaddy and Sittaung rivers in central Burma. The people that the British imagined would implement their <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> of teak cultivation were ethnic Karens who had been residents of the region for generations without incorporation into the lowland Burman culture. Avoidance of the lowland has long been key to the identity and survival of the Karen people. Some, like the political scientist James C. Scott, argue that Karen civilization has been carefully organized {{with the goal of}} lessening the influence of the dominant empire of the time, be it Burmese or British This tendency often meant that Karens choose to live in upland areas where they would be out of immediate reach of such states. Given this heritage, many Karen living in the Pegu Hills were reluctant to integrate themselves into the <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> that the British devised. In addition to opposing it for the political power it gave the British, they found the practice of a form of agriculture unpracticed by their fore-bearers culturally threatening.|$|E

30|$|Agroforestry {{systems in}} India {{include the use}} of trees grown on farms, {{community}} forestry and a variety of local forest management and ethnoforestry practices (Pandey, 1998). The Indian Council of Agricultural Research has classified systems used in different agro-climatic zones as silvipasture, agrisilviculture or agrihorticulture based on irrigated or rain-fed conditions. The practice of growing scattered trees on farmland is quite old. These trees are used for shade, fodder, fuelwood, food and medicinal purposes. Eucalypts and poplars are also grown in fields or on farm boundaries in the Punjab and Haryana. Traditional agroforestry systems include such practice of growing trees on farmlands used for fodder, fuelwood and vegetables etc. along with shifting cultivation in the Northeast India and Taungya cultivation. The <b>Taungya</b> 2 cultivation <b>system</b> is used in Kerala, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh and to a limited extent in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Karnataka, {{as well as in the}} Northeast hill regions. In addition, home gardens, tea plantation, wood lots and alder (Alnus spp.) -based agriculture are other kinds of agroforestry systems prevailing in India.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{directly}} {{on the heels of}} taungya came another form of teak exploitation. This system, which eventually {{came to be known as}} the Myanmar Selection System reduced the British Empire's dependency on the local Karen people. This method entails dividing an area of forest into thirty sections of roughly equal area, one of which is logged every thirty years. However, to put this system into place, the colonial government needed greater control of the forest than the <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> entailed. To do so, in 1870, the British government created the first enclosure that prevented natives from cutting teak and other woods. Without locals interfering with teak and other woods, the government was free to enact new forestry policies. By 1879 it had reserved 1,410 square miles of forest.|$|E
5000|$|Between the 1870s and the 1930s, the <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> {{became less}} and less {{supported}} as a method for harvesting teak. In 1885, the British Empire won the Third Anglo-Burmese War and took control of Upper Burma. Control of this region gave the Empire access to an even larger supply of teak. However, taungya was not the most effective manner to exploit this newly acquired bounty. Most of Upper Burma was remote, and the British Forest Department {{did not have the}} resources to administer the taungya systems in the area. Instead the government selectively felled teak without the providing continuous employment for locals. Taungya also suffered in the Pugu Hills. As the British consolidated their control of Burma, they depended {{less and less}} on the cooperation of the Karen people to retain their power. Therefore, they were able offer less beneficial terms to taungya practitioners. Over time, this led to a decline in its use among Karen in the Pegu Hills.|$|E
5000|$|Because the Karen {{were more}} {{interested}} in maintaining their independence than uniting economically with the British, the implementation of Taungya required the use of force. The British government seized {{on the fact that the}} Karen had no legal title to the land that they occupied, and had occupied for generations. Teak tracts in the Pegu Hills were pronounced state property. The government also made it illegal to burn or damage teak trees within these forests. This law effectively criminalized traditional Karen agricultural practices. Due to the wide distribution of teak in the Pegu Hills, almost any location that a Karen farmer could choose to clear would contain some trees. The British government now found itself in a position to fine or prosecute most of the people living in the area. However, the new laws were difficult to enforce. Breakage was rampant and the British criminal justice system was underfunded and ineffectual. It took until 1869 for a concrete and successful push to implement taungya to be made. At this point, the colonial government, tired of Karen resistance, began to make deals with villages promising them plots of land for permanent cultivation in return for their labor in the <b>taungya</b> <b>system.</b> This arrangement was a major concession for Karen villagers as it entailed abandoning the shifting cultivation they had traditionally practiced.|$|E

The problems are a mix of technical, economic and social. It was found that the costs of establishing the taungya is comparable with that for establishment of industrial forest plantations but technical problems such as the lack of soil preparation, poor quality seed and inadequate fertiliser application techniques resulted in very low yields of the intercrops. This was exacerbated by protection problems and significant damage by birds and browsing animals further reduced yields. Some of these problems may be overcome by guarding the taungya fields and planting crops such as fibre producers which need less protection.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for wood, fibre and pulp coupled with efforts to mitigate {{greenhouse gas emission}} has put immense importance {{on the development of}} forest plantations. The rapidly growing human population will also face shortage of food, particularly in developing world where agricultural productivity is generally low. The <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> – an age-old agroforestry practice involving intercropping of crops with trees on the same unit of land – is opined as a win-win strategy {{to meet the needs of}} wood products and food at the same time. In recent years, the <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> has gained increasing attention by big forest companies as a tool and an opportunity to contribute to the social well-being of the local community. Stora Enso Lao Co, Ltd is one of these forest companies that adopted the <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> in its commercial Eucalyptus plantations in Laos. The tree spacing commonly used is 9 × 1 m, and 5 × 2 m on a trial basis. Eucalyptus camaldulensis was intercropped with rice and cassava, and stands were established in 2007 (7 -yr old) and in 2012 (2 -yr old). The main objective of this thesis was to examine whether the intercropping has an effect on the root system of trees; thereby generating knowledge that supports evidence-based plantation management decisions involving <b>taungya</b> <b>system.</b> The key research questions were: (a) Does intercropping of rice/cassava with Eucalyptus influence the horizontal and vertical distributions of root biomass of trees compared with monoculture plantation of different spacing? (b) Does spacing (5 × 2 m versus 9 × 1 m) influence the horizontal and vertical distributions of root biomass of trees intercropped with rice? (c) Does root biomass differ between young (2 -yr old) and mature (7 -yr old) intercropped stands with 9 × 1 m spacing compared with monoculture plantation? If so, does the effect vary in relation to distance from the tree and soil depth? To characterize the root system architecture, trenches were made on six young trees in both pure monoculture and intercropped stands. To quantitatively estimate root biomass, a total of 324 soil cores (6 stands × 6 trees × 3 distances × 3 soil depths) was collected, roots sorted and dried to constant mass in an oven at 60 °C for 48 hours. The root dry mass data were subjected to analysis of variance to examine significant effects of intercropping, spacing and stand age. The results show that (1) the root system of E. camaldulensis is mainly confined to shallow depth but well elongated horizontally in both pure and intercropped stands with 4 - 6 thick lateral roots; (2) Intercropping of rice/cassava with Eucalyptus has no effect on total root dry mass of the tree component (p > 0. 05) irrespective of the plantation models (5 × 2 m or 9 × 1 m); however root biomass decreases with increasing horizontal distance from the tree base and in deeper soil layer; particularly for trees in young stands; (3) The effects of spacing design, narrow (5 × 2 m) versus wide (9 × 1 m), on root dry mass are dependent on horizontal and vertical distribution of the root system; and root biomass appears to be higher at 40 cm soil depth for the stand with narrow spacing between trees and crops than stands with wider spacing; (4) Root biomass was larger for older than younger trees in both monoculture and intercropped stands; suggesting lack of carry-over effect of intercropping on root biomass. As root biomass varies with horizontal distribution, further research is recommended to test buffer zones between trees and crops other than 1 m (which is currently used) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Forest {{plantation}} {{costs can}} be reduced by the income from annual crops that are intercropped with trees. An experiment was carried out over two years to assess the viability of agroforestry systems including sabiá (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia), gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and maize (cultivar AG 1051). In 2010, the legumes were grown both as monocrops and intercropped (<b>taungya</b> <b>system)</b> with maize in randomized blocks with five replications. Three rows of maize were planted between two rows of each legume (at a spacing of 4. 0 m x 4. 0 m). In 2011, the legumes were cut down, and the young branches and leaves {{were added to the}} areas of intercropped cultivation (alley cropping system). Gliricidia had lower plant height than sabiá. Moreover, while not affecting for gliricidia, intercropping increased plant height for sabiá. Intercropping reduced green ear yield but not grain yield and reduced the cost of introducing reforestation. Intercropping using the alley system reduced the total number and mass of green ears, as well as grain yield, but did not influence the yield of marketable green ears. Finally, producing green ears was more profitable than producing grain and maize monocropping provided a higher net income than intercropping...|$|E
40|$|In {{agroforestry}} systems, annual plants {{closest to}} trees may behave differently from plants in rows {{that are more}} distant. This study evaluated the proximity effects of Mimosa caesalpiniifolia (sabiá) and Gliricidia sepium (gliricidia) on corn yield under the taungya and alley cropping systems. The two species were evaluated, in randomised blocks with five replications, in 2010 and 2011, under taungya and alley cropping, respectively. Three rows of corn (left, middle, and right) were grown between two rows of trees. Sabiá trees grew higher than gliricidia trees. The difference in crown diameter between species depended on plant age. There was a linear relationship between plant age and plant height and between plant age and crown diameter for both sabiá and gliricidia trees. In the <b>taungya</b> <b>system,</b> left rows produced more green ears than middle and right rows, but grain yield was higher in middle rows.

40|$|Natural {{resource}} management literature has documented three paradigm shifts {{over the past}} decade: from co-management to adaptive co-management and adaptive governance respectively and, more recently, towards landscape governance.

Drawing on case studies and expert consultation, the performance of the national MTS and the MTS under the Community Forestry Management Project is reviewed with regard to five principles (integrated approach, multi-stakeholder negotiation, polycentric governance, continual learning and adaptive capacity) and three enabling conditions (social capital, bridging organisations and long-term funding) distilled from the literature.

It addresses the question of what the major dimensions of social safeguards are and how the MTS does relate to these characteristics. Based on a survey of 146 MTS farmers and qualitative methods, results revealed that the MTS potentially meets several of the social safeguard mechanisms distinguished by the IoI Project Team (legal security for forest users, soft law enforcement by creating incentives for adaptation, benefit sharing, capacity building, alternative livelihoods/employment and expanding the resource base). The most promising of these is based on the expansion of areas with planted trees that will become available as legal timber in the future.

40|$|The {{formulation}} {{and implementation}} of an adaptation strategy is of growing concern to governments. The adaptation policy framework (APF) sets out indicative activities and features of an adaptation strategy. Understanding {{the extent to which}} existing practices can support adaptation in societies and ecosystems is an important step towards the solution. This study uses vulnerability, policy and financial analyses to investigate the compatibility of the modified <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> (MTS) (a reforestation programme) in Ghana with the indicative activities of the APF. The findings indicate that MTS takes into consideration most of the activities of an adaptation strategy, is a profitable venture (BCR > 1) and has a high potential to reduce vulnerability due to short-term food production and long-term plantation establishment. Resource management in MTS is promising in the short term, but challenges remain to meet livelihood and adaptation needs in the medium and long term. Policy instruments related to MTS align with the forestry, climate change and the development goals of Ghana. We conclude that MTS is a potential win–win practice for forestry and adaptation. The legalization of all contractual arrangements coupled with continuous monitoring, evaluation and improvement may drive MTS to become a lasting activity that will support the long-term horizon of an adaptation strategy...|$|E

Stem canker was judged {{to be the most}} dangerous disease. Invasion of disease in uncut forest (control) was low level compared with cutting treatments, but difference of disease invasion between the forests with different cutting intensities was not clear because of low numbers of sample trees.

Results indicate {{that the lack of}} regular income from timber until tree harvesting, the delay in signing MTS agreements, the absence of a clear mechanism for sharing the 40 % timber benefits among individual farmers, restrictions on tree and crop species allowed under the MTS, and inadequate support and supervision from the implementing agency demotivate farmers to invest labour in farm maintenance. The study also reveals that the quality of partnership among the actors impacts on the performance of the scheme: a co-management arrangement exclusively between the Forestry Commission and MTS farmer groups generated poorer results in terms {{of the quality of the}} timber stands, income-generating potential and motivation of the actors involved. The continued commitment of both participating farmer groups and coordinating agencies is key to the performance of the MTS. Lastly, the prospects for future income from timber revenues determine to a large extent farmers’ commitment to tree maintenance in the MTS. Linking up with the concepts of interactive and landscape governance and partnerships, the authors make recommendations to overcome these challenges...|$|E

Result revealed that some benefits derived from Agro-forestry practices such as production of food (88. 0 %), fodder for animal consumption (2. 4 %), employment (2. 4 %), revenue generation (64. 3 %), and human welfare (71. 5 %) has improved the farmer’s socio- economic livelihood in the locality by boosting income earning potentials while 71. 5 % of the respondents boldly reported on the generation of income, provision of food and provision of fuel wood and charcoal. Agro-forestry practices have greatly influenced the livelihood of the people (69. 0 %) through the improvement in food production. The common tree species identified in the study area include; Tectona grandis(92. 9 %), Terminalia ivorensis(7. 1 %), Gmelina arborea, Nauclea diderrichii etc. While the food crops commonly planted include yam, cassava, plantain, maize, pineapple etc. 97. 0 % of the respondents lack the basic social amenities like health centre (2. 4 %), electricity supply (30. 9 %), lack of good road (97. 6 %) and provision of credit facilities (30. 9 %). Government and NGOs should gear up efforts to create awareness of tree planting campaign as 97. 6 % of respondents were involved in <b>Taungya</b> <b>system</b> of farming...|$|E

In view of this, the contributions of agroforestry (AF) to enhancing food security and environmental conservation were assessed. The study {{was carried out in}} Ondo state, Nigeria, situated in the tropical rainforest ecological zone. Data were collected with pre-tested questionnaires administered to 300 farmers -household heads, randomly selected from four Local Government Areas (LGAs). Information was gathered on farmers’ awareness of and involvement in AF systems, willingness to plant, retain or take care of trees planted, farm location and sizes, tree species commonly retained/planted on farmland, major causes of deforestation, extension education in AF and other information relevant to the study. Data were analyzed using a descriptive statistics and χ 2 model. Results revealed that the primary occupation {{of the majority of the}} respondents (80 %) is farming. Land is mainly obtained through lease from landowners (52 %). This is followed by those who inherited land (26 %). Very few respondents (6 %) have their farms on government land through AF (Approved <b>Taungya</b> <b>System).</b> Most farmers (67 %) were willing to plant, retain and take care of trees on their farmland to provide shade for crops, for edible fruits, timber and firewood, erosion and leaching control, biodiversity conservation, reduction of global warming, and increased crop yield. Average yearly crop yield (cassava and maize) from AF farms was 750 kg/ha against 630 kg/ha for non-AF farms. Agroforestry is a means of increasing food production and at the same time, it makes wood available to rural dwellers. However, there is a need to improve both formal and informal AF education among the rural communities for agroforestry to become more widely accepted by local populations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} of research carried {{out under the}} TBI Ghana/University of Amsterdam/KNUST ‘Governance for sustainable forest-related livelihoods in Ghana’s High Forest Zone’ programme. The paper starts out by presenting the objectives and components of the programme and the methods employed in the studies carried out thus far. After that, the main features and challenges of the forest governance process are presented. Moreover, it shows {{that in spite of}} the intention to promote co-management with participation of forest fringe communities, the prevailing mode of governance is still hierarchical, characterised by vertical relationships between the state and non-state actors in forest governance. Against this governance context, the authors perform a detailed analysis of the actors involved in forest governance and livelihoods, distinguishing between statutory, customary, market, civil society and hybrid governing structures. Actors use forest and tree resources for their livelihoods in various ways. A more detailed examination is carried out of the contribution of two major forest-related activities to rural livelihoods, namely non-timber forest product extraction and farming under the Modified <b>Taungya</b> <b>System.</b> The last part of the paper outlines different kinds of forest and tree-related conflicts that inevitably arise due to the multiple governing structures and wide variety of actors and their conflicting interests. The authors present three ‘fishbone’ or cause-effect diagrams, which clarify the kind and causes of such conflicts occurring, respectively, in (1) forest reserves, (2) off-reserve areas and (3) both forest and off-reserve areas. The authors conclude that various cross-links exist between the TBI-Ghana/UvA/KNUST programme and the EU Voluntary Partnership Agreement as regards combating illegal logging, with both aiming to improve livelihoods and governance. Key to these improvements is reducing forest and tree-related conflicts, reconciling interests and creating partnerships between the various actors involved in forest governance and management...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{forest cover}} {{dynamics}} {{is important for}} a nation’s environmental, social and political commitments. In the past decade, Myanmar had the highest deforestation rate, in mainland South East Asia (Hansen et al., 2013). Further, in 2009, Myanmar embarked on a landmark political change from military regime to democratic transition which significantly impacted its forest cover. Myanmar also ranks first with respect to forest fires in South/Southeast Asia. In Myanmar, forest cover loss and fire are intrinsically linked through the traditional <b>taungya</b> <b>system</b> of slash and burn. Thus, quantifying factors controlling forest fires in Myanmar is an important topic that needs attention. Although the Myanmar government established protected areas throughout the country to conserve forests, their effectiveness remains unevaluated. This dissertation aims to understand {{the current status of}} forest cover dynamics in Myanmar. The five chapters in this dissertation address the impact of the political transition on forest cover loss and fragmentation, fire disturbance in tropical evergreen and deciduous forests including the factors controlling vegetation fires in the protected and non-protected forests. The dissertation contributes to the existing knowledge in land cover and land use change science (LCLUC), ii especially the impact of institutional changes on forest cover in the tropics. The analysis of the relationship between forest loss, fire and effectiveness of the protected areas addressed in the study, contributes to regional knowledge on fire and conservation science respectively. The findings of this dissertation depict that in Myanmar, the political transition to democracy significantly influenced its forest cover. Our analysis showed that during 2001 - 2014, a total loss of 2, 030, 101 ha of forest occurred at the rate of 145, 007. 21 ha/year with a linear increase of 15, 359 (± 1793) ha/year. The observed increase in variance in between 2008 - 2011 coincides with political transition period which started with the formation of the new Constitution in 2008 and ended with the military government handing over power to the democratic government in 2011. Analysis of trend and variance patterns of two landscape fragmentation metrics (Number of Patches and Mean Patch Area) at the provincial level show the influence of the political transition on landscape fragmentation. The impact of political transition was more pronounced in provinces associated with plantations and urban areas. Among the rubber producing States, the border States, Shan, Kayah, and Kayin were more impacted compared to inland Mon. Tanintharyi and Bago Regions showed higher variance in residuals of both metrics before the transition occurred due to the military government supported oil palm and teak plantations. Fragmentation and the variance in fragmentation metrics in Kachin increased post 2008. Apart from plantation areas, urban areas like Yangon and Mandalay showed high fragmentation post 2009 period after the new government was formed. We attribute the forest loss and fragmentation to the economic and structural reforms of the democratic government, specifically to the increased granting of agricultural concessions and logging for plantations. iii A study of the fire regime from 2003 to 2012 using MODIS satellite data suggested March as the peak of the fire season with 12900 km 2 of Burned Area (BA) and 95000 fire counts. Forests accounted for majority (41. 3 %) of the total BA and most fires (89. 7 %) resulted in medium or high vegetation disturbance. A higher negative correlation between BA and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) was reported for deciduous forests than for evergreen forests (r= 0. 49 vs r = 0. 36, p ~ 0). A maximum decrease in 29 % of original GPP (2007 - 2012) was observed in the evergreen forest patches. The scale-dependent correlation analysis suggested significant BA-GPP correlation at 1 × 1 degree, as compared to finer resolutions. These results highlight the significance of fires impacting carbon cycle. An in-depth analysis of fire causative factors in Myanmar was studied. The mean fire density in non-protected areas was found to be two times more than in protected areas. Fire-land cover partition analysis suggested dominant fire occurrences in the savannas (protected areas) and woody savannas (non-protected areas). The five major fire causative factors in protected areas in descending order were found to be population density, land cover, tree cover percent, travel time from nearest city and temperature. The causative factors in non-protected areas were population density, tree cover percent, travel time from nearest city, temperature and elevation. The fire susceptibility analysis showed distinct spatial patterns with central Myanmar as a hot spot region of vegetation fires. Results from propensity score matching suggested that forests within protected areas have 11 % less fires than non-protected areas. These findings provide information to policy makers about the current forest loss, forest fragmentation and forest fire hotspots, status of forest conservation and can be used to inform, update or evaluate policies. These findings are timely and can guide policy makers to arrive at best management strategies as the new government is formulating policies and laws and amending old ones to aid forest conservation...|$|E
