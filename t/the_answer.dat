5|$|Adders execute integer {{addition}} {{in electronic}} digital computers, usually using binary arithmetic. The simplest architecture is the ripple carry adder, which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm. One slight improvement is the carry skip design, again following human intuition; {{one does not}} perform all the carries in computing , but one bypasses the group of 9s and skips to <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E

5|$|However Saudi {{judges are}} {{expected}} to consult six medieval texts from the Hanbali school of jurisprudence before reaching a decision. The Hanbali school is noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and hadith. If <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is {{not found in the}} six Hanbali texts, the judge may then consult the jurisprudence of the other three main Sunni schools or apply his independent judgment and legal reasoning, referred to as ijtihad.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>answering</b> machine paradox has {{relatively}} recently sparked {{some debate}} regarding Kaplan’s Demonstrative (1977). A popular approach to solve <b>the</b> <b>answering</b> machine paradox {{has been to}} reject Kaplan’s proper context thesis whilst largely maintaining his framework for indexicals. In this thesis I will firstly present two new answering machine type cases and argue that the existing solutions to <b>the</b> <b>answering</b> machine paradox cannot deal with these cases. Then, I will propose a near-side pragmatic solution to <b>the</b> <b>answering</b> machine paradox that adequately deals with these new answering machine cases {{in a way that}} adheres with our pre-theoretical intuitions...|$|R
50|$|The {{first part}} of the plan goes well, with Francesca, Kyle, and Matty {{successfully}} avoiding security cameras and the night guard. However, <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> are located on a computer, and only the technical genius Roy can crack the password; he and the other two get into the building, and Roy correctly guesses the password after seeing a photograph of an employee. Still, <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> can't be printed, so the group decides to take the test with their combined knowledge and get <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> that way. In the early hours of morning, they are finished and have all <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> written down.|$|R
5|$|Scholars also {{debate the}} exact {{influence}} of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> remains uncertain; {{some scholars have}} argued that Durkheim's thought {{is a form of}} secularized Jewish thought, while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine emperor {{was said}} to have been infuriated with <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> {{and the fact that he}} was outsmarted.

50|$|This {{right-handed}} bias {{is reflected}} in standardized tests as well. Multiple-choice tests tend to put the question {{on the left side}} of the page and <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> on <b>the</b> right side. If <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> must be filled in in a separate booklet, it can be awkward and uncomfortable for a left-handed student to line up the booklet with <b>the</b> <b>answers.</b> <b>The</b> time it takes to find a comfortable, convenient position cuts into test-taking time, resulting in rushed answers and unchecked work.|$|R
5|$|The Supreme Court {{noted that}} the Fifth Circuit agreed with Abramski's claim that falsifying <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to Question 11.a is not {{considered}} material, if the true-buyer can legally buy and possess the gun. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split between the circuit courts, even though Abramski's defense had changed, and he now claimed that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to Question 11.a is never material. Various parties filed amicus briefs supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights Defense Fund, and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed amicus briefs supporting Abramski's conviction.|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up with <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E

5000|$|The {{definition}} of NP-easy uses a Turing reduction {{rather than a}} many-one reduction because <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to problem Y are only TRUE or FALSE, but <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> to problem X can be more general.

5|$|Citing {{the limited}} {{size of the}} market as the main {{impediment}} in economic growth, Nurkse reasons that an increase in productivity can create a virtuous circle of growth. Thus, a large scale investment programme in {{a wide array of}} industries simultaneously is <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> The increase in demand for one industry will lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to complementarity of demands. As Say's Law states, supply creates its own demand.|$|E
5|$|Decimal {{fractions}} can {{be added}} by a simple modification of the above process. One aligns two decimal fractions above each other, with the decimal point in the same location.

Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
