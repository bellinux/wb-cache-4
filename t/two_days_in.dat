5|$|Bo's {{approach}} to social policy was demonstrated during the November 2008 taxi strikes, which saw over 8,000 taxi drivers {{take to the}} streets for <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> protests over high fees, unregulated competition and rising fuel costs. Similar protests in China were frequently suppressed—sometimes forcefully—with official media sometimes blaming labor unrest on criminal instigation.

5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode because he was a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series.

Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, a mental health facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E

The music competition's prize was $3,000 and <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> a recording studio. The band then decided it was time for another guitarist, to fill in some of that empty sounds during guitar solo's and to add to the band for a more full sound live. Through friends, Barrales contacted guitarist Juan Juarez and asked him to join Bonded by Blood. Juarez accepted and he then met the rest of the members and they all liked him as well. After winning round after round, Bonded by Blood finally won first place. The band then recorded the demo Four Pints of Blood at Love Juice Labs in the Californian city of Riverside. With this demo, Bonded by Blood gave people something to listen to and it gave the band an audience.|$|E

Commercial flights between Taiwan and Green and Orchid Islands were cancelled, {{as well as}} rail service along Taiwan's eastern coast.

Precipitation from the tropical cyclone peaked at 653mm (25.71in) over nearly <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Taitung County. The rains uprooted trees in southeastern Taitung City and triggered some landslides. Flash flooding was reported in Pingtung County.

Crop damage ensued from the precipitation, and amounted to over NT$70million (US$2million).|$|E
5|$|Following {{their long}} delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor. They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889, and {{travelled}} by train to London, where they {{checked into the}} Berners Hotel on Oxford Street. They were invited to Windsor Castle after <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary {{said that it would}} be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality.

In 2010 Gay was a member of the fifth-fastest 4 x 100m relay team in history, running a 37.45s with {{teammates}} Trell Kimmons, Wallace Spearmon and Michael Rodgers in Weltklasse Zürich 2010. His sprint combination of 100m and 200m in 9.84s and 19.62s, run over <b>two</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> 2007, was the best ever combo at that time. During the Tom Jones Memorial Classic in Gainesville on April 17, 2010 Tyson Gay clocked 44.89 in the 400m event and became the first man in history to dip under 10.00 in the 100m, under 20.00 in the 200m and under 45.00 in the 400m.|$|E
