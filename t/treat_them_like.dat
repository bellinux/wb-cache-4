Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and <b>treat</b> <b>them</b> <b>like</b> adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E

Those two venues are at a square northwest of Taipei Railway Station and the other is at Daan Forest Park. The reason to choose the park because the park is located just across the Taipei Grand Mosque. Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin made a remark urging Taiwanese to be more considerate to foreign workers, telling them that those workers have help to make Taipei a better city to live, thus Taiwanese should <b>treat</b> <b>them</b> <b>like</b> families.|$|E

The Soviet government announced it was acting to protect the Ukrainians and Belarusians who lived {{in the eastern part of}} Poland, because the Polish state – according to Soviet propaganda – had collapsed in the face of the Nazi German attack and could no longer guarantee the security of its own citizens. Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded that the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all uniformed troops to then-neutral Romania.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to have}} been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: [...] "One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and <b>treat</b> <b>them</b> <b>like</b> regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect—the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew {{that we were going to}} be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Tony Sawicki, a trans man {{and another}} clone played by Maslany. The character was first imagined by Manson and Fawcett {{during the development}} of the show's first season; they thought that introducing a transgender clone character would be [...] "very tied to the themes of our show about identity" [...] and would fit well with the previous season's themes of gender and sexuality. When they approached Maslany with the idea {{at the end of the}} first season, she told them that she had already thought about playing a transgender character herself. It took the show's creators longer than with any other character to develop and refine Tony's personality and wardrobe, the entire process taking six months. In preparation for the part, Maslany researched and met with transgender people and grew out her underarm hair for six weeks, although she eventually had to shave her underarms to attend an awards ceremony before the episode was filmed. The new character was kept secret from most of the crew until scripts for the episode were distributed, and the show's hair and makeup department trialled different looks for Tony on Maslany's days off and weekends so that other members of the crew would not see her in Tony's costume. Tony's final look was created by Stephen Lynch, Sandy Sokolowski and Debra Hanson, in the show's makeup, hair and wardrobe departments, respectively. Manson, Fawcett and Maslany sought advice from GLAAD on how to best go about introducing a transgender character. In response to the perception that Tony's introduction had created [...] "a minefield of sexual politics", Fawcett said that that had not been the writers' intention; rather, their aim was to [...] "just throw this character in there and <b>treat</b> <b>them</b> <b>like</b> a normal human being like we would anyone else on the show".|$|E

In response to the Americans [...] "who [...] up tables and benches to keep warm", Béguin claimed surprise, and resolved that [...] "if they behaved churlishly we could no longer <b>treat</b> <b>them</b> <b>like</b> officers".

2500|$|Nirvana {{had been}} in {{negotiations}} with MTV to appear on its acoustic-based show MTV Unplugged for some time. It was while touring with the Meat Puppets that Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain finally accepted. The band {{wanted to do something}} different from a typical MTV Unplugged episode for its performance. According to drummer Dave Grohl, [...] "We'd seen the other Unpluggeds and didn't like many of them, because most bands would <b>treat</b> <b>them</b> <b>like</b> rock shows—play their hits like it was Madison Square Garden, except with acoustic guitars." [...] The group looked at Mark Lanegan's 1990 album The Winding Sheet as a source of inspiration. Among the ideas the band members came up with included covering David Bowie's [...] "The Man Who Sold the World" [...] and inviting members of the Meat Puppets to join them on stage. Still, the prospect of performing an entirely acoustic show made Cobain nervous.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1918, McKenzie sought {{approval}} from the trustees to raise revenue by using Fisk's campus as a receiving station for Black troops in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), a precursor to the present-day Reserve Officers' Training Corp (ROTC) program. The Student Army Training Corp allowed students to attend school while they participated in military training exercises during World War I. McKenzie noted that accommodating the troops, [...] "will cramp us very considerably, but the compensation will keep us from any additional indebtedness and probably turn our lodging and boarding department into a self-supporting institution, and enable us to make a number of necessary changes or improvements without cutting into our normal funds. I am glad, too, to be of very direct service to the nation in its persecution of the War." [...] In August 1918, the first of over 600 Black SATC cadets arrived in Nashville. [...] "The boys will live a highly educational military life, centered about Bennett Hall. The girls will live an equally efficient, busy school life, centered about Jubilee Hall," [...] he stated. However the presence of military cadets on Fisk's campus, {{all of whom were}} young men, added to the University's disciplinary problems. While McKenzie appreciated the disciplinary focus of the military's proscribed daily routine, he harshly criticized the military's refusal to acknowledge and abide by Fisk's rules and regulations. At the opening of the 1918 academic year, McKenzie set the tone for a new approach to student conduct by invoking the military's presence and influence on the campus, [...] "We are a military institution. Not that we have been absorbed by the military, but that the essential principles of efficiency exemplified in the military have been absorbed into the university. These principles include concentration of effort, unremitting toil, elimination of all unnecessary activities and motions, regular and insistent schedule of life, promptness, accuracy, reliability thoroughness, instant and complete obedience. With military leaders unwilling to enforce [...] "satisfactory moral standards," [...] their cadets ran rampant, smoking, cursing, and fraternizing with Fisk co-eds. In one significant infraction, a soldier helped a female Fisk student to [...] "escape supervision" [...] of the University and was found with her in a private room. Although the man was arrested, the military administered no punishment. In addition to the poor behavior of cadets, McKenzie strongly criticized the federal government for failing to provide Black soldiers adequate compensation for their service to the nation. [...] "When the immediate aim of efficient fighters was no longer its aim, the Government sought to free itself from its financial obligations and forgot what havoc it would work in the lives of many, many young men," [...] McKenzie lamented in the Fisk News. While the mobilization effort only lasted a few months and World War I ended in November 1918, the military presence had lasting effects on Fisk's campus school discipline. McKenzie continued to experiment the military's model of conduct, but the continued military discipline for student conduct policies after the military's departure from campus angered Fisk students. Viewing the new policies as infringing on their rights, several Fisk students rebelled. McKenzie reported, [...] "The other day the college boys served notice on me that until I was inclined to <b>treat</b> <b>them</b> <b>like</b> men they would refuse to attend the study hall. It did not take very many hours to secure written pledges from all but five of them that they would attend. Since then, one or more of them have attempted to spoil the lights in the study hall, and they have torn down the picture of President Cravath and written an ugly message on the chapel wall where the picture was. McKenzie noted the required study hall also angered certain Fisk alumni, remarking [...] "Only last night I was sent almost direct word to the effect that the alumni would protest against the study hall, and a reminder of the fact that practically no white man is trusted by any Negro." ...|$|E

60|$|The dramatist's license, in fact, {{ends with}} his design. In {{conception}} alone he is free. He may take what character {{or group of}} characters he chooses, see them with what eyes, knit them with what idea, {{within the limits of}} his temperament; but once taken, seen, and knitted, he is bound to <b>treat</b> <b>them</b> <b>like</b> a gentleman, with the tenderest consideration of their mainsprings. Take care of character; action and dialogue will take care of themselves! The true dramatist gives full rein to his temperament in the scope and nature of his subject; having once selected subject and characters, he is just, gentle, restrained, neither gratifying his lust for praise at the expense of his offspring, nor using them as puppets to flout his audience. Being himself the nature that brought them forth, he guides them in the course predestined at their conception. So only have they a chance of defying Time, which is always lying in wait to destroy the false, topical, or fashionable, all--in a word--that is not based on the permanent elements of human nature. The perfect dramatist rounds up his characters and facts within the ring-fence of a dominant idea which fulfils the craving of his spirit; having got them there, he suffers them to live their own lives.|$|E
