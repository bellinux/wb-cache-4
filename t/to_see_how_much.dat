5|$|Mercedes and Doctor Browning {{travel to}} Las Vegas. They bump into Clare, who lies {{to her that}} Doctor Browning tried to seduce her. Mercedes wants to test Doctor Browning <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he loves her because of this, and {{comes up with a}} plan with Clare in order to scam him of his money. They pretend that Mercedes has been kidnapped and demand ransom money. When Mercedes realises that Clare has been lying she decides to stop the scheme, however Clare knocks her {{unconscious}} and takes her hostage. She demands ransom money in order for Mercedes' release. Jacqui is able to gather the money in order to release her, however, this money is stolen. As a result, Clare kidnaps Doctor Browning and traps him and Mercedes in a cage where she threatens them with vicious dogs. They are eventually tracked down and Clare is then sent to prison. Mercedes goes to see Jacqui, who has fled to Alicante having stolen money off of dangerous gangster Trevor Royle (Greg Wood), before returning to the village. When Myra discovers Doctor Browning is a murderer, she attempts to end his relationship with Mercedes. Doctor Browning attacks Myra because of this and she is left injured. Mercedes is furious when she discovers what Doctor Browning has done although forgives him. Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) also informs Mercedes that Doctor Browning attempted to rape her and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) tells Mercedes that she had slept with Doctor Browning and he attempted to kill her in order to stop her from telling Mercedes, however Mercedes refuses to believe either of them. Myra continues to attempt to split the couple up however and starts a hate campaign against Doctor Browning, spreading flyers across the village that he is a murderer. As a result, Doctor Browning pays Trevor to kill Myra. Mercedes overhears Doctor Browning and Trevor discussing Myra's murder. Devastated, she tells Myra of this who attempts to flee the country. Mercedes and her family are devastated when they are informed that Doctor Browning shot Myra dead while she was attempting to flee. When Mercedes and Doctor Browning fight over this along with his other actions, Doctor Browning strangles Mercedes and she is almost killed. However, Jim walks in on them in time to save her. Mercedes' half-brother John Paul (James Sutton) later reveals to the family that Myra faked her death to escape Doctor Browning and Trevor's murder plot. When Clare is released from prison, she offers to throw Mercedes a 30th birthday party at The Loft in order to make amends and Mercedes agrees in order to get over her recent tragedies, unaware that Clare is secretly planning to bomb the club in order to get revenge. However, Sinead O'Connor (Stephanie Davis) believes the bag containing the bomb has money and takes it to Ste Hay's (Kieron Richardson) leaving party, causing a huge explosion at the block of flats when Clare detonates the bomb. Mercedes is furious and confronts Clare in the street after learning that Clare had planned to kill her, and a fight breaks out between the two women. Mercedes pushes Clare into the road and she is run over by a car and killed instantly.|$|E

25|$|An unusual {{aspect of}} drivers and TSRs, {{is that they}} would use {{different}} amounts of conventional and/or upper memory, based on the order they were loaded. This {{could be used to}} advantage if the programs were repeatedly loaded in different orders, and checking <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> memory was free after each permutation. For example, if there was a 50 KB UMB and a 10 KB UMB, and programs needing 8 KB and 45 KB were loaded, the 8 KB might go into the 50 KB UMB, preventing the second from loading. Later versions of DOS allowed the use of a specific load address for a driver or TSR, to fit drivers/TSRs more tightly together.|$|E
25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a crash course in the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E

40|$|Our common future {{involves}} {{many important}} challenges. People and nature {{need to improve}} the relationship {{in order to reach}} an ecologically sustainable development. In a society where consumption of products steadily increases, the consumer awareness about social and environmental issues connected to the products becomes an importent factor. More and more companies choose to work more actively with these issues and more and more products get labelled by some of the eco labelling organisations. From the cradle to the gate means that a study has been done on a part of a products life cycle. In this master thesis a pair of cotton trousers has been followed from the cotton field and through the manufacturing chain in order <b>to</b> <b>sees</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> resource that are connected to the cultivation and to the production. Methological approach has been Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) according to ISO 14040. The empirical material is collected in South India, in an area known for its intense cotton manufacturing. Studies like this can be a good way of showing the environmental impacts of a certain product. LCI can for example work as a criterion for eco labelling, but the methodology could also support the overall environmental work in companies...|$|R

[...] There was also a questionnaire about science, which asked about scientific facts mentioned in the stories, and a [...] "Science-Crime Notes" [...] section containing news items about science and crime. [...] Gernsback's editorial argued that science would eventually end crime, and suggested that both the police and criminals would make growing use of scientific innovations in the future. [...] Gernsback included on the masthead the names of several experts on crime, such as Edwin Cooley, a professor of criminology at Fordham University; he also listed members of his staff on the masthead with made-up titles: C.P.

500|$|With the Cardinals down by 25 {{points in}} the fourth quarter, quarterback Neil Lomax threw for three touchdowns in a come-from-behind win. One of the touchdowns was to tight end Robert Awalt, the other two to league {{reception}} leader J.T. Smith. Donald Igwebuike's potential game-tying 53-yard field goal attempt bounced off the crossbar as time ran out. The Cardinals came in on a three-game losing streak, while the Buccaneers entered the game leading the league in takeaways. The attendance of 22,449 was the Cardinals' lowest in four years, the team having announced the previous week their plans {{to move to another}} city. Detectives were assigned to guard Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill due to death threats. Irritation over DeBerg's celebrations after his three touchdown passes provided inspiration to some of the Cardinals, who commented, [...] "he's going to lose his job to Vinny Testaverde {{in a couple of weeks}} anyway". Awalt caught nine passes for 124yards, while Smith caught eight passes for 96yards. Said coach Perkins of his team's performance, [...] "...they whipped us in every phase of the game. Even down 28–3, they were playing better football than we were". After the Buccaneers turned three consecutive potential blowout wins into nail-biters, safety Rick Woods said that the team seemed to be playing not to lose instead of playing to win. As an example, he noted that many players turned <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> time was left on the clock after Cardinals linebacker Niko Noga returned a James Wilder fumble for a touchdown. The next week, Woods was demoted to the taxi squad. Offensive tackle Rob Taylor suffered a strained medial collateral ligament, and center Randy Grimes was also out for the fourth quarter with a hyperextended knee. [...] "We should have gotten a lot more hurt", Perkins said, and accused his players of allowing positive press coverage to inflate their egos and cloud their judgments. The 25-point lead, if it had held, would have represented the largest margin of victory in a Buccaneers road win. Instead, it became the largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history.|$|E
