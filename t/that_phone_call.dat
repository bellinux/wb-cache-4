I picked the nastiest {{son of a bitch}} I could find Chandler's lawyer, Barry Rothman, all he wants to do is get this out in the public as fast as he can, as big as he can and humiliate as many people as he can.

Once I make <b>that</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call,</b> this guy is going to destroy everybody in sight in any devious, nasty, cruel way that he can do it. I've given him full authority to do that. Jackson is an evil guy, he is worse than that and I have the evidence to prove it. If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever ... Michael's career will be over. [...] In the same conversation, when asked how this would affect his son, Chandler replied, [...] That's irrelevant to me ... It will be a massacre if I don't get what I want. It's going to be bigger than all us put together ... This man Jackson is going to be humiliated beyond belief ... He will not sell one more record. [...] The recorded conversation was a critical aspect of Jackson's defense against the upcoming allegation made against him. He and his supporters argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money from the singer. In October 1994, Mary A. Fischer of GQ magazine reported it was Evan Chandler who initially accused Jackson of molesting his son, before he demanded a screenwriting deal from Jackson instead of going to the police.|$|E
