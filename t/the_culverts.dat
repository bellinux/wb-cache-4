25|$|The {{place is}} {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a railway range crossing, incorporating 15 tunnels, 15 steel bridges and 24 timber bridges. The line's tight curves, embankments, cuttings, culverts and drains are also characteristic of the engineering techniques needed to traverse steep, unstable terrain. <b>The</b> <b>culverts</b> and drains are vital in a tropical climate with a high rainfall.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>culvert</b> {{comprises}} a long tunnel, about 1.2m wide, {{beneath an}} unsealed roadway. It is lined {{on the floor}} and to about a third of its height along the sides with rusticated sandstone blocks.

25|$|Most locks have a bypass flume, {{which allows}} water {{to bypass the}} lock to water the level below. If the flume was covered over with concrete, that {{generally}} meant that a roadway passed over the lock. Originally the locks 1-27, {{with the possible exception}} of Lock 13 did not have bypass flumes, using <b>the</b> <b>culverts</b> to divert water, but later the bypass flumes were put in (which is what we see today).|$|E
25|$|Effective January 1, 2014, County Road 106 was {{transferred}} from ownership and maintenance responsibilities by Orange County to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission as a park road between Route 17 and the Rockland/Orange County border. Orange County had closed {{the road in}} the Spring of 2008 as a result of two culverts associated with Lake Kanawauke being determined by the County as unsafe to carry vehicular traffic. After discussions with the Commission, the County agreed to repair <b>the</b> <b>culverts</b> as well as make other required improvements to the road on the condition that the Commission takes possession of the road upon completion of said improvements. The agreement also made clear that the Commission would only accept the road as a park road and retain the authority to close it seasonally consistent with other park roads.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{sandstone}} <b>culvert</b> {{is situated}} in the northeastern corner of the reserve close to the property boundary.

50|$|Since 1980, the {{ecological}} impact of road crossings on natural {{streams and rivers}} has been recognised. Baffles may be installed along <b>the</b> <b>culvert</b> to provide some fish-friendly alternative. But baffles can reduce drastically <b>the</b> <b>culvert</b> discharge capacity for a given afflux, thus increasing substantially {{the total cost of}} <b>the</b> <b>culvert</b> structure to achieve the same design discharge and afflux, or increasing the risk of road flooding in an existing structure.|$|R
40|$|A {{two year}} study of fish passage through <b>the</b> Fish Creek <b>Culvert,</b> located at Mile 132. 2 of the Denali Highway, {{was carried out}} by an {{interdisciplinary}} task force. The purposes of this study were: monitor the interaction of the spawning Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and <b>the</b> existing <b>culvert,</b> and document variables of watershed hydrology (primarily runoff) and hydraulic behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>culvert</b> that may impact fish passage. In summary, Arctic grayling encountered minimal difficulty in passing upstream through <b>the</b> <b>culvert.</b> <b>The</b> major areas of difficulty for the fish were entering <b>the</b> slightly perched <b>culvert</b> and exiting where nonuniform flow rates of movement through <b>the</b> <b>culvert</b> barrel varied from less than a minute over 80 minutes. Generally, larger fish moved through more rapidly than smaller fish. All fish stayed as close to the boundary of <b>the</b> <b>culvert</b> as possible, and they oriented themselves normal to this boundary; meaning that they were not always swimming in a vertical position...|$|R
25|$|In {{the longer}} term, FWS plans to create up to 30 acres (12 ha) of {{additional}} grassland {{by removing the}} runway pavement and restoring the original cover. An 8-foot (2 m) wide strip of concrete would be left {{for use as a}} public trail. While grasses are already beginning to grow through cracks in the runways, the agency would prefer not to wait as aircraft continue to make illegal landings at the refuge, disturbing the birds, despite markings on the runways themselves and on aviation charts of the area indicating that the facility is closed. It has not yet determined how this will be done in the most environmentally sensitive fashion. Similarly, it hopes to restore the original stream pattern through the property by removing <b>the</b> <b>culverts</b> and other reroutings made during construction of the airfield.|$|E
500|$|The December 1927 Michigan State Highway Department Official Highway Service Map shows M-94 routed from Au Train west to Munising {{and further}} along its current routing to Manistique. [...] In 1928 or 1929, M-94 was rerouted to run along Munising-Van Meer-Shingleton Road (now H-58 and H-15) and southerly to Shingleton. This routing was {{abandoned}} on November 7, 1963. It was later extended westward to Harvey in 1939. In 1941, {{the portion of}} M-94 west from Munising to Harvey was made a part of M-28, and M-94 was extended along its current routing from Munising to US41. M-94 was extended {{for the last time}} in 1998 over US 41 and through the old K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base to end at a newly designated M-553.

500|$|The centre and oldest {{parts of}} Shepton Mallet are {{adjacent}} to the River Sheppey, and thus {{at the bottom of}} a valley, approximately [...] above sea level.

The river has cut a narrow valley, and between Shepton Mallet and the village of Croscombe, to the west, it is bounded by steeply-sloping fields and woodland. However the river flows through much of Shepton Mallet itself in underground culverts. The river occasionally floods after heavy rain, such as on 20 October 2006, and again on 29 May 2008, when rainfall was so heavy that <b>the</b> <b>culverts</b> were unable to cope with the volume of water, resulting in the flooding of some of the lower-lying parts of the town.

Five were refurbished by the National Rivers Authority in 1994, and the sixth was replaced by an electric motor. Discharge into the River Trent is through <b>the</b> <b>culverts</b> when the water level in the river is low enough, and through the pumps when it is not. A number of the pumping stations within the Chase are reversible, so that water is pumped from the drainage ditches to the high level carriers {{when there is a}} risk of flooding, and from the carriers to the ditches when water is needed for irrigation. The Environment Agency also have pumping stations at Belton Grange, Goodcop and Low Bank, which pump into the Hatfield Waste Drain.|$|E
2500|$|Steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) {{occurred}} historically in Adobe Creek {{based on}} a report touting the trout in the Sportsman Gazetteer in 1877. This very early report makes rumors that Adobe Creek's trout were introduced extremely unlikely since the first trout hatcheries in California did not propagate any trout until the 1870s, and much of their production was shipped to hatcheries out of state. A physical specimen was collected in 1893 by Stanford Biology Professor W. W. Thoburn {{and is in the}} California Academy of Sciences collection. In 1898 John Otterbein Snyder collected steelhead trout specimens in San Antonio Creek (now Adobe Creek). A 1909 land office brochure promoted Los Altos for its [...] "never-failing mountain trout stream, trout caught a few feet from kitchen doors". The reaches upstream from Hidden Villa have been judged excellent trout spawning habitat. Josephine Duveneck wrote, [...] "Before the era of concrete, fish used to swim up to spawn and native trout lured many a small boy to seek out the deeper pools carrying his home-made fishing pole and can of worms." [...] Local historian Florence Fava also reported that [...] "the creeks which lace the (Hidden Villa) property and join Adobe Creek were originally full of fish". Steelhead often were caught using large wet flies with 2x tippet during the early 1970s. [...] Locations that held spawning steelhead included the large cement pieces downstream from the Foothill Junior College paint shop outflow and cut banks just below Interstate 280. [...] According to the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), steelhead were caught by local fishermen during 1985, 1986 and 1987 in Mayfield Slough at the confluence of Matadero and Adobe Creeks. At least six steelhead were noted passing the tidal gates at Mayfield Slough in the Palo Alto Flood Basin in April 1987. There are many formidable obstacles to fish passage on Adobe Creek, including <b>the</b> <b>culverts</b> at the El Camino Real and Interstate 280 overpasses, a drop structure at the Foothill College bridge and the long concrete trapezoidal channel structure from El Camino Real northward to Highway 101. Additional barriers occur at the O'Keefe Lane and Hidden Villa bridges, and the creek suffers from significant bank erosion, failing channel stabilization structures, and sedimentation. Finally, the trash rack at the tidal gate at the mouth of Mayfield Slough is an intermittent complete barrier to fish passage when it is closed.|$|E

60|$|THERE {{were two}} {{branches}} of the Hydraulic: one followed {{the course of the}} Miami, from some unknown point to the northward, on the level of its high bank, and joined the other where it emptied into the river just above the bridge. This last came down what had been a street, and it must have been very pretty to have these two swift streams of clear water rushing through the little town, under <b>the</b> <b>culverts,</b> and between the stone walls of its banks. But what a boy mainly cares for in a thing is use, and the boys tried to make some use of the Hydraulic, since it was there to find what they could do with it. Of course they were aware of the mills dotted along its course, and they knew that it ran them; but I do not believe any of them thought that it was built merely to run flour-mills and saw-mills and cotton-mills. They did what they could to find out its real use, but they could make very little of it. The current was so rapid that it would not freeze in winter, and in summer they could not go in swimming in it by day, because it was so public, and at night the Basin had more attractions. There was danger of cutting your feet on the broken glass and crockery which people threw into the Hydraulic, and though the edges of <b>the</b> <b>culverts</b> were good for jumping off of, the boys did not find them of much practical value. Sometimes you could catch sunfish in the Hydraulic, but it was generally too swift, and the only thing you could depend upon was catching crawfish. These abounded so that if you dropped a string with a bit of meat on it into the water anywhere, you could pull it up again with two or three crawfish hanging to it. The boys could not begin to use them all for bait, which was the only use their Creator seemed to have designed them for; but they had vaguely understood that people somewhere ate them, or something like them, though they had never known even the name of lobsters; and they always intended to get their mothers to have them cooked for them. None of them ever did.|$|E
