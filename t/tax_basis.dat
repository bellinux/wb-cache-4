This may require identification conventions, such as first-in-first-out, for identical properties like shares of stock.

A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the <b>tax</b> <b>basis</b> (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Gains on depreciable property used in a business are treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject-matter}} of the considerations is {{the construction}} of a value added tax. The author comments on the issues of the <b>tax</b> assessment <b>basis,</b> <b>tax</b> rates and the methods of calculating the said tax. Special attention was focused on the concept and range of the <b>tax</b> assessment <b>basis</b> since it makes it possible to show the consequences of that tax. The author presents economic, fiscal and social effects of a value added tax. The considerations are illustrated by examples taken from the tax legislation of the EEC countries among which only Greece does not provide for a value added tax. The author refers to postulates of introducing the said tax in Poland. He claims that at present the economic and financial situation in Poland is not mature enough to introduce a value added tax. Therefore he declares first for eliminating the dualism in taxing the turnover and for introducing one tax instead of two taxes applied at present. The turnover tax which is actually under preparation should be a multiple tax with the traits of a value added tax. It would facilitate a gradual transformation of a turnover tax into a value added tax. The author declares for the tax protection of consumption of the poor.

40|$|One of more {{important}} problems {{dealt with by}} the theory of taxation is the differentiation of tax burden according to the paying capacity of a taxpayer. Theoretical considerations concerning that problem may lead to practical results. The theory of taxation, however, should not {{be treated as a}} science whose task is to formulate practical advice. It is the tax praxis, supported by the theory, that should construct the tax system, along the principle of tax solvency of a taxpayer. In the adjustment of taxation to the tax solvency of a taxpayer of great significance is the adequate determination of the <b>tax</b> assessment <b>basis</b> and the choice of the type of a tax rate. The <b>tax</b> assessment <b>basis</b> indicate the level of tax a taxpayer may pay, while tax rates indicate the level of tax a taxpayer should pay. A tax rate determines {{the degree to which the}} increase of the <b>tax</b> assessment <b>basis</b> will be burdened and determines the limits of such a burden. The most adequate is a progressive tax rate. Of course, it is difficult to adjust the level of taxation to the tax solvency of a taxpayer by means of progressive tax rates only. There is no rule which would make it possible to determine a just level of such rates. Besides, its is also important to levy the taxes only in connection with such circumstances which actually reflect the solvency of a taxpayer. Non-fiscal aims of taxes have negative effects on tax solvency, for the attainment of such aims is the factor by means of which the legislator determines legal criteria of differentiating the tax burden.
