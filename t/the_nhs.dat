40|$|AbstractThe NH 2 -terminal {{domain of}} sonic {{hedgehog}} (residue 25 – 198) was expressed in both yeast and animal cells. <b>The</b> yeast-derived <b>NH</b> 2 -terminal domain of sonic hedgehog was less active by far than the animal cell-derived counterpart. <b>The</b> yeast-derived <b>NH</b> 2 -terminal domain of sonic hedgehog lacked 10 amino acids from <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 2 -terminus. This cleavage of <b>the</b> yeast-derived <b>NH</b> 2 -terminal domain of sonic hedgehog might due to Kex 2.

40|$|Abnormalities in repolarization of {{the cardiac}} {{ventricular}} action potential {{can lead to}} life-threatening arrhythmias associated with long QT syndrome. The repolarization process depends upon the gating properties of potassium channels encoded by the human ether-à-go-go–related gene (HERG), especially those governing the rate of recovery from inactivation {{and the rate of}} deactivation. Previous studies have demonstrated that deletion of <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 2 terminus increases the deactivation rate, but the mechanism by which <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 2 terminus regulates deactivation in wild-type channels has not been elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that <b>the</b> HERG <b>NH</b> 2 terminus slows deactivation by a mechanism similar to N-type inactivation in Shaker channels, where it binds to the internal mouth of the pore and prevents channel closure. We found that the regulation of deactivation by <b>the</b> HERG <b>NH</b> 2 terminus bears similarity to Shaker N-type inactivation in three respects: (a) deletion of <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 2 terminus slows C-type inactivation; (b) the action of <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 2 terminus is sensitive to elevated concentrations of external K+, as if its binding along the permeation pathway is disrupted by K+ influx; and (c) N-ethylmaleimide, covalently linked to an aphenotypic cysteine introduced within the S 4 –S 5 linker, mimics the N deletion phenotype, as if the binding of <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 2 terminus to its receptor site were hindered. In contrast to N-type inactivation in Shaker, however, there was no indication that <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 2 terminus blocks the HERG pore. In addition, we discovered that separate domains within <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 2 terminus mediate the slowing of deactivation and the promotion of C-type inactivation. These results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 2 terminus stabilizes the open state and, by a separate mechanism, promotes C-type inactivation...|$|R

Simulation {{results show that}} the CO 2 regener-ation energy for the MEA based process is lower than that for <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 3 based process, which is mainly because the flow rate of the MEA solution is significantly lower than that of the aqueous ammonia. The MEA leakage concentration is far lower than <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 3 leakage concentration, and this indicates that <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 3 abatement system should be added for dealing with <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 3 slip in <b>the</b> <b>NH</b> 3 based CO 2 capture process. With the flow rate of the flue gas increasing, the liq-uid gas ratios for both processes decrease, which gives rise to the decrease of the CO 2 removal efficiencies for the two processes.
