5|$|X-Flight {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has 8 cars with 4 seats per car (2 {{on each side}} of the track) for a total of 32 riders per train. The colors of the train are red and black with over-the-shoulder restraints. <b>The</b> <b>restraints</b> are similar to <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> found on Superman: Ultimate Flight.|$|E
5|$|With the {{original}} shoulder restraints, riders experienced some discomfort during the ride. <b>The</b> <b>restraints</b> {{were converted to}} individually ratcheting lap bars in the 2001 and 2002 seasons on the Batman and Robin trains, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Goliath {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has nine cars which can seat four riders {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 36 riders per train; each seat has its own individual lap-bar restraint. The structure of the trains are colored yellow, red and blue. The seats are blue and <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> are yellow.|$|E

5000|$|Every {{agreement}} concerning trade, every {{regulation of}} trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition {{or whether it}} is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question, the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> is applied, its condition before and after <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> was imposed, <b>the</b> nature of <b>the</b> <b>restraint,</b> and its effect, actual or probable.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>restraint</b> {{associated}} with hypothermia {{which increases the}} adrenal activity in rats was investigated. In rats with nomothermia or light hypothermia, the plasma and adrenal corticosterone levels increase at least threefold whatever <b>the</b> duration of <b>restraint.</b> Their return to normal values depends on the duration of <b>the</b> <b>restraint.</b> Exposure to cold produces in free rats a light hypothermia with an increase of the plasma and adrenal corticosterone levels, and in restraint animals an important hypothermia which does not potentiate the stimulation of adrenocortical activity induced by <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> alone...|$|R
5|$|Bats possess highly adapted lung {{systems to}} cope with the {{pressures}} of powered-flight. Flight is an energetically taxing aerobic activity and requires large amounts of oxygen to be sustained. In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E
5|$|In the station, {{the trains}} are {{oriented}} in a vertical position {{in order to}} allow riders to board. Once <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> are locked, the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and the train is then dispatched from the station. When the train returns to the station, the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E
5|$|Nitro {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has six cars that can seat four rides {{in a single}} row, {{for a total of}} 24 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over the shoulder restraint. The structure of the trains are coloured blue, red, and yellow; the seats are black and <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> are yellow. Also, unlike traditional steel roller coasters, Nitro has no floor on its trains.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a sitting}} position, the minimum height of <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> should {{correspond}} {{to the top of}} the driver’s ear or even higher. In addition, there should be minimal distance between the back of head and the point where it first meets <b>the</b> <b>restraint.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of rear facing child restraints in frontal crashes {{can be determined}} by controlling a) the child’s kinematics and b) interactions with vehicle structures. Twelve sled tests were performed to analyze {{the effect of the}} location and structural properties of vehicle interior components. <b>The</b> role of <b>restraint</b> kinematics was studied by developing computational models which underwent idealized motions. Stiff structures originally offset from <b>the</b> <b>restraint,</b> but which contact <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> late in <b>the</b> test, cause increased injury values. Attachment methods which reduce child restraint rotation and more rigidly couple <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> to <b>the</b> vehicle result in the best safety performance...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LLM) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} restraints in post-employment cases in England, South Africa and Germany. The {{attempt was made}} to compare <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> of trade doctrine that was developed in England and is still used in the common law countries, on one the hand, and <b>the</b> German <b>restraint</b> of trade rules on the other. Therefore the development of <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> of trade doctrine in England is described, as well as the modifications of <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> of trade doctrine in South Africa. Also it is given an overview of <b>the</b> German <b>restraint</b> of trade rules. As far as the English and South African law is concerned, the historical developments and applicable principles of <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> of trade doctrine are emphasised, whereas the main aim in the German part is to give an overview about <b>the</b> codified <b>restraint</b> of trade rules. While comparing the common law doctrine and <b>the</b> German <b>restraint</b> of trade law it is emphasised that in the common law countries the reasonableness and public interest plays an important role, whereas in German restraint of trade law, on the other hand, the payment of compensation is an important matter.

5|$|After Ealdred's death, one of <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> on William's {{treatment}} of the English was removed. Ealdred {{was one of a}} few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|Once in the station, riders board a train sitting down, in {{a similar}} style to {{inverted}} roller coasters. Riders are restrained through a padded over-the-shoulder harness and a lap bar. At the ankles, two flaps hold the legs in position and close as the harness locks into place. After a train is fully locked and checked, riders are raised into the flying position and the train departs the station. Since being rethemed to Galactica for 2016, riders {{have the option of}} wearing virtual reality headsets, which are attached to <b>the</b> <b>restraints.</b>|$|E
5|$|The four {{objectives}} of the operation (which evolved over time) were to boost the sagging morale of the Saigon regime in the Republic of Vietnam, to persuade North Vietnam to cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without actually taking any ground forces into communist North Vietnam, to destroy North Vietnam's transportation system, industrial base, and air defenses, and to halt the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Attainment of these objectives was made difficult by both <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies and by the military aid and assistance received by North Vietnam from its communist allies, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and North Korea.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall, an {{employee}} at Bohemia working on ARMA 3, released a massively popular mod for Arma II named DayZ, which includes zombies as the game's main enemies. Its popularity led to a resurgence in ARMA 2s sales, with registered players count being raised from 500,000 to one million. Impressed {{with the success of}} DayZ, Bohemia appointed Hall to fully capitalize on it by leading the development of a standalone DayZ video game, which ensured {{that he would not be}} limited by <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> of Arma 2. While the main goal is to transit the mod into an entirely new game, the team also intended to add more content such as base-building and improved crafting. Hall eventually left Bohemia in 2014, and the game remained in early access more than four years after its release in December 2013.|$|E
25|$|On June 9, 1991, a {{severely}} intoxicated (BAC 0.30%) 32-year-old Toledo, Ohio woman fell 60 {{feet from the}} ride and died. An investigation discovered a design flaw in <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> that allowed limp patrons to slide to the unoccupied seat next to their own.|$|E

40|$|A computer-implemented {{method is}} {{provided}} for designing a restraint layer of an inflatable vessel. <b>The</b> <b>restraint</b> layer is inflatable from an initial uninflated configuration to an inflated configuration and is constructed from {{a plurality of}} interfacing longitudinal straps and hoop straps. The method involves providing computer processing means (e. g., to receive user inputs, perform calculations, and output results) and utilizing this computer processing means to implement a plurality of subsequent design steps. The computer processing means is utilized to input the load requirements of <b>the</b> inflated <b>restraint</b> layer and to specify an inflated configuration of <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> layer. This includes specifying a desired design gap between pairs of adjacent longitudinal or hoop straps, whereby the adjacent straps interface with a plurality of transversely extending hoop or longitudinal straps at a plurality of intersections. Furthermore, an initial uninflated configuration of <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> layer that is inflatable to achieve the specified inflated configuration is determined. This includes calculating a manufacturing gap between pairs of adjacent longitudinal or hoop straps that correspond to the specified desired gap in the inflated configuration of <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> layer...|$|R

25|$|On August 23, 1999, a 20-year-old Long Island man {{fell from}} his safety {{restraints}} to his death. An investigation discovered <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> were working properly and still secured {{when the train}} returned to the station. Less than a month later, a 13-year-old boy, concerned {{that he was not}} properly restrained, intentionally slipped out of them as the train ascended the lift hill and jumped onto the adjacent maintenance catwalk.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} an {{economic}} analysis that showed that the largest part of the economic benefit from road pricing {{was not in the}} relief of congestion but in the revenue collected, which would only be released when the revenue is used.

25|$|On June 9, 1991, 32-year-old Candy Taylor of Toledo, Ohio, fell to {{her death}} from Flight Commander, an Intamin Flight Trainer, located at Kings Island. Investigators {{determined}} that a design flaw in the seat divider could allow a rider to slide into an unoccupied seat and become free from the restraint. A coroner's report later revealed that the victim had a blood-alcohol level of 0.30 which may have also contributed. Speculation suggests the rider lost consciousness during the ride and slid out from <b>the</b> <b>restraints.</b>|$|E

50|$|Public policy {{requires}} the balancing of two conflicting public interests {{with regard to}} agreements in restraint of trade. On the one hand, contracts freely entered into should be performed (sanctity of contract); on the other, everyone {{should be free to}} carry on their profession or business (freedom of trade). A contract in restraint of trade is valid and enforceable unless the party wishing to escape its consequences can prove that <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> is contrary to the public interest and thus unenforceable. <b>The</b> <b>restraint</b> denier consequently bears the onus of proving that enforcement of <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> is contrary to policy. An agreement in restraint of trade that is contrary to public policy is not void, but is unenforceable.|$|R
25|$|The Voyage uses two blue, 24-passenger trains {{made by the}} Philadelphia Toboggan Company. Each {{train is}} made up of six cars that hold four riders each. Each car has two rows holding two riders each. Each row has a seat divider that {{separates}} the two riders in that row and ensures each rider remains in a position allowing their restraints to work effectively. Since The Voyage uses the same trains that The Raven and The Legend use, <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> are the same - an individual ratcheting lap bar and an individual, two-point lap belt.|$|E
25|$|The second {{incident}} of 2004 {{was on one}} of Intamin's mega coasters, Superman: Ride of Steel at Six Flags New England in Massachusetts. The ride, again with lap bar restraints, was dispatched with a cerebral palsy sufferer in the front seat, who died after being ejected from his seat. According to an investigation, the ride operators were primarily to blame for not ensuring the rider was properly secured. Intamin was also partially blamed because the ride's safety system allowed the train to be dispatched without all <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> properly secured.|$|E
