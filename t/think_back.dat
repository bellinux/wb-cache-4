5|$|The game also {{remains the}} only {{national}} championship game to have featured three of the NBA 50 Greatest Players – Jordan, Ewing and Worthy – chosen in 1996 to mark the NBA's 50th anniversary. In addition to Jordan's, Ewing's and Worthy's Hall of Fame NBA careers with the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers respectively (including a combined 9 NBA championships), Floyd was named an NBA All-Star and still holds playoff records for most points in a quarter and half, while Perkins played in the league for 17 seasons. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment that gave him the confidence to become what many {{believe to be the}} greatest basketball player of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance. Jordan has said multiple times that before he would take game-winning shots with the Bulls, he would sometimes <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to his shot in the 1982 game that propelled North Carolina past Georgetown.|$|E

25|$|The {{four men}} {{were going to}} spend one year living in {{primitive}} accommodation and working in the hangar, which {{also served as a}} workshop.

500|$|Madonna's vocal range spans a {{bit less}} than {{one and a half}} octaves, from F3 to B4. The chorus is backed by sounds of bells ringing, an {{alternate}} verse—"This time I know it's true"— which is sung by three back-up singers during the interlude, and a bass counter melody which introduces her vocals during the second chorus. The lyrics are constructed in a verse-chorus form, with the theme being Madonna's feelings for Sean Penn; it even uses the archaic love word [...] "dear" [...] in the line [...] "Just <b>think</b> <b>back</b> and remember, dear".|$|E

500|$|Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti {{was delighted}} {{with his team}} after their success. Ancelotti's job had been under threat after a run of poor results in December, {{therefore}} the victory had extra significance for Ancelotti: [...] "When I <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to December, we had to overcome so many hurdles so {{that makes it a}} very special victory."

We worked hard this year, a very difficult year." ...|$|E

500|$|While Sunsoft's {{development}} team, {{headed by}} Iwata, were {{confident that they}} produced a great game, Chô Wakusei Senki Metafight did not sell well in Japan and, as a result, was not received well within Sunsoft. No sequel was originally planned due to the game's poor sales; Iwata already started development on another game when the North American release Blaster Master sold well. The game's impact led Sunsoft to develop titles with similar top-down gameplay like [...] and Fester's Quest, the latter of whose main designer had helped design the characters for Blaster Master. Iwata incorporated many of the gameplay elements in the remake , which his goal was [...] "for players to recall and <b>think</b> <b>back</b> upon (the original) Blaster Master, and so {{my goal was to}} find a way to evoke that through this game." ...|$|E

500|$|Wood {{said that}} she is {{sometimes}} puzzled when reading Steffy's scripts, but connects her present storyline to the character's past. She said: [...] "I just <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to all the things Steffy has been through. She {{has a lot of}} deep seeded [...] issues. That is where I think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sister’s boyfriend, etc. There are just so many traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I first heard about it, I was in major shock, of course. Then I started thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it makes sense that she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{they began}} {{recording}} in studio in June 2012, the band's members felt little pressure {{to complete the}} album as they could deliver something similar to their previous album [...] "if you've delivered once already, why {{would it be a}} problem to do it again? We are the band that made those records [...] so there's really no problem in that regard." [...] Guitarist Jeff Sahyoun said he did not even <b>think</b> <b>back</b> on Fake History when they were producing The Blackest Beautiful. However, as they progressed through it, there were elements that were not clicking, and the performances lacked the same bite in comparison to their Fake History demos. [...] Butler said that this [...] "almost sent the band crazy". He said he required a specific environment when he sings as his performance puts him in a vulnerable state.|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson and Robb Buono, the film's {{production}} designer, {{decided that}} the script was composed of two distinct parts— {{the reality of the}} teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, [...] "we wanted to look at it [...] through rose colored glasses, because when you <b>think</b> <b>back</b> on your memories of that time period— no matter what age you are— you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as we keep coming back, and each time it’s more magical— a Saturday Night Fever-like contrast to the reality of life.” Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.|$|E

500|$|Coburn {{generated}} controversy {{after the}} race, {{when he said}} the current Triple Crown system allowed [...] "the coward's way out" [...] because fresh horses who had not run in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes could challenge horses who contested all three legs. [...] Sherman downplayed the outburst, saying, [...] " [...] was at {{the heat of the moment}} ... Sometimes the emotions get in front of you." [...] Two days later, Coburn apologized, saying he wanted to congratulate the owners of Tonalist and adding, [...] "I wanted so much for [...] to win the Triple Crown for the people of America." [...] Steve Haskin of Blood-Horse magazine summarized the race stating, [...] "when I <b>think</b> <b>back...</b> the one image that will last forever will be of an exhausted colt walking back through the tunnel with a bloodstained foot, his head down and breathing hard, and every vein protruding from his sweat-soaked body.

500|$|Although Lundgren {{has never}} competed as a {{professional}} bodybuilder, he has been closely associated with bodybuilding and fitness since his role as Drago in the mid-1980s.

[...] In an interview with them, he claimed to often train up to six days a week, usually one-hour sessions completed in the morning, saying that [...] "it's just one hour a day, and then you can enjoy the other 23 hours". Although he had begun lifting weights as a teenager, he cites co-star Sylvester Stallone as the man who got him into serious bodybuilding for a period in the 1980s after he arrived in the U.S. Stallone had a lasting influence on his fitness regime and diet, ensuring that he ate a much higher percentage of protein and split his food intake between five or six smaller meals a day. Lundgren has professed never to have been [...] "super strong", saying that, [...] "I'm too tall and my arms are long.
