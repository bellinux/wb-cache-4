5|$|The {{film was}} {{uploaded}} <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Movies</b> Online, Lionhead's website for user-created videos, on 22 November 2005 {{and was soon}} covered by American and French press. Although real-time-rendered, three-dimensional computer animation (machinima) {{had been used in}} earlier political films, The French Democracy attained an unprecedented level of mainstream attention for political machinima. While acknowledging the film's flaws, such as the grammatically poor English subtitles, commentators praised its clear political message and compared it to films such as La Haine and Do the Right Thing. The French Democracy inspired other politically conscious machinima works and fueled discussion about the art form's potential for political expression. Some raised concerns that video game companies would use their copyrights to control the content of derivative machinima films.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the early}} Māori names were {{replaced}} by Europeans during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Government amendments in 1894 {{and the establishment of}} the New Zealand Geographic Board in the mid-1940s led to the encouragement of original Māori names, although incorrect spellings and anglicised pronunciations persisted. Many names now have alternative or dual English and Māori names or, in a few rare cases, dual Māori names or dual English names. Most names have never been made official, but if they are mentioned in authoritative publications they are considered recorded names. Colloquial names in New Zealand result from an ironic view of the place's entertainment value, or plays on advertising mottos, or are shortened versions of the full name. Some places tried to capitalise on the success of The Lord of the Rings films by linking themselves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies.</b>|$|E
