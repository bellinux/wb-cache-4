5|$|Legend of Mana {{was first}} {{announced}} by Square in March 1999 just before its debut at the Tokyo Game Show. The game {{was released in}} Japan in July 1999 with considerable hype, packaged with demos of Square's future releases Vagrant Story, Chrono Cross, Front Mission 3, and <b>Threads</b> <b>of</b> Fate. It was planned {{to be released in}} North America alongside the July and August 2000 releases of Chrono Cross and <b>Threads</b> <b>of</b> Fate, but was instead released early on June 6.|$|E
5|$|Ptychocysts are {{not used}} for prey capture— instead the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> {{discharged}} ptychocysts are used for building protective tubes in which their owners live. Ptychocysts are found only in the order Ceriantharia, tube anemones.|$|E
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E

Pharnavaz's self-anointment may have a Sasanian inspiration, as some early Shahanshahs crowned themselves.|$|E
5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E
5|$|Sea silk is a {{fine fabric}} woven from the byssus <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> bivalves, {{particularly}} the pen shell (Pinna nobilis). It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic. It was an expensive fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations of the pen shell. There is mention in the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone (196 BCE) of this cloth being used to pay taxes.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{mutual exclusion}} is a property of concurrency control, which is instituted {{for the purpose}} of preventing race conditions; it is the requirement that one <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> execution never enter its critical section {{at the same time that}} another concurrent <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> execution enters its own critical section.|$|R

5|$|The figures, the {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E
5|$|The tau {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} tau protein abnormalities initiate the disease cascade. In this model, hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> tau. Eventually, they form neurofibrillary tangles inside nerve cell bodies. When this occurs, the microtubules disintegrate, destroying {{the structure of}} the cell's cytoskeleton which collapses the neuron's transport system. This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication between neurons and later in the death of the cells.|$|E

5|$|Before {{they can}} {{complete}} the mission, Silik is {{killed by a}} guard near the conduit, and Archer is nearly shot by a confused Tucker. With the alien shields down, Enterprise then completes an atmospheric entry, flying over New York City and destroying the alien facility with photon torpedoes. The episode ends with Daniels showing Archer the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> the timeline resetting themselves back to normal, as the Temporal Cold War finally ends {{with the death of}} Vosk. Archer demands that Daniels should never visit or bother Enterprise again. With their mission completed, Enterprise finally arrives back in its proper time period, where the crew are welcomed and escorted by an entire squadron of Starfleet and alien vessels.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical {{or nearly}} so, reddish-brown, {{thick-walled}} and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' dimensions are 7–11µm; the warts are about 1µm long. The spores are non-amyloid, {{and will not}} stain with iodine from Melzer's reagent. The use of scanning electron microscopy {{has shown that the}} spines are 0.90–1.45µm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top. The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5–6.5µm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short sterigmata. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11–15 by 18–24µm. The <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3–5.5µm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4–6μm in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6–8μm diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has branched hyphae of 3–4μm diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3–6μm in diameter.|$|E
