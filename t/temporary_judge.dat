2500|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, a worrisome {{situation}} had emerged. First, in 1974, state law was changed {{so that the}} legislature met every two years, not every year. Second, rulings in the late 1980s by the Montana Supreme Court and advisory opinions issued by the Attorney General of Montana permitted appointed District Court judges to not face an election until after confirmation by the Montana Senate—even if {{this meant that the}} judge served past the formal expiration date of their term. This created a situation in which a judge could conceivably resign immediately after the legislature adjourned, and remain on the bench for up to three years. [...] The judge could then resign before the election. After the election, the governor could appoint a <b>temporary</b> <b>judge</b> once more, and again that judge could serve for up to three years. This clearly defied the will of the 1972 state constitutional convention, which wanted judges elected by voters rather than appointed by governors. [...] By 1992, 41 percent of all District Court judges were appointed, and had never faced voters.|$|E

5000|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council {{decided to}} allow <b>temporary</b> <b>judges</b> at the ICTR {{to vote and}} stand as {{candidates}} in elections to {{the presidency of the}} tribunal.

50|$|Judicial {{independence}} is also secured through a prohibition on permanent judges (no matter what office) from undertaking paid employment, and on restrictions {{as to the}} work that part-time or <b>temporary</b> <b>judges</b> can undertake. Generally, part-time and <b>temporary</b> <b>judges</b> will be practising advocates or solicitors, but they are prohibited from employment with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service or the Government Legal Service for Scotland. Permanent judges are also barred from having any involvement with political parties or organisations.|$|R
50|$|The Security Council was {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} increase the powers of <b>temporary</b> <b>judges</b> at the ICTR so that they may adjudicate in pre-trial proceedings in other cases in addition to their own trials. Furthermore, the number of <b>temporary</b> <b>judges</b> appointed at any one time would also be increased to ensure the completion of all trial activities at first instance by the end of 2008.

40|$|Efficiency in the {{administration}} of justice is found to increase over time, while the variation in the efficiency of the courts tended to remain low and fall over time. This would appear to be good news, at least for the case studied here: the civil courts of first instance in Spain between 2005 and 2009. Apart from the simple passing of time, the percentage of <b>temporary</b> <b>judges</b> in the system also determines some of the differences in efficiency between courts over time. Thus, we find that the greater the percentage of <b>temporary</b> <b>judges,</b> the lower is the efficiency of the courts. Overall, the average relative efficiency level for the period 2005 to 2009 was 97. 46 %, suggesting the matter is under control...|$|R
