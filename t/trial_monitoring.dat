40|$|In many {{clinical}} trials treatments {{need to be}} repeatedly applied as diseases relapse frequently after remission {{over a long period}} of time (e. g., 35 weeks). Most research in statistics focuses on the overall trial design, such as sample size and power calculation, or on the data analysis after trials are completed. Little is done to improve the efficiency of <b>trial</b> <b>monitoring,</b> such as early termination of trials due to futility. The challenge faced in such <b>trial</b> <b>monitoring</b> is mostly caused by the need to properly model repeated outcomes from patients.

The report addresses Learning Objective 1 of the project, which is to enhance understanding of current, emerging and possible future customer load and generation characteristics. The technology installed is a Baxi Ecogen Stirling engine, with a maximum heat output of 6 kW, a maximum electrical output of 1 kW, and an overall efficiency of 90 % [1], producing a heat to power ratio of 6 : 1, an electric efficiency of 13 %, and a heat efficiency of 77 %. In each location, two parameters were monitored: the electrical demand from and generation produced by the micro-CHP engine; and the amount of electricity imported (or exported) from the grid by the house as a whole. Both were measured in average watts per measured interval, with measurements taken every minute. <b>Trial</b> <b>monitoring</b> began in December 2012 and ended in March 2014. <b>Trial</b> <b>monitoring</b> data was provided by British Gas.

Frequently, RCT are planned as multicentre trials, {{with the intention of}} increasing statistical power and raising the precision of outcome estimates.

A website was developed to support a large scale-orthodontic RCT which aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a functional appliance(www. ortodonzia. unina. it).

40|$|Due to {{ethical and}} {{logistical}} concerns {{it is common}} for data monitoring committees to periodically monitor accruing clinical trial data to assess the safety, and possibly efficacy, of a new experimental treatment. When formalized, monitoring is typically implemented using group sequential methods. In some cases regulatory agencies have required that primary trial analyses should be based solely on the judgment of an independent review committee (IRC). The IRC assessments can produce difficulties for <b>trial</b> <b>monitoring</b> given the time lag typically associated with receiving assessments from the IRC. This results in a missing data problem wherein a surrogate measure of response may provide useful information for interim decisions and future monitoring strategies. In this paper, we present statistical tools that are helpful for monitoring a group sequential clinical trial with missing IRC data. We illustrate the proposed methodology in the case of binary endpoints under various missingness mechanisms including missing completely at random assessments and when missingness depends on the IRC’s measurement. </p...|$|E
