25|$|The {{reason of}} Pakistan's {{opposition}} to India's {{entry into the}} Organization of Islamic Cooperation {{is due to the}} human rights issues and problems faced by the Kashmiris in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir(J). The Muslim world has always supported Pakistan rather than India, however the role of the OIC concerning the Kashmir issue is that India has the largest Muslim minority and <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> shown desire to join the OIC. While the First Islamic Summit did not have the issue of the Kashmir people, granting the 60 million Muslims living in India membership in the OIC was discussed. While General Yayha Khan of Pakistan did agree, he showed his extreme displeasure at the fact that at induction of Muslim representative Fakhruddin Ali Ahmad, he took a seat, which caused major controversy. Meanwhile, there were Muslims killed in anti-Muslim riots in Ahmedabad. Pakistan rejected this development and demanded the expulsion of India from the summit.|$|E

Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. <b>Those</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been through enough."
