5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E
5|$|The {{aristocracy}} {{shared their}} power {{only with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops {{were members of the}} aristocracy. <b>The</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from division; a large fee, or dowry, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This {{is one of the reasons}} that so many of the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale.|$|E

5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E

5|$|Cicero, upon {{becoming}} consul, immediately {{moved to}} strike a deal with his consular colleague Hybrida, who had supported Catiline and his party, and who might join a rebellion against the state. In exchange for what amounted to the sole consulship for Cicero, Hybrida was to receive the rich consular province of Macedonia. Hybrida himself was heavily in debt and was wasteful of his money, and <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> Macedonia {{could be used by}} him to restore his lost fortune.|$|E
5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, {{especially among the}} elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, {{where they could be}} more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, undermining <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Edmontosaurus {{was widely}} {{distributed}} across western North America. The distribution of Edmontosaurus fossils {{suggests that it}} preferred coasts and coastal plains. It was a herbivore that could move on both two legs and four. Because it is known from several bone beds, Edmontosaurus {{is thought to have}} lived in groups, and may have been migratory as well. <b>The</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> fossils has allowed researchers to study its paleobiology in detail, including its brain, how it may have fed, and its injuries and pathologies, such as evidence for tyrannosaur attacks on a few edmontosaur specimens.|$|E
5|$|Egbert's conquests {{brought him}} wealth {{far greater than}} his {{predecessors}} had enjoyed, and enabled him to purchase the support which secured the West Saxon throne for his descendants. The stability brought by the dynastic succession of Egbert and Æthelwulf led to an expansion of commercial and agrarian resources, and to an expansion of royal income. <b>The</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> the West Saxon kings was also increased by the agreement in 838–39 with Archbishop Ceolnoth for the previously independent West Saxon minsters to accept the king as their secular lord in return for his protection. However, there was no certainty that the hegemony of Wessex would prove more permanent than that of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|Far Cry 4 was {{met with}} a mostly {{positive}} critical reception upon release. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters, particularly antagonist Pagan Min, {{as well as new}} gameplay additions and <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> content. However, some critics disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A sequel, Far Cry 5, is set to be released in 2018.|$|E

5|$|However, Alexios's {{problems}} were only just beginning. At {{a time when}} the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. Inflation was spiralling out of control, the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different nomismata in circulation), and the imperial treasury was empty. In desperation, Alexios had been forced to finance his campaign against the Normans by using <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Orthodox Church, which had been put at his disposal by the Patriarch of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries ostensibly {{to examine their}} character, but in fact, to value their assets {{with a view to}} expropriation. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously. Cromwell had done the same thing on the instructions of Cardinal Wolsey to raise funds for two proposed colleges at Ipswich and Oxford years before.|$|E

5|$|Swedish {{debate about}} America {{remained}} mostly theoretical before the 19th century, since very few Swedes had any personal {{experience of the}} nation. Emigration was illegal and population was seen as <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> nations. However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850, and as population growth outstripped economic development, it gave rise to fears of overpopulation based on the influential population theory of Thomas Malthus. In the 1830s, the laws against emigration were repealed.|$|E

When his grandfather died, the newly titled 10th Earl of Shaftesbury came into a vast fortune of the Shaftesbury estates and other properties, including the family's 17th-century home and large estate in Dorset, as well as residences in Hove, London, Versailles and the French Riviera. Shaftesbury also inherited a collection of art, antiques, and other valuables worth over £3m. By the 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> the family estate remained well worth millions.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>of</b> detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
