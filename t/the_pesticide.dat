5|$|Agricultural runoff {{containing}} {{pesticide residues}} {{has also been}} concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts.

5|$|Hydrogen cyanide, {{discovered}} in the late 18th century, {{was used in the}} 1880s for the fumigation of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The new product was marketed as <b>the</b> <b>pesticide</b> Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{fipronil}} {{was blamed}} for the spread of CCD among bees, {{in a study by}} the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France, which found that even at very low nonlethal doses, this pesticide still impairs the ability to locate the hive, resulting in large numbers of foragers lost with every pollen-finding expedition, though no mention was made regarding any of the other symptoms of CCD; other studies, however, have shown no acute effect of fipronil on honey bees. Fipronil is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees, such as yellowjackets (Vespula germanica) and many other colonial pests by a process of 'toxic baiting', whereby one insect returning to the hive spreads <b>the</b> <b>pesticide</b> among the brood.|$|E
5|$|Intensification of {{the killing}} {{operations}} took place in late 1941 when the SS began construction of stationary gassing facilities to replace the use of Einsatzgruppen for mass killings.

During Operation Reinhard, run by officers from the Totenkopfverbände, who were sworn to secrecy, three death camps were built in occupied Poland: Bełżec (operational by March 1942), Sobibór (operational by May 1942), and Treblinka (operational by July 1942), with squads of Trawniki men (Eastern European collaborators) overseeing hundreds of Sonderkommando prisoners, who were forced to work in the gas chambers and crematoria before being murdered themselves.

5|$|Malaria {{has been}} {{successfully}} eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, {{in conjunction with the}} monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods, and the use of <b>the</b> <b>pesticide</b> DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program.

5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, the bald eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of <b>the</b> <b>pesticide</b> DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E

In the early 21stcentury, osprey populations are increasing along the river, possibly because of a ban on <b>the</b> <b>pesticide</b> DDT and on the birds' ability to use power poles for nesting.
