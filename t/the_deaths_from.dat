5|$|In addition, the {{outbreak}} {{coincided with the}} deaths and media focus on the First World War. Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both {{the war and the}} epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of young men in the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>from</b> the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may not have had a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.|$|E
5|$|The Red Cross {{estimated}} that 75% of <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>from</b> the storm were children under 12.

Within another day, the homeless total rose to70,000. Total damage from the hurricane was estimated at $100million (1976USD).|$|E

5|$|The storm, {{combined}} with a high pressure system, produced a strong pressure gradient, resulting in strong rip currents {{off the coast of}} Florida. The currents prompted sirens, which are normally used for storm warnings, to be activated in Pensacola Beach. The rip currents killed 5 off the coast of Florida. Outer rain bands from the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the Florida Panhandle of over 11inches (280mm) in one day. The Tallahassee Regional Airport recorded 10.13inches (257mm) in 24hours, breaking the old 24‑hour record set in 1969. Throughout the state, Allison destroyed 10homes and damaged 599, 196 severely, primarily in Leon County. Including <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> <b>from</b> rip currents, Allison killed eight people in Florida and caused $20million (2001USD, $26million 2012USD) in damage.|$|E

A nearby coastal town [...] east of Cárdenas was described as being [...] "virtually leveled by the storm" [...] in news reports. In Cienfuegos along the southern coast, the hurricane destroyed many ships and piers. High waves washed four ships ashore, one of which damaged another ship. High winds destroyed hundreds of houses and damaged many others along the storm's path. About 100,000people were left homeless, many of whom lacking food or medical supplies. In the interior of the country, the hurricane dropped rainfall that flooded rivers and towns. Damage was estimated at $11million, and a report published in 2003 indicated that there were about 70deaths in the country; however, newspaper accounts from shortly after the hurricane indicated there were around 100deaths. After the storm, police officers were deployed to maintain order. Officers shot and killed five people caught looting in Havana, although the deaths {{were not included in the}} overall death toll.

As a result, a warning letter was sent to all residents informing them of the possibility of asbestos contamination in their homes and the need for specialised decontamination. When asked, the Minister for Housing and Planning, Sir George Young, responded that the government would not provide financial assistance to the home owners or the council to pay for decontamination, as this [...] "would not be a justifiable use of public funds." [...] In further tests between 1998 - 2001 the council surveyed 364 houses adjacent to Midland Works. Residual asbestos contamination was found in 363 of the properties tested.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} {{changing}} process and development trend of deaths (mortality) {{in patients with}} viral hepatitis after {{the use of the}} Internet-based National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System. MethodsDescriptive statistical and moving average methods were employed to analyze the infectious disease reports released by the Chinese government during 1992 - 2013, and the changing process and development trend of deaths (mortality) in patients with viral hepatitis in China over the past 10 years were investigated. ResultsThe annual deaths (mortality) in patients with viral hepatitis showed a decreasing trend. <b>The</b> <b>deaths</b> (mortality) <b>from</b> hepatitis B showed a slight declining trend, accounting for a great proportion (over 70 %) of <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> (mortality) <b>from</b> viral hepatitis; <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> (mortality) <b>from</b> hepatitis C had shown a slight downward trend since 2007; <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> (mortality) <b>from</b> hepatitis A and unclassified hepatitis decreased to different extents; <b>the</b> <b>deaths</b> (mortality) <b>from</b> hepatitis E remained at a relatively low level. ConclusionThe treatment of viral hepatitis has been gradually improved in China and the public awareness of viral hepatitis keeps increasing. However, much attention still needs to be given to the prevention and treatment of viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis B and C, by the government...|$|R
