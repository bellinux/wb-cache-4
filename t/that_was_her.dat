Though <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> last major singles title, Navratilova reached two {{additional}} major singles finals during {{the remainder of}} career. In 1991, she lost in the US Open final to the new World No. 1 Monica Seles. And in 1994, {{at the age of}} 37, Navratilova reached the Wimbledon final, where she lost in three sets to Conchita Martínez. In November that year, after losing to Gabriela Sabatini {{in the first round of}} the WTA Tour Championships, she retired from full-time competition on the singles tour. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000.|$|E

Crimes {{were thought to be}} committed by a social [...] "residuum" [...] at the bottom of society who occupied themselves as [...] "habitual criminals", choosing to live a life of drink and theft rather than improving themselves through thrift and hard work. Her strong build, partly a result of the hard physical labour <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> livelihood, ran counter to the largely middle-class notion that women were meant to be physically frail. Some commentators saw her facial features as indicative of criminality; O'Donnell commented upon her [...] "obliquely set eyes", which he declared [...] "are not infrequently found in homicides... this peculiarity, which I consider was sufficient in itself, as one of nature's danger signals, to have warned people to steer clear of her".|$|E

Paul confronted Naomi in public, but with Sheila supporting her, Naomi refused to apologise and threatened to quit her job and their relationship. Paul later apologised to Naomi, as he bonded with Amy. O'Reilly believed Paul and Naomi's relationship would [...] "stand the test of time" [...] and joked that their pairing {{would be part of}} Neighbours history. Paul and Naomi's romance was tested when Naomi learned of Paul's involvement in her brother's crime, and when Paul questioned whether she was still in love with Toadie, following an accident <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> fault. Naomi told him that she admired Toadie as he was a good man, something that Paul was not. Paul promised to be a better man and later proposed to Naomi.|$|E

Speaking to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Rihanna explained: [...] "I went into the studio making music my way. I found myself all at once." [...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion. Rihanna further explained {{that she wanted to}} record the song because she felt that listeners would be able to relate to the subject matter. When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow". Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.'

Very speedily there comes consolation in another form. Queen Anne <b>is</b> on <b>her</b> deathbed, and a young Stuart prince appears upon the scene, of whom some loyal hearts dream {{that they can make}} a king. He is such as Stuarts were, and only walks across the novelist's canvas to show his folly and heartlessness. But there is a moment in which Beatrix thinks that she may rise in the world to the proud place of a royal mistress. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> last ambition! <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>her</b> pride! <b>That</b> <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>her</b> glory!
