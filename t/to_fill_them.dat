5|$|The {{majority}} of the powers exercised by the lieutenant governor are statutory and have been assigned by the Indiana General Assembly. The first additional powers granted to the lieutenant governor were added in 1932 when the office holder was made {{the head of the}} state's agricultural commission. The office's powers have since expanded to include the chairmanship of the Office of Community and Rural Affairs, the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority, Office of Energy and Defense Development, and the Office of Tourism Development. As head of the various office and committees, the lieutenant governor controls many patronage positions and is permitted <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>them</b> by appointment. Important positions filled by the lieutenant governor include the members of the Corn Marketing Council, the Main Street Council, Steel Advisory Commission, and the Indiana Film Commission.|$|E
25|$|Critics dismiss this as demagogy, {{noting that}} {{according}} to the ACP's own studies, {{at the peak of}} construction there would be fewer than 6,000 jobs created, and that some of these would be highly skilled posts filled by foreigners because there are no Panamanians qualified <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

The system worked through local draft boards comprising community leaders who were given quotas and then decided how <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>them.</b> There was very little draft resistance.|$|E

By August 2006, a busy period of crude oil production had caused a significant workforce deficit.

People who first saw him run into the mall believed the tactical clothing and hockey mask was a paintball outfit and that the rifle was a toy.|$|E
25|$|As {{can be seen}} in {{the graph}} to the right, the {{retailer}} has seen rapid growth since the end of 2008, doubling the number of their stores from 61 in November 2008 to 123 in December 2009. Company owner Lalani said that finding sites was getting easier because of the new empty rate tax on commercial property. Whereas, previously, landlords would decline to have a discount shop filling their empty stores, they are now less reluctant <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>them</b> with discount stores, as they are now being charged for stores which lie empty. Stuart Donnelly, head of property at 99p Stores, notes that landlords are now being much more proactive, inviting potential retailers to come and have a look at their locations with the hope of them taking up a lease, as the property market has been badly affected by the recession, allowing the company to drive competitive deals to further expand their portfolio of stores with less expenditure, something that wouldn't have been possible just a few years ago. Landlords are now regarding 99p Stores as an anchor tenant due to the significant number of customers one of their stores can bring to a location.|$|E

50|$|The core of {{the atomic}} clock is a tunable {{microwave}} cavity containing a gas. In a hydrogen maser clock the gas emits microwaves (the gas mases) on a hyperfine transition, {{the field in the}} cavity oscillates, and the cavity is tuned for maximum microwave amplitude. Alternatively, in a caesium or rubidium clock, the beam or gas absorbs microwaves and the cavity contains an electronic amplifier to make it oscillate.

For the second type the number of atoms which change electronic state is detected and the cavity is tuned for a maximum of detected state changes.|$|R
500|$|Dark Magus {{features}} four two-part compositions with {{an average}} length of 25 minutes each. The album's music was unrehearsed and eschewed melody for improvisations around funk rhythms and grooves. The rhythms, colors, and keys [...] "would shift and change on a whim from Davis", as AllMusic's Thom Jurek said. The trumpeter eschewed his previous performances' keyboardists {{in favor of a}} three-guitar line-up of Reggie Lucas, Dominique Gaumont, and Pete Cosey, who had a penchant for guitar wails and pedal effects. Davis often stopped the band with hand signals and created empty spaces, which were longer than traditional jazz breaks, and encouraged the soloists <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>them</b> with exaggerated cadenzas.|$|E
500|$|Because the Army {{reached its}} {{greatest}} extent in 1942 and shrank in size thereafter, Blamey {{was faced with}} a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than he needed <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>them.</b> He faced public and political criticism over [...] "shelving" [...] senior officers, including Robertson. That Robertson and Bennett, two troublesome potential rivals of Blamey's, had been sent to Western Australia did not escape [...] comment. However, it was always more likely that Robertson would be the one recalled. Nevertheless, Blamey had serious concerns about Robertson's health, after the latter was hospitalised with internal haemorrhaging in July 1944 and sent to the eastern states to convalesce. While there he joined Vasey and Brigadier Bertrand Coombes, the Commandant of Duntroon, in conducting an inquiry into the future training and organisation of the Royal Military College. Their report, submitted to Blamey in January 1945, called for a number of reforms, the most significant being that the postings of regular officers should alternate between staff and regimental duties.|$|E
500|$|Before {{and during}} construction, workers and {{engineers}} experienced problems. Contracts {{for companies to}} construct the {{various parts of the}} dam were difficult to award as few companies were sizable enough <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>them.</b> This forced companies to consolidate. In addition, Native American graves had to be relocated and temporary fish ladders had to be constructed. During construction additional problems included landslides and the need to protect newly poured concrete from freezing. Construction on the downstream Grand Coulee Bridge began in [...] and more considerable earth-moving began in August. Excavation for the dam's foundation required the removal of [...] of dirt and stone. To reduce the amount of trucking required in the excavation, a conveyor belt nearly [...] long was built. To further secure the foundation, workers drilled [...] holes into the granite and filled any fissures with grout, creating a grout curtain. At times, excavated areas collapsed from overburden. In order to secure these areas from further movement and continue excavation, 3-inch (76mm) diameter pipes were inserted into the mass and chilled with cold liquid from a refrigeration plant. This froze the earth and secured it so construction could continue.|$|E

500|$|Likewise, {{in their}} article [...] "Wake up call from 'Stars on the Ground'" [...] for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T. Krishna {{wrote that the}} film [...] "deserves to be vastly {{appreciated}} as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life". They also felt it blended [...] "modern professional knowledge" [...] with a [...] "humane approach" [...] in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the [...] "present age where everyone is in a restless hurry". The pair wrote, [...] "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading {{to a state of}} mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" [...] The film depicts how [...] "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan [...] "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>them</b> with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a [...] "naive oversimplification" [...] in the film.

500|$|... "The Grinning Man" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from critics, and was watched by 9.91 million viewers, with a 36% {{share of the}} total television audience. The episode beat ITV's Marple in the same time-slot, with Geraldine McEwan's last episode as Agatha Christie's famous sleuth receiving just 4.48 million viewers and a 15% audience share. The Sunday Times AA Gill was critical of the episode, suggesting that the series had been revived: [...] "because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single, lonely, overweight, over-40 women who keep cats and believe in ghosts who they fancied most on television, and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head." [...] Of the episode itself, he wrote: [...] "It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy {{in a way that}} defies belief and interest. It is a dull confusion of unknotted loose ends that breaks its own rules, suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away through the holes in the story." [...] The Herald's Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies' acting in the episode, writing that: [...] "it really is difficult {{to tell the difference between}} the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick's comedy drama. Davies doesn't act, he tries to stay awake, occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight." [...] While The Scotsmans Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing [...] "a slightly grumpier version" [...] of himself, he was [...] "quite impressed" [...] by Davies performance, having never seen him act before. Whitelaw found that [...] "the episode itself left a lot to be desired", writing that its central mystery was [...] "solid" [...] and its solution was [...] "satisfyingly creepy", but that [...] "At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [...] It was as though Renwick, who also directed, had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>them</b> – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs." [...] Steve Pratt, writing for The Northern Echo, was similarly critical of the episode's length, deeming the Adam Klaus subplot [...] "nonsense" [...] which [...] "could easily be removed without loss". Pratt suggested that [...] "This would also help reduce the overlong two-hour running time, during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done."
