500|$|Pinkner also <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> that [...] "Bellini's lymphocemia", {{the disease}} {{depicted}} in the episode, was invented by the writers, but its characteristics are real.

Some critics have noted that [...] "Bellini's lymphocemia" [...] {{may have been a}} reference to Italian physician and anatomist Lorenzo Bellini.|$|E
500|$|After {{at first}} {{having failed to}} see {{the appeal of the}} image, Tittle {{eventually}} grew to embrace it, putting it on the back cover of his 2009 autobiography. [...] "That {{was the end of the}} road," [...] he <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> in 2008. [...] "It was the end of my dream. It was over." [...] Pittsburgh player John Baker, who hit Tittle right before the picture was taken, ran for sheriff in his native Wake County, North Carolina in 1978, and used the photo as a campaign tool.

500|$|Contemporary {{records and}} Hubbard's {{relatives}} contradict this depiction. Hubbard's grandfather, Lafe Waterbury, briefly owned {{a plot of}} land covering 320acres (0.5mi2) near Kalispell, where he pastured horses {{and worked as a}} veterinarian. A local city directory for 1913 stated Waterbury's assets as a relatively modest $1,550. The Hubbards and Waterburys lived in a pair of townhouses, not a ranch, in the center of Helena, only two blocks from each other and not far from the Montana State Capitol. They also owned a small plot outside the city. Hubbard's aunt <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> in 1990 that the family did not have a ranch, [...] "just several acres (with) a barn on it.... We had one cow (and) four or five horses." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} in the 1986 films Jumpin' Jack Flash and ¡Three Amigos!, Hartman successfully auditioned for NBC's variety show Saturday Night Live (SNL) and joined the cast and writing staff.

[...] In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions, and performed as over 70 different characters. Hartman's original Saturday Night Live characters included Eugene, the Anal Retentive Chef and Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. His impressions included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Ed McMahon, Barbara Bush, Charlton Heston, Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton; the last was often considered his best-known impression.|$|E
500|$|After McCain and Palin were {{defeated}} in the general election, a Republican campaign advisor told The New York Times that the McCain Campaign was not happy about the prank, which caused friction between McCain and Palin. McCain and his advisors were allegedly upset that Palin did not tell them beforehand that she planned to speak with who she thought was Nicolas Sarkozy. McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first. Steve Biegun, one of Palin's aides admitting to vetting the call without speaking to campaign advisors or the U.S. State Department, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> that [...] "No one's going to beat me up more than I beat myself up for setting up the governor like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to reports of Scientology ties in 2008, Jacqueline Olivier who was administrator at the time, {{denied that the}} school had a religious affiliation, and <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> Times: [...] "People tend to think Study Technology is a subject, but it is really just the way the subject is taught. They then {{come to the conclusion}} that we are teaching Scientology when actually a methodology doesn't have anything to do with content." ...|$|R
5000|$|McCarthy is also {{credited}} with developing an early form of time-sharing. His colleague Lester Earnest <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> Times: [...] "The Internet {{would not have}} happened nearly as soon as it did {{except for the fact that}} John initiated the development of time-sharing systems. We keep inventing new names for time-sharing. It came to be called servers.... Now we call it cloud computing. That is still just time-sharing. John started it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Professor of {{computer}} science at Carnegie Mellon University and Scientology critic David S. Touretzky {{was critical of}} the school's use of Study Technology, and <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> Times: [...] "There is no reputable educator anywhere who endorses Study Technology. What happens is that children are inculcated with Scientology jargon and are led to regard L.R. Hubbard as an authority figure. They are {{laying the groundwork for}} later bringing people into Scientology." ...|$|R
500|$|Before {{principal}} photography, {{the cast}} and crew bought season passes to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. They spent ten days in Florida, then returned to California for two weeks at Disneyland, making the parks depicted in the film a combination of both resorts. Actors and crew entered the parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention. [...] "At one point, I even made the camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire, which almost provoked a mutiny," [...] says Moore. Despite the actors wearing the same clothes for days on end, Moore <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times,</b> park personnel never appeared to notice them, save for one day near the end of filming when Disneyland security thought they were paparazzi harassing a celebrity family.|$|E
500|$|In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) he was Indiana Jones' greaser son Mutt Williams. His {{performance}} {{was met with}} mixed reviews with Todd Gilchrist of IGN commenting [...] "one can't quite help but wonder what Spielberg saw in the young actor that inspired him to cast LaBeouf". LaBeouf <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> that he felt he as an actor [...] "dropped the ball" [...] on Jones' legacy, and [...] "there was a reason" [...] the film wasn't universally accepted. His next film was Eagle Eye, released on September 26. His performance received mixed reviews, with Josh Bell of Las Vegas Weekly saying he [...] "makes a credible bid for action-hero status, although his occasional stabs at emotional depth don't really go anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams' live {{rendition}} of [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] was generally well-received by critics. George Lang of The Oklahoman {{described it as}} a [...] "perky" [...] performance, additionally commenting, [...] " [...] great... and she should have already racked up her first Oscar for acting by now." [...] The Boston Globes Wesley Morris wrote, [...] "Watching Amy Adams sing... makes you appreciated [...] the magic of the movies." [...] However, the performance generated some mild controversy revolving around the fact that while Adams was selected to perform [...] "Happy Working Song", Broadway actress and singer Kristin Chenoweth was hired to sing [...] "That's How You Know" [...] live at the ceremony. When questioned about this, Disney executives <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> that [...] "it's best [...] sing 'Happy Working Song' because it has so many parallels to Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins".|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{much of her}} life, Hartman {{suffered}} from depression. In 1978, she was treated at The Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1984, she divorced her husband, screenwriter Gill Dennis, after a five-year separation.

5000|$|In 2006, John McClaughry, {{president}} of Vermont's Institute for Liberty and Community and co-author with Frank Bryan of The Vermont Papers, Recreating Democracy on a Human Scale, <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> Times: [...] "This {{really is a}} good-natured cult. Intellectually, they've got some horsepower, but mostly this is the whole left-wing litany, seen through an interesting prism." [...] Secession, said McClaughry, [...] "is not going to happen, and no one believes {{it is going to}} happen." ...|$|R
500|$|Pascal's supervising {{animator}} Lino DiSalvo <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> that at {{one point}} the animators [...] "weren't getting enough entertainment out of Pascal." [...] DiSalvo elaborated, [...] "originally, he was very realistic. He moved like a real chameleon," [...] which in turn depicted him as very [...] "cold." [...] By exaggerating the character's shape and face, the animators eventually [...] "amped [...] up" [...] in order to make him funnier. The name [...] "Pascal" [...] was borrowed from a pet chameleon owned by Tangled animator Kellie Lewis. During production, Lewis' other pet chameleon and Pascal's mate hatched six eggs, in turn making Pascal a father. In tribute to Pascal, the directors included a [...] "Chameleon Babies" [...] credit in the film's closing credits, parodying the more traditional [...] "Production babies" [...] credit, while Lewis herself received a [...] "Chameleon Wrangler" [...] credit.|$|E
500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo’s {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs…To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> [...] "We know these songs from our youth. We grew up with revolutionary spirit {{and we want to}} pass that on to our children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country’s strong economy.|$|E
500|$|Azaria {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the 2004 short film Nobody's Perfect, which won the Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Short at the US Comedy Arts Festival. In January 2007, he was confirmed to be directing Outsourced, a film about two American workers who journey to get their jobs back, after their factory is moved to Mexico. In 2009, Azaria told Empire he was instead focusing on making a documentary about fatherhood. Two years later he <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>Times</b> that this project was [...] "half-complete" [...] and was [...] "forever looking for financing to finish it." [...] It eventually began in 2014, airing on AOL as an online series titled Fatherhood.

5000|$|St. Brendan {{was formed}} as a new parish in 1914 under the {{leadership}} of Father William Forde.

2500|$|The {{book was}} {{discussed}} {{along with other}} works by Hubbard in an investigation into [...] "skewed sales", in a 1990 article in <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> Times. Bookstore managers told reporters that after the 1987 re-release of Buckskin Brigades by Bridge Publications, the book [...] "just sat there". Sheldon McArthur, former manager of B. Dalton Booksellers on Hollywood Boulevard in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> Times: [...] "Then, in one week, it was gone...

[...] Dworsky's allies refer to Gehry's work as [...] "confusing". Disney Hall official Frederick M. Nicholas also defended Dworsky's work against Gehry's attacks, denying that there were any problems with the Dworsky drawings not attributable to fast-tracking. Nicholas said: [...] "They were not 'bad' drawings. It {{was a question of}} the subs not understanding them." ...|$|R
