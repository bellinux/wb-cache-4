What does it say about young men and women and about the marriage? Are the dialogues supported by the content in <b>the</b> <b>biographies?</b> Did Jane Austen really write realistic?   METHOD AND MATERIAL The method was to read the novels and then <b>the</b> <b>biographies.</b> I divided <b>the</b> empiric material in different categories and based it on the fact in <b>the</b> <b>biographies.</b> I have read Sense and sensibility, Pride and prejudice, Mansfield Park and Persuasion. <b>The</b> <b>biographies</b> I have used are for example Valerie Grosvenor Myer’s Obstinate Heart Jane Austen A Biography, Carol Shield’s Jane Austen.   RESULTS I found that the text and the dialogues and contents in Austen’s novels are realistic. She has not made up own rules for convention and behaviour but lets her characters act in a normal way...|$|R
