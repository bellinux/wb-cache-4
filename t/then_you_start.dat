500|$|Some vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible {{at the end}} of the song, {{picked up}} as leakage onto one of the drum {{microphones}} (close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Starr). In the [...] "Paul is Dead" [...] hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying [...] "I buried Paul." [...] In 1974, McCartney said, [...] "That wasn't 'I buried Paul' at all – that was John saying 'cranberry sauce' … That's John's humour … If you don't realise that John's apt to say cranberry sauce when he feels like it, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> to hear a funny little word there, and you think, 'Aha!'" [...] Shortly before his death in 1980, Lennon expressed dissatisfaction with the final version of the song, saying it was [...] "badly recorded" [...] and accusing McCartney of subconsciously sabotaging the recording.|$|E

He felt that anyone can easily relate to the record [...] "There's a moment in your life where you start going out every night, and it's so fun, but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> to lose yourself; you {{get lost in the}} sauce". The singer compared the song's sentiment to [...] "Lookin' for Love In All the Wrong Places", adding [...] "It's another confession". In a different interview Mars furthered the concept of the track as it's about you [...] "losing yourself", which happened to him in L.A. during his early years. He added, [...] "If you're out there wilding out, drinking and partying, that's not real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2007, Steele {{revealed}} that he began identifying himself as Roman Catholic in recent years, after decades of self-professed atheism. In an interview with Decibel magazine, Steele explained: [...] "There are no atheists in foxholes, they say, and I was a foxhole atheist for a long time. But after going through a midlife crisis and having many things change very quickly, it made me realize my mortality. And {{when you start to}} think about death, you start to think about what's after it. And <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> hoping there is a God. For me, it's a frightening thought to go nowhere.

6000|$|Sam Marlowe had a {{touch of}} the philosopher in him. He had the ability to adapt himself to circumstances. It had been no part of his plans to come {{whizzing}} down off the rail into this singularly soup-like water which tasted in equal parts of oil and dead rats; but, now that he was here he was prepared {{to make the best of}} the situation. Swimming, it happened, was one of the things he did best, and somewhere among his belongings at home was a tarnished pewter cup which he had won at school in the [...] "Saving Life" [...] competition. He knew exactly what to do. You get behind the victim and grab him firmly under his arms, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>start</b> swimming on your back. A moment later the astonished Mr. Swenson, who, being practically amphibious, had not anticipated that anyone would have the cool impertinence to try and save him from drowning, found himself seized from behind and towed vigorously away from a ten-dollar bill which he had almost succeeded in grasping. The spiritual agony caused by this assault rendered him mercifully dumb; though, even had he contrived to utter the rich Swedish oaths which occurred to him, his remarks could scarcely have been heard, for the crowd on the dock was cheering as one man. They had often paid good money to see far less gripping sights in the movies. They roared applause. The liner, meanwhile, continued to move stodgily out into mid-river.|$|E

5000|$|The {{art critic}} Rosalind Krauss {{wrote about the}} film in her essay for the {{catalogue}} of the 1993 retrospective of Agnes Martin’s work (at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York). She writes that ‘It is not a work Martin herself gives any indication of wanting to bracket away {{from the rest of}} her art. Yet it should be. For Gabriel constructs a reading of Martin’s own work as crypto-landscape, a reading that, since it is produced by the artist herself, tends to carry the weight of interpretative proof.’ Arne Glimcher commented: 'It is not unlike a Warhol movie. It is incredibly boring. It's, like, two hours long, and after about twenty, thirty minutes <b>you</b> <b>start</b> to get into it. At the beginning the movie can be excruciating and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> realise what she's doing.
