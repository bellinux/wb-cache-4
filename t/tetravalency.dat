5000|$|A carbon atom {{has four}} {{electrons}} in its outermost valence shell. So, it needs four more electrons to complete its octet. A carbon atom completes its octet only by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms. As a result, a carbon atom forms four covalent bonds by sharing valence electrons with other atoms. This {{is known as}} <b>tetravalency</b> of carbon ("tetra" [...] means four). These four valences of carbon are directed towards four corners of a tetrahedron, and inclined to each other atomic an angle of a 109° 28´.|$|E

50|$|In chemistry, tetravalence is {{the state}} of an atom with four valence {{electrons}} available for covalent chemical bonding in its outermost electron shell, giving the atom a chemical valence of four. An example is methane (CH4): the tetravalent carbon atom forms a covalent bond with four hydrogen atoms. The carbon atom is called tetravalent because it forms 4 covalent bonds.A carbon atom has a total of six electrons occupying the first two shells, i.e., the K-shell has two electrons and the L-shell has four electrons. This distribution indicates that in the outermost shell there are one completely filled 's' orbital and two half-filled 'p' orbitals, showing carbon to be a divalent atom. But in actuality, carbon displays <b>tetravalency</b> in the combined state. Therefore, a carbon atom has four valence electrons. It could gain four electrons to form the C4− anion or lose four electrons to form the C4+ cation. Both these conditions would take carbon far away from achieving stability by the octet rule. To overcome this problem carbon undergoes bonding by sharing its valence electrons. This allows it to be covalently bonded to one, two, three or four carbon atoms or atoms of other elements or groups of atoms. Let us see how carbon forms the single, double and triple bonds in the following examples.|$|E

In both cases, the $ 4 f^ 0 $-related higher-energy component of the essentially double-peaked XANES structure decreases in relative intensity with pressure, opposite to what is generally observed for metallic mixed-valent Ce compounds. This supports the proposed peak assignment on the basis of core-hole induced many-body effects due to 4 f-ligand covalency compatible with traditional <b>tetravalency</b> of these compounds...|$|E

Infrared spectra reveal covalent bonding between the vanadium and the oxalate {{group and the}} coordinated water. The tetrahydrate has also some lattice held water. The weak band at 780 mμ and a shoulder at 600 mμ are due to d ↔ d transitions and the absorption in the ultra violet is due to charge transfer within the VO 2 + group. The dihydrate is assigned a stable five co-ordinated pyramidal structure; while the tetrahydrate, a distorted octahedron with one water molecule loosely bound along the V [...] -O axis and the other outside the co-ordination sphere...|$|E
40|$|Streptavidin (SAv), avidin (Av), and neutravidin (NAv) {{have become}} widely used {{molecular}} tools in biotechnology {{thanks to their}} remarkable affinity for biotin. Their <b>tetravalency</b> renders these molecules particularly interesting for the functionalization of solid−liquid interfaces. Using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, we systematically investigate the deposition of biotin-binding proteins to two surfaces that are popular in biotechnology: gold and silica. We find that simple physisorption of biotin-binding proteins is a viable method to confer biotin-binding functionality to gold surfaces. Both SAv and Av form dense, stable protein monolayers that retain biotin-binding activity and are largely inert to the unspecific binding of bovine serum albumin. Furthermore, we report that SAv resists adsorption to silica {{over a wide range}} of pH and ionic strength. The contrast in the binding behavior of SAv on silica and on gold suggests a simple strategy for the selective biofunctionalization of nano- or microstructured surfaces...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{absorption}} spectroscopy (XAS) at the 3 d and 2 p thresholds {{as well as}} 3 d core-level photoemission (XPS) were used to investigate the electronic structure of CeF$_ 4 $ and TbF$_ 4 $. From non- atomic 4 f-related spectral features in the 3 d XAS spectra, 4 f-ligand hybridization is clearly visible {{in the case of}} CeF$_ 4 $ and—less pronounced—in TbF$_ 4 $. For the latter compound, L 3 -edge XAS data support the view of a finite 4 f admixture to the Tb-F bonding orbitals, while the L 1 -edge spectrum reflects more explicitly <b>tetravalency.</b> From 3 d XPS measurements, an estimate of ≃ 12 eV is obtained for the core-hole– 4 f Coulomb interaction in TbF$_ 4 $. The high-energy spectra characterize both fluorine compounds as tetravalent insulators with covalent bonding and clearly show a decrease in 4 f-ligand mixing, i. e., an increase in 4 f localization, with respect to the corresponding dioxides...|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} physiological {{significance of}} carbohydrate (glycan) protein (lectin) recognition engenders the interest to design synthetic inhibitors {{with a high}} level of selectivity among natural sugar receptors. Plant agglutinins are common models to determine structure activity relationships. Focussing on the contribution of valency towards selectivity, copper-catalysed azide (sugar derivative) -alkyne (scaffold) cycloaddition yielded a panel of 10 bi- to tetravalent glycoclusters with N-acetylglucosamine as the bioactive headgroup. They were introduced into assays using (neo) glycoproteins and cell surfaces as platforms to study carbohydrate-dependent lectin binding. The ability of the bivalent compounds, which exhibit a distance profile of the sugar headgroups of about 16 - 21 angstrom, for intramolecular bridging of two contact sites from the eight hevein domains of wheat germ agglutinin led to comparatively high enhancements of inhibitory potency relative to a tetrameric leguminous lectin (distance profile of 50 - 70 angstrom between sugar-specific sites), especially for a beta-S-glycoside. The extent of inhibition at fixed concentrations of the sugar depended on the type of matrix used for the assay. Increases to tri- and <b>tetravalency</b> played a less important role than the anomeric position to keep cross-reactivity low, these tested topologies enabling cross-linking for both lectins. The potential for cis-interactions (intramolecular interactions), with glycoclusters serving as molecular rulers, is suggested to help designing selective blocking reagents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The use of {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{has become}} routine {{in the research}} and diagnostic laboratories, but the potential of antibody molecules in public health and medical applications is still far from its maximum. Most infections begin at mucosal surfaces, and this is certainly not only a stroke of good fortune if mother's milk serves as a natural delivery vehicle for antibodies protecting the gastrointestinal tract of nursing infants. Mammary gland or other mucous secretions containing numerous antibody specificities provide an efficient mean to immediately protect a mucosal surface against pathogens, which have never been encountered by the host. From a public health perspective, topical passive immunization of mucosal surfaces with monoclonal antibodies can block entry and transmission of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that infect humans, and thus defeat some key immune evasion strategies designed by many pathogens. The chief antibody on most mucosal surfaces is secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), a polypeptide complex comprising dimeric IgA, the connecting J chain, and the secretory component. The molecular stability, <b>tetravalency,</b> and strong anti-inflammatory properties make SIgA particularly well suited to fulfill the function of passive protective immunity when applied exogenously to mucosal surfaces. The review will give {{an overview of the}} basic concepts underlying mucosal immunity, present the molecular mechanisms whereby SIgA prevents mucosal infections, cover the last advances in the topic of recombinant SIgA production, and examine how structure-function relationship in SIgA will help designing molecules with novel properties for passive immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{widely used}} {{interaction}} of the homotetramer streptavidin with the small molecule biotin has been intensively studied by force spectroscopy {{and has become a}} model system for receptor ligand interaction. However, streptavidin's <b>tetravalency</b> results in diverse force propagation pathways through the different binding interfaces. This multiplicity gives rise to polydisperse force spectroscopy data. Here, we present an engineered monovalent streptavidin tetramer with a single cysteine in its functional subunit that allows for site-specific immobilization of the molecule, orthogonal to biotin binding. Functionality of streptavidin and its binding properties for biotin remain unaffected. We thus created a stable and reliable molecular anchor with a unique high-affinity binding site for biotinylated molecules or nanoparticles, which we expect to be useful for many single-molecule applications. To characterize the mechanical properties of the bond between biotin and our monovalent streptavidin, we performed force spectroscopy experiments using an atomic force microscope. We were able to conduct measurements at the single-molecule level with 1 : 1 -stoichiometry and a well-defined geometry, in which force exclusively propagates through a single subunit of the streptavidin tetramer. For different force loading rates, we obtained narrow force distributions of the bond rupture forces ranging from 200 pN at 1, 500 pN/s to 230 pN at 110, 000 pN/s. The data are in very good agreement with the standard Bell-Evans model with a single potential barrier at Δx 0 = 0. 38 nm and a zero-force off-rate koff, 0 in the 10 - 6 s- 1 range...|$|E
40|$|Emerging {{insights}} into the functional spectrum of tissue lectins leads to identification of new targets for the custom-made design of potent inhibitors, providing a challenge for synthetic chemistry. The affinity and selectivity of a carbohydrate ligand for a lectin may immensely be increased {{by a number of}} approaches, which includes varying geometrical or topological features. This perspective leads to the design and synthesis of glycoclusters and their testing using assays of physiological relevance. Herein, hydroquinone, resorcinol, benzene- 1, 3, 5 -triol and tetra(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethene have been employed as scaffolds and propargyl derivatives obtained. The triazole-containing linker to the alpha/beta-O/S-glycosides of GlcNAc/GalNAc presented on these scaffolds was generated by copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. This strategy was used to give a panel of nine glycoclusters with bi-, tri- and <b>tetravalency.</b> Maintained activity for lectin binding after conjugation was ascertained for both sugars in solid-phase assays with the plant agglutinins WGA (GlcNAc) and DBA (GalNAc). Absence of cross-reactivity excluded any carbohydrate-independent reactivity of the bivalent compounds, allowing us to proceed to further testing with a biomedically relevant lectin specific for GalNAc. Macrophage galactose(-binding C) -type lectin, involved in immune defence by dendritic cells and in virus uptake, was produced as a soluble protein without/with its alpha-helical coiled-coil stalk region. Binding to ligands presented on a matrix and on cell surfaces was highly susceptible to the presence of the tetravalent inhibitor derived from the tetraphenyl-ethene-containing scaffold, and presentation of GalNAc with an alpha-thioglycosidic linkage proved favorable. Cross-reactivity of this glycocluster to human galectins- 3 and - 4, which interact with T-n-antigen-presenting mucins, was rather small. Evidently, the valency and spatial display of a-GalNAc residues is a key factor to design potent and selective inhibitors for this lectin. 2016 - 02 - 1...|$|E
