5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans {{to serve as}} officers in the United States military. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war. Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, Charles Young, on a pretense of ill health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted {{on the first day}} of the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.|$|E

5|$|Yaoi and Yuri (also {{known as}} Boys' Love and Girls' Love, respectively) are Japanese genres {{incorporating}} homosexual romance themes across various media. The genres {{emerged in the}} 1970s in a branch of manga aimed at girls. Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi and yuri are now available in many countries and languages. The characters in yaoi and yuri manga do not tend to self-identify as homosexual or bisexual. Famous works include Hiizuredokoro no Tenshi (The Angel <b>that</b> <b>Came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun), an 11-volume series beginning in 1980 that reinterprets {{the life of the}} introducer of Buddhism to Japan; and Kaze to Ki no Uta (Poem of the Wind and the Trees), a 17-volume series beginning in 1976 that chronicles the relationship between two schoolboys in France.|$|E
5|$|Viso {{was issued}} with a drive-through penalty and rejoined in tenth position. The race resumed on lap 54 with Power {{retaining}} his lead. The race's third caution was issued {{shortly after the}} restart when Kanaan made light contact with the side of Tagilani who spun. Mario Romancini was blinded by smoke <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> incident and was hit by Tagilani who was attempting {{to regain control of}} his car. Both cars sustained heavy damage and retired but Kanaan was able to continue without apparent damage. Power led the field back up to speed at the lap-58 restart. Briscoe fell behind the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers, while Tracy moved in front of Hunter-Reay for sixth place. The second (and final) round of green-flag pit stops started on the 63rd lap; Tracy and Hunter-Reay made their pit stops over the next five laps in the hope a caution flag would be shown that would allow the pair to lead the race. After the pit stops, Power remained in the first position, and had the Alternate tires fitted on his car. He was ahead of Castroneves and Dixon.|$|E

The village was occupied by a small group of Red Guard members from the Vyborg working-class district of Kelkkala. At 2 pm, a fierce gunfight broke out at the railway station and the local Workers' Hall. The Reds were soon outnumbered, and some managed to board a train <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> direction of Vyborg and stayed at the station for a while.

25|$|Most of the {{vineyard}} soils {{in the region}} {{date back to the}} Jurassic period of 195-135 million BC when the entire Burgundy region was part of a large inland sea. This left a foundation of predominately limestone made from the skeletal fragments of the marine life that once roamed this sea. The marlstone of the region is made up of the marl, clay, sand and gravel fragments <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> weathering of old mountain chains in the area such as the Ardennes. The flow of streams and tributaries of the Saône contributes to the diversity of {{the vineyard}} soils by depositing alluvial sediments from their paths.|$|E

25|$|Wine {{made from}} the Chenin blanc grape can be dated to the 9th century in {{vineyards}} belonging to the Glanfeuil Abbey located just south of Angers {{in what is now}} Le Thoureil. Angevin wines have been held in high esteem since the Middle Ages but were mostly limited to local French markets. Unusual for the time Anjou was known for its unique winemaking technique of blending vin de presse, the wine extracted from pressing the grapes, with the vin de goutte or free run juice <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> weight of gravity pressing the grape. This vin de presse added extra tannins and color to the wine but could limit the wine's appeal for being consumed young.|$|E
25|$|Saadia Gaon's {{commentary}} on the Bible bears the stamp of the Mutazilites; and its author, while not admitting any positive attributes of God, except these of essence, endeavors to interpret Biblical passages {{in such a way}} as to rid them of anthropomorphism. The Jewish commentator, Abraham ibn Ezra, explains the Biblical account of Creation and other Scriptural passages in a philosophical sense. Nahmanides (Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman), too, and other commentators, show the influence of the philosophical ideas current in their respective epochs. This salutary inspiration, which lasted for five consecutive centuries, yielded to that other influence alone <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> neglected depths of Jewish and of Neoplatonic mysticism, and which took the name of Kabbalah.|$|E
25|$|For the 2010 model year, the CR-V {{received}} style, powertrain, {{and equipment}} changes. The exterior changes included a redesigned front fascia {{with a new}} horizontal-slat chrome grille and honeycomb-designed lower front grille, new front bumper, and revised taillights. The rear bumper was redesigned, {{as well as new}} five split-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels for EX and EX-L models. The interior received minor changes, including seat fabrics, as well as wider driver and front-passenger armrests. The audio head unit controls were altered and the information display backlighting in the gauges was changed to blue, instead of the previous black. A USB audio input became standard in the EX-L trim while hands-free Bluetooth connectivity was exclusive to the EX-L trim equipped with navigation system. In 2011, a mid-level SE trim debuted with a 6-disc CD changer and 17-inch 7-spoke alloy wheels <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pre-facelift EX and EX-L trims.|$|E
