In August 1971, the CDC completed an inspection of Shenandoah Stable, and collected human and animal blood samples, as well as soil samples. Although initial results revealed that the soil at Shenandoah Stable contained PCBs and chlorinated insecticides, the CDC was unable to identify a specific chemical culprit. It was not until 1973 that tests revealed the presence of <b>trichlorophenol.</b> When trace amounts of the crude <b>trichlorophenol</b> contaminant was administered to the inner surfaces of rabbit ears, blisters developed, which was a characteristic result of <b>trichlorophenol</b> poisoning. The unexpected death of some of the affected rabbits however, led the CDC to run more complex tests. On July 30, 1974, the CDC found that, in addition to 5,000 ppm of <b>trichlorophenol</b> and 1,590 ppm of PCBs, the soil samples collected from Shenandoah contained over 30 ppm of dioxin. Although little was known about the effects of dioxin on humans, the lethality of small doses in animals was alarming. As a result, the CDC immediately set out to locate other possible sites of contamination. When confronted by the CDC, Bliss stated {{that he did not know}} where the dioxin could have come from. Because dioxin was a by-product of only a handful of chemicals, <b>trichlorophenol</b> being the most common, the CDC narrowed their search to companies in Missouri using or producing <b>trichlorophenol.</b> NEPACCO was the only company on the search list that had come into contact with Bliss.|$|E

Two surfaces were examined: a dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid (DPPA) monolayer and a planar DPPA/ 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer. TCP was adsorbed from 1 to 3 mM solutions at pH 6. 0 to the lipid layers leading to surface layers at the water/lipid interface.

For DPPA/POPC bilayers, the adsorption of TCP was faster than that of its phenoxide, whereas adsorption of both species to DPPA monolayers proceeded with similar velocity. In both cases, phenoxide formation at the membrane was found to be delayed with respect to phenol adsorption. Phenoxide and phenol were retained after replacing the TCP solution with buffer.

UV-visible spectrophotometry, cyclic voltammetry, and HPLC {{have been used to}} characterize the reaction products and yields. Together with glucose oxidase immobilized on a working glassy carbon electrode (+ 0. 45 V vs Ag/AgCl), chlorinated benzoquinones have been demonstrated to be efficient mediators in a glucose oxidase/glucose system.

The oxidation products of chlorophenols then recycled the reduced glucose oxidase to its active oxidative state, i. e., mediating the rate-limiting electron transfer from the enzyme to the electrode. At pH 3. 5, linear behavior of the current response was observed up to 200 nM for all chlorophenol oxidation products.

Dechlorination of PCP was found to be sequential and phenol was identified as the end product along with accumulation of trace concentrations of tetra- and <b>trichlorophenols.</b> Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) revealed that palladium in its metallic form (Pd 0) produced by reduction of Pd 4 +, was spatially separated from magnesium granules when acid was included in the reaction. These colloidal palladium particles generated active reductive species of hydrogen and dechlorinated chlorophenols. In the absence of acid, the efficiency of dechlorination of PCP by Pd/Mg 0 system was very low and chief mechanism of removal of the compound was through sorption onto solid surfaces. Thus, it was important to include acid in the system to: (a) facilitate corrosion of Mg 0 and reduction of Pd 4 + to Pd 0, (b) provision of protons to produce H 2, (c) retard formation of insoluble oxides and hydroxides that may deposit on the magnesium granules and sorb PCP and its partially dechlorinated products and.

The degradation of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid proceeded via 2, 4 -dichlorophenol and p-chlorophenol as intermediates; the degradation of o-chlorophenol occurred {{with the formation of}} phenol. The dynamics ofp-chlorophenol degradation and chloride ion accumulation were studied. Key words: degradation, bacterial community, anaerobic sludge, chlorinated phenol derivatives. The problem of environment decontamination from stable xenobiotics, including halogenated organic compounds widely used in industry and agriculture, is currently urgent. Therefore, much attention is paid to research into the biochemistry of bacterial degradation of various halogenated xenobiotics, both aerobic [1, 2] and anaerobic [3, 4]. Chlorinated phenol derivatives are widely used in agriculture as pesticides and belong to the most stable xenobiotics.
