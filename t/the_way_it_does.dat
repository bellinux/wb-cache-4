5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E

500|$|Philosophers who {{consider}} subjective experience {{the essence of}} consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. Thomas Nagel spelled out {{this point of view}} in an influential essay titled What Is it Like to Be a Bat?. [...] He said that an organism is conscious [...] "if and only if there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism — something it is like for the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> itself. [...] Other thinkers, such as Douglas Hofstadter, dismiss this argument as incoherent. [...] Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive — Donald Griffin's 2001 book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan O'Brien {{recommended}} {{the book in}} a review in The Sunday Business Post, but noted it focuses more on his life than an analysis of his music: [...] "If you want a meticulously researched, mind-bogglingly detailed account of his early years growing up in Belfast, his schooldays in Orangefield, his time as an unpopular member of the Olympics showband and so on, then, once again, No Surrender is heartily recommended. If, however, you're expecting a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of Morrison's music, of its textures, its surfaces – how and why it sounds <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> – then you've probably come to the wrong place." [...] O'Brien concluded his review by writing: [...] "For all its flaws, No Surrender is a strong, absorbing biography, and never less than well written. It's just that it could potentially have been far, far better." [...] John Beck of The Press Democrat observed that the biography [...] "paints him [...] as a mercurial genius at best and a cantankerous lout on a bad day". In their 2008 book Northern Ireland After the Troubles, Colin Coulter and Michael Murray referenced the biography and stated it puts forth [...] "the view that Morrison's persona has been shaped by a specifically Ulster Protestant sensibility". Bernard Perusse of The Gazette described the earlier biography Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now as [...] "more superficial but more positive" [...] than Rogan's book.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty, Muhammad Yunus shows the outlook behind why Grameen Bank runs <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> saying, “ When {{you hold the}} world in your palm and inspect it only from a birds eye view, you tend to become arrogant, you do not realize things become blurred when viewed from an {{enormous}} distance. I opted instead for the” worms eye view.” … [...] The poor taught me an entirely new economics. I learned about the problems they face from their own perspective. “ Here we see his willingness to immerse himself with the people he is aiming to help. [...] We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle {{due to a lack}} of 27 cents. That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help. [...] Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation. [...] Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, [...] "an institution that would lend to those that had nothing. [...] " [...] Later, as time progressed, more situations would arise, such as battling for those who were landless, or small-time farmers such as those in Jobra who could not use a deep tube-well that was available to them.|$|E

2500|$|The group's fifth studio album, The E.N.D ("The Energy Never Dies"), was {{released}} on June 9, 2009. The overall sound of the album has a more electro hop beat rather than the usual hip pop/R feeling of their previous albums. Following its release, will.i.am remarked that the album had been inspired by a trip to Australia, specifically the sound of The Presets' [...] "My People". [...] "The energy on the Presets' small little stage was crazy energy. That song My People – that shit is wild," [...] will.i.am said, [...] "That's the reason why this record sounds <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> – my three months in Australia." [...] In its first week, the album sold 304,000 copies and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. In the United States, the album became the ninth album to top the one million mark in sales in 2009. The album spent 38 weeks within the top 10 of the Billboard 200. The E.N.D was the 7th best-selling album of 2009 in the U.S. It also debuted at number one in Australia, number two in New Zealand and three in the United Kingdom. Three additional singles, [...] "Imma Be", [...] "Alive", and [...] "Meet Me Halfway", were released through the iTunes Store in the three weeks running up to the album's release.|$|E

Isn't it sinful to do this? Where do bad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mother's jam?" [...] and then he didn't kneel down all alone and promise never to be wicked any more, and rise up with a light, happy heart, and go and tell his mother all about it, and beg her forgiveness, and be blessed by her with tears of pride and thankfulness in her eyes. No; {{that is the way}} with all other bad boys in the books; but it happened otherwise with this Jim, strangely enough. He ate that jam, and said it was bully, in his sinful, vulgar way; and he put in the tar, and said that was bully also, and laughed, and observed [...] "that the old woman would get up and snort" [...] when she found it out; and when she did find it out, he denied knowing anything about it, and she whipped him severely, and he did the crying himself. Everything about this boy was curious--everything turned out differently with him from <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> to the bad Jameses in the books.|$|E
