40|$|Feed spacers are {{important}} {{for the impact of}} biofouling on the performance of spiral-wound reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membrane systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} propose a strategy for developing, characterizing, and <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> spacers by numerical modeling, three-dimensional (3 D) printing of feed spacers and experimental membrane fouling simulator (MFS) studies. The results of numerical modeling on the hydraulic behavior of various feed spacer geometries suggested that the impact of spacers on hydraulics and biofouling can be improved. A good agreement was found for the modeled and measured relationship between linear flow velocity and pressure drop for feed spacers with the same geometry, indicating that modeling can serve as first step in spacer characterization. An experimental comparison study of a feed spacer currently applied in practice and a 3 D printed feed spacer with the same geometry showed (i) similar hydraulic behavior, (ii) similar pressure drop development with time and (iii) similar biomass accumulation during MFS biofouling studies, indicating that 3 D printing technology is an alternative strategy for development of thin feed spacers with a complex geometry. Based on the numerical modeling results, a modified feed spacer with low pressure drop was selected for 3 D printing. The comparison study of the feed spacer from practice and the modified geometry 3 D printed feed spacer established that the 3 D printed spacer had (i) a lower pressure drop during hydraulic testing, (ii) a lower pressure drop increase in time with the same accumulated biomass amount, indicating that modifying feed spacer geometries can reduce the impact of accumulated biomass on membrane performance. The combination of numerical modeling of feed spacers and experimental testing of 3 D printed feed spacers is a promising strategy (rapid, low cost and representative) to develop advanced feed spacers aiming to reduce the impact of biofilm formation on membrane performance and to improve the cleanability of spiral-wound NF and RO membrane systems. The proposed strategy may also be suitable to develop spacers in e. g. forward osmosis (FO), reverse electrodialysis (RED), membrane distillation (MD), and electrodeionisation (EDI) membrane systems...|$|E

The objective was to analyze the influence of selection for RFIF at on carcass and performance traits by estimating various genetic parameters. Data were analyzed from five <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> efficiency, which were conducted with 677 Nellore males. Genetic evaluation was performed by Bayesian inference using an animal model via single- and two-trait analyses. Variables analyzed were dry matter intake, average daily gain, RFIFat, rib eye area, back fat thickness, rump fat thickness, marbling score, and subcutaneous fat thickness. The posterior mean distributions estimated at each analysis were used to estimate heritability of the traits and to perform various correlations. The studied traits showed high heritability estimates, and they should respond well to selection. The RFIFat presented a phenotypic correlation with carcass traits (which was next to zero), and there was also a negative genetic correlation. Additive genetic variability for RFIFat showed that selection for this trait can promote genetic gains in future generations, resulting in animals that are efficient in terms of nutrient use, and according to the genetic and phenotypic correlations, with no significant negative changes to carcass traits...|$|R

40|$|Social insects use cuticular lipids for nestmate recognition. These lipids are chiefly {{hydrocarbons}} {{that can}} be endogenously produced or acquired from the environment. Although these compounds are already described as coming from different sources for different groups of social insects, nothing {{is known about the}} source of cuticular hydrocarbons in stingless bees. We used behavioural recognition tests and cuticle chemical investigation to elucidate the role of endogenous and environmentally based cues for nestmate recognition in the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia. We found that although newly emerged workers present specific cuticle patterns according to their nest origin, these compounds are not used for nestmate recognition, since newly emerged workers are broadly accepted in different colonies. The cerumen used in nest construction {{played an important role in}} recognition behaviour. Twenty minutes of contact with foreign cerumen was sufficient to increase the rejection rates of nestmates and separate the groups of workers according to their chemical profile.

Performance evaluation was done with code system REBUS connected with TRANSX and TWODANT. Scenario Number 1 is the pyroprocessing of Canada deuterium uranium (CANDU) SF. Because the recycling of CANDU SF {{does not have any}} safety problems, the CANDU-Pyro-SFR system will be possible if the pyroprocessing capacity is large enough. Scenario Number 2 is a feasibility <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> SF from a pressurized water reactor PWR. The sensitivity of cooling time before prior to pyro-processing was studied. As the cooling time increases, excess reactivity {{at the beginning of the}} equilibrium cycle (BOEC) decreases, thereby creating advantageous reactivity control and improving the transmutation performance of minor actinides. Scenario Number 3 is a case study for various levels of recovery factors of transuranic isotopes (TRUs). If long-lived fission products can be separated during pyroprocessing, the waste that is not recovered is classified as low- and intermediate-level waste, and it is sufficient to be disposed of in an underground site due to very low-heat-generation rate when the waste cooling time becomes > 300 years at a TRU recovery factor of 99. 9 %.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of organisms {{within a community}} can often {{be determined by the}} degree of plasticity or degree of specialization of resource acquisition. Resource acquisition is often based on the morphology of an organism, behavior, or a combination <b>of</b> both. Performance <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>feeding</b> can identify the possible interactions that allow one species to better exploit a prey item. Scavenging behaviors in {{the presence or absence of}} a competitor were investigated by quantifying prey selection in a trophic generalist, spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias, and a trophic specialist, smooth-hounds Mustelus canis, in order to determine if each shark scavenged according to its jaw morphology. The diet of dogfish consists of small fishes, squid, ctenophores, and bivalves; they are expected to be nonselective predators. Smooth-hounds primarily feed on crustaceans; therefore, they are predicted to select crabs over other prey types. Prey selection was quantified by ranking each prey item according to the order it was consumed. Dietary shifts were analyzed by comparing the percentage of each prey item selected during solitary versus competitive scavenging. When scavenging alone, dogfish prefer herring and squid, which are easily handled by the cutting dentition of dogfish. Dogfish shift their diet to include a greater number of prey types when scavenging with a competitor. Smooth-hounds scavenge on squid, herring, and shrimp when alone, but increase the number of crabs in the diet when scavenging competitively. Competition causes smooth-hounds to scavenge according to their jaw morphology and locomotor abilities, which enables them to feed on a specialized resource [Current Zoology 56 (1) : 100 – 108 2010]...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{was conducted on the}} national database <b>of</b> the station <b>tests</b> carried out between May 1996 and February 2001, using the Hungarian Large White (LW) and Hungarian Landrace (LR) breeds, and the A-line of the Ka-Hyb hybrid (MLW). Days <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> total amount <b>of</b> <b>feed</b> consumed and valuable cuts were taken into the analysis to test the random distribution of the animals' phenotypic measurements and predicted breeding values across the contemporary groups of origin. The phenotypic measurements of all traits were clearly positively associated with the herds of origin (b = 0. 52 - 1. 08). Animals with favourable phenotypic measurements originated from better herds. On the contrary, the predicted breeding values seemed to be independent of the herd effects (b= - 0. 16 - 0. 08) and suggested a possible random distribution across the contemporary groups...|$|R
