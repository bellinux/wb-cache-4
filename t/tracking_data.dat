5|$|All {{populations are}} migratory, and most birds winter in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara, {{with just a few}} records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa. Some Asian birds may {{therefore}} cross 100° of longitude on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Recent <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> has revealed that European nightjars have a loop migration from Western Europe to sub-equatorial Africa where they have to cross several ecological barriers (Mediterranean Sea, Sahara and the Central African Tropical Rainforest). Individuals use similar stop-over sites as do other European migrants. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Seychelles, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|Cheek to Cheek debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 with 131,000 copies sold in its first week {{according}} to Nielsen SoundScan, earning Gaga her third consecutive number-one album and the second for Bennett. It also topped the Jazz Albums and Traditional Jazz Albums charts. Bennett beat his own record—previously achieved in 2011 with Duets II—as the oldest living act to earn a number one album in the US. The debut also made Gaga the first female artist in the 2010 decade to have three number-one albums. Along with the Billboard 200 and Jazz Albums, Cheek to Cheek also entered at number four on the Top Digital Albums chart. As of March 2017, the album has sold more than 750,000 copies in the country, becoming Bennett's seventh half-million album since Nielsen began <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> in 1991, and Gaga's fifth. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of over 500,000 copies. Cheek to Cheek debuted at number three on the Canadian Albums Chart selling 10,000 copies per SoundScan. It was certified Platinum by the Music Canada (MC) for shipment of 80,000 copies of the album.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{there are}} two {{approaches}} to detecting extreme events such as TCs: the model-driven approach (deductive approach), including numerical simulation, and the data-driven approach (inductive approach), including machine learning. The model-driven approach has the limitation that the prediction error increases with lead time because numerical models are inherently dependent on initial values. On the other hand, machine learning, as a data-driven approach, requires {{a large amount of}} high-quality training data. Most related works use reanalysis data and/or satellite observational data and labeled data as TCs or precursors based on the best <b>track</b> <b>data</b> provided by meteorological agencies. However, best <b>track</b> <b>data</b> for a TC’s occurrence well ahead of its formation is limited because the best <b>track</b> <b>data</b> is basically generated using the EDA technique and are limited in accuracy and elapsed time. For example, the best <b>track</b> <b>data</b> from the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC), Tokyo, captures precursors 60 [*]h before TC formation, on average, whereas simulation data from cloud-resolving global atmospheric models (Kodama et al. 2015) and TC tracking algorithms capture TC formation 107 [*]h ahead, on average.|$|R
25|$|The North Vietnamese also netted their SA-2 Fan Song fire-control radars {{with their}} Bar Lock, Whiff, and Spoon Rest ground control {{intercept}} (GCI) radars. The GCI radars could feed the <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> to Fan Song, which then {{did not have}} to be turned on until after missile launch. The Radar Homing and Warning (RHAW) gear carried by the American aircraft provided warning when the aircraft were being tracked by the Fan Song, but could not detect emissions from the GCI radar. Thus pilots had little or no warning of a missile attack.|$|E
25|$|In late 1971, the North Vietnamese {{took several}} actions which vastly {{improved}} and augmented their tracking capability. The most important was netting of their early warning and surveillance radar and their anti-aircraft artillery radar with SAM missiles. In that netted mode, the Fan Song (radars) which alerted U.S. pilots to the surveillance never came up, as the surveillance {{could all be}} conducted with the other radars. General Lavelle believed that, with those mutually supporting radar systems transmitting <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> to the firing sites, the SAM missile system was activated at U.S. aircraft at any time they were over North Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The Red, Orange, and Blue {{lines have}} block {{signalling}} systems that make tracking {{the location of}} trains easier. Signs in most station on those lines began to display real-time train information in late 2012 and early 2013, while data feeds have been available for smartphone applications since 2010. However, the wayside signalling system used in the Green Line's tunnels and the D Branch does not provide for that level of tracking, nor do the basic stop/go signals used on the street-level branch lines. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to provide full <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> for the Green Line by 2015, allowing use of smartphone applications and in-station countdown signs.

25|$|TfL {{reported}} in January 2014, that despite {{a reduction of}} traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, {{as well as an}} increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.|$|E

The Forward Acquisition Radar (FAR) would be positioned [...] ahead of the Zeus bases to provide early warning of up to 200 to 300seconds of <b>tracking</b> <b>data</b> on up to 200 targets. The FAR would broadcast 10MW pulses at UHF between 405–495MHz, allowing it to detect a 1square metre radar reflection at [...] or a more typical 0.1m2 target at [...] Each track would be stored as a 200 bit file including location, velocity, time of measure and a measure of the quality of the data. Clouds of objects would be tracked as a single object with additional data indicating the width and length of the cloud. Tracks could be updated every five seconds while the target was in view, but the antenna rotated at a relatively slow 4RPM so targets moved significantly between rotations.
