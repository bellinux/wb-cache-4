30|$|A {{last point}} {{worthy of note}} is the {{possible}} heterogeneity in <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> effect across periods. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> {{may be more effective}} as time goes on or, on the other hand, the effect may be stronger just after the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>policy,</b> then phases out with the passing of time. In order to see whether <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> effect is quarter- and/or year-specific, three specifications are estimated based on the empirical strategy just outlined above. First, <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> effect is imposed to be constant across quarters over the period. More specifically, there is no allowance for quarter and year specific dummies, and the comparison is between the entire period after <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> introduction and <b>the</b> entire period before <b>the</b> <b>policy.</b> This specification is called “period specific” <b>policy</b> effect. Next, <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> effect is imposed to be constant across quarters within a year, but allowing for variation between years by introducing year specific dummies for <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> period. This specification enables the estimation of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> effect for each year over <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> period. Thirdly, an allowance is made for heterogeneous policy effect across quarters by including year specific quarter dummies. This time the comparison is between each quarter within <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> period and <b>the</b> entire period before <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> intervention. This most flexible specification provides separate estimates of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> effect for each quarter over <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> period 15. Furthermore, each quarter within <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> period is compared to the corresponding quarter in the pre-policy period in order to test the role of seasonality in policy effectiveness.|$|R

40|$|Building on {{a variety}} of conceptualizations about <b>the</b> policymaker, <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> analyst, and <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> process, this essay seeks to {{understand}} how these three aspects mesh together. Consequently, this paper attempts to examine four questions that are germane to the analysis of policy: What roles can <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> analyst play? What are the personality types of policymakers? What {{is the role of the}} policymaker's personality in <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> process? What are the windows of opportunity for <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> analyst in one's attempt to influence the policymaker during <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> process? This paper argues that <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> analyst has <b>the</b> opportunity to influence policymakers at various stages of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> process. However, <b>the</b> influence strategies that are effective are different depending upon the type of policymaker. This understanding is vital if a policy analyst desires to have an impact. Furthermore, the role the analyst performs has a significant impact on the how and the extent to which the analyst may have leverage.

Recalling <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> design described in Section 2.1., the treatment group (those targeted by <b>the</b> <b>policy)</b> could be selected from among men aged 20 - 29 and women over 18 years old, and the control group (those not targeted by <b>the</b> <b>policy)</b> could be selected from among men aged over 29 years.

50|$|The {{first step}} for <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> analyst is to {{identify}} the space in which <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> problem exists.

In keeping with the example, <b>the</b> narrower <b>policy</b> issue area is renewable energy. Once this is done, the analyst can begin to identify the players involved in <b>the</b> <b>policy.</b> Within this step there are other considerations to include, such {{as the level of}} public awareness of <b>the</b> proposed <b>policy,</b> <b>the</b> dynamics created by the timing of <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> proposal, and <b>the</b> concerns and voting patterns of different demographics.|$|R

30|$|What {{could be}} the {{underlying}} reasons behind <b>the</b> significant <b>policy</b> effect in some quarters along with insignificant effect in the others? First, a check was made whether seasonality matters in characterizing <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> effect by introducing non-year specific quarter dummies in the interaction term. In particular, each quarter over <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> period is {{compared with the same}} quarter before <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> intervention. For instance, the third quarter after <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> period (of 2008 and 2009) is compared with the third quarter before <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> period (of 2006 and 2007). The results indicate no evidence of seasonality {{in the sense that the}} coefficients of the interaction terms were found statistically insignificant. In fact, there is one evident explanation for the quarter-specific pattern in <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> effect. As mentioned in Section 2.1, <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> announced in May 2008 was initially designed for one year. After the economic crisis hit the labor market by the third quarter of 2008, the government decided to extend <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> period for one more year, and the statistically significant estimates in 2009 are detected precisely in quarters at the beginning of the second implementation year of <b>the</b> <b>policy.</b> As proposed by Uysal (2013), the reason why <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> effect dies out by the end of 2009 could be related to the introduction of new employment incentives provided for all new employment creation 18.|$|R
