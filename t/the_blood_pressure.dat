5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, especially if <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary {{until it is}} known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E

5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E
5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. <b>The</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} <b>the</b> diurnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{curve in}} healthy normotensive children. Thirty-one children were re-examined after a median interval of 123 days {{in order to}} study the reproducibility of the diurnal profile. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring and conventional <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> readings were obtained in 228 normotensive children, whose ages ranged from 6 to 16 years and of whom 116 were boys and 112 girls. RESULTS: <b>The</b> conventional <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> averaged 99 +/- 11 / 57 +/- 9 mmHg in boys and 98 +/- 12 / 56 +/- 9 mmHg in girls (means+/-SD); the corresponding 24 h pressures were 111 +/- 7 / 66 +/- 5 mmHg and 109 +/- 7 / 65 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively. Of the children, 83 % had a significant diurnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> rhythm for systolic pressure and 89 % for diastolic <b>pressure.</b> <b>The</b> nocturnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> fall was normally distributed, averaging 12. 0 +/- 6. 3 mmHg systolic and 14. 2 +/- 5. 9 mmHg diastolic. There was no evidence for a bimodal distribution. The amplitude of <b>the</b> diurnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> curve, determined by the Fourier approach, was positively skewed {{with a mean of}} 12. 5 +/- 4. 2 mmHg for systolic and 14. 0 +/- 4. 1 mmHg for diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> <b>The</b> daily <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> maximum occurred at 1344 +/- 4 h 46 min for systolic and 1321 +/- 4 h 22 min for diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> For systolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>the</b> cumulative sum (cusum) -derived circadian alteration magnitude was 1. 7 +/- 6. 2 mmHg higher in boys than in girls, whereas the cusum plot height was also 7. 3 +/- 27. 0 mmHg x h higher in male subjects. The repeatability coefficient (2 SD of the difference between paired recordings, expressed as a percentage of nearly maximal variation) was 80 % for the conventional systolic pressure and 40 % for <b>the</b> conventional diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> <b>The</b> repeatability coefficients for <b>the</b> ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> levels varied from 32 to 45 % and for the parameters describing <b>the</b> diurnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> profile from 42 to 78 %. CONCLUSION: A significant diurnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> rhythm is observed in most normotensive children and adolescents. There is no evidence for a bimodal distribution of <b>the</b> nocturnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> fall. <b>The</b> reproducibility of the parameters of <b>the</b> diurnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> curve tended to be less than that of <b>the</b> ambulatory <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> level. Thus, one 24 h recording is probably insufficient to characterize a child's diurnal <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> profile fully. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|When a {{mosquito}} carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin {{together with the}} mosquito's saliva. It binds to and enters white blood cells, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins, such as cytokines and interferons, which are responsible {{for many of the}} symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms, and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the liver and the bone marrow) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to capillary permeability. As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.|$|E
5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, {{the ship is}} struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by {{what appears to be}} a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as it should be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> of a living human being.

5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
