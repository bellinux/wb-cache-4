5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about as {{frequently}} as boys on surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often. If <b>they</b> <b>survived,</b> Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E

5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{reached the}} quarter-finals of the 1968 League Cup; drawn away to Brian Clough's Derby County, {{they took the}} lead, only to lose 5–4. During the 1970s the club had to apply for {{re-election}} to the League five times, and by 1982 they were facing a financial crisis which <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> thanks to fundraising efforts in the town. Three years later they won promotion by finishing third in the league under manager Cyril Knowles. Darlington spent two seasons in the Third Division; the 13th-place finish in 1986 was the highest position they achieved in the Football League since {{the introduction of the}} four-division structure in 1958, but they were relegated the following season.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the docks}} {{declined}} in use and were finally closed in 1980, {{leading to the}} setting up of the London Docklands Development Corporation in 1981. London's main port is now at Tilbury, further down the Thames estuary, outside the boundary of Greater London. The dock had been established in 1886 to bring bulk goods by rail to London, but being nearer the sea and able to accommodate vessels of 50,000tons, they were more easily converted {{to the needs of}} modern container ships in 1968, and so <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> the closure of the inner docks. Various wharves along the river continue to be in use but on a much smaller scale.|$|E

Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated short balls, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. However, <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> Lindwall's spell of bowling. Late in the day, Lindwall was brought back {{to put pressure on}} Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance.|$|E
5|$|Sir Nicholas' kindertransport efforts {{remained}} largely unrecognised until 1988, {{when they came}} to public attention after his wife found a scrapbook in their attic documenting the details. Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn the story of how <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> the Holocaust. As the majority of 'Winton's Children' (as they came to be known) were Jewish, it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia. As of 2009, the direct descendants of Winton's Children numbered over 5000 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} is extensive. At least seven hippopotamus bones show unequivocal signs of butchery, suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> until humans arrived on Madagascar. The evidence of humans butchering the hippos also suggests their extinction may have been, in part, due to humans. Despite the discovery of many fossils, the hippos of Madagascar are not very well studied, perhaps because researchers are interested {{in some of the}} more exotic megafauna of Madagascar, such as the giant lemurs and the elephant birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Royal Warrant, {{was silent}} {{on whether the}} VC could be awarded posthumously. From 1857 until 1897, 18 recipients were gazetted after their deaths but only 12 of the next of kin received the actual medal. In the other six cases there was a memorandum stating {{that they would have}} been recommended for the VC had <b>they</b> <b>survived.</b> By 1899, the precedent had been established that the VC could be awarded posthumously if the recommendation for the award was submitted prior to the recipient’s death from wounds. Two such awards were granted during the Second Boer War, the well known award to Frederick Roberts, the son of Lord Roberts VC and to Francis Parsons. In 1900 and 1901, three memoranda were issued for Herman Albrecht, Robert Digby-Jones and David Younger stating they would have been recommended for the VC had <b>they</b> <b>survived.</b> In a partial reversal of policy restricted to the Second Boer War, it was announced in the London Gazette on 8 August 1902, that the next of kin of the three soldiers mentioned in memoranda would be sent medals. In the same gazette, the first three posthumous awards were gazetted to Alfred Atkinson, John Barry and Gustavus Coulson. In 1907, the posthumous policy was reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the remaining six officers and men. Although the Victoria Cross warrant was not amended to specifically include posthumous awards until 1920, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.|$|E
5|$|Although the IUCN {{lists the}} Rodrigues {{solitaire}} as going extinct by 1778, the species probably became extinct some {{time between the}} 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750, when traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires, and released cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks. In 1755, Joseph-François Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen, {{as he had been}} assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island. After searching for 18 months and offering large rewards, he could find none. He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species, but suspected that it was really due to hunting by humans. When he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, Alexandre Guy Pingré encountered no solitaires, although he had been assured that <b>they</b> <b>survived.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jimenez stopped {{feeding the}} pups after Thanksgiving that same year. Though the pups learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} poacher. Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, a sanctuary in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The fates of the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses hope that <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to continue in the wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wolf Program Coordinator.|$|E

Although the Rodrigues solitaire is the only extinct bird to have a former constellation named for it, celestial mapmakers did not know what it looked like and star maps depict other birds.|$|E
5|$|The native {{range of}} emerald ash borer in Asia was {{surveyed}} for parasitoid species that parasitize emerald ash borer {{and do not}} attack other insect species in the hope they would suppress populations when released in North America. Three species imported from China were approved for release by the USDA in 2007 and in Canada in 2013: Spathius agrili, Tetrastichus planipennisi, and Oobius agrili, while Spathius galinae was approved for release in 2015. Excluding Spathius galinae, which has only recently been released, the other three species have been documented parasitizing emerald ash borer larvae one year after release, indicating that <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> the winter, but establishment varied among species and locations. Tetrastichus planipennisi and Oobius agrili established and have had increasing populations in Michigan since 2008; Spathius agrili has had lower establishment success in North America, which {{could be due to}} a lack of available emerald ash borer larvae at the time of adult emergence in spring, limited cold tolerance, and better suitability to regions of North America below the 40th parallel.|$|E
5|$|The order Squamata, {{which is}} {{represented}} today by lizards, including snakes and amphisbaenians (worm lizards), radiated into various ecological niches during the Jurassic and was successful throughout the Cretaceous. <b>They</b> <b>survived</b> through the K–Pg boundary and are currently {{the most successful}} and diverse group of living reptiles, with more than 6,000 extant species. Many families of terrestrial squamates became extinct at the boundary, such as monstersaurians and polyglyphanodonts, and fossil evidence indicates they suffered very heavy losses in the KT event, only recovering 10 million years after it. Giant non-archosaurian aquatic reptiles such as mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, which were the top marine predators of their time, became extinct {{by the end of}} the Cretaceous. The ichthyosaurs had disappeared from fossil records before the mass extinction occurred.|$|E

5|$|Until 1907, it was policy not {{to award}} the VC posthumously.

As a result of the change of policy, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous but it was only in the general revision of the warrant issued in 1920 that a clause was inserted to explicitly allow posthumous awards.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her. Steve is shocked <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> but taunts them that he has the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides is {{a member}} of the Eomyidae, a diverse rodent family that is now extinct. Eomyids first {{appeared}} in the Middle Eocene (~47 million years ago, mya) in North America, where they existed until the end of the Miocene (~5 mya). In Europe, <b>they</b> <b>survived</b> a little longer, until the end of the Pliocene (~2–3 mya). Apeomyoides is further part of a distinctive subgroup of eomyids known as the Apeomyinae. The first apeomyine to be discovered was Apeomys tuerkheimae, named in 1968 based on fossils from the Early Miocene of Germany, and later discoveries have expanded the range of Apeomys and similar taxa. In 1998, Oldřich Fejfar and colleagues reviewed Apeomys and identified a second, related genus Megapeomys, from the Early Miocene of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Japan. These scientists also named a new eomyid subfamily, Apeomyinae, to house Apeomys and Megapeomys. The Japanese Megapeomys was named as a separate species, Megapeomys repenningi, in 2011. Further apeomyines have been identified in North America: Megapeomys bobwilsoni from the Hemingfordian of Nevada, Apeomyoides savagei from the Barstovian of Nevada, Zophoapeomys indicum from the Late Oligocene of South Dakota, and a possible second species of Zophoapeomys from the Late Oligocene of Nebraska. Another North American eomyid, Arikareeomys skinneri, from the Arikareean of Nebraska, has also been reidentified as an apeomyine.|$|E
