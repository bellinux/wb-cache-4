40|$|The {{behavioural}} repertoire of male flies includes visually guided chasing after moving targets. The visuomotor control system for these pursuits {{belongs to the}} fastest found in the animal kingdom. We simulated a virtual fly, to test whether or not experimentally established hypotheses on the underlying control system are sufficient to explain chasing behaviour. Two operating instructions for steering the chasing virtual fly were derived from behavioural experiments: (i) the retinal size of the target controls the fly's forward speed and, thus, indirectly its distance to the target; and (ii) a smooth pursuit system uses the retinal position of the target to regulate the fly's flight direction. Low-pass filters implement neuronal processing time. Treating the virtual fly as a point mass, its kinematics are modelled in consideration {{of the effects of}} <b>translatory</b> <b>inertia</b> and air friction. Despite its simplicity, the model shows behaviour similar to that of real flies. Depending on its starting position and orientation as well as on target size and speed, the virtual fly either catches the target or follows it indefinitely without capture. These two behavioural modes of the virtual fly emerge from the control system for flight steering without implementation of an explicit decision maker...|$|E
40|$|Application of the multisegment {{numerical}} integration {{technique is}} {{extended to the}} free-vibration analysis of macroscopically anisotropic filament-wound branched shells of revolution with ring stiffeners, considering the variation of the thickness and winding angle. The solution procedure {{is based on a}} modified-frequency trial method, which processes on the numerically integrated transformed fundamental shell equations that are obtained in terms of finite exponential Fourier transform of the fundamental shell variables. The full macroscopically anisotropic form of the constitutive relations, including first-order transverse shear deformation and all components of <b>translatory</b> and rotary <b>inertia,</b> are included in the analysis. To handle branched shells of revolution, modifications that are necessary to incorporate junctions are added to the solution procedure. Inclusion of asymmetric circumferential stiffeners, with respect to the middle surface of the shell, into the semi-analytical solution method is demonstrated by presenting two alternative methods of analysis. The present solution methodology also incorporates the variation of the thickness and winding angle along the meridian of filament-wound shells of revolution, with general meridional curvature, by assuming placement of filaments along the geodesic fiber path {{on the surface of the}} shell of revolution.
