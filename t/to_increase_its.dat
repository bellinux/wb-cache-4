5|$|Boron carbide's {{ability to}} absorb {{neutrons}} without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> surface area.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of the dam}} {{started in}} 1919 and was {{finished}} in 1923, with the first water delivered in 1934 after numerous delays. From 1935–38 the dam was raised <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> capacity for water supply and power generation. The dam, aqueduct and appurtenant hydroelectric systems are collectively known as the Hetch Hetchy Project. Deriving from a largely wild and pristine area of the Sierra Nevada, the Hetch Hetchy supply {{is some of the}} cleanest municipal water in the US, requiring only primary filtration and disinfection.|$|E

5|$|In 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re-established Swiss {{independence}} and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality. Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta. The treaty also allowed Switzerland <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> territory, with the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. Switzerland's borders have not changed since, except for some minor adjustments.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump {{water out of the}} mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.|$|E

In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.|$|E

The wing turrets and their magazines further divided the machinery into three separated groups, thereby increasing survivability. The ships carried 2,700tons of coal, and were later modified to carry an additional 160tons of oil that was to be sprayed on the coal, <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>its</b> burn rate.
