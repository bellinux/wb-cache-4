5|$|The April 15 eclipse was {{the first}} eclipse in a tetrad; that is, four {{consecutive}} total eclipses with no partial eclipses in between. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> eclipse every six lunar cycles during the tetrad – on October 8, 2014, April 4, 2015, and September 28, 2015. The lunar year series repeats after 12 cycles, or 354 days, causing a date shift {{when compared to the}} solar calendar. This shift means the Earth's shadow will move about 11 degrees west in each subsequent eclipse.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015 in {{his column}} in Weekly Famitsu, Sakurai alluded to the {{possibility}} of retirement, expressing doubt that {{he would be able to}} continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was. In December 2015, Sakurai once again stated that he was not sure if <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> Smash Bros. game in the series. In January 2016, it was rumoured that a Super Smash Bros. game was being developed by Bandai Namco and that the game was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. However, the rumour was debunked upon the release of the Switch.|$|E

25|$|According to linear {{interpolation}} and extrapolation of UNDESA population estimates, the world population has doubled, or will double, {{in the years}} listed in the tables below (with two different starting points).

25|$|Fortnight: Half a synodic month (29.53 days). When {{there is}} an eclipse, there is a fair chance that at the next syzygy <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> eclipse: the Sun and Moon will have moved about 15° {{with respect to the}} nodes (the Moon being {{opposite}} to where it was the previous time), but the luminaries may still be within bounds to make an eclipse.For example, partial solar eclipse of June 1, 2011 is followed by the total lunar eclipse of June 16, 2011 and partial solar eclipse of July 1, 2011.|$|E

In 2009, an article in the BBC News singled out the Glass Spider Tour's innovative set and marriage of music and theatre as an inspiration to later acts, including Britney Spears, Madonna, U2 and others. Stage designer Willie Williams said the Glass Spider Tour was a template for those acts: [...] "There will be one set of costumes and they will do a few songs, then <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> big scene change and {{move on to the next}} thing. Bowie crossing rock 'n' roll with Broadway [...] was where that began."

Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that [...] "here's always going to be an opposition.

[...] While details regarding just how much Jim being out of shape would affect game design are still up in the air, Perry mentioned being pretty certain that the game would be played in 2D.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is deemed}} the most {{important}} duty that parents owe to their son by letting him go forth and embrace the legacy of Gautama Buddha, join the sangha and become immersed in {{the teachings of the}} Buddha, the Dhamma, at least for a short while, perhaps longer if not {{for the rest of his}} life. A boy may become a novice on more than one occasion, but by the age of twenty <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> great occasion, the upasampada ordination, in which the boy becomes a fully ordained bhikkhu ( [...] bazin). Those who are not blessed with a male child will seek for an orphan boy or a boy from very poor families in order to receive this special dispensation by the Buddha and hence gain great merit by the act. Shinbyu may well be regarded as a rite of passage or coming of age ceremony as in other religions.

This decision coincided with the release of the band's biography, Love and Poison on 3 November. On 5 November, the band announced {{that there would be no}} more projects under the Suede name for the foreseeable future – effectively announcing the end of the band, as they stated on their website: [...] "There will not be a new studio album until the band feel that the moment is artistically right to make one." [...] Anderson also made a personal statement saying: [...] "There has been speculation about record sales and chart positions, but the bottom line is I need to do whatever it takes to get my demon back." [...] Suede's last concert at the London Astoria on 13 December 2003 was a two-and-a-half-hour marathon show, split into two parts plus encore.

2500|$|On 19 February, Thiers {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a new government with nine ministers, a majority of republicans, including Jules Favre and Jules Simon. The first task assigned by the Assembly was to negotiate an end to the War. Thiers traveled with a delegation of five members of the Assembly to Versailles, where Bismarck was waiting. When he arrived at the hotel, he met the Prussian Field Marshal [...] Moltke, who told him, [...] "You are lucky to be negotiating with Bismarck. If it were me, I would occupy your country for thirty years and in that time {{there would be no more}} France." [...] At the first meeting, Bismarck demanded the province of Alsace and eight billion francs. Thiers insisted that France could pay no more than five billion francs, and Bismarck reduced the payment, but insisted that Germany must have part of Lorraine and Metz as well. The talks were long and stressful; at one point Thiers, exhausted, broke down and wept. Bismarck helped him to a sofa, covered him with his overcoat, and told him, [...] "Ah, my poor Monsieur Thiers, there is no one but you and I who really love France." [...] The negotiations resumed, and Thiers conceded Alsace and part of Lorraine, in exchange for a reduction in the payment. He told the other French delegates, [...] "If we lose one or two provinces it is not of great importance. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> war when France will be victorious, and we will get them back. But the billions we give to Germany now we will never recover." [...] Thiers insisted, however, that France keep the fortress town of Belfort. Bismarck conceded the town, on the condition that, when the armistice was signed, the Prussian army could hold a brief victory parade on the Champs-Élysées, and could remain until the treaty was ratified. Thiers felt he had little choice but to accept.|$|E
2500|$|Dimension {{stone is}} one of the most {{sustainable}} of the industrial minerals since it is created by separating it from the natural bedrock underlying all land on every continent. [...] Dimension stone rates very well in terms of the criteria on the ASTM checklist for sustainability of building products: there are no toxic materials used in its processing, there are no direct greenhouse gas emissions during processing, the dust created is controlled, the water used is almost completely recycled (per OSHA/MSHA regulation), and it is a perpetual resource (virtually inexhaustible in a human time scale). [...] Dimension stone in use can last many generations, even centuries, so the dimension stone manufacturers have not needed a product recycling program. [...] However, there are practical qualifications to and constraints on that sustainability. [...] The dimension stone color and pattern can be changed by weathering when it is very near the surface. [...] The color and pattern can also be changed by proximity to an igneous rock body or by the presence of circulating groundwater charged with carbon dioxide (i.e., limestone, travertine, marble). [...] On the other hand, changes in color and/or pattern can be positive. [...] For example, there are at least 14 separately trade-named varieties of Carrara Marble with many patterns (or no patterns) ranging in shade from white to gray. [...] The presence of faults or closely spaced joints can render the stone unusable. [...] These faults and joints do not have to be at odd angles in the stone mass. [...] Closely spaced, wrongly spaced, or nonparallel bedding planes can make the stone unusable, particularly if the bedding planes are planes of weakness. [...] If part of the stone in one area is unusable, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>another</b> usable part of the stone elsewhere in the formation. [...] A quarry is not a short-term project unless it encounters one of these constraints. [...] Examples of big, old quarries operating for more than a century include the Barre (VT) granite quarry, the Georgia Marble quarry at Tate, several of the Carrara (Italy) marble quarries, and the Penrhyn (Wales) slate quarry. [...] A quarry will produce dust, noise, and some water pollution, but these can be remedied without too much trouble. [...] The landscape may also have to be restored if quarry waste is temporarily or permanently placed on adjacent land.|$|E
