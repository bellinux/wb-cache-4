500|$|Armstrong {{would later}} declare his {{candidacy}} {{for that particular}} election (the Edmonton municipal election, February 1912), for the position of what {{was referred to as}} the first mayor of [...] "Greater Edmonton" [...] Stating that in his belief, 1911 {{was one of the most}} successful years in the history of the city, he ran on the premise that he had unfinished work from his first term, stating, [...] "I ask for a continuance of your confidence, support and influence <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> an opportunity to complete those undertakings which are in the best interests of Greater Edmonton". His opponent, Bryce J. Saunders charged that the city had long lacked efficiency in its utilities, particular the water supply, which he believed in the public ownership of. Armstrong would later go on to defeat Saunders in the general election, 1791 votes to Saunders' 1072, a margin of just over 700, with a voter turnout of around 30 percent.|$|E

He believes in me that much. I'm really blessed ... It's the most incredible gift that Mr Gibson could have given me." [...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all." ...|$|E

I ask for you <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> and Sun Yu to invade Shu (Yi Province) and attack Zhang Lu after that. Sun Yu will then remain behind to defend the captured territories and form an alliance with Ma Chao. I'll join you in attacking Cao Cao at Xiangyang, and we can conquer the north."

[...] "What I was excited about in their offer to bring me on board is that it was wide open for me. There was not going to be any room with a closed door and I would be given an opportunity to see and learn. As time goes by there will be some days where my role is more hockey specific and some days where my role is more business or marketing specific." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{operation}} MASK (19341937), an MI5 counterspy infiltrated the party, and {{was for a}} time Pollitt's {{assistant and}} a clandestine radio operator. [...] This allowed John Tiltman and his colleagues to crack the code and decrypt, for a few years, messages between Moscow {{and some of its}} foreign parties, such as the CPGB. [...] They revealed the Comintern's close supervision of the Communist Party and Pollitt. Among other things, Pollitt was instructed to refute news leaks about a Stalinist purge. [...] Some messages were addressed to code names, while others were signed by Pollitt himself. In his transmissions to Moscow, Pollitt regularly pleaded for more funding from the Soviet Union. One 1936 coded instruction advised Pollitt to publicise the plight of Ernst Thälmann, a German communist leader who had been arrested by the Nazis and who later died at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Pollitt replied that he was 'having difficulties' getting English statesmen to make public declarations supporting Thälmann but that they promised they would speak privately with German officials in London. In one of the more amusing dispatches, Pollitt (1936) informed his Soviet contact about a recent visit to France to make campaign appearances for candidates from the French Communist Party. [...] "At great inconvenience went to Paris to speak in the election campaign". Pollitt went on to complain that he was [...] "kept sitting two days and comrades refused <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>me</b> to speak. Such treatment as I received in Paris is a scandal".|$|E
