Montville, then a U.S. State Department employee, {{coined the}} phrases Track One and <b>Track</b> <b>Two</b> <b>diplomacy</b> in [...] "Foreign Policy According to Freud", which {{appeared}} in Foreign Policy (Davidson & Montville, 1981). Track One diplomacy was what diplomats did—formal negotiations between nations conducted by professional diplomats. <b>Track</b> <b>Two</b> <b>diplomacy</b> referred to conflict resolution efforts by professional non-governmental conflict resolution practitioners and theorists. [...] "Track Two has as its object the reduction or resolution of conflict, within a country or between countries, by lowering the anger or tension or fear that exists, through improved communication and {{a better understanding of}} each other's point of view".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Track</b> <b>two</b> <b>diplomacy</b> is unofficial, non-structured interaction. It {{is always}} open minded, often altruistic, and ... {{strategically}} optimistic, based on best case analysis. Its underlying {{assumption is that}} actual or potential conflict can be resolved or eased by appealing to common human capabilities to respond to good will and reasonableness. Scientific and cultural exchanges are examples of <b>track</b> <b>two</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> The problem most political liberals fail to recognize is that reasonable and altruistic interaction with foreign countries cannot be an alternative to traditional track one diplomacy, with its official posturing and its underlying threat {{of the use of}} force.

Theoretical part of this current paper is divided into several different parts: {{the definition of the}} term „public dipolmacy“ is defined in the first part, as in the second part it is compared to propaganda, public relations and national branding. Third part is centered on the public diplomacy 2. 0 and Wikileaks, which has direct effects on diplomacy and its’ openness. The paper’s theoretical part draws mostly on the works of Eytan Gilboa, Jacquie L'Etang, Denis McQuail and Joseph Nye. In purpose to answer the research questions I carried out four interviews with the employees of the Public Diplomacy Department of Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and an interview with the charge d’affaires in Afghanistan. The interviews were constructed by the semistructured interview scheme which is suitable for finding causations and explanations. To analyse the collected material I used cross-case method: the pieces from various interviews from the sections relating to specific topics were discussed. The results showed that the main purpose of the external communications of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is to promote Estonia and it’s foreign policy, create and maintain Estonia’s good reputation which is achieved in collaboration between the headquarter and the ambassadors in current countries. Public diplomacy was mostly defined in contrast with traditional diplomacy. The employees agreed on the point that the communication activities of the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have intersections with public diplomacy because it was believed that public diplomacy itself is communication. Opinions on Wikileaks were controversial. It was considered that diplomacy can never be done with completely opened doors, but it was also believed that Wikileaks has a positive 68 impact on public diplomacy, as citizens become more positively involved in different (communicational) actions. The Ministry has successfully integrated public diplomacy 2. 0 into their everyday work as it fulfills the objective of reaching wider audiences and bringing diplomacy and the work of diplomat’s closer to citizens. The Ministry has also blogs, which reflects the daily life and doings of diplomats. 2. 0 channels doesn’t change the content of the messages but it provides greater opportunities for bilateral interactions. Overall the external communication purposes of Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs have strong intersections with public diplomacy in terms of creating and holding the country’s reputation and using different activities of public diplomacy. Cultural diplomacy is a part of public diplomacy which is considered to have long-term positive impact on communication activities...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{collapse}} of the Oslo peace process and the violence that followed, many scholars have reflected upon the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Most of this analysis has focused on official negotiations without considering the substantial role that unofficial peace efforts have played in peacebuilding, both prior to and after Oslo. This article, in contrast, seeks to better understand the application of "track two" diplomacy to the Israeli-Palestinian case. It reports on a self-reflection effort by numerous Israeli-Palestinian peace practitioners to better understand what has worked, what has not, and how new initiatives could be more effectively organized and carried out in the future. The research presented is based on an inventory of seventy-nine <b>track</b> <b>two</b> projects that occurred between Israelis and Palestinians between 1992 and 2004, personal interviews with many of those who organized and oversaw these projects, and two focus group meetings that brought together a total of forty practitioners. In this article, we seek to better understand two issues: (1) how <b>track</b> <b>two</b> initiatives have changed in scope, organization, and intent; and (2) how <b>track</b> <b>two</b> practitioners have sought to disseminate their work beyond the participants of those initiatives. Our findings present an overall picture of the Israeli-Palestinian second track practice and identify a number of trends and common types of practice. Among the trends we have identified are the following: during the peace process years, more <b>track</b> <b>two</b> initiatives were undertaken with elite/professional participants than with representatives of the grassroots, but in the subsequent decade-and-a-half, Israeli-Palestinian grassroots, <b>track</b> <b>two</b> initiatives gradually replaced senior-level <b>track</b> <b>two</b> exchanges; most of the grassroots initiatives we studied were relationship focused, whereas those involving elite participants are outcome focused; the <b>track</b> <b>two</b> community subscribes to a set of theoretical propositions about which conditions and contexts facilitate the transmission of <b>track</b> <b>two</b> insights and ideas to the political process, but these propositions have yet to be validated; and <b>track</b> <b>two</b> specialists do little strategic planning about ways to most effectively transfer <b>track</b> <b>two</b> insights and ideas to the political process. Our research also identified four distinct, but not mutually exclusive, approaches to practice: the psychological, the constructivist, the capacity building, and the realistic interest. © 2012 President and Fellows of Harvard College...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the role that <b>Track</b> <b>Two</b> <b>diplomacy</b> has played in the Middle East peace process. Specifically the paper {{addresses}} {{the area of the}} transfer of outcomes from <b>Track</b> <b>Two</b> <b>diplomacy</b> initiatives to the official talks, Track One.

The paper then examines two relatively recent Track Two initiatives in the region, the Jerusalem Old City Initiative and one addressing what an international security presence would look like if a peace agreement was reached, to assess their development and how transfer was approached. In both cases the third-party as part of their transfer strategy that used influential participants who had close ties to officials, which has been shown to lead to successful transfer of Track Two outcomes to the official track.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to figure}} out the role {{unofficial}} civil society actors play in international peace negotiation and conflict resolution. The thesis explores unofficial civil society actors' activities, working approaches and strategies in the Track One, Track 1. 5 and <b>Track</b> <b>Two</b> <b>Diplomacy</b> as well as grass-roots level intervention. A comparative analysis of unofficial civil society actors' performance in drafting the Geneva Accord and Kalman's problem-solving workshop in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is conducted. Based on the comparative study of unofficial civil society actors' role in Track Two and Track 1. 5 Diplomacy in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the thesis debates on how unofficial civil society actors can better contribute to peace promotion. Based on the potential, limitation and challenges analysis for unofficial civil society actors, the thesis argues that a reasonable strategy for unofficial civil society actors in international peace negotiation and conflict resolution is to draw a clear line between Track One and <b>Track</b> <b>Two</b> <b>diplomacy</b> and remain their independence. The thesis also suggests that unofficial civil society actors could go down to grass-roots level mediatory. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on business as a mediating institution that can influence society while engaging in the traditional profit-making and value generation functions. This work includes Professors Fort’s and Schipani’s arguments about how business may be able {{to play a role in}} promoting more peaceful societies, and the work of other scholars addressing how businesses might serve a role in reducing violence in society and the workplace. Although there is a significant body of scholarship on the role of business in reducing violence in society, there is little research on concrete steps for businesses to take to achieve this goal. This paper attempts to begin to fill that void. As identified by Fort and Schipani, business may promote more peaceful societies by encouraging a sense of community and by engaging in <b>track</b> <b>two</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> We argue that one way in which to encourage a sense of community and engage in <b>track</b> <b>two</b> <b>diplomacy</b> on a small scale, and therefore potentially play a role in reducing violence, is for business to provide what we denote as complementary alternative benefits (CABs), to its workforce. In this paper, we encourage businesses to offer CABs which focus on sustaining the health, reducing the stress, and improving the camaraderie of its workforce. We argue that business can use these benefits to promote a healthy, less-stressed, and collegial workforce that is less prone to resolve conflicts by violence. Further, we examine the role business plays in promoting more peaceful societies and how employer-initiated stress reduction programs are consistent with both business ethics and peace-building principles. We suggest that the employment benefits firms provide to their workforces may have a significant impact on how those employees interact with society. Finally, we demonstrate how CABs may also reduce costs related to absenteeism and turnover and thus improve the bottom line...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the parameters of}} ethnonational conflict theory. Ethnonational conflict is a widespread phenomenon. There have been many examples of such intrastate conflicts {{since the end of}} World War II. The reason for the focus on this type of conflict is that it is mostly waged in poor countries. Consequently, these conflicts tend to exacerbate the already abysmal poverty of these countries by destroying their fragile economic bases and inflicting endless misery upon generations of people. The {{study examines}} Micro as well as Macro theories of conflict. While the first emphasizes that the root causes of war lie in the human nature and human behaviour, the second focuses on the explicated, it is a fusion of developmental psychology and international relations theory and is used to explain terrorism in general. Human needs theory is human behaviour. Its basic assumption is that humans have basic needs that theory to practice by studying conflict resolution, <b>track</b> <b>two</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> This is an unofficial, informal interaction between members of adversary groups. This is in no way a substitute for official, formal, ‘track one’ government to government or leader – to leader relationships...|$|E

The authors hope that such a review will provide scholars of conflict resolution and international politics with {{a better understanding of how}} complex social theories are adapted for use in the applied world, and how gaps between theory and practice can be identified and addressed. The paper begins with an overview of three of the main theoretical contributions of social psychology to the problem of inter-group conflict: social identity theory, stereotyping and prejudice, and contact theory. We then review how these theories have been applied by conflict resolution specialists in international and ethnic conflicts as they have sought to moderate intergroup hostilities in conflict zones. The paper concludes with an analysis of the gaps between theory and practice, namely: theory of change gap, transfer strategies gap, and unit of analysis gap. Finally, based on the reviewed social psychology research, the article makes policy recommendations about how these gaps between theory and practice can be narrowed. © 2011 International Studies Association...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations Secretary- General is {{a symbol}} and an {{instrument}} of the peaceful settlement of international disputes, with a proven effectiveness in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, {{even in the most}} difficult political contexts. The configuration of this distinguished function is largely the result of a long evolutionary process which ultimately provided the occupants with a repertoire of practices that define a powerful and influential role in maintaining the international peace and security. The UN Secretary General’s endeavours in the field of peaceful resolution of conflicts may include traditional diplomatic means, such as good offices, mediation and international inquires. Nevertheless, sometimes the traditional techniques of diplomatic approach require the complementary use of unofficial, discreet diplomatic means (such as secondary diplomacy - <b>track</b> <b>two</b> <b>diplomacy</b> - and hybrid diplomacy - track one and a half diplomacy) which may enable a superior information and trigger new ways of action.
