25|$|As {{a private}} organization, the Committee {{followed}} normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individual(s) {{to accept and}} endorse checks {{on behalf of the}} Committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the Committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the Committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that Committee deputy director Jeb Magruder and finance director Maurice Stans had directed him to give the money to G. Gordon Liddy.|$|E
500|$|U2's {{decision}} to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason. Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson believed it devalued music, saying U2 had [...] "sent a message to everyone that music is free, and that's disturbing. It's easy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't really something that you worry about, but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing to see someone do that." [...] The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: [...] "This vindicates our view that giving away {{hundreds of millions of}} albums simply devalues music and runs the risk of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} of each category {{appeared on the}} podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. All three of the No. 1 Audi drivers felt their turbocharger problem cost them the victory, with Lotterer saying, [...] "When we had the turbo problem we were very disappointed because it's impossible {{to come back from}} that. We were a bit unlucky, but at Le Mans you never know {{what is going to happen}} and the team motivated me again - they did a great job." [...] Fässler added the team attempted to pressure Toyota but they were unable to catch the Japanese manufacturer: [...] "But this time everyone had problems. We had to be flat out and have no penalties - it isn't easy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you are pushing." [...] Tréluyer stated that winning Le Mans was [...] "emotional" [...] and praised the engineers strategy. The driver felt their approach was like their 2011 victory: [...] "We concentrated on our own race and took the car through until morning. It was the car which had the least bad luck that won.” Kristensen stated he was not unhappy to finish in second and that while his team would have liked to have had their [...] "little fairy tale" [...] it was still a good result. Di Grassi said it had been [...] "a difficult race" [...] for his team but hoped to return to Le Mans in the future while Gené revealed that did not expect a strong result but that second was [...] "like a fairytale for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{temptation to}} lie? I don't {{recommend}} you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> for <b>when</b> I'm misinformed I'm {{as dangerous as}} a poisoned rat. I don't mean to crow over you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I, [...] "but {{you spend}} so much of your time in {{thinking}} how glad you will be <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> little, <b>when</b> it is <b>to</b> be <b>done,</b> <b>that</b> you can't give me any attention, at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If that's all a feller has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> {{travel with}} a circus," [...] said Toby, [...] "I'm just the one, 'cause I always used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> just <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I hadn't {{any idea of}} bein' a circus man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Emily, I've {{had such}} a splendid sail. It was glorious. Bad Emily, you've been {{carrying}} water. Didn't I tell you never <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I was away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] {{she murmured}} gently; [...] "you always used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I was ill or tired--don't stop it yet, as {{you always do}} now, and go away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{never thought}} before of giving any {{thing to the}} poor but what they really needed, and I have always been willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I could without going far out of my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{happy to}} say it isn't yet, on most of our roads. They were tipping the baggage-man, {{to make sure that}} he checked their baggage in time and put it on the train. I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> myself <b>when</b> I came up; {{otherwise}} it might have got along here some time next day. But the system is perfect." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{production}} of A Good Day to Die Hard, Bruce Willis {{stated that he}} hoped to retire the character of John McClane after the sixth film. Willis said [...] "At the moment, I can run and I can fight on screen. But there will {{come a time when}} I no longer want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>when</b> I’ll step away from the Die Hard films".|$|R
50|$|On November 9, 2010, the USDA Forest Service, {{along with}} Smokey Bear, made Betty White an honorary forest ranger, {{fulfilling}} her lifelong dream. White said in previous interviews {{that she wanted}} to be a forest ranger as a little girl but that women were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> then. <b>When</b> White received the honor, more than one-third of Forest Service employees were women.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you really}} believe, sir," [...] said I, [...] "that he would {{hesitate}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> {{he knows the}} horrible charge to which his disappearance has exposed his wife? He is a heartless villain, I know; but surely--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Time enough <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we are forced. We {{can never}} reach that {{mountain}} on foot, {{and after they}} had run down the horses, they would hunt us by spoor or gaze. No, man, ride as you never rode before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{admitted}} Davy, [...] "Dora wasn't {{very hungry}} and she only et half her slice {{and then she}} give the rest to me. But I didn't know she was going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I give it to her, so I WAS good, Anne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Six! Six trunks!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Well, I'm {{very glad}} {{you intend to}} stay awhile. Say, Majesty, it will take me as long to realize who you really are as it'll take to break you of being a tenderfoot. I hope you packed a riding-suit. If not you'll have to wear trousers! You'll have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> anyway, <b>when</b> we go up in the mountains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But tell me, Pina, what <b>do</b> {{you mean}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>that</b> schoolhouse <b>when</b> it is built?" [...] asked Otto, {{as he walked}} beside his sister to the picturesque spot above {{referred}} to.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, one has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> you know, <b>when</b> our own fellows get blackguardly,' {{said little}} Lance, freely; whereat Cherry shuddered somewhat. 'And, Fee,' he added, 'if you would only come {{and make him}} {{understand}} about things.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let her {{give that}} up--after a while; {{when all this}} has passed by. That man is not in want. It will not hurt him to be without it a little longer. It will be enough for her <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> this trial shall be over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How are we <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> {{the roots}} {{have made a}} deep hole, and above that is a high bank?' replied a fourth. 'No; the only way I can think of, is to burn a large hole in the trunk.' And this they did, but the trunk was very thick, and would not burn through.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear no. In what {{position}} am I, alas! <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> <b>When</b> can I EVER {{meet her}} again?" [...] He had turned it all over. [...] "If I could meet Addie after this, you know, I could meet YOU. And if I do meet Addie," [...] he lucidly pursued, [...] "what will happen {{by the same}} stroke is that I SHALL meet you. And that's just what I've explained to you I dread." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How humiliating," [...] said she, [...] "that a great monarch {{should be}} {{dependent}} upon {{one of his}} subjects for permission <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this or <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> he might have all his affairs under his own absolute control!" ...|$|R
50|$|The existential fallacy, or existential instantiation, is {{a formal}} fallacy. In the existential fallacy, we presuppose that a class has members {{when we are}} not {{supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so; <b>that</b> is, <b>when</b> we should not assume existential import.|$|R
5000|$|His father, George Haité (1825-1871), was a {{prominent}} early Victorian cashmere shawl designer, albeit sadly so disillusioned with being a [...] "slave of the fashion of the hour" [...] that he actively discouraged his son from following him into the same profession. Ironically, it was his father's premature death of smallpox aged 45 <b>that</b> propelled G.C. <b>to</b> <b>do</b> just <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he found himself {{head of the household}} at the age of 16.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] {{returned}} Kitty dictatorially, [...] "and if he IS cold, he {{can easily}} light those logs. They always build their open fires under a tree. Why, even Mr. Gunn used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he was camping {{out in the}} Adirondacks last summer. I call it perfectly comfortable and SO natural." [...] Nevertheless, they had both tucked their chilly hands under the fleecy shawls they had snatched from the hall for this hyperborean expedition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{declared}} the Giantess; [...] "and I have added a little magic to your transformations {{to make you}} all contented with wearing your new forms. I'm sorry I didn't think <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I transformed Polychrome into a Canary-Bird. But perhaps, when she sees how cheerful you are, she will cease to be silent and sullen and take to singing. I will go get the bird and let you see her." ...|$|E
6000|$|The poor youth's heart {{stood still}} as he listened. Find the queen? But {{how was he}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> nobody in the palace {{had been able to}} do so! Slowly he walked to the stable, and laying his head on his horse's shoulder, he said: 'The king has ordered me to bring his wife home again, and how can I do that when she {{disappeared}} so long ago, and no one can tell me anything about her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, no--that's only words. She's {{too good}} a girl <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> But <b>when</b> we {{consider}} what she knows, and what she has seen since she last saw us, 'tis as well to meet her views as nearly as possible. Why, 'tis a year since she was in this old place, owing to her going abroad in the summer, which I agreed to, thinking it best for her; and naturally we shall look small, just at first--I only say just at first." ...|$|R
6000|$|It's {{easy enough}} to command one's face. I learnt <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in Africa <b>when</b> often my life {{depended}} on my seeming to have no fear. But in my heart ... I never knew that I could feel so bitter. And yet, after all, it's only your good opinion that I care for.|$|R
60|$|In another {{second he}} was cowering {{in the bottom}} of the car, and {{released}} from the weight of the grapnel and the two ropes, rushing up once more through the air. For a time he remained crouching, and when at last he looked out again the little town was very small and travelling, with the rest of lower Germany, in a circular orbit round and round the car--or at least it appeared <b>to</b> be <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> he got used to it, he found this rotation of the balloon rather convenient; it saved moving about in the car.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{it will be}} {{time enough}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we get over the ghauts. It will be better that he should get the disguise. In the first place, he will know exactly what is wanted; and in the next, it would look rum for either of us to be buying such a thing. Of course, we could ask Pertaub to get it for us, but if we take Ibrahim with us he may as well buy it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No,--I {{remember}} looking that {{up when he}} first came down. Sent that back, if I recall the matter correctly." [...] Colonel Varney went to a desk {{in the corner of the}} room, unlocked it, drew forth a black book, and running his fingers through the pages stopped at the letter K. [...] "Yes, sent back his legislative pass, but I've known 'em <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> they were holding out for something more. There must be somebody who can get close to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} sure <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> I can," [...] he answered. [...] "But of course, I shall have no money, at first; {{and it may}} {{be a long time before}} I can pay my railway fare here; but you may be sure I will come. Whoever may be my real mother, you are the only mother I ever knew, and no mother could have been kinder. When I grow to be a man, and go to sea in big ships, I will bring you all sorts of pretty things from abroad and, if ever you should want it, you may be sure that my wages will be quite as much yours as if I had been, really, your son!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is soon forgotten," [...] Blake cut in adroitly. [...] "Indeed, 'twill be most {{convenient}} to his lordship to forget it. Think you he would care {{to have it}} known that 'twas to such a chance he owes the preservation of his army?" [...] He laughed, and added in a voice of much sly meaning, [...] "The times are full of peril. There's Kirke and his lambs. And there's no saying how Kirke might act <b>did</b> he chance <b>to</b> learn what Richard failed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> night <b>when</b> he was left to guard the rear at Newlington's!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What in {{the world}} is <b>to</b> be <b>done,</b> Geoffrey? I have only got twenty dollars left, which at the outside will pay for our lodgings and food for another month. For the life of me I cannot see what is <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> <b>when</b> <b>that</b> is gone, unless we take to the road." ...|$|R
5000|$|Klotz relates: [...] "He {{commanded}} the boys <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this or <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>when</b> they appeared slow {{in carrying out}} instructions he yelled at them, chased them, and threw what was handy at them until all was in an uproar. Then his exasperation would upset him completely and he {{would go on to}} the porch of the laboratory and yell and tear his hair. His commotion was heard at the pavilion of the Korley Bu Hospital and at the bungalows behind the grounds of the Institute. This state became worse during the late months of spring, and not a few thought he must be mentally unbalanced." ...|$|R
