40|$|Both <b>tactile</b> {{distance}} <b>perception</b> {{and position}} sense {{are believed to}} require that immediate afferent signals be referenced to a stored representation of body size and shape (the body model). For both of these abilities, recent studies have reported that the stored body representations involved are highly distorted, {{at least in the}} case of the hand, with the hand dorsum represented as wider and squatter than it actually is. Here, we investigated whether individual differences in the magnitude of these distortions are shared between <b>tactile</b> distance <b>perception</b> and position sense, as would be predicted by the hypothesis that a single distorted body model underlies both tasks. We used established task to measure distortions of the represented shape of the hand dorsum. Consistent with previous results, in both cases there were clear biases to overestimate distances oriented along the medio-lateral axis of the hand compared to the proximo-distal axis. Moreover, within each task there were clear split-half correlations, demonstrating that both tasks show consistent individual differences. Critically, however, there was no correlation between the magnitudes of distortion in the two tasks. This casts doubt on the proposal that a common body model underlies both <b>tactile</b> distance <b>perception</b> and position sense...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Our aim is {{to predict}} the {{stability}} of a grasp from the perceptions available to a robot before attempting to lift up and transport an object.

Our robot is equipped with multiple tactile sensing arrays and {{it is able to}} track the pose of an object during the application of a grasp. We present a kernel-logistic-regression model of pose- and touch-conditional grasp success probability which we train on grasp data collected by letting the robot experience the effect on tactile and visual signals of grasps suggested by a teacher, and letting the robot verify which grasps can be used to rigidly control the object. We consider models defined on several subspaces of our input data – e. g., using <b>tactile</b> <b>perceptions</b> or pose information only. Our experiment demonstrates that joint <b>tactile</b> and pose-based <b>perceptions</b> carry valuable grasp-related information, as models trained on both hand poses and tactile parameters perform better than the models trained exclusively on one perceptual input.

The present study aimed to investigate the coherence of such distortions of <b>tactile</b> size <b>perception</b> across different skin surfaces. We investigated distortions of <b>tactile</b> size <b>perception</b> on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of both the left and right hands as well as the forehead. Participants judged which of two tactile distances felt larger. One distance was aligned with the proximodistal axis (along the body), the other with the mediolateral axis (across the body). Clear distortions were found on all five skin surfaces, with stimuli oriented across the width of the body being perceived as farther apart than those oriented along the length of the body. Consistent with previous results, distortions were smaller on the palmar than on the dorsal hand surface. Distortion on the forehead was intermediate between the dorsal and palmar surfaces. There were clear correlations between distortion on the left and right hands, for both the dorsal and palmar skin surfaces. In contrast, within each hand, there was no significant correlation between the two skin surfaces. Distortion on the forehead was not significantly correlated with that on any of the other skin surfaces.
