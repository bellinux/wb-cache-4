5|$|Between 1964 and 1975, both Britain and France {{delivered}} significant {{quantities of}} arms, including Hunters, to Iraq. The Hunters {{were far more}} effective in fighting guerrilla activity than the Russian MiG-17s then operated by Iraq. In 1967, Hunters of the Iraqi Air Force saw action after <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War between Israel and several neighbouring Arab nations. During the War of Attrition Iraqi Hunters usually operated from bases in Egypt and Syria. While flying a Hunter from Iraqi Airbase H3, Flight Lieutenant Saiful Azam, on exchange from the Pakistan Air Force, shot down three Israeli jets including a Sud Aviation Vautour and a Mirage IIICJ. Some missions were also flown by the Royal Jordanian Air Force, {{but most of the}} Jordanian Hunters were destroyed on the ground {{on the first day of}} <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War. Replacement Hunters for Jordanian service were acquired from both Britain and Saudi Arabia in the war's aftermath. These were used with considerable success in ground attacks against Syrian Army tanks during the Black September Crisis.|$|E
5|$|Gan HaHamisha (Garden of the Five), a {{memorial}} park {{for the five}} residents of Arad {{who were killed in}} action in <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War. Includes a monument for the soldiers, as well as a stone structure called Amud HaBulbusim (lit. Pillar of the Potatoes, because of its shape), which marks Arad's place in the desert and their residents' control of the territory according to Bedouin tradition – designed by Yona Pitelson.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War in June 1967, Israel {{captured}} the rest of Mandate Palestine from Jordan and Egypt, and began a policy of establishing Jewish settlements in those territories. From 1987 to 1993, the First Palestinian Intifada against Israel took place, which included the Declaration of the State of Palestine in 1988 and ended with the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords {{and the creation of}} the Palestinian National Authority.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, since Willy Brandt {{had become}} {{chancellor}} in 1969, {{there had been}} a change of the West German attitude towards the Arab–Israeli conflict. The earlier conservative governments had been considered pointedly pro-Israel (especially during the mid-1960s with <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War), which had resulted in a number of Arab states breaking off diplomatic relations to West Germany. With Egypt and Tunisia, these had only been restored shortly before the 1972 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The Lebanese Air Force {{operated}} Hawker Hunters from 1958 to 2014. A Lebanese Hunter {{shot down}} an Israeli jet over Kfirmishki {{in the early}} 1960s; its pilot was captured by the Lebanese Armed Forces. One Hunter was shot down {{on the first day}} of <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War by the Israeli Air Force. They were used infrequently during the Lebanese Civil War, and eventually fell out of usage and went into storage during the 1980s.|$|E

It was used during World War II, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Vietnam War, <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War, and the Yom Kippur War. It had been used by eleven different countries by the end of its service.|$|E

5|$|Zarqa, Jordan's {{second largest}} city, {{is built on}} the banks of the Zarqa River, and is the largest {{settlement}} along its course. The town of Zarqa was founded in 1902 by Chechen immigrants. Its population grew rapidly with an influx of Palestinian refugees who fled the West Bank during <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned was judged appropriate. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War reinforced the economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War, Jerusalem's {{municipal}} borders were {{expanded to}} include the Old City and beyond. Barricades that had lined the border were torn down. Many buildings on Mamilla's eastern end were in shambles from the fighting and lack of maintenance. Several historic buildings were condemned. One was the Stern House, which housed Zionist leader Theodor Herzl on his 1898 visit. However, popular outcry brought Supreme Court involvement {{which led to the}} temporary dismantling and reassembly nearby of this historical landmark.|$|E

Poland {{was the first of}} the Eastern Bloc countries to restore diplomatic relations with Israel after these have been broken off right after <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day's</b> War. In 1986 partial diplomatic relations with Israel were restored, and full relations were restored in 1990 as soon as communism fell.|$|R

5|$|Bani Na'im was annexed by Jordan {{after the}} 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In June 1967, after <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War, the town came under Israeli rule. In 1982, an 18-year-old {{resident}} of the town {{was shot and killed}} by Jewish settlers from nearby Kiryat Arba. In 1987, during the First Intifada, a committee against the Israeli occupation was set up in Bani Na'im. In May 1988, two residents were killed by the Israeli Army (IDF) {{in the center of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|During the 1936–39 Arab {{revolt against}} British Mandate rule, Deir Ghassaneh {{was the scene}} of rebel gatherings and British {{military}} raids. In 1967, Bani Zeid was occupied by Israel during <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War, but it was transferred to full Palestinian security and administrative control in 2000. The next year it became the first Palestinian-controlled town to be the site of major operation by Israeli forces during the Second Intifada. When Fathiya Barghouti Rheime was elected mayor in 2005, Bani Zeid became the first Palestinian locality with a woman as head of the municipality, in concurrence with nearby Ramallah. The current mayor is Abdel Karim Abu Aql, elected in 2012.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of the Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E

5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim {{for which there is no}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|Quneitra was the Syrian {{headquarters}} for the Golan Heights. The Israeli capture of the city occurred in chaotic circumstances on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} <b>the</b> <b>Six-Day</b> War. Israeli forces advancing towards Quneitra from the north-west prompted Syrian troops to deploy north of the city, under heavy bombardment, to defend the road to Damascus. At , Syrian radio broadcast an announcement that the city had fallen, though it actually had not. Alarmed, the Syrian Army's redeployment turned into a chaotic retreat along the Damascus road.|$|E
5|$|Set in London, England, Jab Tak Hai Jaan {{tells the}} story of Akira Rai (Anushka Sharma), an ambitious, hardworking intern at the Discovery Channel. She finds the diary of Samar Anand (Shah Rukh Khan), a bomb-disposal expert. The diary recounts his time as a {{struggling}} immigrant in London, and later details his whirlwind romance with Meera Thapar (Katrina Kaif). The film was released during <b>the</b> <b>six-day</b> Diwali weekend beginning on 13 November 2012. Jab Tak Hai Jaan emerged as the third-highest-grossing Bollywood film overseas at that time, after 3 Idiots and My Name Is Khan (2010).|$|E
