5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. Creditors {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated {{due to a lack of}} capital and the latter had no capital and no guarantee of state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law to state that creditors who would accept payment in notes from <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only notes from the Bank of Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who would not accept notes from either.|$|E

5|$|Bullion {{deposits}} {{continued to}} decline, and in 1797, silver dollar production reached {{the lowest point}} since 1794 with a mintage of just 7,776 pieces. During this time, silver deposits declined {{to such an extent}} that Thomas Jefferson personally deposited 300 Spanish dollars in June 1797. In April 1797, an agreement was reached between the Mint and <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. The Bank agreed to supply the Mint with foreign silver on the condition that the Bank would receive their deposits back in silver dollars. The Mint was closed between August and November 1797 due to the annual yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia; that year's epidemic took the life of the Mint's treasurer, Dr. Nicholas Way. In November 1797, the Bank deposited approximately $30,000 worth of French silver. In early 1798, the reverse was changed from the small, perched eagle to a heraldic eagle similar to that depicted on the Great Seal of the United States. The agreement reached with <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States along with other bullion depositors (including Boudinot) led to an increase in the number of silver dollars coined; mintage for both the small and heraldic eagle types totalled 327,536. Mintage numbers for the dollar remained high through 1799, with 423,515 struck that year.|$|E

The report recommended improvements to some of the banks, but funding for the work was not available, and so no work was done at the time.|$|E
5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, on <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted {{to replace it with}} a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E
