Two Hurricanes from No. 615 were taking off under the attack.|$|E
5|$|A-10s flew 32 {{percent of}} combat sorties in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The sorties ranged from 27,800 to 34,500 {{annually}} between 2009 and 2012.

From the beginning of 2006 to October 2013, A-10s conducted 19 percent of CAS missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than the F-15E Strike Eagle and B-1B Lancer, but less than the 33 percent flown by F-16s.|$|E

5|$|Although naval aviators were, at that time, {{prohibited}} from marriage {{within two years}} of getting their wings, having left the navy, the marriage could go ahead. John and Jane were married on 5 July 1941 at the First Presbyterian Church of Houston, Texas. After a two-day honeymoon in a Houston hotel, <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> to San Francisco {{to meet up with}} other AVG recruits and their wives. They parted company on 10 July 1941 at the docks, where Newkirk boarded the M.V. Jagersfontein, with some of the AVG recruits on their way to Singapore, whilst Janie stayed in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not officially}} announced, the {{original}} backup crew consisted of Fred W. Haise (CDR), William R. Pogue (CMP) and Gerald P. Carr (LMP), who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on Apollo 19. However, after the cancellations of Apollos 18 and 19 were finalized in September 1970 this crew would not rotate to a lunar mission as planned. Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell were recycled {{to serve as}} members of the backup crew after returning from Apollo 14, while Pogue and Carr were reassigned to the Skylab program where <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> on Skylab 4.|$|E

Hawker Osprey fighters replaced the Flycatchers in early 1934 and the Nimrods were withdrawn in October 1936. 811 and 822 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-shipping missions. <b>They</b> <b>flew</b> the Blackburn Ripon, the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and as well as the Fairey IIIF, the Fairey Seal and the Blackburn Shark reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} before his death, Goldstein's {{behavior}} had been erratic {{and he had been}} missing appointments. His manager and sponsor were both so concerned that <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> to New York to visit him two days before his death. Goldstein refused to see his manager, but allowed his sponsor into his apartment, consuming pills and smoking crack cocaine in front of him. He promised to check himself into a rehabilitation center following his scheduled gig at Rain Nightclub in Las Vegas that Friday. When he missed his flight and would not return phone calls, friends brought the police to his apartment.|$|E

5|$|On 23 March, Pattle flew {{his first}} {{missions}} with No. 33 Squadron, now based at Larissa. <b>They</b> <b>flew</b> as escort for Blenheims from No. 84 Squadron over the Pindus Mountains and Paramythia. Supported by No. 112 Squadron Gladiators, <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> to raid Berat. The cloud base {{was low and}} thick and they descended below it at 1,900 feet. The bombers attacked and two Hurricanes were badly damaged by ground fire. One of the squadron was shot down by a Fiat G.50 and bailed out — the Italians disappeared before they could retaliate. In the afternoon, he was briefed to strafe the heavily defended Fieri airfield. It was an unpopular sort of mission. At 25,000 feet, they were intercepted and a dogfight began with G.50s and Macchi C.200s. Only Pattle and one other Hurricane attacked the airfield. Furious, Pattle berated the pilots for not carrying out their primary assignment. He had claimed one enemy fighter as a probable and proceeded to the airfield to claim another victory — his 25th — and claimed another three on the ground.|$|E
5|$|RAF night fighter defences {{were still}} in their infancy. Most fighters lacked radar and in any case, radar was {{short-range}} and unreliable. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> outside the anti-aircraft guns' fields of fire on likely approach routes using the pilots' vision to locate enemy aircraft. In later years, the night fighter defences would be highly sophisticated. But in 1940, they were not effective. Just 28 sorties were flown against the nocturnal raids.|$|E
5|$|The Allies possessed little {{intelligence}} on western New Britain's terrain and {{the exact location}} of Japanese forces, so <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> extensive air photography sorties over the region, and small ground patrols were landed from PT boats. A team from Special Service Unit No. 1 reconnoitered Arawe on the night of 9/10December and concluded that there were few Japanese troops in the area. The Japanese detected this party near the village of Umtingalu and strengthened their defenses there.|$|E

5|$|HMS Forester {{was one of}} nine F-class destroyers {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the early 1930s.

A few weeks after the start of World War II in September 1939, she helped to sink one German submarine and then participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Forester was sent to Gibraltar in mid-1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on the Vichy French ships at Mers-el-Kébir and the Battle of Dakar between escorting the aircraft carriers of Force H as <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> off aircraft for Malta and covering convoys resupplying and reinforcing the island until late 1941. During this time the ship helped to sink another German submarine.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964 he and {{his wife}} Joan {{travelled}} to India and Pakistan, visiting major cities such as Madras (now Chennai) and Jaipur, meeting eminent jurists and speaking with Jawaharlal Nehru. He again visited Canada and the United States in the long vacation of 1964 and addressed a full conference hall in New York. On 14 August 1965 {{he and his}} wife flew to South America for a month-long tour of the continent sponsored by the British Council. The couple visited Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Peru before flying north to visit Mexico City. On 6 January 1966 <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> to Malta, where Denning spoke at various legal conferences and lectures. In the same year <b>they</b> <b>flew</b> to San Francisco, Fiji and finally to New Zealand {{to take part in the}} law conference at Dunedin, New Zealand. His lecture at the conference so impressed an Australian visitor that he was invited in 1967 to speak at the Australian Law Society annual conference. While there, he spoke at a student meeting at the University of Sydney; while the previous speaker received a slow hand-clap, Denning was given a standing ovation and the student law society was named the Denning Law Society in his honour. On the way home the couple made a stop at Delhi, where they gave a dinner for members of the Indian Bar who had welcomed them during their visit in 1964. In 1968 they again visited Canada, and Denning was given an honorary degree by McGill University. In 1969 he again travelled to India, this time on an official visit with Elwyn Jones and Sir John Widgery.|$|E
