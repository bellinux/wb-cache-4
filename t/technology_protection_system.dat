In parallel with the Congress Industrial Exhibition of fire <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> materials and <b>technology</b> was held, where manufacturers presented their products. The urgency of the “Fire Stop Moscow” Congress in 2015 organized by the Congress Bureau ODF Events lies primarily in the fact that it considered the full range of issues related to the fire protection of building and construction projects; studied the state of the regulatory framework for fire safety and efficiency of public services, research centers, private companies and busi-nesses in the area of fire safety. The main practical significance of the event which was widely covered in the media space, was the opportunity to share the views and information between management, science, and practice of business on implementing fire <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> in the conditions of modern economic relations and market realities. : congress, fire <b>protection,</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>technologies,</b> fire <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> exhibitio...|$|R

Finally, the detailed analysis using engineering methods to interpolate the surface-heating-rate results from the inviscid/boundary layer method to predict the required thermal environments is described and results presented...|$|R
40|$|Trust {{is easier}} to destroy than create, hence, trust in overly applied {{automation}} may erode following accidents. This paper looks at the crash of a revolutionary supersonic fighter that resulted from over-reliance on <b>protection</b> <b>technology.</b> The <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> has been automated {{to the extent that}} it was impossible for the pilot to regain control and convince the system that there was a problem. Complete trust in the safety of the system has thus been translated into a new kind of computer-assisted error, where in the interest of safety the only possible exit strategy is outlawed by the system leading to the potential (or in this case, the actual) destruction of the system it was meant to protect. Overall, trust appears to be an emergent function that takes in safety issues affecting the entire system as well as the relationship between the product, client and developer and the trade-offs that underpin decisions. Operators, working as part of a system, abrogate some of their responsibility by implicitly or explicitly passing on control to computerised systems. While operators function as an integral part of systems, their trust in the ability and safety of the system plays a key role in the ensuing success or failure...|$|R

Two different CI paradigms are successfully tested for the specific application task: Circular BackPropagation (CBP) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
