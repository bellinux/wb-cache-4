5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of <b>the</b> <b>dart</b> that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats <b>the</b> <b>dart.</b> The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when <b>the</b> <b>dart</b> is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dart</b> is a non-convex {{quadrilateral}} whose four {{interior angles}} are 36, 72, 36, and 216 degrees. <b>The</b> <b>dart</b> may be bisected along its {{axis of symmetry}} to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 36 and 108 degrees), which are smaller than the acute triangles.|$|E

50|$|The World Series of Darts exists since 2013. The goal {{of these}} series of tournaments {{is to make}} darts more popular across the globe. In 2013, the World Series of Darts made its debut on the PDC calendar. Two World Series tournaments were held: <b>the</b> Dubai <b>Darts</b> Masters and <b>the</b> Sydney <b>Darts</b> Masters. In 2014, <b>the</b> Signapore <b>Darts</b> Masters and <b>the</b> Perth <b>Darts</b> Masters {{were added to the}} series. In 2015 <b>the</b> Singapore <b>Darts</b> Masters was deleted but <b>the</b> Japan <b>Darts</b> Masters and Auckland Darts Masters were added. Also in 2015 ended the series with the World Series of Darts Finals. In 2016, the PDC deleted <b>the</b> Japan <b>Darts</b> Masters but added <b>the</b> Shangai <b>Darts</b> Masters and <b>the</b> Tokyo <b>Darts</b> Masters. In 2017, <b>the</b> Tokyo <b>Darts</b> Masters was deleted and <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Darts</b> Masters added. <b>The</b> Sydney <b>Darts</b> Masters was {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> Melbourne <b>Darts</b> Masters. <b>The</b> best 8 players from <b>the</b> World Series <b>Darts</b> tournaments qualified for this tournament.

5|$|Rope dart: The rope dart is {{a weapon}} used in Chinese martial arts.

The first written description of the rope dart is dated from the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 AD).|$|E

5|$|The love dart {{is not a}} penial stylet (in {{other words}} {{this is not an}} {{accessory}} organ for sperm transfer). The exchange of sperm between both of the two land snails is a completely separate part of the mating progression. Nevertheless, recent research shows that use of <b>the</b> <b>dart</b> can strongly favor the reproductive outcome for the snail that is able to lodge a dart in its partner. This is because mucus on <b>the</b> <b>dart</b> introduces a hormone-like substance that allows far more of its sperm to survive.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Darts</b> were <b>the</b> reason Bert {{first came}} to Washington; and he soon decided {{that this is where}} he wanted to make his home. He and his coach {{negotiated}} a trade with the Atlanta Chiefs so that Mr. Grell could stay in Washington, D.C. permanently. <b>The</b> <b>Darts</b> joined <b>the</b> NASL in 1970. In 1971 as a member of <b>the</b> <b>Darts,</b> Grell took part in the league's first ever indoor tournament, scoring no goals and earning two penalty minutes. Bert took a break from soccer in 1973 after deciding not to follow <b>the</b> <b>Darts</b> when <b>the</b> franchise moved to Miami, Florida. Bert joined the Washington Diplomats when they came to D.C. in 1974. He retired from professional soccer in 1976.|$|R
50|$|To {{visualize}} the motivation behind rejection sampling, imagine graphing the density {{function of a}} random variable onto a large rectangular board and throwing darts at it. Assume that <b>the</b> <b>darts</b> are uniformly distributed around the board. Now remove all of <b>the</b> <b>darts</b> that are outside the area under the curve. <b>The</b> remaining <b>darts</b> will be distributed uniformly within the area under the curve, and the x-positions of these darts will be distributed according to the random variable's density. This is because there is the most room for <b>the</b> <b>darts</b> to land where the curve is highest and thus the probability density is greatest.|$|R
5|$|The two snails {{circle around}} each other {{for up to six}} hours, {{touching}} with their tentacles, and biting lips and the area of the genital pore, which shows some preliminary signs of the eversion of the penis. As the snails approach mating, hydraulic pressure builds up in the blood sinus surrounding the organ housing <b>the</b> <b>dart.</b> Each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, when the body of one snail touches the other snail's genital pore, it triggers the firing of <b>the</b> <b>dart.</b>|$|E
5|$|The darting can {{sometimes}} be so forceful that <b>the</b> <b>dart</b> ends up buried in the internal organs. It can also happen that a dart will pierce the body or head entirely, and protrude on the other side.|$|E

5|$|In 2069, Agent Miles Kilo, EuroCorp's latest agent, is {{equipped}} with the new prototype DART 6 chip created by Eurocorp scientist Lily Drawl (voiced by Rosario Dawson). After a successful test run of the chip's abilities, EuroCorp CEO Jack Denham (voiced by Brian Cox) assigns him to kill Lily's counterpart, Chang, at the rival syndicate Aspari. Accompanied by his mentor Agent Jules Merit (voiced by Michael Wincott), Kilo attacks the Los Angeles branch of Aspari and corners Chang, who shoots himself. Kilo retrieves Chang's chip and learns from an encrypted conversation that Lily has been sharing information about <b>the</b> <b>DART</b> 6 chip with him.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} {{presence}} in the region dates to 8,000years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds. About 2,000years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until about 500CE. Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. <b>The</b> <b>dart</b> points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.|$|E
5|$|At Eurocorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead {{and send}} him to be rebooted while they plan to {{retrieve}} Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6.

Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp.
