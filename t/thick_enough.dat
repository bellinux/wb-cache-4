5|$|While most temnospondyls are aquatic {{in early}} stages of life, most metoposaurids {{appear to have been}} {{terrestrial}} in their juvenile stage. Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have bones that are <b>thick</b> <b>enough</b> to withstand this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle, a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to thicken with positive allometry, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be <b>thick</b> <b>enough</b> for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus eburneus, {{commonly}} known as the ivory waxy cap or the cowboy's handkerchief, is a species of edible mushroom in the waxgill family of fungi. It is widespread in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in northern Africa. The fruit bodies are medium-sized, pure white, and when wet are covered in a layer of slime <b>thick</b> <b>enough</b> to make the mushroom difficult to pick up. The gills are broadly attached to the stem or running down it; as the family name suggests, they feel waxy when rubbed between the fingers. Like all Hygrophorus species, the fungus is mycorrhizal—a symbiotic association whereby the underground fungal mycelia penetrate and exchange nutrients with tree roots. They are common in a variety of forest types, where they grow on the ground in thickets or grassy areas. Hygrophorus eburneus is the type species of the genus Hygrophorus. A number of biologically active chemicals have been purified from the fruit bodies of the fungus, including fatty acids with bactericidal and fungicidal activity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this work, doped AlGaAs/GaAs {{parabolic}} quantum wells (PQW) {{with different}} well widths (from 1000 Å up to 3000 Å) were investigated {{by means of}} photoluminescence (PL) measurements. In order to achieve the 2 DEG inside the PQW Si delta doping is placed at both side of the well. We have observed that the thickness of this space layer plays a major rule {{on the characteristics of}} the 2 DEG. It has to be <b>thicker</b> <b>enough</b> to prevent any diffusions of Si to the well and thin enough to allow electrons migration inside the well. From PL measurement, we have observed beside the intra well transitions, indirect transitions involving still trapped electron on the delta doping and holes inside the PQW. For the thinness sample, we have measured a well defined PL peak at low energy side of the GaAs bulk emission. With the increasing of the well thickness this peak intensity decreases and for the thickest sample it almost disappears. Our theoretical calculation indicated that carriers (electron and holes) are more placed {{at the center of the}} PQW. In this way, when the well thickness increases the distance between electrons on the delta doping and holes on the well also increases, it decreases the probability of occurrence of these indirect optical transitions...|$|R
5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly <b>thick</b> <b>enough</b> to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 million miles). The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances, and the size of the universe is now known to be inconceivably large and possibly infinite.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is <b>thick</b> <b>enough</b> to withstand the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{after the}} Royal Marines had met stiff resistance, No. 6 Commando attempted to advance from {{its position in}} an effort to relieve the pressure on them. This attack was well supported by artillery and a squadron of armour from the 8th Hussars, nevertheless, the commandos were stopped near an orchard close to the crossroads by a hastily formed, but well-led, force consisting of Luftwaffe aircrew and Fallschirmjäger. As the rest of the brigade advanced towards the town of Linne, attempts to cross the Montforterbeek Canal were frustrated by the defenders who managed to destroy all the bridges that crossed it. The ice over the canal was not <b>thick</b> <b>enough</b> to support the crossing of armour, so temporary bridges were brought up and erected by members of the Royal Engineers. Finally, after a number of attempts at forcing a crossing, an assault force from No. 3 Commando managed to enter Linne.|$|E

25|$|Yellowknife did {{not have}} an all-season road access to the rest of Canada's highway network until the {{completion}} of Deh Cho Bridge in 2012. Prior to that, traffic relied on ferry service in summer and ice road in winter to cross the Mackenzie River.

25|$|The {{thickness}} of the ammolite layer {{is also an important}} factor: after polishing, the ammolite is only 0.1–0.3millimeters thick. The rarest and most valuable are <b>thick</b> <b>enough</b> to stand alone, with only a thin portion of its original matrix (not exceeding 1.5mm); but the vast majority require some sort of supportive backing. Other treatments are also commonly undertaken; all other factors being equal, the less treatment an ammolite gem has received, the more valuable it is. Calibrated stones—that is, stones fashioned into standard dimensions that will fit most jewelry settings—may also command a higher price.|$|E

50|$|The {{value of}} the Chenillette as an {{armoured}} fighting vehicle was limited. In French service, the Modèle 31 carried no armament, although some later vehicles had attachment points for a removable AA-machine-gun to be fitted — but {{this had to be}} operated from outside the vehicle in an awkward crouched position due to its low height. For the crew to use personal weapons through the hatches while sitting inside the hull was highly impractical. Consideration had been given to arming it with a machine-gun, but the Direction de l'Infanterie feared that if such a weapon were mounted, the UE would be misused as a light tank rather than being dedicated to its correct tactical resupply role. Likewise the armour protection was minimal. The vertical plates had a thickness of nine millimetres, the other plates, all riveted, were six millimetres <b>thick,</b> just <b>enough</b> to stop normal rifle bullets and shell fragments.|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwaving}} thin metal films {{can be seen}} clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type). The microwaves induce electric currents in the metal film, which heats up, melting the plastic in the disc and leaving a visible pattern of concentric and radial scars. Similarly, porcelain with thin metal films can also be destroyed or damaged by microwaving. Aluminium foil is <b>thick</b> <b>enough</b> {{to be used in}} microwave ovens as a shield against heating parts of food items, if the foil is not badly warped.

40|$|It {{is found}} in the Pt/Co/Pt(111) {{sandwiches}} that perpendicular magnetic anisotropy weakens associated with the dramatic magnetization enhancement as the temperature decreases below a critical temperature, T_cri, which increases with the Pt overlayer thickness t_Pt. For the sandwich with <b>enough</b> <b>thick</b> Pt overlayer, it trends to an unusual state with weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the absence of obvious easy direction behavior at low temperature. It suggests that Pt is more significantly polarized in the film with thicker Pt overlayer.
