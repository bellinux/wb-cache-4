5000|$|Michael Angelakos to {{his fans}} on the {{perception}} of the album: To You,Tremendous Sea of Loveis an album for us, for me, and for you.Something happened when I started making music [...] "professionally.”What happened is I forgot how fun, how beautiful it was to share the version of my music that was not the [...] "product."When I say product, I mean the b version of the song, or album, that was done, finished, ready for a sale.Revisions are important, but we are so good at revising, so concerned with presenting perfect versions of ourselves that we miss the point. We become upset when people don’t fully understand us, or assume things[...] [...]That, my friends, is the business we are in. No, we were in.Because each song was quickly rendered, or written the night before it was uploaded, andwas mixed {{to the best of my}} ability (after years of people telling me I couldn’t mix). [...] They were not perfect, but they were honest.Honesty is important because clearly we can, as humans, detect falsehoods, and yet <b>today</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> “alternative truths.”This is not crazy, it is just a message saying:ALL WE HAVE LEFT IS THE FIRST DRAFTALL WE HAVE LEFT ARE THE SPELLING ERRORSALL WE HAVE LEFT ARE THE ZITS AND IMPERFECTIONS WE E IT OUT [...] ALL WE HAVE LEFT IS THE CONFESSION THAT WE DO NOT KNOW EVERYTHINGBecause today to edit, to revise, is to propagate a culture, A BUSINESS that is archaic, that is scared of acknowledging the truth and that is saying YOU ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I wrote this album to tell myself and to tell you that you were always good enough. That the money we spend agreeing with these people, it is adding insult to injury. [...] You are tremendous, you are truly the reason I have, have always, and could continue to have anything. And you deserve a thank you.I do not need your money.I just want you, I just NEED you, to listen to me. No money can quantify what that means to me.I really, truly love you. Thank you.M Angelakos.|$|E

President Herman van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Barroso {{said in a}} joint statement: [...] "Together {{with its}} member states, the EU will {{urgently}} review {{in the coming days}} its relations with Egypt and adopt measures aimed at pursuing goals of promoting an end to violence, resumption of political dialogue and return to a democratic process. Further escalation must be prevented. It could have unpredictable consequences for Egypt and for its broader neighborhood." [...] Just before EU foreign ministers were scheduled to meet, they also warned Egypt's army and interim government that it was ready to [...] "review" [...] ties failing an end to violence and return to dialogue. They two issued statements that read further escalation could have [...] "unpredictable consequences" [...] for Egypt and the region. [...] "The calls for democracy and fundamental freedoms from the Egyptian population cannot be disregarded, much less washed away in blood. In co-operation with its international and regional partners, the EU will remain firmly engaged in efforts to promote an end to violence, resumption of political dialogue and return to a democratic process. To this effect, together with its member states, the EU will urgently review in the coming days its relations with Egypt and adopt measures aimed at pursuing these goals." [...] High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton released a statement that read: [...] "Confrontation and violence is not the way forward to resolve key political issues. I deplore the loss of lives, injuries and destruction in Cairo and other places in Egypt. I call on the security forces to exercise utmost restraint and on all Egyptian citizens to avoid further provocations and escalation." [...] Her spokesman, Michael Mann, said that [...] "the reports of deaths and injuries are extremely worrying. We reiterate that violence won't lead to any solution and we urge the Egyptian authorities to proceed with utmost restraint." [...] Envoy Bernardino León said: [...] "No options are being ruled out <b>today.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>discussing</b> responses to the current discussion in a very open-minded way." [...] Foreign Ministers of the bloc were expected to meet on 21 August to discuss how to get the Egyptian junta to resort to find a peaceful compromise to the impasse. He suggested option that could include cutbacks in Europe's 5 billion euro package of grants and loans promised last year, as well as a possible arms embargo The European Union restricted exports of security equipment and arms to Egypt, while Ashton said that aid would remain in place to the most [...] "vulnerable" [...] groups and to civil society. She also said that the member states were reassessing their export licenses.|$|E
40|$|Emergency {{response}} {{training is}} an important part of preparing for emergencies. The effectiveness of your in-house response efforts will be largely dependent upon the quality and quantity of the training your response personnel have been given. Emergency response activities can include many things. The most common types of, emergency response in an industrial setting are: 1) fires, 2) medical emergencies, 3) hazardous materials releases, and 4) special rescue such as confined space rescue. We will focus primarily on hazardous materials release response in our program <b>today.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> going to <b>discuss</b> some of the things you will need to consider if you are starting an emergency response training program or evaluating an existing program. We will cover some recommendations that will improve the quality of your program, insure the program is meeting your needs, help you with regulatory compliance issues, and provide some food for thought on approaches to emergency response training that you may find useful.

40|$|In Lecture 2, we {{saw that}} we can use Markov’s Inequality to obtain {{probabilistic}} inequalities for higher order moments. Specifically, {{we saw that}} if φ is a strictly monotonically increasing function, then Pr [X ≥ t] = Pr [φ(X) ≥ φ(t) ] ≤ E [φ(X) ] φ(t) For instance, for φ(x) = x 2 we obtained Chebyshev’s inequality. Theorem 4. 1 (Chebyshev’s Inequality) Let X be any random variable. Then, Pr [|X − E [X] | ≥ t] ≤ Var [X] t 2 Chebyshev’s inequality tells us that the random variable X takes value E [X]+O(λVar [X]) with probability 1 − O(λ− 2). This means that the tail of the probability distribution decays as O(λ− 2). In numerous cases, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> able to get control of higher moments of the variable X. So we may ask, whether we can use this to get better tail estimates. <b>Today,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to <b>discuss</b> the exponential moment method which results in deriving the famous Chernoff bounds. The typical setting <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to deal with is when the random variable is the sum of random variables which are either jointly independent or negatively associated or “almost ” independent, in the sense that there may be dependencies but they will <b>be</b> weak. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> going to focus typically on integer-valued, non-negative variables in the context of our class, but keep in mind that these results apply to other settings as well. For instance, there exist Chernoff bounds for complex-valued random variables. Furthermore, in this and the next lectures <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to see applications of probabilistic tools on random graphs. Finally, since almost all of you who are registered in this class are computer scientists, {{it is worth noting that}} these tools come up very often in the analysis of randomized algorithms. See for instance, see the classic book of Motwani-Raghavan [Motwani and Raghavan, 2010]. We will also see an example in Section 4. 3. 4...|$|R
