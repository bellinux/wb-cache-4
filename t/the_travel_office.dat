5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or the Independent Counsel.|$|E
5|$|The White House {{stated the}} firings were done because {{financial}} improprieties in <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> operation during previous administrations had been revealed by an FBI investigation. Critics contended the firings were done to allow friends of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton {{to take over}} the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted. Heavy media attention forced the White House to reinstate most of the employees in other jobs and remove the Clinton associates from the travel role.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven {{employees}} of the White House Travel Office, causing the White House travel office controversy even though <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> staff served {{at the pleasure of}} the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.|$|E

5|$|Since 2006, {{there have}} been a number of {{terrorist}} attacks, including explosions in a landmark holy place, a court and a temple. The 2006 Varanasi bombings were a series of bombings that occurred across the Hindu holy city of Varanasi on 7 March 2006. At least 28 people were killed and as many as 101 others were injured. The blasts occurred simultaneously shortly after 18:00 IST. The first blast took place at 18:20 in the crowded Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near the Banaras Hindu University. Other blasts followed at the Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station near the waiting area next to <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office.</b> Initially, another blast was reported in the stationary Shivganga Express bound for Delhi.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> {{controversy}} {{was subsequently}} judged {{to have been}} a factor in Vince Foster's depression and July 20, 1993, suicide. [...] In his torn-up resignation note from a few days before, he wrote [...] "No one in The White House, to my knowledge, violated any law or standard of conduct, including any action in <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office.</b> There was no intent to benefit any individual or specific group. [...] The press is covering up the illegal benefits they received from the travel staff". [...] (In the last part, Foster may have been referring to lax customs treatment by <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> of goods brought back from foreign trips by reporters.) ...|$|E
500|$|According to the White House, the {{incoming}} Clinton administration had heard reports of irregularities in <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> and possible kickbacks {{to an office}} employee from a charter air company. [...] They looked at a review by KPMG Peat Marwick which discovered that Dale kept an off-book ledger, had $18,000 of unaccounted-for checks, and kept chaotic office records. [...] White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty and the White House counsels thus decided to fire <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> staff and reorganize it. [...] The actual terminations were done on May 19, 1993, by White House director of administration David Watkins. [...] There was also a feeling among the White House and its supporters that <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> had never been investigated by the media due to its close relationship with press corps members and the plush accommodations it afforded them and favors it did for them. (Congress would later discover that in October 1988, a whistleblower within <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> had alleged financial improprieties; the Reagan White House counsel looked into the claim but took no action.) ...|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> White House <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of <b>the</b> White House <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> were fired. This action was unusual because although theoretically staff employees serve at the pleasure of the President and could be dismissed without cause, in practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|R

500|$|Almost {{two years}} passed. [...] Independent Counsel Starr {{continued}} his investigation. [...] Starr wanted access to notes that Vince Foster's attorney {{took in a}} conversation with Foster about <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> affair shortly before Foster's suicide, but on June 25, 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 against Starr in Swidler & Berlin v. United States, stating that attorney–client privilege extends beyond the grave. [...] In September 1998 Independent Counsel Starr released the famous Starr Report, concerning offenses that may have been committed by President Clinton as part of the Lewinsky scandal. [...] It did not mention <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> matter.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the FBI {{investigation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> practices themselves continued, soon focusing on Dale. [...] During {{the summer of}} 1993 the other staffers of the office were informed that {{they were no longer}} a target of investigation.|$|E
500|$|Immediate {{reactions}} to the report differed. [...] David E. Kendall, Hillary Clinton's lawyer, said that Ray's words were [...] "highly unfair and misleading" [...] and that Ray's conclusions were inconsistent, that evidence regarding her innocence had been buried in the document, and that the report confirmed that her fears about financial improprieties in <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> were warranted.|$|E

500|$|On June 23, 2000, the {{suspense}} ended when Ray submitted the final Independent Counsel report on <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> affair under seal to the judicial panel {{in charge of}} the investigation and publicly announced that he would seek no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. [...] Ray said that she had, contrary to her statements, [...] "ultimately influenced" [...] the decision to fire the employees. [...] However, [...] "the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that any of Mrs. Clinton's statements and testimony regarding her involvement in <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> firings were knowingly false," [...] and thus prosecution was declined. [...] White House press secretary Joe Lockhart was critical of Ray's statement: [...] "By inappropriately characterizing the results of a legally sealed report through innuendo, the Office of Independent Counsel has further politicized an investigation that has dragged on far too long." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1994, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr {{took over}} from Fiske in {{investigating}} Whitewater, Foster, and indirectly <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> matter.

500|$|Ray's full 243-page {{report was}} {{unsealed}} and made public on October 18, 2000, {{three weeks before}} the Senatorial election. [...] It confirmed that neither Hillary Clinton nor David Watkins would be indicted. [...] It included some new detail, including a somewhat unsubstantiated claim from a friend of Watkins saying that the First Lady had told Watkins to [...] "fire the sons of bitches." [...] Ray cited eight separate conversations between the First Lady and senior staff and concluded: [...] "Mrs. Clinton’s input into the process was significant, if not the significant factor influencing the pace of events in <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> firings and the ultimate decision to fire the employees." [...] Moreover, Ray determined Hillary Clinton had given [...] "factually false" [...] testimony when questioned by the GAO, the Independent Counsel, and Congress about <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> firings, but reiterated that [...] "the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt" [...] that she knew her statements were false or understood that they may have prompted the firings.|$|E
500|$|Attention {{initially}} {{focused on}} the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), since on May 12, 1993, a week before the firings, associate White House counsel William Kennedy had requested that the FBI look into possible improprieties in <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> operation. FBI agents went there and, although initially reluctant, authorized a preliminary investigation. [...] Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster became worried about the firings about to take place and ordered the KPMG Peat Marwick review, asking the FBI to hold off in the meantime. [...] The accounting review started on May 14 and the report was given to the White House on May 17. KPMG was unable to do an actual audit, because there were so few records in <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> that could be audited and because the office did not use the double-entry bookkeeping system that audits are based upon. One KPMG representative later described the office as [...] "an ungodly mess in terms of records" [...] with ten years of material piled up in a closet. [...] When the review came back with its reports of irregularities, Watkins went ahead with the terminations on May 19.|$|E
500|$|On January 5, 1996, a new {{development}} thrust <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> matter again to the forefront. A two-year-old memo from White House director of administration David Watkins surfaced that identified First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as the motivating force behind the firings, with the additional involvement of Vince Foster and Harry Thomason. [...] "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action. The action desired was the firing of <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> staff." [...] Written in fall 1993, apparently intended for McLarty, the Watkins memo also said [...] "we both know {{that there would be}} hell to pay" [...] if [...] "we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes." [...] This memo contradicted the First Lady's previous statements in the GAO investigation, that she had played no role in the firings and had not consulted with Thomason beforehand; the White House also found it difficult to explain why the memo was so late in surfacing when all the previous investigations had requested all relevant materials. [...] House committee chair Clinger charged a cover-up was taking place and vowed to pursue new material.|$|E

500|$|The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee {{issued its}} {{majority}} report on September 18, 1996, {{in which it}} accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed the committee's efforts to investigate the Travelgate scandal. [...] It portrayed Bill Clinton as being heavily involved in <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> affair, {{more than any other}} investigation. [...] The report's chapter titles were lurid: [...] "The White House Stonewalled All Investigations into the White House Travel Office Firings and Related Matters", [...] "The White House Initiated a Full-Scale Campaign of Misinformation in the Aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> Firings and President Clinton Led the Misinformation Campaign from the First Days of the Travelgate Debacle", [...] "Foster's Death Shattered a White House Just Recovering from an Abysmal First 6 Months of Administration", and so forth. [...] Democratic members of the Committee walked out in protest over the report, with ranking member Henry Waxman calling it [...] "an embarrassment to you , this committee and this Congress" [...] and [...] "a crassly partisan smear campaign against President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and this administration." [...] The following month Clinger forwarded the report, along with one on Filegate, to the Independent Counsel, suggesting that the testimony of several witnesses be looked at for possible perjury or obstruction of justice. [...] Democrats said this was politically motivated in an attempt to influence the 1996presidential election.|$|E
500|$|On November 19, 1998, Starr {{testified before}} the House Judiciary Committee in {{connection}} with the impeachment of Bill Clinton over charges related to the Lewinsky scandal. [...] Here, for the first time, Starr exonerated President Clinton of complicity in <b>the</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> affair, saying that while investigations were not complete, [...] "the president was not involved in our... investigation." [...] (Starr also chose this occasion to clear President Clinton in the Filegate matter, and to say he had not committed impeachable wrongdoing in the Whitewater matter; Democrats on the committee immediately criticized Starr for withholding all these findings until after the 1998Congressional elections.) ...|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> affair {{quickly became}} the first major ethics {{controversy}} of the Clinton presidency and an embarrassment for the new administration.

The effect was intensified by cable television news {{and the advent of}} the 24-hour news cycle. [...] Within three days of the firings, World Wide Travel voluntarily withdrew from the White House travel operation and were replaced on a temporary basis by American Express Travel Services.
