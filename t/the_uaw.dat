In 1968, Reuther led <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> out of the AFL-CIO, and <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> did not re-affiliate with the AFL-CIO until 1981, long after Reuther's death in a 1970 plane crash.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, {{because he was}} concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided {{it was important to}} work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E

5000|$|However, while peace united {{many members}} {{earlier in the}} organisation's lifetime, it also {{proved to be a}} {{divisive}} sticking point later on. <b>The</b> <b>UAW's</b> executive committee was affected by a [...] "pro-Soviet bias", choosing not to take specific action against the Soviet Union {{in the aftermath of the}} Chernobyl disaster. Opinions over the Partial Test Ban Treaty also caused a split along ideological lines, eventually contributing to <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> gradual decline.|$|R
5000|$|The war {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} nature of <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> organizing. <b>The</b> <b>UAW's</b> Executive Board voted to make a [...] "no strike" [...] pledge to ensure that the war effort would not be hindered by strikes (although vehemently opposed by some UAW executives, such as Tom Di Lorenzo: [...] "Our policy is not to win the war at any cost..."), and that pledge was later reaffirmed by the membership.|$|R
5|$|Live {{television}} {{coverage of the}} race, the thirtieth of thirty-six in the 2006 season, began in the United States at 1:00p.m.Eastern Daylight Time on NBC. Rev. Mike Jackson gave the invocation at 2:20, followed by the 151st Army Band's rendition of the national anthem. The command for the drivers to start their engines was given by Gary Casteel of <b>the</b> <b>UAW,</b> and no driver had {{to move to the}} rear of the grid at the start.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>UAW</b> {{was founded}} in August 1935, and the Canadian Region of <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> was {{established}} in 1937 following the 1937 GM Oshawa strike at General Motors's Oshawa, Ontario plant. The Canadian Region of <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> unionized the Ford Motor Company in 1945 after a major strike which established the right of Canadian labour union members to union dues checkoff.|$|E
50|$|Walter Reuther Central High School in Kenosha, Wisconsin {{is named}} for him, thanks to <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> {{significant}} presence at the city's former American Motors Corporation and Chrysler plants.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>the</b> most {{prominent}} <b>UAW</b> activists in <b>the</b> {{early years of}} the union was Wyndham Mortimer, who had led a strike against White Motors in Cleveland, Ohio. Mortimer was elected Vice-President at <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> first convention and might have been elected President if not for concern about his Party membership.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, United Auto Workers (UAW) {{president}} Bob King hired Bensinger {{to organize}} Japanese, Korean, and German transplant {{factories in the}} United States as part of <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> work to increase membership.|$|R

25|$|During Bieber's {{tenure in}} office, the Canadian branch of <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> broke off and formed an {{independent}} union, the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>UAW's</b> name, {{as opposed}} to the NHA's, {{reflected}} their aim to attract [...] "all women", recognising that those who stayed in the post-war workforce were no longer necessarily housewives and would want to identify otherwise.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>UAW's</b> {{constant}} lobbying against racist {{laws in the}} 1950s and 1960s {{were finally}} vindicated by the 1967 Australian referendum, where over 90% of Australians voted to give Australian Aborigines citizenship as well as equal rights under federal jurisdiction.|$|R
5000|$|... 'These are {{the most}} {{important}} negotiations in <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> history,' said Gary Chaison, a labor specialist at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. 'This is where they have to reset their role as a bona fide bargaining agent.' [...] " ...|$|R
25|$|Bieber's 1985 reelection was {{not without}} controversy, and <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> saw its first {{substantial}} internal leadership challenges since the 1940s during his presidency.|$|E
25|$|In November 1997, King was {{assigned}} to oversee the union's National Organizing Department, a position created especially for him. UAW members approved making the position an elected vice president in June 1998, and King was elected that year. It was the first new vice presidency created in many years. During his four-year tenure in this latter position, King pushed <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> to organize retail workers at Kmart, casino workers; state, county, and local government employees; and graduate student teaching and research assistants. Yokich defended King's outreach to these nontraditional constituencies of <b>the</b> <b>UAW.</b> King also established six regional organizing centers to help devolve responsibility for organizing closer to the worksite. By November 2000, he had led organizational drives which added about 50,000 new members to the union. By 2001, more than 22,000 state government workers in Michigan belonged to <b>the</b> <b>UAW,</b> as did some 15,000 graduate student workers. More than 20,000 of the 60,000 new members <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> organized between 2002 and 2006 worked outside the automotive industry. Under his leadership, <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> organized another 6,000 new members between 2006 and 2009. But his organizing drives also saw some major setbacks, such as when Nissan workers in Tennessee rejected UAW representation 2-to-1 in what {{was seen as a}} major setback for the union in its Southern organizing effort. Another loss came at Freightliner in North Carolina, and a major organizing effort at Mercedes-Benz never resulted in an election. The union did make organizing headway among auto parts suppliers, however.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Bieber won {{election}} as Vice President of the General Motors Department of <b>the</b> <b>UAW.</b> Irving Bluestone, who {{had led the}} GM Department since 1970, had retired. <b>The</b> <b>UAW</b> Steering Committee (a body of about 400 local union presidents) unanimously endorsed Bieber for the position. Also nominated for Vice President slots were Donald Ephlin, Ray Majerus, and Stephen Yokich. Bieber won the election at the UAW's national convention in June 1980, receiving {{the highest number of}} votes of any candidate.|$|E
5000|$|In 1939, he was {{defeated}} in his bid for re-election as <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> Canadian director by George Burt who was the candidate of the [...] "Unity Caucus" [...] composed of Communists, left-wing CCFers and other militants who viewed Millard as right-wing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{decision}} by <b>the</b> Liberals, <b>UAW</b> members and Communists to collaborate was ironic given Hepburn's vociferous opposition to both Communism and the Congress of Industrial Organizations during his term as Premier of Ontario. Two pro-labour MPPs, David Croll and Arthur Roebuck, had resigned from Hepburn's cabinet in 1937 to protect to his anti-labour actions during a UAW strike in Oshawa, Ontario. (George Burt was Treasurer of <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> Oshawa local {{at the time}} of the strike.) ...|$|R
50|$|He joined United Auto Workers as {{counsel in}} 1963, {{and served as}} general counsel until 1982, working under UAW presidents Walter Reuther, Leonard Woodcock, and Douglas A. Fraser. By the early 1970s, he was also {{put in charge of}} <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> Washington office.|$|R
25|$|International Harvester never {{recovered}} from the strike. In November 1981, IH asked <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> for $100 million in wage and benefit concessions. Rising interest rates, demand weakened by the early 1980s recession, and high manufacturing costs pushed the company's total debt to a whopping $4.5 billion. On December 23, 1981, the company reached an agreement with 200 of its lenders to refinance $4.15 billion of its debt {{in a bid to}} avoid bankruptcy. On January 20, 1982, <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> rejected Harvester's request for concessions because McCardell had just given $6 million in bonuses to salaried employees. But with the firm's financial condition rapidly worsening, <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> opened negotiations in March 1982. Negotiators reached a tentative agreement nearly two years to the day after the 19791980 strike ended, giving Harvester $200 million in wage, benefit, pension, and other savings over three years.|$|E
25|$|The break {{began in}} 1984. That year, the Canadian UAW {{leadership}} learned that Bieber had actively resisted and counteracted {{their attempts to}} avoid a concessionary contract. The Canadian UAW locals at General Motors rejected the contract negotiated by Bieber and his team, and 36,000 union members went out on strike in October. After two weeks, GM agreed to the Canadian union's demands, which included higher annual wage increases and no work teams, no profit sharing, and no joint labor-management committees. The Canadian locals learned that Bieber had threatened to withdraw authorization for their strike, which would have left them without strike pay. The Canadian strike against GM not only strained relationships between the American and Canadian wings of <b>the</b> <b>UAW,</b> but also put a heavy strain on the union's strike fund. Angry at Bieber's interference, White and the Canadian leadership offered a resolution before <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> executive board which would have limited American interference in Canadian UAW affairs. White's proposal gave the Canadian leadership exclusive control over collective bargaining and strike authorizations, removed international UAW authority over Canadian staff, and granted the Canadians unrestricted access to <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> strike fund. Bieber strongly opposed the plan, and <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> executive board rejected it {{by a vote of}} 24-to-1.|$|E
25|$|White {{began working}} at age 15 (Hay & Company - a wood {{furniture}} maker owned by US Plywood) {{and within a}} year he had already participated in a strike, his first pro-labour activity, and was elected a union steward {{at the age of}} 17. He led his first strike, against the same company, in 1957 at the age of 22, leading 500 workers off the job. Subsequently, White became fully immersed in the Canadian labour movement as a union organizer and then by 1959 president of Local 636 of the United Auto Workers (U.A.W.), a union based in the United States, that at the time had a large membership in Canadian industry (particularly in automobile manufacturing). In 1960 White was appointed as international representative of <b>the</b> <b>U.A.W.</b> and assigned to organizing duties within Canada. 1972 saw White named as administrative assistant to the director of the National Office of <b>the</b> <b>U.A.W.</b> White succeeded Dennis McDermott as Canadian Director of <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> in 1978.|$|E
50|$|King won {{re-election}} as {{vice president}} in 2002. In addition to his organizing duties, he was also appointed head of <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> Competitive Shop/Independents, Parts and Suppliers (IPS) Department, which assisted members and local unions in the auto parts and automotive supply industries.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>UAW's</b> {{discourse}} on <b>the</b> universality of motherhood followed {{a long tradition}} of uniting women across race, class, and even national divisions, providing an impetus for local women to agitate for change [...] "from within, rather than from the fringes of, mainstream society".|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1941, Mortimer's refusal to follow the anti-strike line of <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> {{governing}} Executive Board during a highly controversial work stoppage at a California aircraft factory lead to his termination by the union and effectively brought an end to his career.|$|R
25|$|The SWOC {{signed up}} {{thousands}} of members and absorbed {{a number of}} company unions at U.S. Steel and elsewhere, but did not attempt the sort of daring strike that <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> had pulled off against GM. Instead Lewis was able to extract a collective bargaining agreement from U.S. Steel, which had previously been an implacable enemy of unions, by pointing to the chaos and loss of business that GM had suffered by fighting <b>the</b> <b>UAW.</b> The agreement provided for union recognition, a modest wage increase and a grievance procedure.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} the CAW split from <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> are complicated. Holmes and Rusonik (1990) contend that {{although}} the Canadian labour movement {{has been seen as}} traditionally more militant than its American counterpart, it was in fact the uneven geographical development of both management and labour led the Canadian auto-workers to develop a distinctly different set of collective bargaining objectives, which placed them in a far stronger bargaining position as compared to <b>the</b> <b>UAW</b> in the U.S., and, ultimately, brought about the events that led directly to the Split.|$|E
25|$|During the war Walter Reuther {{took control}} of <b>the</b> <b>UAW,</b> and soon led major strikes in 1946. He ousted the Communists from the {{positions}} of power, especially at the Ford local.|$|E
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>UAW's</b> {{last major}} {{environmental}} acts was to petition {{the government to}} seek a heritage listing for Kakadu National Park in 1989, in consideration of its significance to the Aboriginal traditional owners, and the environmental threat posed by the nearby Ranger uranium mine.|$|R
25|$|By 2011 {{fewer than}} 7% of {{employees}} {{in the private sector}} belonged to unions. <b>The</b> <b>UAW's</b> numbers of automobile union members are representative of the manufacturing sector: 1,619,000 active members in 1970, 1,446,000 in 1980, 952,000 in 1990, 623,000 in 2004, and 377,000 in 2010 (with far more retired than active members).|$|R
