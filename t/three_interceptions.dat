5|$|Statistically, the Bears offense struggled. Cutler {{completed}} 27 of 47 {{passes for}} 317 yards, two touchdowns, <b>three</b> <b>interceptions</b> and a 65.6 passer rating. Cutler's <b>three</b> <b>interceptions</b> and fumble tied his turnover amount {{in the first}} three games. The offense also had trouble on third down; despite being ranked ninth in third down efficiency, the Bears failed to convert until there were 47 seconds left in the game to end the game converting just 1 of 13 third downs.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} highly {{promoted}} in pregame media coverage, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was outperformed statistically by Louisville's Hunter Cantwell. Vick completed 11 of 21passes for 203yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for 10yards on 13carries.

50|$|Booth {{assignments}} included those {{dedicated to}} identification, electronic countermeasures and <b>three</b> <b>interception</b> control stations. Other rooms {{that did not}} overlook the control room were provided for weather and technical control. The detection room housed the radar scopes showing the image generated by the radar system. The system used triangulation to establish the position of radar targets.|$|R

25|$|The Onyx {{system was}} {{launched}} in 2000 in order to monitor both civil and military communications, such as telephone, fax or Internet traffic carried by satellite. It was completed in late 2005 and currently consists of <b>three</b> <b>interception</b> sites, all based in Switzerland.

The win was only the Packers' second of the season. The loss left the Buccaneers' defense in last place in the league, despite their having spent four of their first five draft picks on defensive players.|$|E
5|$|Alabama's sole {{success on}} offense {{came from the}} hands of quarterback Andrew Zow, who {{completed}} 19 of 35 passes for 224 yards and a touchdown but also threw <b>three</b> <b>interceptions</b> and fumbled the ball once. Zow's favorite receiver was running back Shaun Alexander, who caught eight passes for 87 yards. Alexander also was Alabama's leading rusher. He finished the game with 21 carries for 55 yards.

To sixteen offensive touchdowns were added <b>three</b> <b>interception</b> returns, including a 69-yarder by James Rooths. Rob Hart was a perfect 10-10 in field goals, sharing kicking time with Scottish-born kicker Lawrence Tynes.|$|R
25|$|Harrington's worst {{game was}} arguably the 2000 Civil War {{in which he}} passed 24-36 for 333 yards, but threw five <b>interceptions.</b> <b>Three</b> of those <b>interceptions</b> were by Oregon State {{defensive}} back Jake Cookus. #8 Oregon State ultimately won 23-13 over then-#6 Oregon.|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Loganville, Georgia, Nkemdiche {{attended}} Grayson High School, {{where he played}} for the Grayson High School Rams high school football team. As a senior, he helped lead the team to a 10-4 record by recording 101 tackles, 18 tackles for loss, eight sacks, and <b>three</b> <b>interception</b> returns for touchdowns. He was projected {{to move to the}} secondary in college, but lacked elite speed, which is why he was only rated as a two-star recruit and not ranked among the nation's top prospects.|$|R
5|$|Amadi played {{high school}} {{football}} at Alief Hastings High School. He recorded 80 tackles and <b>three</b> <b>interceptions</b> in 1999 before being named an all-district player as a senior in the 2000 season. Amadi was {{also a member of}} Alief Hastings' track and field team. Following his senior season, Amadi was recruited by several programs, including Texas Tech and Indiana. He committed to play for the Kansas Jayhawks in early 2001, largely because Kansas also recruited his brother, with whom he played in high school.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' quarterbacks {{benefited from}} the profusion of passing. Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{finished}} the game having completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 266 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also ran three times for a total gain of one yard. Texas quarterback James Brown completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 148 yards, <b>three</b> <b>interceptions,</b> and a touchdown. He rushed six times for -43 yards because sacks are counted as runs for negative yardage. Texas also was hurt by penalty yardage. The Longhorns' nine penalties for 91 yards are both Texas bowl-game records.|$|E
5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game {{up to this}} point in the season: he threw <b>three</b> <b>interceptions</b> and was held to only 84 yards rushing. This marked the first time that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As a testament to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E
50|$|He had an {{immediate}} impact as a freshman, 71 tackles, with 1.5 of them coming for loss. He added a playmaking element as a sophomore, racking up 106 tackles and five picks on the year.

5|$|During {{the second}} half, however, {{things began to}} fall apart for Virginia Tech. Hokie quarterback Sean Glennon threw <b>three</b> <b>interceptions</b> and fumbled the ball once, giving Georgia {{excellent}} field position and many chances to score. Tech clung to a 21–13 lead {{at the end of}} the third quarter, but halfway through the fourth quarter, Georgia took a 31–21 lead over Virginia Tech. The Hokies closed the gap to 31–24 with a late field goal, but Georgia's defense held and the Bulldogs clinched the victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech defensive end Corey Moore was named the game's most valuable player. Moore had a sack, a tackle for a loss, a blocked punt and a forced fumble. His performance was representative by a successful defensive effort by the Virginia Tech Hokies, who blocked two punts, had <b>three</b> <b>interceptions,</b> and limited Alabama to only seven points and 50 rushing yards. Tech's 31-point margin of victory was the biggest bowl-game win in school history, and Alabama's loss was their biggest in a bowl game since a loss in the 1972 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Manning came {{in second}} in voting for the MVP award to running back Shaun Alexander ending his streak at two years. He was named the 2005 winner of the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award and {{nominated}} for the FedEx Air Player of the Year Award, along with Tom Brady and Carson Palmer.

5|$|On defense, Tech {{allowed an}} average of 190yards per game through the air. Free safety Carter Wiley and cornerback Billy Myers had <b>three</b> <b>interceptions</b> each during the regular season.

5|$|The Wake Forest {{defense was}} led by All-America honorable mention linebacker Jon Abbate. Abbate, who was a first-team All-ACC selection, was the team's leading tackler and earned the second-most tackles in the ACC during the season. Safety Josh Gattis was another star on the Wake defense. A first-team All-ACC selection, Gattis was the only player in the ACC to earn 70 tackles and five interceptions.
