40|$|One of the {{problems}} facing the introduction of novel crops is the concerns about their spread into the natural environment.

5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1346, Kantakouzenos stood on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> victory.

50|$|Most Pemphis live {{either at}} <b>the</b> <b>verges</b> <b>of</b> {{mangrove}} forests, {{well away from}} the forest-ocean interface; or they colonize beaches behind the intertidal zone, taking hold on rocks, gravel or sand, laterite or limestone, and frequently on promontories or crags.|$|R

During the Great Depression the local government was on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy. The Ontario Municipal Board stepped in and appointed an oversight committee which prevented the collapse of local government.|$|E

5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} was on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated.

He {{continued to be}} highly respected in Indonesian film circles, but was displeased with {{the condition of the}} country's film industry, which he considered to be on <b>the</b> <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> collapse. This he blamed on American cultural imperialism, which meant that most cinemas preferred screening foreign films, especially those from Hollywood, and that Indonesian youth were no longer creating a uniquely Indonesia identity.|$|E
