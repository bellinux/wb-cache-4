25|$|Although the {{existence}} of ORS is generally accepted, there is some controversy {{as to whether it}} is a distinct condition or merely a part or manifestation of other psychiatric conditions, mainly due to the overlapping similarities. Similarly, there is controversy with regards how the disorder should be classified. As ORS has obsessive and compulsive features, some consider it as a type of obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder, while others consider it an anxiety disorder due to the strong anxiety component. It is also suggested to be a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> dysmorphic disorder or, as it involves a single delusional belief, some suggest that ORS is a monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis (hypochondriacal type of delusional disorder, see monothematic delusion).|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} with clinical tools, one relatively inexpensive <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> fat meter uses {{the principle of}} bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) {{in order to determine}} an individual's body fat percentage. To achieve this, the meter passes a small, harmless, electric current through the body and measures the resistance, then uses information on the person's weight, height, age, and sex to calculate an approximate value for the person's body fat percentage. The calculation measures the total volume of water in the body (lean tissue and muscle contain a higher percentage of water than fat), and estimates the percentage of fat based on this information. The result can fluctuate several percentage points depending on what has been eaten and how much water has been drunk before the analysis.|$|E
25|$|Until 1994 the No.1 Dress {{was also}} the {{everyday}} working uniform, but today it is rarely seen except on formal occasions. The normal working dress retains the shirt and trousers. In some forces short sleeved shirts may be worn open-necked. Long sleeved shirts must always be worn with a tie or cravat, worn {{with or without a}} jersey or fleece. If a jersey, fleece or jacket is worn over a short sleeved shirt, then a tie must be worn. In 2003, Strathclyde Police replaced the white shirts with black wicking T-shirts with stab vest on top, for the majority of officers on duty. Some forces use combat trousers (trousers are of a cargo pocket style i.e. two thigh pockets and two conventional side and rear pockets) and boots. Today, female officers almost never wear a skirt in working dress, and sometimes wear trousers in formal dress as well. Officers also frequently wear reflective waterproof jackets, which have replaced the old greatcoats and cloaks traditionally worn in inclement weather. Most officers now wear stab vests, a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> armour, when on duty.|$|E
25|$|Lorica segmentata was a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> armour {{primarily}} used in {{the early}} Roman Empire, but the Latin name was first {{used in the}} 16th century (the ancient form is unknown). The armour itself consisted of broad ferrous strips ('girth hoops') fastened to internal leather straps. The strips were arranged horizontally on the body, overlapping downwards, and they surrounded the torso in two halves, being fastened at {{the front and back}} by means of brass hooks, which were joined by leather laces. The upper body and shoulders were protected by additional strips ('shoulder guards') and breast- and backplates. The form of the armour allowed it to be stored very compactly, since it was possible to separate it into four sections. During the time of its use, it was modified several times, the currently recognised types being the Kalkriese (c. 20 BC to 50), Corbridge (c. 40 to 120), and Newstead (c. 120 to possibly the early 4th century) types. There is also a little-known fourth type, known only from a statue found at Alba Julia in Romania, where there {{appears to have been a}} hybrid form, the shoulders being protected by scale armour and the torso hoops being fewer in number and deeper.|$|E

500|$|The {{location}} of the battle is unknown. However, according to Michael Livingston, {{the case for a}} location in the Wirral has wide support among current historians. Charters from the 1200s suggest that Bromborough (a town on the Wirral Peninsula) was originally named Brunanburh (which could mean [...] "Bruna's fort"). In his essay [...] "The Place-Name Debate", Paul Cavill listed the steps by which this transition may have occurred. Evidence suggests that there were Scandinavian settlements in the area starting in the late 800s, and the town is also situated near the River Mersey, which was a commonly used route by Vikings sailing from Ireland. Additionally, the Chronicle states that the invaders escaped at Dingesmere, and Dingesmere could be interpreted as [...] "mere of the Thing". The word Thing (or þing, in Old Norse) might be a reference to the Viking Thing (or assembly) at Thingwall on the Wirral. In Old English, mere refers to a body of water, although the specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> varies depending on the context. In some cases, it refers to a wetland, and a large wetland is present in the area. Therefore, in their article [...] "Revisiting Dingesmere", Cavill, Harding, and Jesch propose that Dingesmere is a reference to a marshland or wetland near the Viking Thing at Thingwall on the Wirral Peninsula. Since the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes the battle as taking place [...] "ymbe Brunanburh" [...] ("around Brunanburh"), numerous locations near Bromborough have been proposed, including the Brackenwood Golf Course in Bebington, Wirral (formerly within the Bromborough parish).|$|E

To account for such variety, there is a growing consensus that {{there are at least two}} distinct <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>body</b> representation that can be impaired, the body schema and the body image. However, the definition of these notions is often unclear. The notion <b>of</b> <b>body</b> image has attracted most controversy because of its lack of unifying positive definition.
