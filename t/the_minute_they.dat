25|$|I {{would be}} a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people {{of the public and}} we have found you wanting. The old Inquisition had its rack and its {{thumbscrews}} and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>they</b> catch on fire.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} mainstream critics. It holds an average ranking 13% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews. Site consensus reads: [...] "The tropes of both football and evangelical movies are gracelessly on parade in this banal, insipid drama." [...] The film also received criticism from some Christians for portraying a prosperity gospel version of Christianity, where one simply gets {{whatever they want}} <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>they</b> follow Jesus.|$|E

60|$|That day was our {{understanding}} of it--Noel's and mine; that was our dream; and now we would count the days, <b>the</b> hours, <b>the</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>They</b> would fly lightly along; they would soon be over.|$|R
50|$|Unanimous consent is {{frequently}} used to approve <b>the</b> <b>minutes.</b> If {{no one has}} corrections to <b>the</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>they</b> are approved without a formal vote by unanimous consent.

'I {{was not a}} day too soon,' he said; for {{he could}} see the baby cobras curled up inside the skin, and he knew that <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>they</b> were hatched they could each kill a man or a mongoose.

60|$|Barker {{was still}} standing, {{and on the}} fret, but after a moment's hesitation, he sat down {{as if he might}} spring up again <b>the</b> next <b>minute.</b> <b>They</b> ordered drinks in silence.|$|R

"Now, as I've {{told you}} before, {{more than half}} the club members had been knocked around by Slowly and Jimmy, and <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>they</b> heard that the job had been put up by Mr. Crow they sailed into him, calling the old fellow more names than there are days in the month.

6000|$|They hastened off, and I {{walked back}} to the gardens. I looked at my watch, and to my horror I saw it was five minutes past six. Fifteen minutes left yet.

6000|$|But {{how she was}} to earn it, how she was {{to conquer}} the world--almost entirely for the world's own good--she did not see. Most of the girls who were not betrothed meant to be teachers. Of these there were two sorts: {{careless}} young women who admitted that they intended to leave the [...] "beastly classroom and grubby children" [...] <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>they</b> {{had a chance to}} marry; and studious, sometimes bulbous-browed and pop-eyed maidens who at class prayer-meetings requested God to [...] "guide their feet along the paths of greatest usefulness." [...] Neither sort tempted Carol. The former seemed insincere (a favorite word of hers at this era). The earnest virgins were, she fancied, as likely to do harm as to do good by their faith in the value of parsing Caesar.|$|E
6000|$|Everywhere in the Western {{newspaper}} circles Walter {{heard stories}} of Californians {{who had gone}} East and become geniuses <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>they</b> crossed the Hudson.... Walter also went East and crossed the Hudson, {{but he did not}} become a genius. If there had been an attic to starve in, he would have starved in one, but as New York has nothing so picturesque, he starved in furnished rooms instead, while he wrote [...] "special stories" [...] for Sunday newspapers, and collected jokes for a syndicated humorous column. He was glad to become managing editor (though he himself was the only editor he had to manage) of a magazine for stamp-collectors. He wrote some advertisements for a Broadway dealer in automobile accessories, read half a dozen books on motors, and brazenly demanded his present position on the Motor and Gas Gazette.|$|E
