5|$|Amelia visits Meredith to {{apologize}} for her prior behavior and discuss her sobriety. Amelia confides in Meredith that she is scared to lose her, but Meredith responds {{that she is not}} ready to forgive her. Webber takes Meredith out for some fresh air, and gives her a talk about the power of forgiveness. He encourages her to forgive Amelia, Penny, Derek, and most importantly herself. She agrees to meet Lou. He introduces his wife and two daughters and then offers a sincere apology for what happened.

25|$|They declare Walther the winner, and the Mastersingers want to {{make him}} a member of their guild on the spot. At first Walther is tempted to reject their offer, but Sachs {{intervenes}} once more and explains that art, even ground-breaking, contrary art like Waltherâ€™s, can only exist within a cultural tradition, which tradition the art sustains and improves. Walther is convinced; he agrees to join. Pogner places the symbolic Master-hood Medal around his neck, Eva <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and the people sing once more the praises of Hans Sachs, the beloved Mastersinger of Nuremberg.|$|E
25|$|One SEAL, {{unaware of}} Coffey's plan at the time, helps {{to locate the}} warhead, stopped on a ledge several {{thousand}} feet down the trench. Bud volunteers to use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will {{only be able to}} communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice keeping him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. The SEAL guides him in successfully disarming it. With nearly no oxygen left in the system, Bud types out that he knew this was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud and <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> He is guided to an alien ship deeper in the trench. Deep inside, the NTI creates an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTI plays back Bud's message to his wife, and the two look at each other with understanding.|$|E
60|$|SHE. For my sake, Henry. After all, he's my husband. Forgive him. <b>Take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> [Henry, dazed, {{lets her}} <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{and place it}} in Teddy's].|$|R

2500|$|When a pawn {{is moved}} to its eighth , once the player <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> off the pawn, a {{different}} move of the pawn {{can no longer}} be substituted. [...] However, the move is not complete until the promoted piece is released on that square [...]|$|E
2500|$|Chow {{emerges from}} the limo and kills Marshall, {{allowing}} the Wolfpack to live because Alan saved his life. He offers Alan a bar of gold as a gift, but Alan turns him down and trolls Chow by pretending to end their friendship because of Chow's unhealthy influence on the group (but pulls a fast one on Chow when he <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> back from a handshake) and Chow tells Alan he is [...] "...cold as ice". As Chow sadly watches them leave, they go to retrieve Phil's minivan from the pawnshop and Alan makes a date with Cassie. Six months later, the two marry. Vowing to stop with his antics, Alan regretfully resigns from the Wolfpack but would still like for the gang to hang out on occasion. As the four walk to the ceremony, a montage of clips from the previous films play.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Project Reborn", Tommy {{learns that}} in order for him and Malina to stop the H.E.L.E., they need a third person to act as a conduit for their power, someone willing to {{sacrifice}} themselves to save the world. Tommy goes back in time two days and saves Noah's life, transporting him seven years into the past to when Angela tested the twins powers. Noah watches as Angela states that there was a third faceless person in her vision and seems to look right at Noah. Tommy explains to Noah that after failing to stop the H.E.L.E. [...] "a thousand times", he realized Noah was the key: if Noah acts as their conduit, they can stop it, but it will be fatal to him. Noah tells Tommy {{to take him to the}} present where he takes Malina's hand. Though Tommy protests, Noah tells him that this is his destiny and Tommy <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> With the power boost from Tommy, Malina fires a blast of energy into the sky through Noah, causing him great pain but successfully shielding the planet from the H.E.L.E. and saving the world. After the future is changed, Tommy and Malina find Noah sitting on the ground, near death. Noah looks at his grandchildren one last time and tells them that he's proud of them before dying.|$|E

60|$|And the ardent Lee swaggers up to Harry, and <b>takes</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> with respect, {{and pays}} him a {{compliment}} or two, which makes me, at least, pardon {{him for his}} late impertinence; for my dearest Hal walks gloomily through his mother's rooms in his old uniform of the famous corps which he has quitted.|$|E
