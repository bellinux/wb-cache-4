25|$|The Endless Stair {{rose from}} the lowest dungeon of Moria to Durin's Tower at the summit of Celebdil.

Durin's Tower {{and the top of}} the Stair were destroyed in <b>that</b> <b>struggle.</b> The height of the Stair is not known, but Gandalf said that it climbed many thousands of steps in an unbroken spiral. The Stair was clearly of epic proportions, as it allowed Gandalf and the Balrog to ascend from one of Moria's lowest Deeps to the pinnacle of one of the tallest mountains in Middle-earth.|$|E

25|$|Not only is {{the state}} of nature hostile to the state of art of the garden; but the {{principle}} of the horticultural process, by which the latter is created and maintained, is antithetic to that of the cosmic process. The characteristic feature of the latter is the intense and unceasing competition of the struggle for existence. The characteristic of the former is the elimination of <b>that</b> <b>struggle,</b> by the removal of the conditions which give rise to it. The tendency of the cosmic process is to bring about the adjustment of the forms of plant life to the current conditions; the tendency of the horticultural process is the adjustment of the conditions {{to the needs of the}} forms of plant life which the gardener desires to raise.|$|E
25|$|A {{major theme}} in Marxism {{is the problem}} of {{mediation}} or determination: what amount of agency does labor have in light of the determining forces of a given culture. Implicit in this is the underlying fact that labor is itself worth something, and thus the mediator is actually money, be it access to money or its possession. All arenas of conflict are mediated by how money acts as a primary determining agent in the outcome of <b>that</b> <b>struggle.</b> As James Arnt Aune has reflected, questions that arise concerning this problem include: “How do institutions, practices, and messages shape class formation? What alternative institutions, practices, and messages are available to those who wish to reshape class formations within the framework of structural possibilities?” (46). The question of mediation, then, is a question, as Aune puts it, of how Marxist theory mediates “structural possibilities and popular struggle” (46).|$|E
25|$|When Boris I {{assumed the}} throne of Bulgaria in 852, the country was still pagan, with the ruling Bulgar elite being Tengriists while the Slavic {{population}} practised its own religion. Christianity was already widespread in Bulgaria as the country was established on former territories of the Byzantine Empire, and {{seems to have been}} influential. Even one of the sons of Khan Omurtag (r. 814–831), Enravota, converted to Christianity. The Bulgarian nobility was strongly opposed to any form of Byzantine influence in the country and was therefore hostile to Christianity as it was directly associated with the Byzantine Empire. Boris I, however, had many reasons to consider conversion— Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and East Francia; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth; and finally, Boris also saw Christianity as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs. The geopolitical situation in the mid 9th century was also favourable because of the increasing friction and rivalry between the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople for influence in Central Europe. <b>That</b> <b>struggle</b> between the two churches would give the Bulgarian ruler the opportunity to manoeuvre and negotiate with both, thus extracting favourable concessions while keeping the country out of direct foreign influence. When the Byzantines invaded Bulgaria in the autumn of 863 and demanded conversion to Christianity from Constantinople as the single condition to retreat, Boris I readily accepted and was baptised in the beginning of 864, assuming the Christian name Michael after his spiritual godfather, the Byzantine Emperor Michael III. That step was very unpopular among the nobility, but when they rebelled Boris I dealt decisively with them and executed 52 magnates along with their whole families. When in the following year the Byzantines sturdily demonstrated their determination not to allow the existence of an autocephalous Bulgarian Church, Boris I decided to turn to the Papacy.|$|E

500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico.

Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father.

[...] Some Catholics believed that the martyrdom of James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, would encourage James to convert to the Catholic faith, and the Catholic houses of Europe may also have shared that hope. [...] James received an envoy from the Habsburg Archduke Albert of the Southern Netherlands, ruler of the remaining Catholic territories after over 30years of war in the Dutch Revolt by English-supported Protestant rebels. [...] For the Catholic expatriates engaged in <b>that</b> <b>struggle,</b> the restoration by force of a Catholic monarchy was an intriguing possibility, but following the failed Spanish invasion of England in 1588 the papacy had taken a longer-term view on the return of a Catholic monarch to the English throne.|$|E

He based protagonist Alex Parrish, whose complex family history haunts her throughout the series, on a relative; Safran wove his own struggle to understand that family member into Alex's desire to learn the truth about her father. Safran said [...] "I have a family member who either is a pathological liar or has been involved with a government agency my whole life.

500|$|Mentioning Operation Clambake as {{an example}} of an Internet {{response}} to a controversial movement in their 2003 book Understanding New Religious Movements, John A. Saliba and J. Gordon Melton referred to the site as [...] "a Web page devoted to the negative aspects of Scientology". Douglas E. Cowan, writing in Religion Online (2004), characterizes Operation Clambake {{as an example}} of a [...] "surfeit of sites dedicated to so-called watchdog organizations or [...] home pages of disgruntled ex-members." [...] According to Cowan, Internet coverage of the Church of Scientology represents an [...] "important example of competing propagandas <b>that</b> <b>struggle</b> for authority and control both online and off". Cowan proposes that Operation Clambake seeks to demonstrate that the Church of Scientology [...] "lacks any redeeming social value". Cowan notes that most of the content presented by the site is not the result of original research by the owner but rather a collection of hyperlinks to media reports, scholarly and popular articles, court documents and out-of-print books. Complemented by links to like-minded sites hosting essentially the same information, the result is thought by Cowan to be inflation of the apparent quantity of anti-Scientology material available. According to Cowan, Operation Clambake is not designed to be read by Scientologists, but rather meant for those who already hold negative views about Scientology and might join Heldal-Lund in his self-stated purpose: [...] "The Fight Against the Church of Scientology on the Net." [...] Cowan compares the site to a propaganda effort, and writes that a message is presented repeatedly, consistently to a target audience that already has some affinity with it, leading to a somewhat self-limiting construction of reality.|$|E
