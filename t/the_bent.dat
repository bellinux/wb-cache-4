5|$|The book on Lappland was {{published}} in 1908, with eleven watercolors by Bauer. They were painted in Stockholm, almost 18 months after his visit, using the photos and sketches he had collected during his journey. Many of the photos resulted in other drawings and paintings. Most of these were romanticized versions of the photos, but he succeeded in capturing the nuances and ambiance of the goahtis, and {{the richness of the}} Sami garments and crafts. Details from the Sami culture, such as <b>the</b> <b>bent</b> knives, shoes, spears, pots and belts, became important elements in the clothes and ornamentations of Bauer's trolls. Bauer's eye for detail and his numerous notes also made the material an ethnographic documentation of the era.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on architectural-flared column <b>bents.</b> <b>The</b> objective was to evaluate the static and dynamic performance of <b>the</b> <b>bents.</b> <b>The</b> unique aspect of <b>the</b> <b>bents</b> is a gap {{at the top of}} the flares to separate the flares from contributing structurally. The project concentrated on the effect of the gap width {{at the top of the}} column section. The study included both experimental and analytical investigations. Two specimens were tested statically that had been partially tested on a shake table in a previous study. The objective of the static tests was to evaluate the performances of <b>the</b> <b>bents</b> till failure. One specimen had columns that were flexure dominated while the other had shear dominated columns. Each column had same reinforcement except for the flare transverse reinforcement. A newly constructed specimen was tested to evaluate the performance of <b>the</b> <b>bents</b> with twice <b>the</b> gap that had been used in the previous study. The flare had the minimum longitudinal and transverse reinforcement. A non-linear finite element analysis program DIANA was used to perform the analytical study. The results were also compared with the results of programs like RCMC, RC-Shake and wFRAME. The performances of the specimen...|$|R
50|$|The {{mounting}} {{differences between}} Macquarie, Bent and Bent's brother led Macquarie {{to write to}} Lord Bathurst offering to resign unless both Bents were removed from office. Bathurst did so in January 1816, siding with Macquarie rather than <b>the</b> <b>Bents.</b> Before notification of Bent's dismissal arrived in <b>the</b> colony, <b>Bent</b> had died on 10 November 1815.|$|R
25|$|As a true smooth-sided structure, <b>the</b> <b>Bent</b> Pyramid {{was only}} a partial success – albeit a unique, {{visually}} imposing one; {{it is also the}} only major Egyptian pyramid to retain a significant proportion of its original smooth outer limestone casing intact. As such it serves as the best contemporary example of how the ancient Egyptians intended their pyramids to look.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bent</b> coin as a love token may {{be derived}} from the well-recorded {{practice}} of bending a coin when making a vow to a saint, such as vowing {{to give it to}} the saint's shrine if the saint would intercede to cure a sick human, animal, etc. Bending a coin when one person made a vow to another was another practice which arose from this.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bent</b> of {{his mind}} was decidedly political. He was a natural born politician.

25|$|Pasquale Vinaccia (1806–c. 1882), modernized the mandolin, adding features, {{creating}} the Neapolitan mandolin c. 1835. Pasquale remodeled, raised and extended the fingerboard to 17 frets, introduced stronger wire strings made of high-tension steel and substituted a machine {{head for the}} friction tuning pegs, then standard. The new wire strings required that he strengthen the mandolin's body, and he deepened the mandolin's bowl, giving the tonal quality more resonance. He didn't introduce <b>the</b> <b>bent</b> soundboard, as it was present {{in some of the}} instruments made by the previous generation for bronze strings.|$|E
25|$|To {{accommodate}} a folding wing the designers considered retracting the {{main landing gear}} rearward but, for the chord of wing that was chosen, {{it was difficult to}} make the landing gear struts long enough to provide ground clearance for the large propeller. Their solution was an inverted gull wing, which considerably shortened the required length of the main gear legs. The anhedral of the wing's center-section also permitted the wing and fuselage to meet at the optimum angle for minimizing drag, without using wing root fairings. <b>The</b> <b>bent</b> wing, however, was heavier and more difficult to construct, offsetting these benefits.|$|E

They are braced twice: at the intersection of the post and tie beams, and again above the tie beam. Both upper and lower ties are connected to the anchor beams by mortise joints and pegs. A purlin-plate runs across the top of <b>the</b> <b>bents,</b> also mortised and braced. Below the tie beams another set of longitudinal braces links <b>the</b> <b>bents,</b> parallel to <b>the</b> purlin-plates.|$|R

25|$|Wollaston made {{improvements}} to the galvanic battery (named after Galvani) in the 1810s. In Wollaston's battery, the wooden box was replaced with an earthenware vessel, and a copper plate was bent into a U-shape, with a single plate of zinc placed {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>bent</b> copper. The zinc plate was prevented from making contact with the copper by dowels (pieces) of cork or wood. In his single cell design, the U-shaped copper plate was welded to a horizontal handle for lifting the copper and zinc plates out of the electrolyte when the battery was not in use.|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} Egyptian pyramids {{is thought to}} {{represent}} the primordial mound from which the Egyptians believed the earth was created. The shape of a pyramid {{is thought to be}} representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance. Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence. For example, the formal name of <b>the</b> <b>Bent</b> Pyramid at Dahshur was The Southern Shining Pyramid, and that of Senwosret at el-Lahun was Senwosret is Shining.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} channel {{to the port}} has two sections—the entrance channel within the protection of outer arm and the outer channel beyond the protection of outer arm. The total length of the entrance channel is 7km. The width of channel gradually increased from 244m to 419m at <b>the</b> <b>bent</b> portion, then maintains a constant width of 305m. The depth of the inner and the outer channels are 18.6m and 19.2m, respectively, below chart datum, with a swell allowances of 3m. The entrance is 350m in Bharathi Dock and 125m in Dr. Ambedkar Dock. The draught in the navigational channel is maintained by dredging approximately 1 million cubic metres annually.|$|E

50|$|This refusal, {{with other}} {{difficulties}} mounting between Macquarie and <b>the</b> two <b>Bents,</b> led to Macquarie {{writing to the}} British authorities asking for both of <b>the</b> <b>Bents</b> to be removed, to which Lord Bathurst agreed in January 1816.

25|$|Another hunting weapon, {{based on}} {{different}} principles than the spear, is the throwing stick. While at its simplest the throwing stick {{is just a}} heavy club thrown at the game, a well designed throwing stick uses the principles of an airfoil shape and gyroscopic stability; the oldest of these dates back 200,000 years to ancient Poland. The kylie, for example, an Australian hunting boomerang in use into modern times, uses <b>the</b> <b>bent</b> shape and a symmetric airfoil cross section to provide stability and low drag for long, accurate throws. Kylies do not return (a good thing, since they are large, heavy, and dangerous) but smaller, lighter versions, the classic boomerang, exhibit the classic circular path that made the boomerang famous. Boomerangs, of both the non-returning and returning variety, {{have been found in}} many ancient cultures, ranging from Egypt to North America.|$|E
25|$|Muralitharan's doosra was {{the subject}} of an {{official}} report by match referee Chris Broad during Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 2004, for illegal bending of the arm at the elbow during the bowling action. Subsequent biomechanical tests conducted at the University of Western Australia in Perth showed that Muralitharan was straightening his arm by angles of up to 10 degrees prior to delivering doosras, well outside the International Cricket Council (ICC) acceptable guideline of 5 degrees for spin bowlers. (Straightening <b>the</b> <b>bent</b> arm at the moment of delivery imparts added ball speed due to the action of the triceps muscle: {{this is one of the}} ways baseball pitchers generate ball velocity.) Muralitharan was subsequently instructed by Sri Lanka Cricket not to bowl the doosra in international cricket. In November 2004, the International Cricket Council conducted more research into illegal bowling actions and found that many great bowlers like Glenn Mcgrath, Jason Gillespie and Shaun Pollock, whose actions were considered legitimate were actually transgressing the rules. A rule change was proposed and accepted at a meeting of ICC chief executives in early 2005, stating that any bowler may straighten the arm up to 15° (which was earlier 9° for spinners and 12° for seamers) and Muralitharan's doosra once again became a legal delivery.|$|E
500|$|Atherton Botanical Garden Club, {{which is}} today a social club, {{was formed in}} 1850, and {{organised}} lectures, study groups and rambles on Chat Moss for its members.
