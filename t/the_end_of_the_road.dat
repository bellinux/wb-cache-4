25|$|It was a nightmarish {{campaign}} for India, with no wins {{and none of}} the players contributing. The fact that India as a team were not able to score even 200 runs in a single match, that only Vishwanath crossed three-figures in terms {{of the total number of}} individual runs scored (106) with only him and Gavaskar scoring a half-century each, and that only Amarnath, with 4 wickets, and Kapil, with 2 wickets, took wickets in all the 3 matches, showed how horrible and pathetic the Indian performance was in the World Cup. This dismal performance generated an uproar in India. The tournament marked <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> for the now struggling Indian spin quartet, with its two members in the World Cup side, Bedi and Venkataraghavan, bowling really poorly and not even taking a single wicket. Following the World Cup and the subsequent series against England, Bedi retired from international cricket, while Venkataraghavan was sacked as captain and also dropped from the team. None of the 4 members of the spin quartet ever played in a World Cup again.|$|E

[...] Graphic scenes earned the film an X rating, {{such as those of}} the botched abortion and of what Barth calls a [...] "man rapes chicken" [...] scene not found in the book. [...] Barth and critics widely panned the movie; Barth wrote disdainfully about it in the introduction to the 1988 single-volume edition of The Floating Opera and <b>The</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road.</b> [...] Academics Ken Pellow and Rita Hug opined that the linguistic, literary and philosophical aspects of the book made it difficult to adapt; they argued that Jake Horner's frequent speaking to the reader is key to the book's effectiveness but does not lend itself to film.|$|E
