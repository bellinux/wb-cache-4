5|$|The Gurdon Bill Store {{is named}} for Gurdon Bill, {{who was born in}} 1784. The land was {{originally}} purchased by Bill and his partner, Philip Gray, in 1818. Clouette notes that four years later, Bill was the sole owner of the property; a record from 1819 says Gray sold his interest in <b>the</b> <b>store</b> to Bill for $500. Bill continued to run <b>the</b> <b>store</b> until shortly before his death in 1856. At age 21, Bill went to Plainfield Academy and later went on to work with various merchants before setting up <b>the</b> <b>store</b> in North Groton, later incorporated as Ledyard, Connecticut. Clouette notes a brief passage of <b>the</b> <b>store</b> out of the Bill family, soon reacquired, before it was sold to the Congregational Society in 1875. The Congregational Society has made limited use of <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> preserving its historical integrity. Local historians speculate that the store's final transaction was made in 1868; afterwards <b>the</b> <b>store</b> was boarded up and left essentially unused.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> {{energy of}} an antenna is {{instrumental}} {{in the evaluation of}} antenna Q and the associated physical bounds, it is difficult to strictly define <b>stored</b> energy. Classically, <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> energy is either determined from the input impedance of the antenna or the electromagnetic fields around the antenna. The new energy expressions proposed by Vandenbosch express <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> energy in <b>the</b> current densities in the antenna structure. These expressions are equal to <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> energy defined from the difference between the energy density and the far field energy for many but not all cases. Here, the different approaches to determine <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> energy are compared for dipole, loop, inverted L-antennas, and bow-tie antennas. We use Brune synthesized circuit models to determine <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> energy from <b>the</b> input impedance. We also compare the results with differentiation of the input impedance and the obtained bandwidth. The results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> energy in <b>the</b> fields, currents, and circuit models agree well for small antennas. For higher frequencies, <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> energy expressed in the currents agrees with <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> energy determined from Brune synthesized circuit models whereas <b>the</b> <b>stored</b> energy approximated by differentiation of input impedance gives a lower value for some cases. The corresponding results for the bandwidth suggest that the inverse proportionality between the fractional bandwidth and Q-factor depends on the threshold level of the reflection coefficient...|$|R

5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, he thinks about informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>store</b> does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open <b>the</b> <b>store</b> for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to <b>the</b> <b>store</b> and buy things.
