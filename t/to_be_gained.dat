5|$|During the march, Amangkurat {{tried to}} gain the loyalty of the lords in the territories he passed through. Many were {{previously}} loyal to Kajoran, who sided with Trunajaya, or were wavering between the two sides. The presence of the king and his forces, {{as well as the}} possibly booty <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> in the campaign, motivated them to declare allegiance to Amangkurat and join his forces. At some point, the Javanese forces in the column reached 13,000.|$|E
5|$|As vice president, Brundage {{served on}} a {{commission}} appointed at the IOC's London session in 1948 to recommend whether the 1906 Intercalated Games, held in Athens, {{should be considered a}} full Olympic Games. All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there was nothing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> by recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Sampson {{also made}} enemies when he backed Samuel Insull's plan to dam the Cumberland Falls to {{generate}} hydroelectric power. An {{ally of the}} traditional southern power groups—the utility companies and textbook manufacturers—Sampson cited the jobs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> from the plan. The plan was opposed conservationists {{in the state and}} by most of the state's newspapers. An alternate plan was proposed by Louisville-born millionaire and Delaware senator T. Coleman du Pont, who offered to purchase the falls for $230,000 {{and turn it into a}} state park. The General Assembly passed legislation giving the state park commission the right of eminent domain over the falls, then voted to accept the du Pont's offer. Sampson vetoed the Assembly's action, but his veto was overridden.|$|E

Although {{the use of this}} mask is {{strictly}} limited to boss battles only, it is possible to wear it anywhere using a glitch. Upon donning this mask, Link grows to nearly two-and-a-half times his normal height. His clothes turn white and his face appears with a type of war paint on it. The sword that Fierce Deity Link carries is a helix shape that uses magic power to shoot beams at enemies.|$|E
5|$|Book Four, The Alchemist, {{takes place}} in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid, {{attempts}} to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone (which supposedly can turn Lead into Gold), but his fraud is uncovered and his hand is chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with Alchemy (the prevailing belief of the scholars of the time) and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books (which come to Samarkand via the trade routes {{from all over the}} known world). However, his friends Iwang (a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician) and Bahram (a Sufi blacksmith) instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims in the books and thus see if there is any true wisdom <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained.</b> They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly improve knowledge of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create the scientific method. Their discoveries create interest (and alarm) amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch the eye of the Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East.|$|E

25|$|Tongyong Pinyin {{would not}} {{supplant}} Hanyu Pinyin in Taiwan, as Hanyu Pinyin is rarely encountered outside the Taipei area anyway {{and has never}} been in common use. Tongyong Pinyin is intended to supplant the many variants of Wade–Giles that remain the dominant form of romanization encountered in Taiwan. No one questions the superiority of Tongyong Pinyin to Wade–Giles and the benefit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> from the change.|$|E
25|$|Modern Western square {{dancing is}} non-competitive activity. There are no dance competitions, {{and apart from}} fun events, no prizes are ever offered or sought for 'best dancer' or 'best square'. Particularly at the 'challenge' levels there is large degree of {{personal}} satisfaction <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> from the problem solving element of completing a dance. At all levels the main elements are to enjoy the dance, and to exercise.|$|E

25|$|Brass, 1962–1982. The {{composition}} of the coin was changed again slightly in 1962. Mint officials felt that deletion of the tin content would have no adverse effect on the wearing qualities of the coin, whereas the manufacturing advantages <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> with the alloy stabilized at 95% copper and 5% zinc would be of much benefit. Congressional authority for this modification is contained in an Act of Congress approved on September 5, 1962.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{the basis}} is {{associated}} with the primordial or original Buddhahood, also called Samantabhadra, which is said to be beyond time itself and hence Buddhahood is not something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained,</b> but an act of recognizing what is already immanent in all sentient beings. Likewise, this view of the basis stems from the Indian Buddha-nature theory. Other terms used to describe the basis include unobstructed (ma 'gags pa), universal (kun khyab) and omnipresent.|$|E

By the 1930s, the resources and development work necessary to realistically achieve absolute speed and distance records were becoming beyond the resources of individual companies, and required the involvement of national governments.|$|E
25|$|Russia entered World War I against Germany in August 1914.

When Turkey joined the war on Germany's side in November, Georgia found itself on the frontline. Most Georgian politicians remained neutral, though pro-German feeling and the sense that independence was within reach began to grow among the population.|$|E

However, on the military front, this merely freed up Austria to engage in further western European wars. Austria was becoming more involved in competition with France in Western Europe, fighting the French in the War of the League of Augsburg (1688–1697).|$|E
25|$|During Vessey's tenure {{there was}} {{increased}} emphasis on space as a theater of operations.

Realizing the enormous military advantages <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> from operations in space and to support SDI, the JCS recommended the establishment of a unified command for space. US Space Command was activated on September 23, 1985.|$|E

In return the USSR was to supply fish to Equatorial Guinea. China and Cuba also gave different forms of financial, military, and technical assistance to Equatorial Guinea, which gave them a measure of influence there. For the USSR, despite the unsavoury background of Macias Nguema, there was an advantage <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> in the War in Angola by having access to Luba base and later on to Malabo International Airport.|$|E
