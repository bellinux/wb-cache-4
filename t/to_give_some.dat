Colours, sizes and shapes can all be chosen according to taste and the tradition in a given village or tribe; further, motifs are often combined, as illustrated in the photographs above. <b>To</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> idea of this variability, a few alternative forms are shown in the table.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E
5|$|Gundamma is {{tortured}} by Padma's ruthless, confidence-trickster aunt Durga. Bhoopati is {{released from jail}} and Ghantaiah asks Gundamma <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> money. Because of Gundamma's arrogance, Prabhakar and Padma leave for Bangalore. Durga steals {{the money in the}} locker, accuses Gundamma of robbery and locks her in a room behind the house. Lakshmi and Anji visit Gundamma and become aware of her condition. Lakshmi and Gundamma coerce Durga and retrieve the money she stole. Bhoopati comes to Durga's rescue but is defeated by Anji in a duel and is hospitalised.|$|E

5|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were unable}} to start a fire using {{friction}} due to the thin air at that altitude, and sent for matches. By this time, the naval officers and Hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters, so sailors and marines were ordered from the ships. Dr. Judd traveled between the summit and the Recruiting Station to tend the many who suffered from altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on the rough rock. Christmas Day was spent building rock walls around the camp <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> protection from the high winds and blowing snow. It took another week to bring all the equipment to the summit, including a pendulum designed for measuring slight variations in gravity.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

However, by the time he made his return to first team action, manager Jim Magilton had left the club and been replaced by Roy Keane. Smith featured heavily in Keane's early games as Ipswich manager, with the former Manchester United midfielder opting <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> of the club's younger talent – such as Connor Wickham and Smith – a chance to prove themselves.|$|E
25|$|The body or {{basket of}} the chariot rested {{directly}} on the axle (called beam) connecting the two wheels. There was no suspension, making this an uncomfortable form of transport. At the front and sides of the basket was a semicircular guard about 3ft (1 m) high, <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> protection from enemy attack. At the back the basket was open, {{making it easy to}} mount and dismount. There was no seat, and generally only enough room for the driver and one passenger.|$|E
25|$|In a {{different}} direction, for compact operators on a Banach space, a result {{analogous to the}} Jordan normal form holds. One restricts to compact operators because every point x in the spectrum of a compact operator T, the only exception being when x is the limit point of the spectrum, is an eigenvalue. This is not true for bounded operators in general. <b>To</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> idea of this generalization, we first reformulate the Jordan decomposition {{in the language of}} functional analysis.|$|E

The east boundary saw significant changes as it was pushed eastward to 66 Street into Edmonton-Beverly-Clareview and Edmonton-Manning {{as far north as}} 144 Avenue from the railway tracks at 127 Street. The east boundary with Edmonton-Manning was also realigned to run on 66 Street north of 153 Avenue <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> land to Manning.|$|E

England won the ODI series 2-0 and tied the Twenty20 series 1-1, with international debuts for Natalie Sciver, Lauren Winfield and Natasha Farrant.|$|E
25|$|In early December 2010, {{members of}} the Christianity subreddit decided to hold a fundraiser and later {{members of the}} atheism subreddit decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> {{friendly}} competition, cross-promoting fundraising drives for Doctors Without Borders and World Vision's Clean Water Fund, respectively. Later, the Islam subreddit joined in, raising money for Islamic Relief. In less than a week, the three communities (as well as the Reddit community at large) raised over $50,000. Most of this was raised by the atheism subreddit, though the smaller Christianity subreddit had a higher average donation amount per subscriber. A similar donation drive in 2011 saw the atheism subreddit raise over $200,000 for charity.|$|E
