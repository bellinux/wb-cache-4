5|$|In {{the northwestern}} Caribbean, Hattie passed close to Grand Cayman with heavy rainfall. At least 11.5inches (292mm) of rain were {{reported}} on the island, including 7.8inches (198mm) in six hours.

5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> {{that had}} fallen, the drivers {{went out on}} track on {{intermediate}} tyres {{at the beginning of}} Q3. On these tyres, Hamilton set the fastest time, followed by Button and Ricciardo. The track dried quickly however, and soon the cars returned to the pit lane to switch to slick tyres. Hülkenberg twice set the fastest time, but was beaten to pole position by Hamilton. Rosberg went faster as well, but lost his second place on the grid to Hülkenberg due to his five-place grid penalty. Vettel went fourth fastest, but was relegated as well, handing third on the grid to Button, who had set the fifth fastest time. Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Valtteri Bottas, Verstappen and Felipe Massa rounded up the top ten. It was Hülkenberg's second front row start of his career, the first having been his pole position at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E

25|$|Damascus has a cold {{desert climate}} (BWk) in Köppen-Geiger system, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> shadow {{effect of the}} Anti-Lebanon {{mountains}} and the prevailing ocean currents. Summers are dry and hot with less humidity. Winters are cool and somewhat rainy; snowfall is infrequent. Annual rainfall is around , occurring from October to May.|$|E
50|$|The spring weather {{preceding}} the flooding had been wet in the region, and May 2013 {{had been one}} of the three wettest in the last 156 years in Austria, together with the years 1962 and 1965. Austria saw twice as much rainfall as average during the month, resulting in the ground in the region becoming saturated.

Once again though the only winner on day three was the weather {{with much of the}} day lost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the {{winemaking}} {{regions of}} the Piedmont and Bordeaux are very close in latitude, only the summertime temperatures are similar: the Piedmont wine region has a colder, continental winter climate, and significantly lower rainfall due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> shadow effect of the Alps. Vineyards are typically planted on hillsides altitudes between 490–1150ft (150-400 metre). The warmer south facing slopes are mainly used for Nebbiolo or Barbera while the cooler sites are planted with Dolcetto or Moscato.|$|E

25|$|Silent Valley gets copious {{amounts of}} {{rainfall}} during the monsoons, {{but the actual}} amount varies within the region due to the varied topography. In general, rainfall is higher at higher altitudes and decreases from the west to the east due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> shadow effect. Eighty per cent of the rainfall occurs during the south-west monsoon between June and September. The park also receives {{a significant amount of}} rainfall during the north-east monsoon between October and November.|$|E
25|$|The {{atmosphere}} is severely dry {{nine months of}} the year, and average annual snowfall is only , due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> shadow effect.

The Indian monsoon exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures {{in the summer and}} intense cold in the winter.|$|E

The largest of these, Cenote Sagrado (also known as the Well of Sacrifice), was where many victims were cast as an offering <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> god Chaac. A 2007 study of remains taken from this cenote found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.|$|E

The staff eventually choose their former import Arizona Reid as a last-minute replacement for Wilkerson.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the season, Coca-Cola {{assigned}} then-assistant coach Kenneth Duremdes to his first Head Coaching duties with the Tigers. After a few games, Duremdes was then assigned as the Team Manager and Assistant Coach Bo Perasol took over as head coach. After a dismal start in the Philippine Cup campaign, the Tigers made a move by getting Burger King stalwart Gary David alongside Chico Lanete, while giving up all-around Guard Alex Cabagnot and Wesley Gonzales in a deal. After the trade, they then went on to win 4 straight games, but still ended up in the 7th seed of the team standings. The Tigers defeated Burger King in their first Wildcard match before bowing out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rain</b> or Shine Elasto Painters in the next game.|$|E
25|$|England {{once again}} won the toss and chose to bat {{in the second}} Test, but in {{contrast}} to the first match, they made few runs. Only three batsmen reached double figures—Tom Hayward, Johnny Tyldesley and George Hirst—as Faulkner took six wickets for the tourists, getting prodigious turn in both directions with his spin bowling. The pitch was soft and difficult to bat on due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> and after lunch nine of England's wickets were lost in under an hour. England were weakened due to their decision to pick a pace bowler, Neville Knox, over a spinner, Jack Crawford, who would have been better suited to the conditions. Accordingly, England relied on Colin Blythe, who bowled for the entire innings and collected eight wickets. Nevertheless, partially due to a number of dropped catches, South Africa scored 110 to lead by 34 runs.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh' {{chances of}} {{reaching}} the Super Eights by means of net run rate diminished after a 198-run defeat to Sri Lanka, the third-heaviest of their history and the largest since their 200-run defeat to India at the 2003 TVS Cup. Indeed, it was only due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> during Bangladesh' innings and the consequently readjusted target that the margin of victory was smaller; Bangladesh were bowled out for 112, with all the Sri Lankan bowlers except Sanath Jayasuriya taking wickets, but Jayasuriya had already contributed with seven sixes in his twenty-fourth One-day International century as Sri Lanka totalled 318 for four. Spinners Mohammad Rafique and Abdur Razzak {{were the only ones}} to keep the economy rate below five an over, while for Sri Lanka only Russel Arnold cost more than five an over. Four Sri Lankan batsmen outscored Bangladesh' top-scoring batsman, Ashraful, who made 45 not out from number seven.|$|E
25|$|When nests {{are also}} found built among the {{branches}} of various trees, {{the architecture of the}} nest is changed because of the substrate to which it has to attach. The most noticeable difference is that R. romandi nests connected to branches are sphericsl rather than hemispherical and mostly double-layered, with only a few single-layered sections. The envelope is not a gray color, but instead a creamy brown, suggesting differences in the plants available to construct the nest. The saliva coating of the envelope is thicker when built in trees, suggesting that the thickness of the coat might be related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> exposure of the nest location. Instead of a roof, the nests often use leaves from the tree, incorporated into the envelope, to cover the top of the nest. The number of combs in a branch-built nest is almost double that of one built on a solid surface, however they are much more irregular in shape and arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The three match test series started poorly for England, as {{they lost}} the match by 88 runs. Despite England holding a first innings lead of almost a hundred, Sri Lanka posted 442/8 in the second innings, putting them on the front foot. England could only make 261 in their second innings, thus losing the match by 88 runs. In the second test Stuart Broad was given his debut. The pitch suited batsmen, with bowlers {{struggling}} to make an impact. England posted 351 in their first innings, only for Sri Lanka to make 548 in reply. The game ended in a draw with England finishing on 250/3. The second match was interrupted by rain, although Sri Lanka posted 499 in their first innings. England were dismissed for just 81 in reply, putting them {{in danger of losing}} the match. However, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> England survived, finishing on 251/6. England lost the series 2-1, meaning they had now lost their previous two test series.|$|E
