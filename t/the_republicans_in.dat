5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other {{to make the first}} move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> 1912, and did not speak of himself as a candidate.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{part of his}} career, Tzara {{combined}} his humanist and anti-fascist perspective with a communist vision, joining <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II, and serving a term in the National Assembly. Having spoken in favor of liberalization in the People's Republic of Hungary just before the Revolution of 1956, he distanced himself from the French Communist Party, {{of which he was}} by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the Algerian War.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, with <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the majority, McKinley sought {{election}} as Speaker of the House. He failed {{to gain the}} post, which went to Thomas B. Reed of Maine; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods.|$|E
50|$|William J. Pape became {{sole owner}} of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> 1910 and in 1922 {{acquired}} the Waterbury American. The two newspapers {{continued to be}} published - <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and the American in the afternoon. <b>The</b> Sunday <b>Republican</b> first appeared on October 7, 1906 and continues publication today.|$|R

Hill, ran <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> primary <b>in</b> Connecticut. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> nominee <b>in</b> Rhode Island challenged Democratic United States Senator Sheldon Whitehouse while <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nominee <b>in</b> Connecticut ran for an open seat being vacated by independent United States Senator Joseph Lieberman.|$|R
50|$|Lawson {{used the}} money saved while running her {{boarding}} houses to purchase shares in the radical pro-federation newspaper <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> 1887. She and son Henry edited <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> 1887-88, which was printed on an old press <b>in</b> Louisa's cottage. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> called for an Australian republic uniting under 'the flag of a Federated Australia, the Great Republic of the Southern Seas'. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> {{was replaced by the}} Nationalist, but it lasted two issues.|$|R
5|$|The mid-term {{elections}} in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor {{with the administration}} over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.|$|E
5|$|Due {{in large}} part to surplus {{revenues}} from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. The spending issue in part led to the defeat of <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the 1890 mid-term elections. Cleveland defeated Harrison for re-election in 1892, due to the growing unpopularity of the high tariff and high federal spending. Harrison returned to private life and his law practice in Indianapolis. In 1899 Harrison represented the Republic of Venezuela in their British Guiana boundary dispute against the United Kingdom. Harrison traveled to the court of Paris as part of the case and after a brief stay returned to Indianapolis. He died at his home in Indianapolis in 1901 of complications from influenza. Although many have praised Harrison's commitment to African Americans' voting rights, scholars and historians generally regard his administration as below-average, and rank him in the bottom half among U.S. presidents. Historians, however, have not questioned Harrison's commitment to personal and official integrity.|$|E
5|$|Hoosiers {{voted in}} favor of <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> 1860, and in January 1861, Indiana's newly elected {{lieutenant}} governor, Oliver P. Morton, became governor after Henry Smith Lane resigned from the office to take a vacant seat in the U.S. Senate. Hoosiers also helped Abraham Lincoln win the presidency in the 1860 election and {{voted in favor}} of his re-election in 1864. Although Lincoln won only 40 percent of the country's popular vote in the U.S. presidential election in 1860, he earned Indiana's 13 electoral votes with 51.09 percent of its popular vote, compared to Stephen Douglas's 42.44 percent, John Breckenridge's 4.52 percent, and John Bell's 1.95 percent. In the 1864 presidential election, Lincoln once again carried the state, this time by a wider margin, earning Indiana's electoral votes with 53.6 percent of the state's popular vote compared to George McClellan's 46.4 percent.|$|E

5|$|Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the Assembly's decision and vacate the governorship. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> the legislature obeyed Taylor's orders, while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February 21, 1900, Taylor and Beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of Beckham. Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, {{at that time the}} court of last resort in the state. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court. Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declined to hear the case on May 21, 1900. Taylor's only supporter on the court was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E
5|$|Saudis and Jordanians {{provided}} an active {{support to the}} royalists through {{the first years of}} war. The September 1962 coup d'état in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1. The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to the Republicans, rapidly spiraling the country into a full-scale war, as the Republicans called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North Yemen, the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages. The same day, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known. Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans, the Saudis decided to launch attacks on <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> North Yemen.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{had formed}} a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They {{believed}} that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic {{about the idea of}} African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E

5000|$|In abolitionist, Liberty, and Free Soil {{circles the}} name 'republican' had been bandied {{around for a}} number of years, with even Horace Greeley using the term as early as 1852, and is {{credited}} to christening <b>the</b> name <b>republican</b> <b>in</b> 1854. In addition, Israel Washburn, U.S. congressman from Maine, used <b>the</b> name <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> reference to forming an anti-slavery party, there were private meetings in Crawfordsville, Iowa, Ripon, Wisconsin, Exeter, New Hampshire, and the convention in Jackson, Michigan, which all claim to have first named <b>the</b> party <b>republican</b> <b>in</b> 1854. Research completed by Mrs. Page Johnson in 1976, agrees with the column by R.F. Howard in 1903, that Edwin Hurlbut named <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>in</b> Madison, WI., July 13, 1854. Included in Mrs. Johnson's article is a photo of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> float <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bi-centennial parade in Oconomowoc in 1976, on which is displayed a replica of the handbill which Hurlbut distributed in June 1854, and added signage, [...] "Hurlbut Named Party Republican".|$|R
5|$|Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant, April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was a {{prominent}} United States Army general during the American Civil War and Commanding General {{at the conclusion of}} that war. He was elected as the 18th President of the United States in 1868, serving from 1869 to 1877. As Commanding General, Grant worked closely with President Abraham Lincoln to lead the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy. After Lincoln's assassination, Grant's assignment in implementing Reconstruction often put him at odds with President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor. Twice elected president, Grant led <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African-American citizenship, and support economic prosperity. Grant's presidency has often been criticized for its scandals and for his failure to alleviate the economic depression following the Panic of 1873, but modern scholarship regards him as a president who performed a difficult job with some merit, and took strong action on civil rights for African Americans.|$|E
5|$|McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was {{confident}} of winning an election fought on that question. But it was free silver {{that became the}} issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> power most of the time until 1932.|$|E
5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff {{bill could}} be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.|$|E
