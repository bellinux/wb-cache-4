5|$|By 1 March, over {{two-thirds of}} BuzzFeed users polled responded that <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> {{was white and}} gold.

40|$|We {{develop a}} partial charge-spin {{separation}} fermion-spin theory implemented <b>the</b> gauge invariant <b>dressed</b> holon and spinon. In this novel approach, the physical electron is decoupled as <b>the</b> gauge invariant <b>dressed</b> holon and spinon, with <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> holon behaviors like a spinful fermion, and represents the charge {{degree of freedom}} together with the phase part of the spin degree of freedom, while <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> spinon is a hard-core boson, and represents the amplitude part of the spin degree of freedom, then the electron single occupancy local constraint is satisfied. Within this approach, the charge transport and spin response of the underdoped cuprates is studied. It is shown that the charge transport is mainly governed by the scattering from <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> holons due to <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> spinon fluctuation, while the scattering from <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> spinons due to <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> holon fluctuation dominates the spin response.

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} {{fluctuations}} of <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> sliver solution {{found in a}} previous paper, hep-th/ 0311198, in the operator formulation of Vacuum String Field Theory. We derive the tachyon wave function and then analyze the higher level fluctuations. We show that <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> is responsible for implementing the transversality condition on the massless vector. In order to consistently deal with the singular k = 0 mode we introduce a string midpoint regulator and we show {{that it is possible}} to accommodate all the open string states among the solutions to the linearized equations of motion. We finally show how <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> can give rise to the correct ratio between the energy density of <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> sliver and <b>the</b> brane tension computed via the three–tachyons–coupling. In short, we present strong evidence that <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> slivers are solutions appropriate to represent D–branes. Content...|$|R

40|$|Nosocomial infections {{present a}} growing {{challenge}} in wound care, {{especially in light}} of the rising distribution of multiresistant bacterial strains. Because wounds are an ideal breeding ground for pathogens, special care must be taken in choosing <b>the</b> right <b>dressing.</b> Following <b>the</b> traditional preventive approach, exposure of the nursing staff as well as the wounds to pathogens should be reduced. Dressings allowing a reduced frequency of dressing changes may help accomplish this. During <b>dressing</b> changes <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> should allow for safe handling with a low risk of contamination.

40|$|A {{condensate}} of = 0 partons in the perturbative vacuum {{gives rise}} to a term ∝δ^ 4 (p) in the free PQCD propagators. The leading condensate contribution to the quark propagator can be exactly summed since there is a factor δ^ 4 (p) associated to each loop. We calculate <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> quark propagator in the presence of either a gluon or a quark condensate, for a number of colors N →∞. <b>The</b> <b>dressed</b> quark propagator satisfies a Dyson-Schwinger type equation which can be exactly solved within our framework. In the case of a gluon condensate <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> quark propagator has no pole, hence quarks cannot appear in asymptotic states, and moreover the DS equation has a solution which spontaneously breaks chiral symmetry.
