5|$|By 1964, {{construction}} was underway {{on a new}} expressway leading south from I-490 at <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms to Elmwood Avenue east of Twelve Corners. The highway was completed , at which time NY47 was realigned to follow the Sea Breeze Expressway and the new expressway south through <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms to its end at a partial interchange with Elmwood Avenue (now I-590 exit3). It continued west on Elmwood Avenue to Twelve Corners, where it reconnected to its old alignment at Winton Road.|$|E
5|$|On March18, 1980, the NY47 {{designation}} {{was eliminated}} and split into four other routes. From NY104 in Greece to I-490, NY47 became NY390. The section from I-490 south to NY383 was designated {{as part of}} I-390; however, it would not connect to the existing portion of I-390 south of Rochester until 1981, when the interchange between I-390 and I-590 was completed. The segment of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue north to <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms became part of I-590, which continued southwest along the freeway to Winton Road. From <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms to Lake Ontario, NY47 was redesignated NY590.|$|E
5|$|The four-lane I-590 becomes NY590 upon passing under I-490 at <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms on {{the eastern}} edge of Rochester. It heads {{northeast}} into Brighton and through the remainder of the interchange, passing under the ramp connecting I-490 west to I-590 south, the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision, and the ramps from NY590 south to I-490 in succession before widening to six lanes and turning northward ahead of a diamond interchange with Blossom Road, once designated as NY286A. Between Blossom Road and NY286 (Browncroft Boulevard), NY590 slowly turns to the northwest, passing through densely populated neighborhoods located adjacent to the Rochester–Brighton boundary. It reaches the city line and reenters Rochester upon meeting NY286.|$|E

5|$|The freeway travels due north {{along this}} stretch, flanked {{on both sides}} by {{residential}} neighborhoods separated from I-590 only by sound barriers. Not far {{to the north of}} the intersection with NY31 is exit3, a partial diamond interchange for Elmwood Avenue permitting access from I-590 south and to I-590 north. Prior to 1980, NY47 entered the freeway at this point and followed both I-590 and NY590 north to Sea Breeze. Another partial interchange with Highland Avenue follows at exit4—making the two connections that exit3 omits—before I-590 enters <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms, a complex interchange connecting I-590 to I-490. North of the ramps leading to I-490, I-590 descends northeastward into a cut and passes below both I-490 and NY96 as it becomes NY590, which continues onward toward Sea Breeze.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} I-590 between Winton Road and <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms was {{originally}} {{constructed in the}} 1960s and designated as part of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue northward. In the late 1970s, I-590 was proposed as a designation for the entire southern half of the Outer Loop. Ultimately, it was cut back to its current western terminus at the then-proposed I-390. I-590 was officially assigned in 1980 following the elimination of NY47, and the last segment of the freeway between Winton Road and I-390 was completed by the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} NY590 between <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms and NY104 {{is part of}} the northeastern {{quadrant}} of the Rochester Outer Loop, a series of expressways that form a beltway around the city of Rochester. At NY104, the Outer Loop turns west to follow NY104 through Irondequoit. The Sea Breeze Expressway was built in stages from the 1950s to the 1960s and carried various designations until 1970, when the entirety of the Rochester – Sea Breeze highway was designated as part of NY47. It was redesignated as NY590 in 1980. In the late 2000s, the section of NY590 north of Titus Avenue was reconfigured into a two-lane road named Sea Breeze Drive, and NY590 was truncated to end at Titus Avenue.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms is {{the local}} name for the {{intersection}} of Interstate490 (I-490), I-590, New York State Route590 (NY590), NY96 (East Avenue), and University Avenue {{on the east side}} of Rochester, New York, in the United States. The junction was built during the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Rochester Outer Loop's construction, and rebuilt in the late 1980s to eliminate weaving caused by the interchange's original design. Although the reconstruction eliminated many of the issues, <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms name stuck and is still used locally.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} since the reconstruction, <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms name has {{remained}} in local parlance, typically as a descriptor for the modern junction during traffic reports. Its name is also invoked when other traffic issues in the area are discussed in the local media—such as a lane re-striping on NY590 in Irondequoit that generated a significant amount of controversy in 2010—a reference to the problems that once plagued the 490/590 interchange.|$|E
25|$|HK commercially markets the MK 23 and {{derivatives}} of it, but not {{the complete}} SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included {{as part of its}} entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause <b>the</b> <b>can</b> <b>of</b> the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem.|$|E

25|$|I-490 {{continues}} {{to run in}} the former bed until exit21, where I-490 connects to NY590 and I-590 at an interchange known locally as <b>the</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms. At this point, the former Erie Canal route (now part of I-590) curves southward while I-490 continues eastward into the eastern suburbs of Rochester. Between exits21 and24, I-490 parallels the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision rail line, intersecting NY441, a four-lane divided highway in the process. South of exit25, I-490 traverses the southeastern suburbs of Rochester, passing close to East Rochester, Pittsford and Bushnell's Basin and closely paralleling NY96 on its way toward the Ontario County line. The freeway meets NY96 twice in Perinton and a third time in the Ontario County town of Victor, where I-490 passes along the western fringe of Eastview Mall. I-490 ends a short distance southeast of the third NY96 interchange at Thruway exit45.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Can</b> <b>of</b> Worms at ICI was the {{headline}} in Business & Finance magazine on 8 November 1984. The Insurance Corporation of Ireland (ICI) was a wholly owned subsidiary of AIB when it collapsed in 1985 with losses of over £200 million. When {{it was discovered}} in November 1984 that ICI was operating below the statutory reserve ratio, a request for further capital was made to AIB— ICI had returned a profit of more than £80 million the previous year. This collapse occurred {{at a time of}} deep economic recession in Ireland. The level of Government debt at that time was 116% of GDP. But the Irish taxpayer bailed ICI out of its difficulties. The Irish Government did so to ensure a continuation of the insurance business and to protect policyholders. AIB claimed that it could not resolve the problems of ICI without putting its core banking business in jeopardy. The investment of £85 million by AIB in ICI was written off and the cost to the Irish taxpayer was £400 million.|$|E

500|$|Interstate590 (I-590) is a north–south {{auxiliary}} Interstate Highway {{that serves}} the immediate southeastern suburbs {{of the city of}} Rochester, New York, in the United States.
