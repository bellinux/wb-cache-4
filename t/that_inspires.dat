25|$|Rama is {{especially}} important to Vaishnavism. He is the central figure of the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana, a text historically popular in the South Asian and Southeast Asian cultures.

500|$|Fränger {{believed}} The Garden of Earthly Delights {{was commissioned}} by the order's Grand Master. Later critics have agreed that, because of their obscure complexity, Bosch's [...] "altarpieces" [...] {{may well have been}} commissioned for non-devotional purposes. The Homines intelligentia cult sought to regain the innocent sexuality enjoyed by Adam and Eve before the Fall. Fränger writes that the figures in Bosch's work [...] "are peacefully frolicking about the tranquil garden in vegetative innocence, at one with animals and plants and the sexuality <b>that</b> <b>inspires</b> them seems to be pure joy, pure bliss." [...] Fränger argued against the notion that the hellscape shows the retribution handed down for sins committed in the center panel. Fränger saw the figures in the garden as peaceful, naive, and innocent in expressing their sexuality, and at one with nature. In contrast, those being punished in Hell comprise [...] "musicians, gamblers, desecrators of judgment and punishment".|$|E

500|$|The film conveys {{what some}} viewers have {{described}} as {{a sense of the}} sublime and numinous. Roger Ebert writes in his essay on 2001 in The Great Movies: [...] In a book on architecture, Gregory Caicco writes that Space Odyssey illustrates how our quest for space is motivated by two contradictory desires, a [...] "desire for the sublime" [...] characterized by a need to encounter something totally other than ourselves—"something numinous"—and the conflicting desire for a beauty that makes us feel no longer [...] "lost in space," [...] but at home. Similarly, an article in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, titled [...] "Sense of Wonder," [...] describes how 2001 creates a [...] "numinous sense of wonder" [...] by portraying a universe <b>that</b> <b>inspires</b> a sense of awe, which {{at the same time we}} feel we can understand. Christopher Palmer wrote that there exists in the film a coexistence of [...] "the sublime and the banal," [...] as the film implies that to get into space, mankind had to suspend the [...] "sense of wonder" [...] that motivated him to explore space to begin with.|$|E

This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely {{want to be able to}} step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music <b>that</b> <b>inspires</b> her.

500|$|Hill {{has been}} {{credited}} with bringing many women into rock climbing. The 1980s saw a large influx of women into the sport, in part because more women were visible in it {{and in part because}} Title IX funding mandated equal access for boys and girls to athletic programs in public schools. In answer to a question about her position as a role model for women climbers, Hill responded that she felt [...] "responsible to communicate something that touches people, <b>that</b> <b>inspires</b> them, that gives them a sense of passion". Climber John Long explains that Hill [...] "was a prodigy and everyone knew as much... Twenty years ago, no female had ever climbed remotely as well as the best guys, so when Lynn began dusting us off—which she did with maddening frequency—folks offered up all kinds of fatuous explanations. Some diehards refused to believe a woman, and a five-foot article at that, could possibly be so good. Out at Josh, it was said Lynn shone owing to quartz monzonite's superior friction, which catered to her bantam weight. In Yosemite, her success apparently hinged on midget hands, which fit wonderfully into the infernal thin cracks. On limestone, she could plug three fingers into pockets where the rest of us managed two. In the desert Southwest, she enjoyed an alliance with coyotes—or maybe shape-shifters. Even after a heap of World Cup victories, it still took the climbing world an age to accept Lynn as the Chosen One, and perhaps her legacy was never established, once and for all, till she free climbed the Nose." ...|$|E

500|$|Following the {{appropriation}} of the hymn in secular music, [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] became such an icon in American culture {{that it has been}} used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns, placing it in danger of becoming a cliché. It has been mass-produced on souvenirs, lent its name to a Superman villain, appeared on The Simpsons to demonstrate the redemption of a murderous character named Sideshow Bob, incorporated into Hare Krishna chants and adapted for Wicca ceremonies. It can also be sung to the theme from The Mickey Mouse Club, as Garrison Keillor has observed. The hymn has been employed in several films, including Alice's Restaurant, Coal Miner's Daughter, and Silkwood. It is referenced in the 2006 film Amazing Grace, which highlights Newton's influence on the leading British abolitionist William Wilberforce, and in the upcoming film biography of Newton, Newton's Grace. The 1982 science fiction film [...] used [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] amid a context of Christian symbolism, to memorialize Mr. Spock following his death, but more practically, because the song has become [...] "instantly recognizable to many in the audience as music that sounds appropriate for a funeral" [...] according to a Star Trek scholar. Since 1954, when an organ instrumental of [...] "New Britain" [...] became a bestseller, [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] has been associated with funerals and memorial services. It has become a song <b>that</b> <b>inspires</b> hope in the wake of tragedy, becoming a sort of [...] "spiritual national anthem" [...] according to authors Mary Rourke and Emily Gwathmey. For example, President Barack Obama recited and then sang the hymn at the memorial service for Clementa Pinckney, one of the victims of the 2015 Charleston church shooting.|$|E

2500|$|As {{all levels}} of Creation are {{constructed}} around the 10 sefirot, their names in Kabbalah describe the particular role each plays in forming reality.

While the band's second album - Payin' the Dues - was in similar style as their debut album it also displayed a tighter musicianship and songwriting technique as well as keyboards by Anders Lindström. Grande Rock was the first studio album to be recorded without original guitarist Dregen and was {{a departure from the}} band's Detroit rock influenced sound to a more 1970's rock sound. The band continued to evolve their sound throughout their career, while Nicke Andersson claims that all of their music is based around three chords and a chorus the band had no interest in repeating themselves. On the band's later releases, Andersson's vocals incorporated soul influences from his and Scott Morgans sideproject The Solution. The Hellacopters also recorded many cover songs throughout their career of songs from bands and artist such as Radio Birdman, Misfits, Smokey Robinson, Nationalteatern, Alice Cooper, The Nomads, April Stevens, Sonic's Rendezvous Band, The Dictators, Love and others. However Andersson asserts that {{there is a difference between}} the music <b>that</b> <b>inspires</b> him and the music that has an influence on his music, Andersson has mentioned country music artist Guy Clark as an artist <b>that</b> <b>inspires</b> his songwriting without affecting the band's sound.|$|E
