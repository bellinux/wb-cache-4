5|$|Considering the {{lopsided}} {{score of}} the series, historians such as Paul Kitchen question why Dawson City was even granted a chance at the Cup. Dawson City had won no championships and {{did not belong to}} any recognized senior league. While team official Weldy Young knew Stanley Cup trustee P. D. Ross personally through their joint connection with the club, {{it may have been the}} political connections that Joe Boyle had with the government Interior Minister of the time, Clifford Sifton, <b>that</b> <b>got</b> Dawson City the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{fire was}} caused by a hunter's illegal fire <b>that</b> <b>got</b> out of control, and it was named for its {{proximity}} to the Rim of the World vista point, a scenic overlook on Highway 120 leading up to Yosemite. A total of eleven residences, three commercial structures, and 98 outbuildings were destroyed in the fire. A total of ten injuries from the wildfire were also reported, but no firefighters were killed during the suppression efforts which cost more than $127 million (2013 USD).|$|E
5|$|Bonds {{resumed his}} {{march to the}} all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately {{followed}} by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment <b>that</b> <b>got</b> him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game, Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} draft <b>that</b> <b>got</b> the film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside. Production {{was to begin}} {{at the start of}} 2009, but was delayed while the script was {{completely}} re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present, leaving behind much of the book's premise to make it more of an action film. In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now had nothing in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.|$|E

5|$|His role in The Widowmaker lead to {{him being}} offered and taking many obsessive {{character}} roles; he played {{police officers in}} Black and Blue, Framed, Between the Lines and Out of the Blue, and soldier Andy McNab in The One <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> Away (1996). Morrissey first met screenwriter Peter Bowker when he played Detective Sergeant Jim Llewyn in the second series of Bowker's Out of the Blue. In 1994, he played customs officer Gerry Birch in the first series of The Knock, and Stephen Finney in the six-part ITV series Finney. In Finney, Morrissey assumed the role originated by Sting in Stormy Monday (Mike Figgis, 1988). He was the first choice for the part and {{had to learn to}} play the double bass.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, BK {{introduced}} its BK Baguette line of sandwiches designed {{to replace the}} Chicken Whopper. The sandwiches were introduced {{at the insistence of}} the new CEO, former Darden Restaurants executive Bradley (Brad) Blum, shortly after the company was acquired by TPG Capital in 2002. The sandwiches were designed to be a lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 or fewer calories. The line was a health conscious oriented product <b>that</b> <b>got</b> its taste from ingredients instead of fat. They were formally introduced in 2004 as its BK Baguette line of sandwiches, that replacing the Chicken Whopper sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Parker {{played the}} male lead in Rome & Jewel, a hip-hop take on Romeo and Juliet <b>that</b> <b>got</b> mothballed and re-released in 2008. Parker's title character, who is {{supposed}} to be the modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both tenderness and toughness. Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him but very familiar to the audience.|$|E

5|$|In June 2001, Combs ended Bad Boy Entertainment's {{joint venture}} with Arista Records, gaining full control of Bad Boy, its catalogue, and its roster of artists. The Saga Continues..., {{released}} on July 10 in North America, was the last studio album released by the joint venture. The album reached number 2 on the Billboard 200 and the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums charts, and was eventually certified Platinum. It is the only studio album under the P. Diddy name, and the first album by Sean Combs not to feature any guest appearances by Jay-Z or Lil Kim. Combs was {{executive producer of the}} reality TV show Making the Band, which appeared on MTV from 2002 to 2009. The show involved interviewing candidates and creating musical acts that would then enter the music business. Acts <b>that</b> <b>got</b> their start this way include Da Band, Danity Kane, Day26, and Donnie Klang.|$|E

5|$|The primary storyline {{heading into}} Genesis {{involved}} the TNA World Heavyweight Championship held by then-champion Kurt Angle.

The lead-up to this decision began at TNA's previous PPV event Bound for Glory on October 12. There, Sting defeated Angle to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the October 25 episode of Impact!, with help from Nash, Angle defeated Sting to win back the title. Due to the controversial circumstances, Cornette announced that Angle would defend the title in a tag team match, in which the person <b>that</b> <b>got</b> the pinfall or submission would win the title.|$|E

5|$|The rivalry {{intensified}} {{after the}} 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, {{where the two}} drivers had an agreement that neither would get in each other's way to the first corner (cf. 1982 San Marino Grand Prix). At the start, Senna got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in Senna's way. Gerhard Berger's crash on lap four stopped the race. At the restart, it was Prost this time <b>that</b> <b>got</b> away the better of the two; but Senna forced his way past Prost in the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement {{at the start of}} the race, leaving the Frenchman furious with Senna. Senna argued it was the restart. Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring Senna because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda, so he announced mid-season that he had signed to race for Ferrari the following season.|$|E
5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but <b>that</b> <b>got</b> harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
5|$|Having blocked Jourdan, Archduke Charles {{began moving}} troops south {{to oppose the}} Army of Rhin-et-Moselle as early as 21 June. He {{received}} the news that Moreau was across the Rhine on the 26th. Leaving 25,351 foot and 10,933 horse under Wartensleben and 27,000 more around Mainz, the archduke raced south. The last units of the Moreau's army made it across the Rhine on 29 June, though Delaborde remained guarding {{the west bank of}} the Rhine for a time. For a few days the French enjoyed a numerical superiority of 30,000 to 18,000 over their opponents. Moreau then made the remarkable decision to switch the positions of two of his wings; Desaix now led the Left Wing while Saint-Cyr commanded the Center. He also reorganized his army, reassigning some regiments <b>that</b> <b>got</b> lost in the confusion of the river crossing. Army of Rhin-et-Moselle expanded its bridgehead in a semicircle. Desaix moved downstream (north), Ferino moved upstream (south) and Saint-Cyr operated in the hills, ready to support either wing. The French irruption caused Fröhlich and Condé to retreat up the Rhine and Kinzig Rivers while Sztáray and the Swabians fell back to Freudenstadt.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment <b>that</b> <b>got</b> stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E
5|$|Pattillo Higgins {{was born}} to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He {{attended}} school {{until he reached the}} fourth grade, after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father’s direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans. When he was seventeen, he pulled a prank on a black Baptist church <b>that</b> <b>got</b> the attention of a sheriff deputy. The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later {{turn out to be a}} fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by a jury that perceived his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a logger along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm. It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as to dip the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes <b>that</b> <b>got</b> caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E
