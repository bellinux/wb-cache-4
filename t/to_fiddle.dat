2500|$|The term STV in Australia {{refers to}} the Senate electoral system, a variant of Hare-Clark {{characterized}} by the [...] "above the line" [...] group voting ticket, a party list option. [...] It {{is used in the}} Australian upper house, the Senate, and some state upper houses. [...] Due to the number of preferences that are compulsory if a vote for candidates (below-the-line) is to be valid for the Senate a minimum of 90% of candidates must be scored, in 2013 in New South Wales that meant writing 99 preferences on the ballot 95% and more of voters use the above-the-line option, making the system, in all but name, a party list system. [...] Parties determine the order in which candidates are elected and also control transfers to other lists and this has led to anomalies: preference deals between parties, and [...] "micro parties" [...] which rely entirely on these deals. [...] Additionally, independent candidates are unelectable unless they form, or join, a group above-the-line. [...] Concerning the development of STV in Australia researchers have observed: [...] "... we see real evidence {{of the extent to which}} Australian politicians, particularly at national levels, are prone <b>to</b> <b>fiddle</b> with the electoral system".|$|E
