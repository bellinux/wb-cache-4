5|$|A cold front's {{location}} is at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can {{move up to}} {{twice as fast as}} warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the cooler air mass.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightest}} and longest arc was Fraternité; {{the faintest}} was Courage.

5|$|Downbursts.

40|$|Some general {{guidelines}} that are applicable to grit-type boundary-layer- I transition trips located near <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> model components are pre- sented. Conditions that permit transition {{to be fixed}} at the roughness at subsonic and supersonic speeds without a resultant grit drag are reviewed. In certain cases in which grit drag is unavoidable, two methods- the choice of which depends upon {{the characteristics of the}} wind tunnel used- for correcting for such drag are discussed. At hypersonic speeds _ the problem of fixing boundary-layer transition near <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model components with-out distorting the turbulent-boundary-layer velocity profile has not been solved...|$|R
5|$|Warm fronts are at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, {{which is located}} on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative camber which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
50|$|The OIAV {{would not}} have to achieve {{supersonic}} speeds while ascending. This would minimize drag and put less stress on <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft.. also having the advantage of minimizing vibrations.

50|$|In-flight ice buildups {{are most}} {{frequent}} on <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings, tail and engines (including the propellers or fan blades). Lower speed aircraft frequently use pneumatic de-icing boots on <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> wings and tail for in-flight de-icing. The rubber coverings are periodically inflated, causing ice {{to crack and}} flake off. Once the system is activated by the pilot, the inflation/deflation cycle is automatically controlled. In the past, it was thought such systems can be defeated if they are inflated prematurely; if the pilot did not allow a fairly thick layer of ice to form before inflating the boots, the boots would merely create a gap between <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and <b>the</b> formed ice. Recent research shows “bridging” does not occur with modern boots.|$|R
40|$|Ena/VASP {{proteins}} {{are associated}} with cell-cell junctions in cultured mammalian cells [1] and Drosophila epithelia [2, 3], but they have only been extensively studied at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> migratory fibroblasts, where they modulate <b>the</b> protrusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> [4]. They act by regulating actin-filament geometry, antagonizing the effects of actin-capping protein [5]. Embryos lacking the C. elegans Ena/VASP, UNC- 34, display subtle defects in <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> migrating epidermal cells but undergo normal epidermal morphogenesis. In contrast, embryos lacking both UNC- 34 and the C. elegans N-WASP homolog have severe defects in epidermal morphogenesis, suggesting that they have parallel roles in coordinating cell behavior. GFP-tagged UNC- 34 localizes to <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> migrating epidermal cells, becoming redistributed to new junctions that form during epidermal-sheet sealing. Consistent with this, UNC- 34 contributes {{to the formation of}} cadherin-based junctions. The junctional localization of UNC- 34 is independent of proteins involved in Ena/VASP localization in other experimental systems; instead, junctional distribution depends upon the junctional protein AJM- 1. We also show that Abelson tyrosine kinase, a major regulator of Enabled in Drosophila, is not required for UNC- 34 /Ena function in epithelia. Instead, our data suggest that Abelson kinase acts in parallel to UNC- 34 /Ena, antagonizing its function...|$|R

5|$|The {{tawny owl}} flies with long glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and {{typically}} at a greater height. The {{flight of the}} tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe on <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the outer primaries. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; great grey, eagle and Ural owls are similar in shape, but much larger.|$|E
5|$|Once {{north of}} Bermuda, Igor began to undergo an extratropical {{transition}} {{as it turned}} northeastward. Though deep convection was no longer consistently over its center, data from Hurricane Hunters continued to support hurricane intensity. Accelerating along <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a trough over the Canadian Maritimes, the storm intensified within a baroclinic zone as it neared Newfoundland. The interaction between these two systems allowed the hurricane to strengthen despite moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures. Around 1500UTC on September21, Igor made landfall near Cape Race, with winds of 85mph (140km/h), slightly higher than several hours earlier. Shortly thereafter, the storm completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone, as it became fully embedded within the baroclinic zone. After turning northwestward between Labrador and Greenland, the remnants of Igor were absorbed by another extratropical cyclone on September23, within the Labrador Sea.|$|E
