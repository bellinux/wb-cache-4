5|$|Another {{stress test}} for German–Japanese {{relations}} was the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/05, during which Germany strongly supported Russia. This circumstance triggered the Japanese foreign ministry <b>to</b> <b>proclaim</b> that any ship delivering coal to Russian vessels within {{the war zone}} would be sunk. After the Russo-Japanese War, Germany insisted on reciprocity in the exchange of military officers and students, and in the following years, several German military officers were sent to Japan to study the Japanese military, which, after its victory over the tsarist army became a promising organization to study. However, Japan's growing power and influence also caused increased distrust on the German side.|$|E
5|$|By 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt {{more than}} doubled the forest reserve acreage, and Congress responded by {{limiting}} the President’s ability <b>to</b> <b>proclaim</b> new reserves. The National Forest System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new additions to the system {{under the authority of}} the Weeks Act.

5|$|In {{the case}} of a demise of the Crown, the Privy Council—together with the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London as well as representatives of Commonwealth realms—makes a {{proclamation}} declaring the accession of the new sovereign and receives an oath from the new monarch relating to the security of the Church of Scotland, as required by law. It is also customary for the new sovereign to make an allocution to the Privy Council on that occasion, and this Sovereign's Speech is formally published in The London Gazette. Any such Special Assembly of the Privy Council, convened <b>to</b> <b>proclaim</b> the accession of a new sovereign and witness the monarch's statutory oath, is known as an Accession Council. The last such meetings were held on 6 and 8 February 1952: as Elizabeth II was abroad when the last demise of the Crown took place, the Accession Council met twice, once <b>to</b> <b>proclaim</b> the sovereign (meeting of 6 February 1952), and then again after the new queen had returned to Britain, to receive from her the oath required by statute (meeting of 8 February 1952).|$|E

Meckiff did not bat in the second innings of the weather-interrupted match; Australia declared at 1/144 before South Africa reached 1/13 when the match ended as a draw. After his single over, Meckiff's participation in the match was limited to his fielding, during which he caught Goddard from the bowling of Benaud in the South African first innings. He retired from all forms of cricket {{at the end of}} the game, but continued <b>to</b> <b>proclaim</b> that his bowling action was fair.|$|E

However, Ladislaus, who had always been partial towards his Cuman subjects, was assassinated by three Cumans, named Árbóc, Törtel, and Kemence, at the castle of Körösszeg (now Cheresig in Romania) on 10 July 1290. Mizse and the Cuman Nicholas, who was the brother of Ladislaus's Cuman lover, took vengeance for Ladislaus's death, slaughtering the murderers.|$|E
5|$|The coin was {{probably}} struck at Canterbury {{in the late}} 6th century, most likely between 578 and 589.

The coin is the oldest surviving example of Anglo-Saxon coinage. The design of the figured side has some affinities with Merovingian and Visigothic coins, but the side with the cross has few known predecessors in coinage, and is the first northern European depiction of a patriarchal cross in any medium.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in Hong Kong in 1992 to generally positive audience reception, {{but it was not}} as commercially successful as Woo's previous action films, such as A Better Tomorrow and The Killer.

It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod <b>to</b> <b>proclaim</b> the decisions of the council. Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after the council with a report on the council and its resolutions. This action may have been taken in response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy. The actions of the council were also gathered into a collection at Cuthbert's command.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, Richards {{continued}} to be champion into 2014. Richards was defeated by Luke Hawx in what was billed as a title match at an East Coast Wrestling Association (ECWA) show in Delaware. However, Extreme Rising said the match was not for the title and {{continued to}} recognize Richards as champion. Despite the statement, Hawx continued <b>to</b> <b>proclaim</b> himself champion and was to defend the title against Matt Hardy on July 20, 2014, at Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW). Extreme Rising owner Steve O'Neill issued a press release denying that they had sanctioned the match. According to Dan McDevitt of MCW, the match {{would be for the}} MCW Heavyweight Championship, but said it was up to Hardy or Hawx to bring other titles. Hawx lost to Hardy in the match, who retained the MCW Championship and obtained the Extreme Rising championship belt – but was not officially recognized as champion.|$|E
5|$|In August, Khánh {{gave himself}} more powers, {{provoking}} widespread riots and demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent in expressing opposition against Khánh. The anarchy forced Khánh {{to back down}} and make concessions, {{and he ended up}} in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had been close to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community. Among those demoted were Generals Phát and Đức, both Catholic. They launched a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khánh before dawn on 13 September. They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station <b>to</b> <b>proclaim</b> the deposing of Khánh's junta. There was little initial reaction from most of the military commanders, including Thi.|$|E
