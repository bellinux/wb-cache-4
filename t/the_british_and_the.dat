5|$|After {{signing the}} Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942 on 26 May Molotov left for Washington, D.C., United States. Molotov met with Franklin D.

Both <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States government, albeit vaguely, promised {{to open up}} a second front against Germany.

5|$|Attempts by anti-war {{officials}} in Istanbul to apologise for the incident were botched by Enver.

The Ottomans did not officially declare war until 11 November.|$|E
5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Assyrians.|$|E

5|$|He {{also took}} {{advantage}} of his travels to deliver fiery political and religious sermons in which he encouraged villagers to organize resistance units to attack the British and Jews. He intensified his agitation and obtained a fatwa from Shaykh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the Mufti of Damascus, which ruled that the struggle against <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Jews was permissible.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, {{there were}} 2,545 Catholic {{households}} {{with a population}} of 10,877. Their population almost doubled by 1818. According to various parish books, Mangalorean Catholics numbered 19,068 in South Canara (12,877 in Mangalore and Bantval, 3,918 in Moolki, 2,273 in Cundapore and Barcoor). Most of the churches which were earlier destroyed by Tipu were rebuilt by 1815.

5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity to form a new coalition against France. Mutual suspicion between <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and keen on revenge, Austria also joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E

5|$|Ramsay Weston Phipps (10 April 1838 – 24 June 1923) was an Irish-born {{military}} {{historian and}} officer in Queen Victoria's Royal Artillery. The son of Pownoll Phipps, {{an officer of}} the British East India Company's army, he was descended from the early settlers of the West Indies; many generations had served in <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> English military. Phipps served in the Crimean War, had a stint of duty at Malta, and helped to repress the Fenian uprising in Canada in 1866.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{was heavily}} {{involved}} in the Napoleonic Wars, participating {{in a number of}} campaigns in Europe (including continuous deployment in the Peninsular War), the Caribbean, North Africa and North America. The war between <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> First French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte stretched around the world; at its peak in 1813, the regular army contained over 250,000 men. A coalition of Anglo-Dutch and Prussian armies under the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal von Blücher finally defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815.|$|E
5|$|Amid renewed rumours of an {{impending}} Rhodesian UDI, Smith travelled to meet Wilson in London {{at the start}} of October 1965, telling the press that he intended to resolve the independence issue once and for all. Both <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rhodesians were surprised by the large numbers of Britons who came out to support Smith during his visit. Smith accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its Twenty-Four Hours evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked this at the last minute. Following largely abortive talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of these}} disappointments, No. 6 Commando's first major {{action as a}} formed unit came in November 1942 when, along with No. 1 Commando, it formed part of the {{spearhead}} for the Allied landings in Algeria as part of Operation Torch. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Iain McAlpine, the commando embarked upon HMT Awatea in October 1942 in Glasgow along with some United States Army Rangers that were also {{taking part in the}} operation. Tensions were high between <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Vichy French at this time because of a number of clashes and as a result the decision was made for the commandos to be equipped with American weapons and uniforms in an effort to placate the defenders.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a dispute}} between the Malays and the Bugis, the Johor-Riau Empire was split in 1819 with the {{mainland}} Johor Sultanate came {{under the control of}} Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim while the Riau-Lingga Sultanate came {{under the control of the}} Bugis. The Temenggong intended to create a new administration centre for the Johor Sultanate to create a dynasty under the entity of Temenggong. As the Temenggong already had a close relationship with <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British intended to have control over trade activities in Singapore, a treaty was signed between Sultan Ali and Temenggong Ibrahim in Singapore on 10 March 1855. According to the treaty, Ali would be crowned as the Sultan of Johor and receive $5,000 (in Spanish dollars) with an allowance of $500 per month. In return, Ali was required to cede the sovereignty of the territory of Johor (except Kesang of Muar which would be the only territory under his control) to Temenggong Ibrahim. When both sides agreed on Temenggong acquiring the territory, he renamed it Iskandar Puteri and began to administer it from Telok Blangah in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolution, {{the road}} was an {{important}} artery over which <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> colonists fought. In January 1777, the colonists brought a cannon {{to the top of}} a hill and fired at the British. The hill, now inside Woodlawn Cemetery, was locally called Gun Hill afterwards. The road was known as Kingsbridge Road (part of the original Boston Post Road) until 1875, when it was renamed Gun Hill Road. It did not originally extend east of White Plains Road but was extended by segments to the Hutchinson River, by 1938.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Perseus {{was fitted}} with an {{experimental}} steam catapult. The catapult {{was placed on}} top of the carrier's existing flight deck and the deckhouse to port of the island was removed to accommodate it. Some 1,560 launches were made by the catapult, beginning with over 1,000 wheeled dead-loads, of gradually increasing weight, and moving on to with unmanned aircraft with their wings truncated to reduce their ability to glide. The final tests were made by manned aircraft of every type flown by the Fleet Air Arm. After this, the ship arrived in Philadelphia on 14 January 1952 to demonstrate the catapult to the United States Navy. Between them, some 127 launches of manned aircraft were made by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Americans. Perseus arrived back at Portsmouth on 21 March and had the catapult removed. All of her remaining maintenance equipment was removed and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier.|$|E
5|$|In August 1814, British forces {{attacked}} Washington, D.C. {{and burned}} the White House. Congress formed {{a committee to}} investigate the circumstances that allowed Washington to be captured. Johnson chaired this committee, and delivered its final report. After the sacking of Washington, the tide of battle turned against <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Ghent ended the war even as Johnson prepared to return to Kentucky to raise another military unit. With {{the end of the}} war, he turned his legislative attention to issues such as securing pensions for widows and orphans and funding internal improvements in the West.|$|E
5|$|In spring, 1813, {{the army}} {{returned}} to the offensive, leaving Portugal and marching northwards through Spain to Vitoria where the French stood in preparation for battle, which took place on 21 June. The Light Division held {{the centre of the}} Allied line, and took the bridges of Villodas and Tres Puentes. The battle proved an overwhelming victory for <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following day the 1/52nd, with the Light Division, were sent in pursuit of the retreating French, skirmishing with the enemy rearguard. In August, volunteers from the 1/52nd were involved in the storming of San Sebastian. The 1/52nd crossed into France on 7 October, when they stormed redoubts above Vera. The 1/52nd also fought in the battles at Nivelle (November 1813), Nive (December 1813) and Orthes (February 1814). During the battle of Orthes, the 52nd led an assault up the ridge under heavy fire, an advance which was later described by Sir Harry Smith as the most majestic he had ever seen.|$|E

5|$|Mangalore {{developed}} as a port on the Arabian Sea—remaining, to this day, a major port of India. Mangalore's port handles 75 per cent of India's coffee and cashew exports. Mangalore {{is used as a}} staging point for sea traffic along the Malabar Coast. Mangalore was ruled by several major powers, including the Kadambas, Alupas, Vijayanagar Empire, Keladi Nayaks and the Portuguese. The city was a source of contention between <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mysore rulers, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan. Eventually annexed by the British in 1799, Mangalore remained part of the Madras Presidency until India's independence in 1947. The city was unified with the state of Mysore (now called Karnataka) in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The Americans stopped sharing any {{information}} on heavy water production, the method of electromagnetic separation, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of bomb design, or the facts about fast neutron reactions. This was a major disappointment which hindered <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Canadians, who were collaborating on heavy water production and several {{other aspects of the}} research programme. By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States, which slowed down the pace of work there, which had relied on efforts led by British scientists. In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee, which decided that Britain's help would benefit some areas of the project. Chadwick, Penney, Peierls, Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.|$|E
5|$|The British {{arrived in}} the area which would become the modern-day South Africa during the early 18th century, yet {{substantial}} settlement only started end of the 18th century, in the Cape of Good Hope; the British first explored the area for conquests for or related to the Slave Trade. In the late 19th century, the discovery of gold and diamonds further encouraged colonisation of South Africa by <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> population of the British-South Africans rose substantially, although there was fierce rivalry between the British and Afrikaners (descendants of Dutch colonists) in the period known as the Boer Wars. When apartheid first started most British-South Africans were mostly keen on keeping and even strengthening its ties with the United Kingdom. The latest census in South Africa showed that there are almost 2 million British-South Africans; they make up about 40% of the total White South African demographic, and the greatest white British ancestry populations in South Africa are in the KwaZulu-Natal province and {{in cities such as}} Johannesburg and Cape Town.|$|E
