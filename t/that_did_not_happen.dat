5|$|Biographies {{published}} {{after his}} death were typically heavy on eulogy. Theodore Martin's five-volume magnum opus was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it is an accurate and exhaustive account. Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-twentieth-century biographers such as Hector Bolitho and Roger Fulford, who (unlike Strachey) had access to Victoria's journal and letters. Popular myths about Prince Albert—such as the claim that he introduced Christmas trees to Britain—are dismissed by scholars. Recent biographers, such as Stanley Weintraub, portray Albert as a figure in a tragic romance, who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for a lifetime. In the 2009 movie The Young Victoria, Albert, played by Rupert Friend, is made into a heroic character; in the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet—something <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen</b> in real life.|$|E

25|$|In November 2007, Greenpeace filed legal {{motions to}} block the {{construction}} of Angra 3, arguing it was unlawful and unconstitutional. Greenpeace’s lawyer, José Afonso da Silva, issued a legal opinion contending {{that the creation of}} Angra 3 was not a legal act of the executive branch. Da Silva’s legal opinion also affirmed that Articles 21, 49 and 225 of the Constitution required that the construction of a nuclear power plant must be discussed beforehand in the parliament—an action <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the view}} of the State Department under President Harry S Truman, the United States needed to adopt a {{definite}} position on the world scene or fear losing credibility. The emerging doctrine of containment (as opposed to rollback) argued that the United States needed to substantially aid non-communist countries {{to stop the spread of}} Soviet influence. There was also some hope that the Eastern Bloc nations would join the plan, and thus be pulled out of the emerging Soviet bloc, but <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E

25|$|Congregation Mezritch Synagogue – While not an {{individual}} landmark, this building was protected in 2010 {{as part of}} the East Village/Lower East Side Historic District. Due to its status as the area’s last operating neoclassical “tenement synagogue” — named for the fact that it fits miraculously into a narrow mid-block 22-foot wide lot — GVSHP in 2008 asked the LPC to designate it as {{an individual}} landmark.

25|$|Bragg's {{forces were}} {{situated}} with Leonidas Polk's corps {{on the west}} side of the river, and William J. Hardee's men on the east.

Wharton deep into the Union rear. He began moving the bulk of Hardee's corps across the river to his left flank to prepare for the next morning's attack. This left Breckinridge's division in reserve on the east side of the river on the high ground.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, Pope Paul IV issued {{orders to}} have all the conversos in Italy be thrown into the prisons of the Inquisition which he had instituted. Sixty of them, who {{acknowledged}} the Catholic faith as penitents, were transported to the island of Malta; twenty-four, who adhered to Judaism, were publicly burned (May 1556). Those who escaped the Inquisition were received at Pesaro by Guidobaldo II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino. Guidobaldo had hoped to have the Jews and conversos of Turkey select Pesaro as a commercial center; when <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen,</b> he expelled the New Christians from Pesaro and other districts in 1558 (ib. xvi. 61 et seq.).|$|E

Their entries contained blurbs about ways to escape to Mexico, hijacking an aircraft at Denver International Airport and crashing it into a building in New York City (foreshadowing the September 11 attacks by two years), and details about the planned attack. The pair hoped that, after detonating their home-made explosives in the cafeteria at the busiest time of day, killing hundreds of students, they would shoot survivors fleeing from the school. Then, as police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks, and reporters came to the school, bombs set in the boys' cars would detonate, killing these emergency and other personnel. <b>That</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen,</b> since these explosives did not detonate.|$|E

25|$|When Sweden {{finally was}} {{at peace with}} Hanover, Great Britain, Brandenburg-Prussia and Denmark–Norway, she hoped that the anti-Russian sentiments of the Vienna parties and France would culminate in an {{alliance}} which would restore her to her Russian-occupied eastern provinces. Yet, primarily due to internal conflicts in Great Britain and France, <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b> Therefore, the war was finally concluded by the Treaty of Nystad between Russia and Sweden in Uusikaupunki (Nystad) on 30 August 1721 (OS). Finland was returned to Sweden, while Swedish Estonia, Livonia, Ingria, Kexholm and the bulk of Karelia were ceded to Russia. Sweden's dissatisfaction with the result led to fruitless attempts at recovering the lost territories {{in the course of}} the following century, such as the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743), and the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790).|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the {{electricity}} {{generated by the}} nuclear power plants of Angra 1 and Angra 2 represented 2.7% of the national energy output, approximately 14 tWh.

In 2012, a review of the PNE 2030 was commissioned, so as {{to take into account the}} increasing share of renewable sources like wind and biomass in the Brazilian energy matrix and the consequences of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.

25|$|Lyon brought Gloucestershire greater {{success than}} the county had {{seen since the}} days of W. G. Grace. In 1929 and 1930, they won more matches than any other county; in 1930 and 1931 they {{finished}} second. Lyon was aided, no doubt, by having Wally Hammond, perhaps England's finest batsman of the time in the side. And the three years of success coincided as well with the last truly effective years of the great slow left-arm bowler Charlie Parker and the first effective years of Parker's successor, the off break bowler Tom Goddard. But the captaincy of Lyon was regarded as a vital factor, and he was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1931. The citation in Wisden suggested that he might be a future captain of England, but <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E

This time, {{late in the afternoon}} of April 24, 1778, the ships, roughly equal in firepower, engaged in combat. Earlier in the day, the Americans had captured the crew of a reconnaissance boat, and learned that Drake had taken on dozens of soldiers, with the intention of grappling and boarding Ranger, so Jones made sure <b>that</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen,</b> capturing Drake after an hour-long gun battle which cost the British captain his life. Lieutenant Simpson was given command of Drake for the return journey to Brest. The ships separated during the return journey as Ranger chased another prize, leading to a conflict between Simpson and Jones. Both ships arrived at port safely, but Jones filed for a court-martial of Simpson, keeping him detained on the ship.|$|E
