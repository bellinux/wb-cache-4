5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand <b>the</b> <b>etiology</b> of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E

25|$|Adaptationist {{hypotheses}} regarding <b>the</b> <b>etiology</b> {{of psychological}} disorders are {{often based on}} analogies between physiological and psychological dysfunctions, {{as noted in the}} table below. Prominent theorists and evolutionary psychiatrists include Michael T. McGuire and Randolph M. Nesse.

25|$|Many {{drugs have}} been found that lessen the risk of {{neurotoxicity}} from NMDA receptor antagonists. Centrally acting alpha 2 agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine are thought to most directly target <b>the</b> <b>etiology</b> of NMDA neurotoxicity.
