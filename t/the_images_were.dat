5|$|In September 2010, Hamas {{released}} a propaganda video showing various Israeli landmarks, including the Hurva synagogue, ablaze after coming under missile attack. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> {{the result of}} special effects, as no such attacks had taken place.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} created on Macintosh computers, principally Macintosh Quadras. The {{graphics}} were individual shots of fully rendered rooms. Overall, Myst contains 2,500frames, {{one for each}} possible area the player can explore. Each scene was modeled and rendered in StrataVision 3D, with some additional modeling in Macromedia MacroModel. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> then edited and enhanced using Photoshop1.0.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, 2014, a {{large number}} of private {{photographs}} taken by celebrities were posted online due to a compromise of user passwords at iCloud. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> initially posted on 4chan. As a result of the incident, 4chan announced that it would enforce a Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy, which would allow content owners to remove material that had been shared on the site illegally, and would ban users who repeatedly posted stolen material.|$|E

5|$|Sightseers {{gathered}} on the bridge in the morning. George Henry Farnum, the owner of Okemah's only photography studio, took photographs, which were distributed as postcards, a common practice at the time. The district judge convened a grand jury, but the killers were never identified. Four of Farnum's photographs {{are known to have}} survived—two spectator scenes and one close-up view each of Laura and L.D. Three of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> re-published in 2000 and exhibited at the Roth Horowitz Gallery in New York by James Allen, an antique collector. The images of Laura Nelson are the only known surviving photographs of a female lynching victim.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church was {{unmatched}} in its ceramic decoration by any {{church in}} Preslav, {{and was the}} only known building {{in the city to}} rely heavily on polychrome ceramic tiles. Ceramic and mosaic icons were a highlight of the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> enclosed in ellipses.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of Daredevil was {{released}} on March 18, 2016 on the streaming service Netflix worldwide, in Ultra HD 4K. Preparing for the release, Netflix created eight different images to use as cover art for the season on its site. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> randomly distributed among select subscribers, with Netflix tracking to see which one was the best-performing to eventually use for all subscribers. Netflix also debuted a countdown timer to a percentage of its users worldwide, allowing them to see how long it was until the season would debut. The season was enhanced to be available in high dynamic range after its initial release by post-production vendor Deluxe.|$|E

30|$|The {{denoising}} {{process of}} computer video electromagnetic leakage emission reduction <b>image</b> <b>is</b> of great significance {{for improving the}} video reproduction and reception capability. From the effect and evaluation after the denoising process, the signal-to-noise ratio of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> improved, <b>the</b> contrast of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> enhanced, and to some extent, the recognizability of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> improved.|$|R
50|$|By convention, if the {{resulting}} magnification <b>is</b> positive, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> upright. If <b>the</b> magnification <b>is</b> negative, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> inverted (upside down).|$|R
5|$|With {{a budget}} of $230,000, the {{surviving}} original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to Lowry Digital for restoration. The video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> from tapes in Australia, the CBS News archive, and kinescope recordings made at Johnson Space Center. The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{photo shoot}} with the band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not indicative {{of the spirit of}} the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E
40|$|A hybrid <b>image</b> {{compression}} method <b>is</b> proposed {{by which the}} Nuclei-Cytoplasm of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> completely restorable and the background part of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> restorable with insignificant loss. In Hybrid Compression of Cervical Images by Segmenting Nuclei-Cytoplasm, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> subjected to binary segmentation to detect Background and Nuclei-Cytoplasm. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> compressed by standard lossy {{compression method}}. The difference between <b>the</b> lossy <b>image</b> and <b>the</b> original <b>image</b> <b>is</b> computed as residue. The residue at the Nuclei-Cytoplasm area is compressed by standard lossless compression method by which the Nuclei-Cytoplasm area is completely restorable.

30|$|In {{the second}} step, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> further {{processed}} {{by increasing the}} color performance, where <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> first converted into hue-saturation-value (HSV) color model.

5|$|Mandalas became {{predominant}} in {{the paintings}} of the early Heian period as esoteric Buddhism emerged with the Shingon and Tendai sects in the 8th and 9th centuries. The evolution of Pure Land Buddhism caused raigō-zu to be developed as a genre, characterised by depictions of the Amida welcoming {{the souls of the}} faithful to his Western Paradise as seen in a 1053 painting in the Phoenix-Hall of Byōdō-in. By the mid-Heian period, Chinese style kara-e painting was replaced with the classical Japanese yamato-e style, in which <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> painted primarily on sliding screens and byōbu folding screens. At the close of the Heian period around 1185, the practice of adorning emakimono hand scrolls with yamato-e paintings flourished. Examples of illustrated hand scrolls include novels such as Genji Monogatari Emaki, historical writings like The Tale of Great Minister Ban, or religious works such as the Scroll of Hungry Ghosts. These genres continued to be produced into the Kamakura period from 1185 to 1333. As during the Nara period, sculpture remained the preferred art form of the period.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E
5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the galaxies in the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E
5000|$|For concave mirrors, whether <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> virtual or real {{depends on}} how large the object {{distance}} is compared to the focal length. If the [...] term {{is larger than the}} [...] term, [...] <b>is</b> positive and <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> real. Otherwise, <b>the</b> term <b>is</b> negative and <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> virtual. Again, this validates the behavior described above.|$|R
25|$|In modern lithography, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> {{made of a}} {{polymer coating}} applied to a {{flexible}} plastic or metal plate. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> can <b>be</b> printed directly from the plate (the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>is</b> reversed), {{or it can be}} offset, by transferring <b>the</b> <b>image</b> onto a flexible sheet (rubber) for printing and publication.|$|R

5|$|Woodenlegs, {{unsure what}} to do with the material, passed them to Weist, who at the time was writing a Cheyenne history for use in {{reservation}} schools. The negatives were contained in a battered shoebox, and some were in poor condition. Weist involved photographer Jerry Mader to work on their restoration. Weist, Mader, and Woodenlegs began a project in the 1960s to make the images available in reservation schools. Without funds for publication, however, the project was abandoned in 1981 on the death of Woodenlegs. Weist died in 1994. The negatives were passed to anthropologist Margot Liberty in 1998 by a remaining project member, Elizabeth Wilson Clark, shortly before her death. Liberty had been a teacher at the Northern Cheyenne reservation in the 1950s, and she agreed to edit the material into a book for the University of Oklahoma Press. Finally, 142 of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> published in 2006 as A Northern Cheyenne Album. The book includes a commentary from Woodenlegs recorded years before.|$|E
5|$|While Bungie founder Alex Seropian {{handled the}} {{business}} aspect of Bungie and produced the game's box art and promotional material, Jones programmed the game, wrote the story line, {{and contributed to}} the game's manual. Whereas Jones had single-handedly coded Minotaur, the small staff for Pathways was due to lack of money for a large team. To speed implementation, Jones built a level editor for the game that allowed him to add objects, monsters and walls to the levels. The game's levels and mazes span 40million scaled square feet. Jones' friend, Colin Brent, did much of the art and creature design, reducing Jones' workload and, in the programmer's opinion, improving the art. Each monster was drawn by hand in different states such as stationary, moving, attacking, and dying. They were then scanned into the computer and added to the game; if there were problems, they were redrawn. Once the final drawings were complete, <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>were</b> colorized in 24-bit color using Adobe Photoshop. Despite the game's advanced graphics, Pathways was designed to work on any Macintosh model; it was one of 30applications that ran natively on Apple's PowerMacs on launch day.|$|E
25|$|Early radiologists would adapt {{their eyes}} to view the dim {{fluoroscopic}} images by sitting in darkened rooms, or by wearing red adaptation goggles.
