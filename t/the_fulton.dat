5|$|NY54 was a {{circuitous}} east–west {{route that}} extended from Utica, Oneida County, to Fonda, Montgomery County, via Speculator and Benson. It entered Hamilton County from Herkimer County on modern NY8 and proceeded east through Speculator to Wells, where it turned south to follow {{what is now}} NY30 to <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> County line. It was assigned in the mid-1920s and split into several routes, including NY8 and NY30, in the 1930 renumbering.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of a ramp connecting the IND Fulton Street Line with <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> Street Elevated on Liberty Avenue. Six stations on the elevated would have their platforms extended to accommodate 10-car trains. This would make possible the demolition of the BMT Fulton Street Line between Grant Avenue and Rockaway Avenue and the demolition of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E
5|$|When the Illinois and Michigan Canal {{opened in}} 1848, the landmass at Wolf Point was {{decreased}} by dredging {{to accommodate a}} turning basin for ships. In the autumn {{of the same year}} the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad opened Chicago's first railroad depot at Wolf Point, on the southwestern corner of Kinzie and Canal Streets. By 1857 the site of Wolf Point Tavern was being used as a lumber yard; <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> Elevator, one of Chicago's earliest grain elevators, was built just {{to the north of the}} former tavern in 1852. Several blocks to the west of Wolf Point were destroyed in a large fire on September 15, 1859. <b>The</b> <b>Fulton</b> Elevator survived this, and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, but was burned down on September 7, 1873. It was rebuilt in the same year, and another grain elevator, the St Paul Elevator, was added immediately to the south of the original in 1879. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railway company purchased both elevators in 1889 for $400,000 ($ million today), but demolished them in 1906. Currently, the site is occupied by the Riverbend Condominiums at 333 North Canal Street.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> IND <b>Fulton</b> Street Line {{is within}} 0.5 mi of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line and the IRT New Lots Line {{for most of}} its length in Brooklyn. It was {{designed}} to replace <b>the</b> BMT <b>Fulton</b> Street Line.|$|R
5000|$|Cemetery. This is {{actually}} three adjacent but distinct cemeteries: Presbyterian Cemetery, Fulton Cemetery and <b>Fulton</b> Mechanick's Cemetery. <b>The</b> Presbytery of Cincinnati was awarded {{title to the}} Presbyterian Cemetery in 1970 by local courts {{in response to a}} suit for quiet title. The Court also charged the Presbytery with [...] "use and care" [...] of <b>the</b> two <b>Fultons,</b> but <b>the</b> Presbytery does not own <b>the</b> <b>Fultons.</b> Recorded deeds indicate <b>the</b> <b>Fultons</b> would be owned by the descendants of the original plot owners. The Presbyterian Cemetery dates to 1794 and is the final resting place of at least six Revolutionary War veterans, allegedly including Sgt. Willam Brown, the first man to receive a Purple Heart from George Washington. Brown was active in the area, although his headstone has not been found and confirming documentation does not exist. These cemeteries were severely vandalized and used as dumps since around 1900.|$|R

5|$|A {{connection}} between the Seventh Avenue Extension and the Rockaway Line would be built at 99th Street, costing $9,200,000.The Rockaway Beach Branch of the LIRR would be purchased and converted for subway operation. Service to the Rockaway would be provided through {{a connection to the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line. The extension would have cost $42,380,000. In addition, $2,550,000 would be spent on a two-track subway an open-cut {{connection between}} the Rockaway Line and <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> Street Line. Only the portion south of Liberty Avenue was completed.|$|E
5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} in {{the ceiling}} of the {{existing}} station. This portion of the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten feet from the mezzanine floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.|$|E
5|$|On July 28, {{the trial}} began at <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> County Superior Court (old city hall building). The judge, Leonard S. Roan, had been {{serving as a}} judge in Georgia since 1900. The {{prosecution}} team was led by Dorsey and included William Smith (Conley's attorney and Dorsey's jury consultant). Frank was represented {{by a team of}} eight lawyersincluding jury selection specialistsled by Luther Rosser, Reuben Arnold, and Herbert Haas. In addition to the hundreds of spectators inside, a large crowd gathered outside to watch the trial through the windows. The defense, in their legal appeals, would later cite the crowds as factors in intimidation of the witnesses and jury.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the roundabouts was controversial from the outset. The first two roundabouts were installed by NYSDOT even though both the town and city of Poughkeepsie declared that they were opposed to the roundabouts. Additionally, the roundabouts have drawn much controversy from local residents because they remove a lane of traffic in each direction, reducing Raymond Avenue (NY376) from a four-lane road to a divided two-lane boulevard and significantly altering pre-existing traffic patterns. A moderate amount of traffic has diverted onto alternate local routes as a result. In response, NYSDOT installed traffic calming measures on these parallel roads prior to the {{construction of}} <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> Avenue roundabout.|$|E
5|$|The line {{begins at}} the four-tracked Jay Street–MetroTech station, where the IND Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue lines {{interchange}} and continue as the Culver and Fulton Street lines respectively. Running under Smith Street south of the station, the Culver tracks split into local and express tracks, with the two express tracks ramping down to the lower level of Bergen Street, while the local tracks merge with the IND Crosstown Line tracks from Hoyt-Schermerhorn Street before entering the upper level. Between Jay Street and Bergen Street, the line passes under both the IRT Eastern Parkway Line and <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> Line tracks curving east into Hoyt-Schermerhorn Street, requiring a deeper tunnel and extensive ventilation systems.|$|E

Its eight-week run at <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> Theatre in Pittsburgh attracted over 50,000 people with reservations being made from cities located one hundred miles from the venue. Engagements were also held at the Geary Theatre in San Francisco for eight months, the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland for nine weeks, the Majestic Theatre in Boston, the Apollo Theater in Chicago, and also in Philadelphia, Detroit, Buffalo, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.|$|E

5|$|On December 5, 1899, Brittain and Lettie McDonald, {{daughter}} of Baptist minister Dr. Henry McDonald, were married. He returned to academic administration, first as superintendent of <b>the</b> <b>Fulton</b> County School System (1900–1910) and later, at {{the appointment of}} Joseph Mackey Brown, the education system for {{the entire state of}} Georgia (1910–1922). In this role, Brittain became well known for fighting corruption and generally improving the education system. Throughout this time, Brittain earned LL.D. degrees from Mercer University (1919), and, later, the University of Georgia (1927) and Emory University (1928). He was also president of the Georgia Education Association in 1906, of the Southern Education Association in 1913, and of the Council of State School Superintendents of the United States in 1917. He earned the wrath of Senator Tom Watson during these positions, who attempted to remove Brittain from his position as superintendent of education.|$|E
