After the conclusion of the maneuvers, Blitz was withdrawn from active service. In 1903, she was used as a tender for the fleet.|$|E

5|$|Rhythm game or rhythm {{action is}} a genre of music-themed action video game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or <b>the</b> <b>simulated</b> performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads {{may be used as}} input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.|$|E

25|$|This {{notion of}} slow cooling {{implemented}} in <b>the</b> <b>Simulated</b> Annealing algorithm is {{interpreted as a}} slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, <b>the</b> <b>Simulated</b> Annealing algorithms work as follows. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and then decides to move to it or {{to stay with the}} current solution based on either one of two probabilities between which it chooses {{on the basis of the}} fact that the new solution is better or worse than the current one. During the search, the temperature is progressively decreased from an initial positive value to zero and affects the two probabilities: at each step, the probability of moving to a better new solution is either kept to 1 or is changed towards a positive value; instead, the probability of moving to a worse new solution is progressively changed towards zero.|$|E
