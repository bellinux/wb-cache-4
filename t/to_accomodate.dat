Well, said my nephew, if you are so resolved, permit me to talk with him, and then I have done; and so he came to me, giving me an account of their resolution, how one and all designed to forsake the ship when I came on board, for which he was mightily concerned. [...] "I am glad to see you, nephew," [...] said I, [...] "and rejoice it is no worse, since they have not rebelled against you; I only desire you to send my necessary things on shore, with a sufficient sum of money, and I will find my way to England as well as I can." [...] Though this grieved my nephew to the heart, yet there was no remedy but complience; in short, all my necessaries were sent me, and so this matter was over in a few hours.|$|E

Robertus congratulated him {{and sent him}} in his Carriage to take possession of the Cottage. After travelling {{for three days and}} six nights without stopping, they arrived at the Forest and following a track which led by it's side down a steep Hill over which ten Rivulets meandered, they reached the Cottage in half an hour. Wilhelminus alighted, and after knocking for some time without receiving any answer or hearing any one stir within, he opened the door which was fastened only by a wooden latch and entered a small room, which he immediately perceived {{to be one of the}} two that were unfurnished--From thence he proceeded into a Closet equally bare. A pair of stairs that went out of it led him into a room above, no less destitute, and these apartments he found composed the whole of the House. He was by no means displeased with this discovery, as he had the comfort of reflecting that he should not be obliged to lay out anything on furniture himself--. He returned {{immediately to}} his Brother, who took him the next day to every Shop in Town, and bought what ever was requisite to furnish the two rooms and the Closet, In a few days everything was completed, and Wilhelminus returned to take possession of his Cottage. Robertus accompanied him, with his Lady the amiable Cecilia and her two lovely Sisters Arabella and Marina to whom Wilhelminus was tenderly attached, and a large number of Attendants.--An ordinary Genius might probably have been embarrassed, in endeavouring <b>to</b> <b>accomodate</b> so large a party, but Wilhelminus with admirable presence of mind gave orders for the immediate erection of two noble Tents in an open spot in the Forest adjoining to the house. Their Construction was both simple and elegant--A couple of old blankets, each supported by four sticks, gave a striking proof of that taste for architecture and that happy ease in overcoming difficulties which were some of Wilhelminus's most striking Virtues.|$|E

Due to Cooke's obligations on The Spirit, Stan Berkowitz wrote the film, while Cooke storyboarded ten percent of the film, rewrote and polished dialogue, as well as provided art direction.

Having resewn a pair of $10 pants to make them fit, he was approached by Taime Downe of glam metal band Faster Pussycat. He sold him 8 pairs of his customized pants for $25 each and soon after established a stall on Venice Beach, where would sell customized clothing he revamped from cheap clothes he bought at flea markets or second hand stores. Soon, he was earning $2000 a weekend. By the early 90s, his brand, now dubbed Serious Clothing, was a multi-million dollar business venture, and was worn {{by the likes of}} Madonna, Alice Cooper, and Bruce Willis. <b>To</b> <b>accomodate</b> his company's growth, which was now being sold at retailers worldwide, he bought a huge but run-down factory building in the Arts District of Los Angeles. This accidently established a second venture, as when interest in his person grew, he was approached whether he would rent parts of his property as filming locations. Bruce Willis, Victoria Beckham, Jay-Z, and Prince, among others, have filmed adverts, films or music videos on his company grounds. After about 15 years of manufacturing clothes, the sales of Serious Clothing began to dwindle, and Walker and his wife no longer felt connected to the scene, so they sold their business and the company eventually closed. On June 1, 2017, Walker published his autobiography Urban Outlaw: Dirt Don't Slow You Down, detailing his rise and fall in the fashion industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to formulate the characteristic of Denpasar architectural style (DAS) as a benchmark in understanding the diversity of the elements of traditional Balinese architecture. The study also does not stop at the stage of formulation of romantic-retrospective perspective identity alone, but also to look at the phenomenon of the application of the identity in contemporary architecture that is critical–prospective. With this understanding, this study is a descriptive - qualitative research which inductively observes, classifies and interprets architectural elements so as to formulate an identity of DAS called Peciren Bebadungan. The findings of {{this research}} shows that the identity of the DAS which is characterized by the use of brick as the main elements and the modulation of the building. DAS is more adaptive to the combination with other foreign culture and the proportions of the building looks wider that shows strong and firm characters, reflecting the character of Denpasar community. The elements that form peciren bebadungan are: the elements of creativity that is to say elements of the development which are customized with the element of function but still retaining the character of Balinese architecture. The element of acceptability namely the element of “openness” towards acculturation with the foreign culture without eliminating the character and identity as Balinese.
