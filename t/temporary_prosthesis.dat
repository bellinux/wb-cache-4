Most of these techniques involve dental technicians producing the temporary construction, for example, rebuilding existing dentures, acrylic bridges, etc. PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of a chair-side technique of a cost-effective <b>temporary</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Fixture survival rate and risk of temporary bridge failure were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven partially or totally edentate patients (18 female and 19 male; mean age: 66. 7 years) treated with chair-side manufactured temporary restorations (QuickBridge, BIOMET 3 i, Palm Beach, Fl, USA) for immediate loading have been evaluated. The prostheses extended from two unit bridges supported by two implants to full-arch construction supported by six implants. The temporary prostheses were monitored from the day of surgery and delivery to the time of replacement with a permanent prosthetic construction 3 to 6 months later. RESULTS: No implants were lost during the observation time. One (3 %) <b>temporary</b> <b>prosthesis</b> fractured and additional two (6 %) loosened during the follow-up time.

Materials and methods: 225 edentulous patients were selected, 67 of these were subjected to immediate loading with placing of 402 implants to both jaws and 158 patients to delayed loading with placing of 948 implants to both jaws. A screwed resin prosthesis has been positioned to the first group while a removable <b>temporary</b> <b>prosthesis</b> to the second one. The patients were recalled 6, 12 months after the surgical phase. Results: 20 of 298 immediate loading implants placed in the upper jaw were lost with a 93. 2 % survival rate while in the case of delayed loading at the upper jaw 64 of 636 were lost with a 89. 9 % survival rate. Results at lower jaw in terms of success were similar. Discussion: The biggest lost of implants with delayed loading is due to a decubitus of removable <b>temporary</b> <b>prosthesis</b> on implants with excessive pressure excerted on them, during the function.

The samples of new polymer materials with different percentages of nanotubes were obtained, the results of measurement of their strength characteristics were provided. The mechanism of interaction of the basic components of “Karbodent” and single-wall carbon nanotubes are theoretically studied. The various orientations of the main components of “Karbodent” were analyzed in relation to the surface of carbon nanotubes. A semi empirical quantum chemical MNDO method is the main method of calculation. On the basis of the analysis of theoretical and practical studies, the authors made conclusions about the feasibility of a new dental material using carbon nanotubes with unique strength characteristics.

In this work the in vivo degradation of devices from copolymer, as a system of plates and screws, used in fixation of the tibia of rabbits was studied. The devices were implanted in 15 adult rabbits, albinos, New Zealand race, and they were used as control devices of alloys of titanium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V/ V grade). The use of copolymers, synthesized in the laboratory, was tested in the repair of fracture in rabbits'tibias, being assessed in the following times: 2 weeks, 2 months and 3 months. Morphological analysis of tissue surrounding the plate and screw system, for 2 weeks of implantation, showed the presence of osteoblasts, indicating a pre bone formation. After 2 months there was new bone formation in the region in contact with the polymer. This bone growth occurred simultaneously with the process of PLDLA degradation, invading the region where there was polymer and after 3 months there was an intense degradation of the copolymer and hence greater tissue invasion compared to 2 months which characterized bone formation in a region where the polymer degraded. The in vivo degradation study of the devices for PLDLA by means of histological evaluations during the period of consolidation of the fracture showed the efficiency of plate and screw system, and it was possible to check formation of bone tissue at the implantation site, without the presence of inflammatory reaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of the crestal {{alveolar bone}} {{is important for}} both the maintenance of osseointegration {{and the location of}} the gingival soft tissues. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the bone microstructure of the alveolar bone and of the interimplant bone in implants inserted at different interimplant distances. The mandibular bilateral premolars of six dogs were extracted, and after 12 weeks, each dog received eight implants, for a total of 48 implants. Two pairs of implants, one for each hemiarch, were separated by 2 mm (group 1) and by 3 mm (group 2). After 12 weeks, the implants received <b>temporary</b> acrylic <b>prostheses.</b> After four more weeks, metallic crowns substituted the <b>temporary</b> <b>prostheses.</b> After an additional 8 weeks the animals were sacrificed and the hemimandibles were removed, dissected, and processed. The longitudinal collagen fiber orientation was 43. 2 % for the alveolar bone; it was 30. 3 % for the 2 -mm group and 43. 9 % for the 3 -mm group. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 -mm and 3 -mm groups (p <. 05). The orientation of transverse collagen fibers was 47. 8 % for the alveolar bone; it was 37. 3 % for the 2 -mm group and 56. 3 % for the 3 -mm group. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 -mm and 3 -mm groups (p <. 05). The marrow spaces were 34. 87 % for the alveolar bone, 52. 3 % for the 2 -mm group, and 59. 9 % for the 3 -mm group. There was a statistically significant difference between the alveolar bone and the 3 -mm group (p <. 05). The low mineral density index was 36. 29 for the alveolar bone, 46. 76 for the 2 -mm group, and 17. 91 for the 3 -mm group. There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 -mm and 3 -mm groups (p <. 05). The high mineral density was 87. 57 for the alveolar bone, 72. 58 for the 2 -mm group, and 84. 91 for the 3 -mm group. There was a statistically significant difference between the alveolar bone and the 2 -mm group (p <. 05). The collagen fiber orientation resulted in statistically significant differences in both the 2 -mm and 3 -mm groups compared with the alveolar bone. The marrow spaces appeared significantly increased in the 3 -mm group compared with the alveolar bone.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some of the {{original}} surgical protocols for implant surgery have been reassessed to satisfy the patient's continuously increasing expectation for shorter rehabilitation time, improved esthetics, and increased comfort. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the 12 -month clinical success of 18 single-tooth implants inserted immediately after tooth extraction and restored the same day with non-functional loading. METHODS: A total of 18 patients (12 women and six men), 22 to 60 years old, were enrolled in this study. Eighteen single implants were inserted in fresh extraction sockets and immediately restored with temporary abutments and crowns. All experimental sites showed an absence of fenestrations or dehiscences of the bone walls and a residual gap between implant surfaces and surrounding bone walls < or = 2 mm. All <b>temporary</b> <b>prostheses</b> were positioned the same day of surgery and were not in occlusal contact with opposing arches. The comparison between the baseline and 12 -month visits was performed with the Student t test for paired data (statistically significant at a level of alpha = 0. 05). RESULTS: During the 12 -month follow-up period, one fixture was removed 4 weeks after implant placement following an abscess. All remaining implants healed uneventfully with no complications and were assessed as stable and successful at the 12 -month checkup. No technical complications such as screw loosening, resin fracture, or pain during chewing were registered during the 12 -month period. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of the data from this study, it can be suggested that immediate placement and restoration of a single implant can be a valid and successful option of treatment in the case of single compromised teeth. Moreover, this treatment protocol eliminates the need for removable provisional restoration and seems to maintain the preexisting architecture of soft and hard tissues in most cases. Nonetheless, further prospective and long-term studies are required to obtain a better insight into the limitations of this protocol...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: {{in recent}} years, an {{increasing}} interest is emerging about computer-guided implant surgery, flapless surgery and immediate prosthetic loading. The extreme accuracy {{to replicate the}} patient's anatomical features of the computer-guided implant surgery shows great relevance in clinical conditions where {{a small amount of}} bone volume and anatomical restrictions are present, improving the treatment predictability and encouraging the adoption of advanced therapy options. In this procedure the virtual planning, based on a three-dimensional digital system, and the surgery, guided by a computer designed stereolithographic template are used. Digital technology allows to create a virtual three-dimensional model of the jaw on which the implant placement has to be planned, according to anatomical features (e. g. bone volume and vital structures) and the prosthetic project. The reported case illustrates the clinical procedures performed to avoid a more invasive surgical approach, an interim removable denture, and long treatment times. Case presentation: implant-prosthetic rehabilitation in a patient in which the extraction of the 1. 3, 2. 3, 1. 5 and 1. 6 is needed. The extraction of hopeless teeth and the immediate implant placement with a functionalized <b>temporary</b> <b>prosthesis</b> are planned on the same day of surgery. A diagnostic wax-up of the prosthetic restoration was made on articulator mounted plaster models, to allow the realization of a tripartite template (one base portion and two teeth set-up portions). Pre-operative high-resolution CT scans of patient and template applying the double-scan technique were performed. The multiplanar reconstructions and the virtual navigation system allowed to program three-dimensional implant positioning based on the pre-operative prosthetic study. The transfer of the implant position from the diagnostic phase to the flapless surgery was performed through the stereolithographic template NobelGuide ™ (NobelBiocare ®). Results: the final restoration, carried out after 6 months, allowed to achieve good functional and aesthetic results. Conclusion: the transfer of the virtual implant position from the diagnostic to the clinic phase by using stereolithographic template allows to adopt a minimally invasive surgical technique, to reduce operating times, to improve the post-operative position and to functionalize immediate <b>temporary</b> <b>prosthesis...</b>|$|E
30|$|The inlay {{bone graft}} technique, first {{described}} by Schettler and Holtermann in 1977 [15] which presented {{the reconstruction of}} a severely atrophic edentulous mandible, has great potential for bone graft incorporation. The technique is relatively simple and provides satisfactory results {{both in terms of}} surgical success and predictability [15 – 19]. The technique is predicable because the four walls of the graft are in contact with live tissue, increasing vascularization and reducing resorption [17]. A box-style gap opens between the segments, which borders on an open bone marrow cavity on two sides. This space offers excellent conditions for vascularization of the graft and bone healing. Thus, a <b>temporary</b> <b>prosthesis</b> can be used in the early postoperative period. Since that first report, several reports on research outcomes, technological progress, and the good results obtained with this technique have been published.

Narration thus becomes profoundly corporeal, involving hands, face and eyes, with the viewer required to merge two slightly different images into one, an ocular exercise that four out of ten people find difficult to master. The intense haptic sensation of depth this produces is never static, for the eye moves from one plane to another, constantly changing the narrative.

Complications included non-union of the greater trochanter in four patients, intraoperative femoral fracture in two and fracture of the cement prosthesis in one. The use of an interim spacer was associated with better hip function in the interim period; a decreased operative time and less blood loss at the time of arthroplasty; and a higher hip score at final follow-up. Staged arthroplasty is an effective salvage procedure for deep hip infection after the failed treatment of an intertrochanteric fracture. The use of a temporary spacer maintains hip function between stages, makes arthroplasty less complicated, and improves the clinical outcome...|$|R
