5|$|The first Southern Railway livery {{continued}} {{that of the}} LSWR, {{but with}} the number displayed on the tender. However, from 1925, a darker Olive-type green was substituted, and <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was so painted.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to adopt blue {{as the standard}} colour was subsequently reversed and Brunswick green was introduced in November 1951 with No. 46232 Duchess of Montrose. Between October 1955 and December 1957, all 38 locomotives carried it concurrently, the only livery <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> carried.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{its young}} age, {{the arrival of}} the KTM Class 92 in 2012 {{resulted}} in total retirement of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> KTM <b>class</b> 82 fleet, with the many cannibalised for parts, while others are being retired due to accidents and incidents, there are no more working sets available for use, added to complexity of having not able to source any more parts from factory. This marks the end of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> KTM <b>class</b> 82's short history.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Coronation {{class was}} {{probably}} painted in more styles of livery {{than any other}} engine class, seven in the LMS era up to 1947 and five more during the British Railways era from 1948 onwards. That {{does not mean that}} all 38 locomotives were painted in all these different styles; many were specific to just a few engines. The only style that all 38 bore was the British Railways lined Brunswick Green and <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was turned out thus beween 1955 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} {{gradually}} superseded on top link expresses during the 1940s by {{growing numbers of}} Bulleid Pacifics, although throughout the 1950s they were frequently called upon during peak periods or to deputise for failures. The rebuilding of the Pacifics in the late 1950s and their subsequent increased reliability rendered the Lord Nelson surplus to operational requirements, and they were gradually phased out of service. <b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was withdrawn during 1961 and 1962.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes one may {{be confronted}} with {{classification}} problems where classes are constituted of several subclasses that possess different distributions and therefore destroy accurate models of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>classes</b> as one similar group. An issue is modelling via local models of several subclasses. In this paper, a method is presented of how to handle such classification problems where the subclasses are furthermore characterized by different subsets of the variables. Situations are outlined and tested where such local models in different variable subspaces dramatically improve the classification error. ...|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the chiefs}} {{respected}} Atangana as their spokesman and leader, and the Beti at large deferred to him prestige and power. A {{new system of}} status had evolved under his rule: a cadre of minor bureaucrats, envoys, interpreters, and office staff worked for Atangana and the other chiefs independent of the French government and were completely dependent on the chiefs. Atangana set up a private police force, for example, known as the fulus in Ewondo. <b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> recognised its reliance on the chiefs and gave them loyalty in exchange for protection and pay, and the chiefs relied on these functionaries to swiftly fulfill their duties to the French regime.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass {{was also}} {{successful}} on the Central section, where they worked alongside L. B. Billinton's LB K class 2-6-0s. However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the Nclass prevented {{use of the}} type on the Eastern section's TonbridgeHastings line. The route's narrow bridges and tunnels were unable to accommodate the class, and provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route. Despite these restrictions, the class was capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds, a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War. <b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> came into British Railways' ownership in 1948 and {{could be seen in}} most areas of the Southern Region.|$|E

5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear. Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside steam pipes of Maunsell's original design {{were replaced by}} outside steam pipes emerging from the smokebox, behind the smoke deflectors. From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class.</b> Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption. The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{other five}} {{submarines}} were scheduled for completion at 12-month intervals. However, {{the series of}} defects and problems encountered during sea trials of the submarines (particularly Collins) resulted in the repeated diversion of resources from those still under construction, adding to delays. Consequently, delivery of the submarines ran significantly behind schedule; submarines were presented to the RAN between 21and 41months late, and <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was not cleared for full operational service until March 2004, {{a year after the}} last boat was commissioned. These delays forced the RAN to keep several Oberon-class submarines and the submarine base HMAS Platypus in service beyond their planned decommissioning dates.|$|E
5|$|British {{submarines}} {{were becoming}} increasingly {{active in the}} Baltic by late 1915; several cruisers had been sunk and the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships {{could no longer be}} risked there. Therefore, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service and disarmed by 1916. They were used as training ships, with the exception of Mecklenburg, which was used as a prison ship. In 1919, Wittelsbach and Schwaben were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. <b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class,</b> with the exception of Zähringen, were struck from the navy list after the end of World War I. Mecklenburg was struck on 27 January 1920, Wettin followed on 11 March 1920, and Wittelsbach and Schwaben were struck on 8 March 1921. The four ships were broken up between 1921–22. Zähringen was converted into a radio-controlled target ship in 1926–27. Royal Air Force bombers sank the ship in Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–50.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{after the}} closure of the Wilmer-Hutchins Independent School District, what would have been <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> senior <b>class</b> of Wilmer-Hutchins High School was sent to South Oak Cliff. SOC and other DISD schools absorbed the {{remaining}} WHISD high school students.|$|R

50|$|The Philippine Navy {{made plans}} to upgrade <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> ship <b>class</b> with new radar systems and the BGM-84 Harpoon {{long-range}} anti-ship cruise missile, but this did not materialize due to the worsening political and economic crisis in the Philippines in the mid-1980s.|$|R
5|$|However, {{problems}} with the combat system, excessive noise, and engine breakdowns were recurring and appeared across <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class.</b> These and other shortcomings were often made harder to solve by disagreements between Kockums, ASC, Rockwell, the RAN, and the Australian Government over the nature of problems, their causes, and {{who was responsible for}} solving them. Media reporting of the problems during the mid-1990s was often negative and exaggerated, creating poor public perception. This was aided by politicians, who used the shortcomings to politically attack the Labor Party and Kim Beazley, particularly after Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition in the 1996 federal election, and Beazley became Leader of the Opposition. During the mid-1990s, it was recommended on several occasions that the submarine project be abandoned, and the completed submarines and incomplete hulls be broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The 1928 {{accident}} inquiry did not attach {{blame to}} the Southern Railway for track maintenance or locomotive performance issues, {{and noted that}} the prototype had run for eight years over the same stretch of line without complaint. However, it identified the Brighton batch and No.A890 as being more susceptible to rolling on sharp curves with weak rail joints, although <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> operated without incident on the former LBSCR network. The management of the Southern Railway realised that to have any success in operating the Kclass tanks on {{other parts of the}} network, vast stretches of track would require upgrading. With the prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst the necessary upgrading took place, the management recommended the class be fully withdrawn from service. To recoup the expense of constructing the engines, Maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to the new SR Uclass 2-6-0 tender engine design in 1928. This decision also reduced the adverse publicity generated by the accident. However, many of the components discarded during the rebuilding process would later be re-used on another 2-6-4 tank locomotive designed to haul heavy freight on short trips: the 3-cylinder Wclass of 1932.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> {{is based}} at , also known as Fleet Base West, which is located on Garden Island, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. The {{decision}} to locate all six submarines at Stirling was prompted by the lack of suitable long-term facilities on the east coast of Australia (although individual submarines can use Fleet Base East in Sydney Harbour as a forward staging facility), and the proximity to Australian offshore interests, including most of the nation's external territories, the oil and natural gas resources of the North West Shelf, and the Indian Ocean sea lines of communication, through which the majority of Australia's seaborne trade passes. The submarines' primary missions are patrolling the waters of Australia and nearby nations, and gathering intelligence through the interception of electronic communications by foreign nations and the deployment/retrieval of special forces operatives.|$|E

5|$|The Schichau {{class were}} torpedo boats {{built for the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy between 1885 and 1891. A total of 22 boats were built by three {{shipbuilding}} companies; nine by Seearsenal Pola, six by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, and the remaining seven boats were built by Schichau-Werke. The class {{was one of the}} first torpedo boat classes built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and they were initially powered by steam from a single locomotive boiler. <b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was reconstructed between 1900 and 1910, when they received two Yarrow boilers and a second funnel. Ten of the class were converted to minesweepers between 1911 and 1913, and apart from one that was discarded in 1911, all boats saw active service as part of local defence forces for Adriatic naval bases during World War I, with one being lost in the early days of the war. The remaining nine torpedo boats were also converted to minesweepers in 1917, although five still carried torpedoes. After the war, sixteen were allocated to Italy and four were allocated to the navy of the newly created Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). Except for one of the Yugoslav boats which was retained as a training vessel, all of the boats had been discarded and broken up by 1925. After capture during the April 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia the remaining boat saw service with the Italians then the Germans during World War II. She was lost in German hands sometime after September 1943.|$|E

40|$|We extend certain homomorphisms defined on {{the higher}} Torelli subgroups of the mapping class group to crossed homomorphisms defined on <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> mapping <b>class</b> group.

From this crossed homomorphism we also obtain a crossed homomorphism extending the kth Johnson homomorphism τk to the mapping class group. D Johnson and S Morita obtained their respective homomorphisms {{by considering the}} action of the mapping class group on the nilpotent truncations of the surface group; our approach is to mimic Morita’s construction topologically by using nilmanifolds associated to these truncations. This allows us to take the ranges of these crossed homomorphisms to be certain finite-dimensional real vector spaces associated to these nilmanifolds. ...|$|R
