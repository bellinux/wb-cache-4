Conceptual model of <b>transition</b> <b>piece</b> design for a full lattice tower support structure proposal was discussed extensively which included consideration of structural form, functional requirement, mechanical condition, etc. A mechanical model of <b>transition</b> <b>piece</b> with regards to boundary condition and load conditions was also provided.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{deals with}} a new design of a joint between a steel pipe and a PE-HD pipe, which is called a <b>transition</b> <b>piece</b> and is {{intended}} for transmission of liquid and gas media. As a pipe fitting it connects a PE-HD pipeline, which is usually laid underground, outside a building, and a steel pipeline, which is mounted in a building. Design/methodology/approach: Paper gives some theoretical considerations on welding steel with PE-HD and other joining processes suitable for dissimilar materials such as metals and plastics. A production technology, stress calculations for the joint and an analysis of testing of the <b>transition</b> <b>piece</b> are described. An experimental research of a new “joint” between steel and PE-HD pipes is given. Findings: The most important part in formation of a joint between steel and PE-HD pipes is played by an internal sleeve of high-alloy stainless steel, which expends the PE-HD pipe mounted {{in the interior of}} the expanded part of the steel pipe by elastic mechanical force. Theoretical stress calculations indicating the force required to tear the PE-HD pipe from the <b>transition</b> <b>piece</b> constitute an important part. An analysis of pressure and strength tests under different conditions, i. e. with different temperatures, moisture conditions, inner overpressures and underpressures, is given.

The study defines the velocity and temperature profiles at the exit of the <b>transition</b> <b>piece</b> and the hot streak along the system. The variation of the composition in the fuel depends {{of the amount of}} N 2 contained in the fuel, and the hot track influences on the temperature distribution at the input of the first stage of vanes and blades of the gas turbine. The study takes place in a three-dimensional model in steady state using FLUENT ® 6. 3. 26, applying the k-ε turbulence model and chemical equilibrium to the combustion process.

40|$|Seaway Heavy Lifting is an {{offshore}} contractor that transports, installs and decommissions offshore {{oil and gas}} platforms and offshore wind turbines. During transport, objects need to be secured on the deck, the so-called seafastening. In particular for parts of offshore wind turbines, called Transition Pieces, this proves to be difficult. The Transition Pieces are on average 25 m high tubular structures and weight 300 mT. The outside {{is covered with a}} special coating and various attachments, such as boat landings, ladders, and anodes for corrosion protection. The inside of the Transition Pieces contains various structures and equipment, such as groutskirts, shear keys, J-tubes and internal platforms. Seaway Heavy Lifting currently uses clamps on the lower flange to secure the Transition Pieces in an upright position to the deck of the ship. This causes relative high stresses in the flange and weld and {{turned out to be a}} critical limiting factor during transportation for several projects. Due to this limitation, the workability of the vessels is suboptimal. Many other offshore contractors use the same or similar method of clamping the lower flange to the deck. A new method for seafastening Transition Pieces is proposed to improve the securing strength, the safety, and workability of the vessels. This new method comprises of a tubular element, much like the monopile on which the <b>Transition</b> <b>Piece</b> will stand once on offshore location, welded onto the grillage. The <b>Transition</b> <b>Piece</b> can then be lifted over this tubular element. Mounted on the tubular element are hydraulic cylinders that extend outwards towards the inner wall of the <b>Transition</b> <b>Piece.</b> By exerting a force to the inner wall, the <b>Transition</b> <b>Piece</b> is effectively secured to the vessel. This method avoids using the rather weak lower flange. Strength calculations have shown that this new method can withstand accelerations and accompanying forces caused by the ships motions that are nearly twice as high as the current method allows. Because the new method is fully automated, it requires no manual labour and the seafastening can be activated and deactivated quickly, thus saving critical crane time. It also reduces the time frame where the Transition Pieces stands on the deck unsecured, as is the case with the current method which uses clamps and bolts, thus improving safety. This thesis covers the invention of the new method, calculating the critical structural parts, and detailing those element that are crucial to the design. Currently, a patent applications is pending.
