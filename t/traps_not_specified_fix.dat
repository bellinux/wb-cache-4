50|$|By {{the time}} Venkatamakhin {{formulated}} the melakarta ("mela") system, the grama system {{was no longer}} in use. Unlike the grama system, the mela system uses the same starting swara. It forms the scales by varying the intervals of the subsequent swaras, and does <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> a <b>fixed</b> interval for a swara in terms of shrutis. For example, the intervals of kakali-nishada and shuddha-madhyama vary depending on the dhaivata and the gandhara that precede them, respectively. The interval of kakali-nishada is of three different shruti values depending on whether shuddha, panca-sruti or shat-shruti-dhaivata preceded it. Thus shruti as a measure of interval is not fully employed in the mela system.|$|R
50|$|Fixed length arrays {{are limited}} in capacity, {{but it is not}} true that items need to be copied towards the head of the queue. The simple trick of turning the array into a closed circle and letting the head and tail drift around {{endlessly}} in that circle makes it unnecessary to ever move items stored in the array. If n is the size of the array, then computing indices modulo n will turn the array into a circle. This is still the conceptually simplest way to construct a queue in a high level language, but it does admittedly slow things down a little, because the array indices must be compared to zero and the array size, which is comparable to the time taken to check whether an array index is out of bounds, which some languages do, but this will certainly be the method of choice for a quick and dirty implementation, or for any high level language that does not have pointer syntax. The array size must be declared ahead of time, but some implementations simply double the declared array size when overflow occurs. Most modern languages with objects or pointers can implement or come with libraries for dynamic lists. Such data structures may have <b>not</b> <b>specified</b> <b>fixed</b> capacity limit besides memory constraints. Queue overflow results from trying to add an element onto a full queue and queue underflow happens when trying to remove an element from an empty queue.|$|R
5000|$|When the Compact {{was agreed}} to, {{irrigation}} was accomplished mostly by flooding crop fields. Around 65% {{of the water}} would be absorbed into the soil or evaporate, leaving 35% of the water to flow back into the source rivers and downstream. With more efficient irrigation systems such as sprinkling, 10% or less of the water flows downstream, effectively allowing Wyoming to utilize more water. The Supreme Court granted the motion for leave of Court and appointed Stanford University natural resources law professor Bradford H. Thompson, Jr. as Special Master to try the case and recommend a decision to the Court. [...] Special Master Thompson concluded that because the Compact did <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> a <b>fixed</b> volume {{of water from the}} Yellowstone River or its tributaries that would be available to Montana, Wyoming's use of more efficient irrigation methods did not violate the Compact. [...] In the opinion for Montana v. Wyoming filed May 2, 2011, the Supreme Court agreed, holding that Montana had failed to state a claim for breach of the Compact, and that Wyoming's more efficient irrigation systems do not violate the Compact.|$|R

50|$|The institutio tituli collativa (that {{which gives}} the title), {{sometimes}} also called verbalis (which may be {{by word of mouth}} or by writing, as distinguished from the institutio corporalis, or realis), is the act by which an ecclesiastical authority confers a benefice on a candidate presented by a third person enjoying the right of presentation. This occurs in the case of benefices subject to the right of patronage (jus patronatus), one of the principal prerogatives of which is the right of presenting to the bishop a titular for a vacant benefice. It also occurs when, in virtue of a privilege or of a concordat, a chapter, a sovereign, or a government has the right to present to the pope the titular of a bishopric or of an important ecclesiastical office. If the pope accepts the person presented, he bestows the institutio canonica on the titular, The effect of this act is to give the candidate who has been presented (and who till then had only a jus ad rem, i. e. the right to be provided with the benefice) a jus in re or in beneficio, i.e. the right of exercising the functions connected with the benefice and of receiving revenues accruing from it. The right of institution to major benefices rests in the pope, {{but in the case of}} minor benefices it may belong to a bishop and his vicar-general, to a vicar capitular, or even to other ecclesiastics, in virtue of a foundation title dating from before the Council of Trent, or of a privilege, or of prescription. In all these cases the bishop has the right to examine the candidate, excepting candidates presented by universities recognized canonically; even this exception does not apply to parishes. Institution ought to be bestowed within the two months following the presentation, in the case of parish churches, but canon law has <b>not</b> <b>specified</b> any <b>fixed</b> time with regard to other benefices. However, if the bishop refuses to grant institution within the time appointed by a superior authority, the latter can make the grant itself.|$|R

40|$|Many {{systems have}} been {{proposed}} for automatic description and indexing of digital data, for posterior retrieval. One of such content-based indexing-and-retrieval systems, and the one used as a framework in this thesis, is the MUVIS system, which was developed at Tampere University of Technology, in Finland. Moreover, Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) utilising frame-based and region-based features has been a dynamic research area in the past years. Several {{systems have been}} developed using their specific segmentation, feature extraction, and retrieval methods. In this thesis, a framework to model a regionalised CBIR framework is presented. The framework does <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> or <b>fix</b> the segmentation and local feature extraction methods, which are instead considered as “black-boxes” so as to allow the application of any segmentation method and visual descriptor. The proposed framework adopts a grouping approach in order to correct possible over- segmentation faults and a spatial feature called region proximity is introduced to describe regions topology in a visual scene by a block-based approach. Using the MUVIS system, a prototype system of the proposed framework is implemented as a region-based feature extraction module, which integrates simple colour segmentation and region-based feature description based on colour and texture. The spatial region proximity feature represents regions and describes their topology by a novel metric proposed in this thesis based on the block-based approach and average distance calculation. After the region-based feature extraction step, a feature vector is formed which holds information about all image regions with their local low-level and spatial properties. During the retrieval process, those feature vectors are used for computing the (dis-) similarity distances between two images, taking into account each of their individual components. In this case a many-to-one matching scheme between regions characterised by a similarity maximisation approach is integrated into a query-by-example scheme. Retrieval performance is evaluated between frame-based feature combination and the proposed framework with two different grouping approaches. Experiments are carried out on synthetic and natural image databases and {{the results indicate that}} a promising retrieval performance can be obtained as long as a reasonable segmentation quality is obtained. The integration of the region proximity feature further improves the retrieval performance especially for divisible, object-based image content. Finally, frame-based and region-based texture extraction schemes are compared to evaluate the effect of a region on the texture description and retrieval performance utilising the proposed framework. Results show that significant degradations over the retrieval performance occur on region-based texture descriptors compared with the frame-based approaches...|$|R
