5|$|Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American {{author of}} gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She {{is perhaps best}} known for her series of novels, <b>The</b> <b>Vampire</b> Chronicles, {{revolving}} around the central character of Lestat. Books from <b>The</b> <b>Vampire</b> Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations, Interview with <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> in 1994, and Queen of the Damned in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Interview with <b>the</b> <b>Vampire,</b> while living in California, Rice wrote two historical novels, The Feast of All Saints and Cry to Heaven, along with four erotic novels (The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, Beauty's Release, and Beauty's Kingdom) under the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaure, and two more under the pseudonym Anne Rampling (Exit to Eden and Belinda). Rice then returned to <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> genre with <b>The</b> <b>Vampire</b> Lestat and The Queen of the Damned, her bestselling sequels to Interview with <b>the</b> <b>Vampire.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>vampire</b> is now {{a fixture}} in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and {{continued}} with 19th-century short stories, {{the first and most}} influential of which was John Polidori's The Vampyre (1819), featuring <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> Lord Ruthven. Lord Ruthven's exploits were further explored in a series of vampire plays in which he was the antihero. <b>The</b> <b>vampire</b> theme continued in penny dreadful serial publications such as Varney <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> (1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent vampire novel in history: Dracula by Bram Stoker, published in 1897.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> moonbane <b>vampire,</b> <b>the</b> persuasive <b>vampire,</b> <b>the</b> psychic <b>vampire,</b> <b>the</b> savage <b>vampire,</b> and <b>the</b> swarmform <b>vampire</b> {{appeared}} in Libris Mortis: The Book of Undead (2004).|$|R

5|$|In 2008 the BBC Three series Being Human {{became popular}} in Britain. It {{featured}} an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol. Another popular vampire-related show is CW's <b>The</b> <b>Vampire</b> Diaries. The continuing popularity of <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> theme has been ascribed {{to a combination}} of two factors: the representation of sexuality and the perennial dread of mortality.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} only ceased when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria {{sent her}} personal physician, Gerhard van Swieten, {{to investigate the}} claims of vampiric entities. He concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies, sounding the end of <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> epidemics. Despite this condemnation, <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> lived on in artistic works and in local superstition.|$|E

5|$|Vampirism and <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> {{lifestyle}} {{also represent}} a relevant part of modern day's occultist movements. The mythos of <b>the</b> <b>vampire,</b> his magickal qualities, allure, and predatory archetype express a strong symbolism {{that can be}} used in ritual, energy work, and magick, and can even be adopted as a spiritual system. <b>The</b> <b>vampire</b> has been part of the occult society in Europe for centuries and has spread into the American sub-culture as well for more than a decade, being strongly influenced by and mixed with the neo gothic aesthetics.|$|E

5|$|Following {{its debut}} in 1976, Interview with <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> {{received}} many negative reviews from critics, causing Rice to retreat temporarily from the supernatural genre. When <b>The</b> <b>Vampire</b> Lestat debuted in 1985, reactionboth from critics and from readerswas more positive, and the first hardcover edition of the book sold 75,000 copies. Upon its publication in 1988, The Queen of the Damned was given an initial hardcover printing of 405,000 copies. The novel was a main selection of the Literary Guild of America for 1988, and reached the #1 spot on The New York Times Best Seller list, staying on the list {{for more than four}} months.|$|E

5|$|In August 1974, {{after a year}} {{of therapy}} for her OCD, Rice {{attended}} the Squaw Valley Writer's Conference at Squaw Valley, conducted by writer Ray Nelson. While at the conference, Rice met her future literary agent, Phyllis Seidel. In October 1974, Seidel sold the publishing rights to Interview with <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> to Alfred A. Knopf for a $12,000 advance of the hardcover rights, {{at a time when most}} new authors were receiving $2,000 advances. Interview with <b>the</b> <b>Vampire</b> was published in May 1976. In 1977, the Rices traveled to both Europe and Egypt for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{where much}} of <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> {{folklore}} originates, <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, vampire superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that {{he had become a}} vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating the figure of <b>the</b> <b>vampire</b> to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E
