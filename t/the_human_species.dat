5|$|Michaud {{suggests}} that humanity could be impacted by {{an influx of}} extraterrestrial science and technology {{in the same way}} that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists. Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.|$|E
5|$|Sri Aurobindo {{argues that}} divine Brahman manifests as {{empirical}} reality through līlā, or divine play. Instead of positing {{that the world}} we experience is an illusion (māyā), Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> just as human species have evolved after the animal species.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E
5|$|Raël founded Clonaid in March 1997, {{shortly after}} the Dolly the Sheep cloning, believing that the process was {{important}} because <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> had been created by an extraterrestrial cloning project. On a practical level, Raël promoted the practice {{as a way to}} develop more desirable genetics and eventually prolong memories in new bodies. Shortly after Clonaid's launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that she had set up cloning laboratories and had hired a team of six scientists. She said she had limited knowledge of cloning but was skilled in selecting experts.|$|E
5|$|Survivors is a British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series {{produced by the}} BBC. It depicts {{the lives of a}} group of people who survived a virulent unknown strain of influenza which has wiped out most of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> According to the producers, the series is not a remake of the 1970s BBC television series Survivors (1975–1977), created by Terry Nation, but rather is loosely based on the novel of the same name that Nation wrote following the first series of the 1970s programme. Two series were produced of the new show: series 1 ran on BBC One and BBC HD in November–December 2008, and series 2 ran in January–February 2010, ending with a cliffhanger. The BBC announced on 13 April 2010 that, due to poor viewing figures and other considerations, Survivors had been cancelled.|$|E
50|$|This {{makes its}} status as a Homo fossil {{critically}} important to <b>the</b> study of <b>human</b> origins as it suggests that H. erectus was not <b>the</b> first <b>human</b> <b>species</b> to leave Africa and supports the argument made by some that H. erectus evolved in Asia and not Africa.|$|R
50|$|In 1840, Heinrich Heine {{also used}} the same analogy, in his essay on Ludwig Börne:Welcome be a {{religion}} that pours into the bitter chalice of <b>the</b> suffering <b>human</b> <b>species</b> some sweet, soporific drops of spiritual opium, some drops of love, hope and faith.|$|R

5|$|The Overlords {{are eager}} to escape from their own {{evolutionary}} dead end by studying the Overmind, so Rodricks's information is potentially of great value to them. By radio, Rodricks describes a vast burning column ascending from the planet. As the column disappears, Rodricks experiences {{a profound sense of}} emptiness when the children have gone. Then material objects and the Earth itself begin to dissolve into transparency. Jan reports no fear, but a powerful sense of fulfillment. The Earth evaporates in a flash of light. Karellen looks back at the receding Solar System and gives a final salute to <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

25|$|England, France, or Germany. This {{approach}} {{defines as}} its object <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> as a totality. This focus {{did not lead}} Boas to seek to reduce all forms of humanity and human activity to some lowest common denominator; rather, he understood the essence of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> to be the tremendous variation in human form and activity (an approach that parallels Charles Darwin's approach to species in general).|$|E
5000|$|In his Meditations On Hunting, Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset calls Polybius [...] "one {{of the few}} great {{minds that}} <b>the</b> turbid <b>human</b> <b>species</b> has managed to produce", and says {{the damage to the}} Histories is [...] "without {{question}} one of the gravest losses that we have suffered in our Greco-Roman heritage".|$|R

25|$|It is also {{sometimes}} {{argued that it}} is important for <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> as a whole to preserve a wide range of cultural diversity as possible, and that the protection of indigenous cultures is vital to this enterprise.|$|E
50|$|Existential {{nihilism}} is {{the belief}} that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. With respect to the universe, existential nihilism posits that a single <b>human</b> or even <b>the</b> entire <b>human</b> <b>species</b> is insignificant, without purpose and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. The meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of existentialism.|$|R
40|$|We face an awe-inspiring {{prospect}} in the 21 st century⎯the {{unification of}} the fund of knowledge for <b>the</b> entire <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> This article re-examines the medieval Memory Palace concept, a powerful mnemonic device, and the surrealistic art of M. C. Escher to uncover design patterns for information architecture {{that will help us}} build XMLbased tools for navigating very large information spaces...|$|R
50|$|Other {{perspectives}} on modularity come from evolutionary psychology, {{particularly from the}} work of Leda Cosmides and John Tooby. This perspective suggests that modules are units of mental processing that evolved in response to selection pressures. On this view, much modern human psychological activity is rooted in adaptations that occurred earlier in human evolution, when natural selection was forming <b>the</b> modern <b>human</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{species name}} is also called a binomial, that is, a two-term name. For example, the zoological name for <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> is Homo sapiens. This is usually {{italicized}} {{in print and}} underlined when italics are not available. In this case, Homo is the generic name and it is capitalized; sapiens indicates the species {{and it is not}} capitalized.|$|E
25|$|In 1758, Carl Linnaeus {{proposed}} what {{he considered}} to be natural taxonomic categories of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> He distinguished between Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens europaeus, and he later added four geographical subdivisions of humans: white Europeans, red Americans, yellow Asians and black Africans. Although Linnaeus intended them as objective classifications, his descriptions of these groups included cultural patterns and derogatory stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|Sherwood Washburn and Ashley Montagu {{were heavily}} {{influenced}} by the modern synthesis in biology and population genetics. In addition, they were influenced by Franz Boas, who had moved away from typological racial thinking. Rather than supporting Coon's theories, they and other contemporary researchers viewed <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species</b> as a continuous serial progression of populations and heavily criticised Coon's Origin of Races.|$|E
50|$|Homo antecessor is an extinct <b>human</b> <b>species</b> (or subspecies) {{dating from}} 1.2 million to 800,000 years ago, that was {{discovered}} by Eudald Carbonell, Juan Luis Arsuaga and J. M. Bermúdez de Castro."The unique mix of modern and primitive traits led the researchers to deem the fossils a new species, H. antecessor, in 1997". Regarding its great age the species must be related to Out of Africa I, the first series of hominin expansions into Eurasia, {{making it one of}} <b>the</b> earliest-known <b>human</b> <b>species</b> in Europe.|$|R
2500|$|Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future is a [...] "future history" [...] {{science fiction}} novel written in 1930 by the British author Olaf Stapledon. A work of {{unprecedented}} {{scale in the}} genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years and eighteen distinct <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> of which our own is the first. The book employs a narrative conceit that, under subtle inspiration, the novelist has unknowingly been dictated a channelled text from <b>the</b> last <b>human</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} identified a chlamydial protein, chlamydial protease/proteasome-like activity factor (CPAF), for degrading host transcription factors in cells infected with <b>the</b> <b>human</b> chlamydial <b>species</b> Chlamydia trachomatis or Chlamydia pneumoniae. We now report that functional CPAF was also produced during infection with the species Chlamydia muridarum, Chlamydia psittaci, and Chlamydia caviae, which primarily infect nonhuman hosts...|$|R
25|$|Though {{there is}} {{disagreement}} about {{the uniqueness of}} language to humans, babbling {{is not unique to}} <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b> Many animals produce similar ranges of sounds to human infants. These ranges of sounds are used in the young of many species to experiment with sound-making capabilities, or to practice for future vocal behavior. Similar to human infants, animal babbling is restricted by physiological development.|$|E
25|$|Hominization, in both {{science and}} religion, {{involves}} the process or {{the purpose of}} becoming human. The process and means by which hominization occurs is a key problem in theistic evolutionary thought, {{at least for the}} Abrahamic religions, which hold as a core belief that animals do not have immortal souls but that humans do. Many versions of theistic evolution insist on a special creation consisting of at least the addition of a soul just for <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of races is {{a token of}} change in <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> and suggests there is some significance in geographical separation. Lawrence noted that racial characteristics were inherited, not caused by the direct effect of, for instance, climate. As an example, he considered the way skin colour was inherited by children of African origin when born in temperate climates: how their colour developed without exposure to the sun, and how this continued through generations. This was evidence against the direct effect of climate.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{evidence}} {{has also been}} employed to resolve {{the question of whether}} there was any gene flow between early modern humans and Neanderthals, and to enhance our understanding of <b>the</b> early <b>human</b> migration patterns and splitting dates. By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating <b>the</b> entire <b>human</b> <b>species</b> since <b>the</b> last shared ancestor.|$|R
50|$|Homo habilis, {{probably}} <b>the</b> first early <b>human</b> <b>species,</b> occupied Olduvai Gorge approximately 1.9 {{million years}} ago (mya); then came a contemporary australopithecine, Paranthropus boisei, 1.8 mya, then Homo erectus, 1.2 mya.
