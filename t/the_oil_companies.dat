5|$|The {{difference}} was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and the taxes and revenue it brought to Alaska. Alyeska and <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> injected {{billions of dollars}} into the Alaska economy during the construction effort and the years afterward. In addition, the taxes paid by those companies altered the tax structure of the state. By 1982, {{five years after the}} pipeline started transporting oil, 86.5 percent of Alaska revenue came directly from the petroleum industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} has {{at times}} been damaged due to sabotage, human error, maintenance failures, and natural disasters. By law, Alyeska {{is required to}} report significant oil spills to regulatory authorities. The Exxon Valdez oil spill is the best-known accident involving Alaska oil, {{but it did not}} involve the pipeline itself. Following the spill, Alyeska created a rapid response force that is paid for by <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies,</b> including ExxonMobil, which was found liable for the spill.|$|E
5|$|In February 1969, {{before the}} SS Manhattan had even sailed from its East Coast {{starting}} point, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), an unincorporated joint group created by ARCO, British Petroleum, and Humble Oil in October 1968, asked for {{permission from the}} United States Department of the Interior to begin geological and engineering studies of a proposed oil pipeline route from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, across Alaska. Even before the first feasibility studies began, <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> had chosen the approximate route of the pipeline. Permission was given, and teams of engineers began drilling core samples and surveying in Alaska.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1989, Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi founded Braathens Helikopter. The {{shipping}} company had {{signed an agreement}} with <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil to provide helicopter transport for their crews to their offshore oil installations Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk. This {{was the first time the}} incumbent Helikopter Service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services. The initial agreement secured Braathens Helikopter a revenue of NOK800 million in the course of five years, and gave the company a 20% market share. Four 19-seet Aérospatiale Super Puma helicopters were ordered, each costing NOK60 million. Total investment costs were NOK300 million. Two helicopters were stationed at Stavanger Airport, Sola and two at Bergen Airport, Flesland. The initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{environmental}} groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. partially reversed Hart's decision. The appeals {{court said that}} although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. <b>The</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska and <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> fought {{objections}} to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the Alaska Legislature {{created the}} Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation {{to manage the}} {{investments}} of the Permanent Fund, and it passed the Permanent Fund Dividend program, which provided for annual payments to Alaskans from the interest earned by the fund. After two years of legal arguments about who should be eligible for payments, the first checks were distributed to Alaskans. After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund's value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to the Permanent Fund, the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a separate savings account established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies.</b> The Constitutional Budget reserve is run similar to the Permanent Fund, but money from it can be withdrawn {{to pay for the}} state's annual budget, unlike the Permanent Fund.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{supported}} {{the pipeline project}} even before the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial incentives, and granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E
5|$|Petronas, a Malaysian {{national}} {{oil and gas}} company, {{was formed}} in 1974. As a result, a concession system was changed into production sharing contract system (PSC) between Shell and Petronas. All the foreign oil companies including Shell required to obtain licenses from Petronas. The first two PSCs were signed on 30 November 1976. Foreign oil companies are required to keep not more than 41% of the oil produced until their original costs are recovered. After a return of their investments, <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> will keep 30% of the revenue after all operating costs and oil royalties are deducted. Petronas also formed a company named Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd which was {{directly involved in the}} exploration, development, and production of oil and gas in the country. Petronas also initiated the Baram Delta Gas Gathering (Bardegg) project which involves the collection and compression of gas from five fields, namely Betty, Bekor, Baram, Baronia, and West Lutong, located 10km to 45km offshore from Miri. This is to ensure the minimisation of gas loss during oil production. Petronas and Shell are also involved in educational outreach activities such as awarding scholarships to deserving students. Both companies are also involved in Malaysian first rig-to-reef project, in an effort to preserve bio-marine life in the sea offshore Miri. In this project, an abandoned offshore platform was made {{to become part of the}} Siwa reef. Both companies also started to establish Piasau Nature Reserve in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Upon his {{election}} to the presidency, Bolivia was South America's poorest nation. Morales' government did not initiate any fundamental change in Bolivia's economic structure, and in their National Development Plan (PDN) for 2006–10, they adhered largely to the country's previous liberal economic model. Bolivia's economy was based largely on the extraction of natural resources, with the nation having South America's second largest reserves of natural gas. As per {{his election}} pledge, Morales took increasing state control of this hydrocarbon industry with Supreme Decree 2870; previously, corporations paid 18% of their profits to the state, but Morales symbolically reversed this, so that 82% of profits went {{to the state and}} 18% to the companies. <b>The</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> threatened to take the case to the international courts or cease operating in Bolivia, but ultimately relented. Thus, where Bolivia had received $173 million from hydrocarbon extraction in 2002, by 2006 they received $1.3 billion. Although not technically a form of nationalization, Morales and his government referred to it as such, resulting in criticism from sectors of the Bolivian left. In June 2006, Morales announced his desire to nationalize mining, electricity, telephones, and railroads, and in February 2007 nationalized the Vinto metallurgy plant, refusing to compensate Glencore, which the government asserted had obtained the contract illegally. Although the FSTMB miners' federation called for the government to nationalise the mines, the government did not do so, instead stating that any transnational corporations operating in Bolivia legally would not be expropriated.|$|E
25|$|The mayor battled the country’s {{three major}} oil companies, the partly {{state-owned}} and Saudi Aramco managed Petron, Dutch-owned Pilipinas Shell and Caltex-Chevron. Atienza {{and the city}} council decreed {{that the presence of}} oil distribution depots in the heavily populated district of Pandacan poised as a security and safety danger and issued an eviction notice to <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies.</b> The concern was raised after the terror attacks that started on September 11, 2001 that destroyed the World Trade Center in New York. Atienza and the council decreed that the Pandacan district was to be converted from an industrial zone to a residential-commercial zone. A moratorium was set and <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> have agreed to gradually scale down their operations.|$|E
25|$|With {{the right}} {{connections}} at the Shipping Board, ships could be bought cheaply, which {{caused a lot}} of fraud. This system was too complicated for <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> however, so when World War II started, independents owned 39 percent of the world tanker fleet. This was especially because oil companies needed capital to invest in the growing oil market. By not buying the ships, but chartering, the bond rating of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>companies</b> was not affected, because the charter hire was not recognized as debt in that time. In 1934 H.T. Schierwater founded the International Tanker Owners’ Association — later International Association of Independent Tanker Owners or INTERTANKO — to protect the interests of these companies in a strongly fluctuating market.|$|E
