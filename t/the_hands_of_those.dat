5|$|Following {{a revolt}} in 1028, Harald's brother Olaf {{was forced into}} exile until he {{returned}} to Norway in early 1030. On hearing news of Olaf's planned return, Harald gathered 600 men from the Uplands to meet Olaf and his men upon their arrival in the east of Norway. After a friendly welcome, Olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030, in which Harald took part on his brother's side. The battle {{was part of an}} attempt to restore Olaf to the Norwegian throne, which had been captured by the Danish king Cnut the Great. The battle resulted in defeat for the brothers at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Norwegians who were loyal to Cnut, and Olaf was killed while Harald was badly wounded. Harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during the battle.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer {{continued}} to press Hitler {{to bring the}} economy to a total war footing. The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played into <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had been pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry {{at the expense of}} sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort. Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service. However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer. Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.|$|E

25|$|The {{blood of}} the {{innocent}} victims of last Friday's outrage—and {{of the victims of}} similar outrages in the North and in England—is on the hands of every man who has fired a gun or discharged a bomb in furtherance of the present campaign of violence in these islands—just as plainly as it is on <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who parked the cars and set the charges last Friday.

25|$|A siege {{was only}} worth {{undertaking}} if the attacker had previously ensured he had legal authority and {{had asked the}} state sovereign or even the emperor for permission. This was only possible where there had been actual or fabricated violations of the law, such as highway robbery, forgery or murder. <b>The</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had sworn allegiance to the sovereign were then tied; for legal reasons they could {{not come to the}} aid of the attacked lord.

5000|$|Moloney has {{suggested}} that the tactic may have been calculated to weaken the position of alleged [...] "hawks" [...] in republicanism—those who favoured armed action over electoral politics. At the same time Moloney argues that the widespread public revulsion would have strengthened the position <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in the IRA such as Gerry Adams who were considering how republicanism could abandon violence and focus on electoral politics. Peter Taylor wrote of the proxy bombs that, by such actions and the revulsion they caused in the community, IRA hardliners inadvertently strengthened <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> within <b>the</b> republican movement who argued that an alternative to armed struggle had to be found.|$|R
2500|$|On <b>the</b> other <b>hand,</b> {{many writers}} {{have pointed out}} how this battle was a humiliation for the Italian military. One student of Ethiopia, Donald N.

It also played no little part in motivating Italy's revanchist adventure in 1935". Levine {{also noted that the}} victory [...] "gave encouragement to isolationist and conservative strains that were deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture, strengthening <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who would strive to keep Ethiopia from adopting techniques imported from the modern West – resistances with which both Menelik and Ras Teferi/Haile Selassie would have to contend".|$|R
25|$|There was {{therefore}} no wholesale displacement of native lords in Scotland. In 1200 all the earls north of Forth and Clyde were still of Celtic descent; and {{as late as}} 1286, eight of the earldoms in Scotland were still in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> of native stock. Many native lords were granted or confirmed in their lands in feudal form. Within a few generations, regular intermarriage and the Wars of Independence had removed most {{of the differences between}} native and incomer, although not those between Highlander and Lowlander.|$|E
25|$|The {{two largest}} {{powers in the}} Sixth Seimas had vastly {{different}} views on how the land reform should take place. Sąjūdis (and Homeland Union that emerged from it) focused on returning the agricultural land to those that had lost it in the waves of Soviet collectivization and implemented it as a policy when in power before 1992. LDDP, on the other hand, prioritized maintaining the existing levels of production, which meant ensuring that the land stays in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who would work it most efficiently. Once in power, LDDP introduced changes to the Law on Land Reform, slowing down the process of restitution and limiting its scope.|$|E
25|$|After {{the rise}} of the Communists, most of the Church {{properties}} in Palestine remained in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> opposed to their ascendancy. The majority of these joined with the ROCOR. Some properties of the ROC remained completely closed until 1941, when the Politburo ordered the churches reopened. The Soviets invited all Orthodox prelates in the Middle East to go to Moscow to witness the installation of Patriarch Alexei I. In 1952 the Soviets reopened the Russian Palestine Society under the direction of Communist Party agents from Moscow, replaced Archimandrite Vladimir with Communist-trained Ignaty Polikarp. They won over many Christian Arabs with Communist sympathies to the ROC. The members of other branches of Orthodoxy refused to associate with the Soviet-led ROC in Palestine.|$|E

According to Davis and her lawyer, the pope told Davis to [...] "stay strong" [...] and gave her two rosaries. Vaticanist John L.

50|$|In Judah, {{the growing}} Assyrian {{pressure}} strengthened <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who sought accommodation {{to the enemy}} from the north, resulting in a change of leadership:In 736 and 735 Tiglath-pileser was again in the northwest, in the regions of Mount Nal and Urartu. Many in Judah would no doubt think that {{the time had come}} to submit or be crushed. In 735 it is altogether likely that a pro-Assyrian group felt itself strong enough to force Jotham into retirement and to place Ahaz on the throne. Although Jotham continued to live to his (Ahaz') twentieth year (II Kings 15:30), 732/31, it was Ahaz who directed affairs from 735.|$|R

25|$|At the Israeli Cabinet {{meeting the}} {{following}} day, both Begin and Eitan belittled intelligence {{reports that the}} likely culprit was the Abu Nidal group. Begin cut short his own advisor on terrorism, arguing that all Palestinian terrorists {{were members of the}} PLO, while Eitan ridiculed the intelligence staff for splitting hairs and demanded to strike at the PLO. Yet Abu Nidal had broken with Arafat and PLO in 1974 over a fundamental principle: namely, that the Palestinian national movement would adopt a phased piecemeal approach to secure a Palestinian state and embark on a political path. The lack of understanding of the difference between Palestinian groups and the total ignorance of Palestinian politics on the part an overwhelming majority of Israelis and Jews played into <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who did not wish to distinguish between the PLO and the Abu Nidal group. Thus, instead of an initiative to locate the Abu Nidal group in Damascus or Baghdad, the plan to invade Lebanon was activated.|$|E

Kowalski questions what the benevolent precogs in the film could become in <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who trained their skills for political intrigue.

500|$|The Zany (orig. Spanish el Pelele), also {{translated}} as the Idiot by some critics, appears {{only in the}} first four chapters and again at the end of chapter seven but serves a critical function in the novel. The Zany, who [...] "looked like a corpse when he was asleep" [...] and had eyes that [...] "saw nothing, felt nothing" [...] is critical to establishing the tone of the novel and triggering the novel's action. Critic John Walker argues that, by [...] "choosing the Idiot {{as a representative of the}} innocent, the a-political, who suffer the abuses of a totalitarian regime [...] Asturias shows how dictatorship corrupts people and destroys their values to the extent that compassion for one's companion in distress ceases to exist." [...] In fact, it becomes clear that the only happiness that the Zany experiences is through the memory of his dead mother. Asturias then shows how el Pelele, a mother-loving figure, [...] "suffers at <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who, long under the domination of the over-aggressive father figure, lack love and pity". Furthermore, el Pelele [...] is a tool that allows readers to see the psychological effects of living under a dictatorship ruled by terror. His murderous act seems to trigger the subsequent events of the novel and to impact on all the characters. Also important is the fact that the one moment of complete happiness experienced by the Zany in the novel takes place while he is in a dream-like state. Walker argues that this serves to highlight the harsh, nightmarish world of reality in which he has been forced to live.|$|E

The rise of the Chinese Communists in 1949 and the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 strengthened <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who saw resistance to Communism in East and Southeast Asia as dominating all other issues there. Ousted Chinese Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek, exiled to Taiwan, had strong U.S. political allies such as Claire Chennault.

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, a {{new method}} is {{proposed}} for hand tracking {{based on a}} density approximation and optimization method. Considering tracking as a classification problem, we train an approximator to recognize hands from its background. This procedure is done by extracting feature vector of every pixel in the first frame and then building an approximator to construct a virtual optimized surface of pixels for similarity of the frames which belong to <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> frames related to the movie. Received a new video frame, approximator is employed to test the pixels and build a surface. In this method, the features we use is color RGB corresponding to the feature space. Conducting simulations, it is demonstrated that hand tracking based on this method result in acceptable and efficient performance. The experimental results agree with the theoretical results.

However, the demand across the region for a sustainable, competitive and stable energy sector creates an ‘energy incentive’ that the Union can leverage to improve the rule of law and adherence to European rules. Furthermore, a juridical strengthening of the Energy Community Treaty will also strengthen <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> parties supporting energy liberalisation rules across the region, such as independent businesses, consumers and NGOs. In addition, there is likely to be significant spill-over effects from decisions of a European Energy Community Court operating in the region on the rule of law in general and the accession process in particular...|$|R
