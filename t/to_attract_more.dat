5|$|The {{crash of}} Flight 111 was a severe blow to Swissair. Ironically, the IFE {{system on the}} {{aircraft}} that was blamed for causing the accident was installed by Swissair <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> passengers in order to ease the airline's financial difficulties. Swissair finally went bankrupt shortly after the 9/11 attack in 2001, which caused a powerful disruption to the aviation transportation industry.|$|E

The train was marginally profitable, when mail and express revenue was included.|$|E
5|$|FreeStyleGames {{selected}} on-disc {{songs from}} {{a wider variety}} of music genres beyond rock music as to provide challenging guitar tracks for players, while their approach to licensing of songs for GHTV enabled them <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> musical acts to offer their music. Game reviewers found the on-disc soundtrack to be weak as it focused too much on more recent musical acts, while praising the wider variety across a larger time period that GHTV offered.|$|E

50|$|In 1987 Rob Vooren {{handed over}} the {{organisation}} for the last time, to a rotating committee. For reasons of credibility, and with a view <b>to</b> <b>attracting</b> <b>more</b> sponsors, it was decided in 1996 to change the name to Millennium Prize. Following the death of Paul Harland, who had not only won the award several times, but had also organised it, {{in addition to being}} on the jury more often than almost anyone else, the prize was given his name in 2003.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|E

5|$|Like Williams, Smith {{knew the}} Mad Dogs would face {{an uphill battle}} {{attracting}} fans once the traditional American football season started. As {{was the case in}} Birmingham, Smith persuaded the CFL to let them play their late-season home games on Sundays to avoid competing against high school and Tennessee/Ole Miss football. It was to no avail; late in the season the Mad Dogs struggled <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> than 10,000 people. Like Williams, Smith publicly blamed community apathy and media hostility for the lackluster attendance. The team went 9–9 in their only year.|$|E

5|$|Supernatural had low ratings {{during its}} second season. Viewers {{consisted}} mainly of teenage girls, with the CW trying <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> males. It ranked No. 216 {{relative to the}} position of other prime time network shows. With an average viewership of 3.14 million Americans, the show's future was in doubt at the season's end. Despite this, the series was renewed for a third season. According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 Supernatural convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} of Akihabara in Tokyo, {{where there are}} maid cafes featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or anime characters, is a notable attraction center for otaku. Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, retro video games, figurines, card games and other collectibles. Another popular location is Otome Road in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. In Nagoya, students from Nagoya City University started a project on ways to help promote hidden tourist attractions related to the otaku culture <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> otaku to the city.|$|E
5|$|Governor Crittenden {{resigned}} on July 31, 1850 {{to accept}} President Millard Fillmore's appointment as attorney general, and Helm ascended to the governorship. As governor, Helm vetoed a legislative plan to cover deficits {{in the public}} school fund by drawing money from the state's sinking fund, but the General Assembly overrode the veto. He urged the legislature to fund a survey of the state's mineral reserves and a census of the state's agricultural and manufacturing resources. He called for spending on internal improvements and for raising judges' salaries <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> qualified jurists to the bench. He also sought a ban on the carrying of concealed deadly weapons. The legislature did not act on any of these proposed reforms. The only part of Helm's agenda that did progress through the General Assembly was election reform.|$|E
50|$|Critics at {{the time}} {{questioned}} whether the property would be better suited for possible future expansion of the Baltimore Convention Center.

40|$|The comfort {{perceived}} by passengers during transport in public transport plays a vital role, and its improvement can lead <b>to</b> <b>attracting</b> <b>more</b> customers. For this reason, {{there is a}} constant effort to improve the comfort of the passenger. This thesis deals with the objective measurement of the maneuvers of MHD in Brno (tram, trolleybus, bus) with the XL Meter and together with the subjective evaluation of the standing and sitting figurant, determines the limit values of longitudinal and transverse acceleration for comfortable ride and dangerous ride, which can lead to accidents to passengers...|$|R
5|$|In 1997, SAS {{announced}} {{that it was going to}} reduce its commission to travel agents from 9 to 5%. Braathens followed, reducing from 8 to 5% from 1 January 1998. However, to try <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> business passengers, the airline retained the 8% commission on their international routes. At the same time, the Government of Norway abandoned its old regime of negotiating prices with the airlines for state-employed civil servants' flights. Instead, they introduced an annual tender for the routes. It was awarded to SAS, who also won all subsequent tenders. For Braathens SAFE, this meant that state-employed civil servants only flew on routes where SAS did not fly. The contract was worth NOK500 million for SAS.|$|E
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; {{he did not like}} the idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives so much that they had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{numbers at}} Redland were further boosted by a {{marketing}} campaign by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> people, especially students, {{to use the}} station. The work won a Department for Transport Community Rail Marketing Award in 2007. The Severnside CRP also formed {{a support group for}} the station, and improved the provision of timetabling information through the use of simplified departure timetable posters. In 2008, they helped to renovate and repaint the station building. It was decorated in 2009 by students from Fairfield School, who created a mural of Victorian characters with incongruous details such as mobile phones, sunglasses and funny hats. The work won a Community Rail Award.|$|E

5000|$|Price {{skimming}} is {{a product}} pricing strategy by which a firm charges the highest initial price that customers will pay. As the demand of the first customers is satisfied, the firm lowers the price <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> another, <b>more</b> price-sensitive segment.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, our {{involvement}} with discussing with potential {{students and their}} parents before they apply for an undergraduate Computer Science programme, made us realise that there exist patterns in people’s minds about Computer Science studies and profession. These patterns form misconceptions, which we identified as myths. In this paper, we present ten of them. We argue that these {{could be used as a}} promotion tool <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> potential students. Bearing in mind that Computer Science programmes all over the world have suffered a decrease in admissions, we believe that a good marketing policy that will lift public misconceptions about Computer Science will contribute <b>to</b> <b>attracting</b> <b>more</b> students <b>to</b> the discipline...|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} dress code dust-up made headlines, a letter was sent to The New York Times by the Women's Professional Billiard Association (WPBA), by its {{president}} Belinda Bearden, disputing the facts as reported. According to the WPBA, {{the dress code}} was self-imposed by the players {{in an attempt to}} improve the image of women's pool and <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> spectators and press to the sport, and that Balukas was the only participant at Binghamton unwilling to comply. They further explained that Balukas first withdrew from the women's division but later returned and asked to play after player assignments had been completed. A vote to allow her to play resulted in a tally of 8–7 in her favor, but after they moved to consult a player who was not present for the vote, Balukas again withdrew from the competition, and that was where the matter had ended.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} older {{citizens}} of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays entering the Castro District were growing, however, and in 1973, when two gay men tried to open an antique shop, the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted {{to prevent them from}} receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the Castro Street Fair in 1974 <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.|$|E
5|$|The Kerala {{school of}} {{astronomy}} and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created {{a number of}} important mathematics concepts, including series expansion for trigonometric functions. Following the instructions of the Wood's despatch of 1854, both the princely states, Travancore and Cochin, launched mass education drives with support from agencies, mainly based on castes and communities and introduced a system of grant-in-aid <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>more</b> private initiatives. The efforts by leaders, Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali and Kuriakose Elias Chavara towards aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state, with the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches, {{led to the development of}} mass education in Kerala.|$|E
30|$|Visual {{communication}} is still {{dominant in the}} museum of today. However, all experience {{of the world is}} multisensory, whether or not it has been designed as such [26]. The benefits of a multisensory approach to the examination of historic objects and practices have been argued [27, 28] and {{since the turn of the}} century many heritage institutions have been staging multisensory exhibits. The inclusion of smell in museums can be related <b>to</b> <b>attracting</b> <b>more</b> visitors, adding a ‘dose of reality’ to the displays, exploring the connections between olfaction and other senses and even claiming a space for perfume as an art form.|$|R
40|$|This {{empirical}} study identifies {{factors that}} {{have contributed to the}} differential growth rates between the so-called "sun-belt" states {{on the one hand and}} the so-called "frost-belt" states on the other hand. The model deals with the 48 contiguous states and the 1975 - 1980 time period. It finds that the lower living costs in the sun-belt states have contributed a great deal to their growth rate by attracting migrants. Furthermore, the the generally warmer temperatures and greater presence of sunshine have contributed <b>to</b> <b>attracting</b> <b>more</b> migrants <b>to</b> the sun-belt and hence have contributed to the higher economic growth of the latter. ...|$|R
