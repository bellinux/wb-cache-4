5|$|The 1707 Acts of Union had merged the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland {{into one}} {{national}} entity, but they retained separate legal systems. However, the House of Lords became {{the highest court}} of appeal in both English and Scottish law, and as a result, from 1707 Scottish cases on appeal from the Court of Session were sent there. <b>To</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> cases, a barrister had {{to be familiar with}} both Scottish and English law, and Murray found his niche, acting in Scottish cases in the House of Lords as early as 1733. His work in Moncrieff v Moncrieff in 1734 established Murray as a brilliant young barrister praised for his performance by Lords Cowper and Parker. After Moncrieff, Murray was involved in almost every case in the House of Lords, whether it had been appealed from a Scottish court or not.|$|E

25|$|The {{agriculture}} objectives on {{the desert}} lands are often questioned; the desert farm lands which were offered regularly at different levels and prices were restricted to a limited group of elites selected very carefully, who later profiteered retailing the granted large desert farm land by pieces. This allegedly transforms the desert farms to tourist resorts, hits all government plans to develop and improve {{the conditions of the}} poor, and causes serious negative impact on agriculture and the overall national economy over time. One company, for example, bought over 70 hectare of large desert farm for a price as low as EGP 0.05 per square meter and now sells for EGP 300 per square meter. In numbers, 70 hectares bought for about US$6,000 in 2000 sells for over US$3.7 million in 2007. Currently, no clear solution exists <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> activities.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacities}} and demands {{model has been}} proposed {{to account for the}} heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the capacity that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the demands placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and cognitive or affective issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or self esteem or inadequate language skills or external factors such as peer pressure, time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> pressures. However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.|$|E

Middleware tailored for specific data models is a common approach <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> challenges, but middleware commonly reproduces scalable services already present in many distributed file systems. We present DataMods, an abstraction over existing services found in large-scale storage systems that allows middleware to take advantage of existing, highly tuned services.
