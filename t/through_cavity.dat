40|$|A {{continuous}} quantum field, {{such as a}} propagating beam of light, may {{be characterized}} by a squeezing spectrum that is inhomogeneous in frequency.

We find theoretically that such complex squeezing is a component of ponderomotive squeezing of light <b>through</b> <b>cavity</b> optomechanics. We propose a detection scheme, called synodyne detection, which reveals complex squeezing and allows the accounting of measurement back-action.

The course was held in Ebeltoft, Denmark, from 8 - 17 June, 2010 in collaboration with Aarhus University, with the topic 'RF for Accelerators' While this topic has been covered by CAS previously, early in the 1990 s and again in 2000, it was recognized that recent advances in the field warranted an updated course. Following introductory courses covering the background physics, the course attempted to cover all aspects of RF for accelerators; from RF power generation and transport, <b>through</b> <b>cavity</b> and coupler design, electronics and low level control, to beam diagnostics and RF gymnastics. The lectures were supplemented with several sessions of exercises, which were completed by discussion sessions on the solutions.

While cavities have a net cooling effect on cluster gas, young, expanding cavities drive shocks that increase the local entropy. Cavities also produce radial filaments of thermal gas and are sources of cluster cosmic rays that diffuse <b>through</b> <b>cavity</b> walls, as in Virgo where a radio lobe surrounds a radial thermal filament. Cosmic rays also make the hot gas locally buoyant, allowing large masses of low entropy gas to be transported out beyond the cooling radius. Successive cavities maintain a buoyant outflow that preserves the cluster gas temperature and gas fraction profiles and dramatically reduces the cooling rate onto the central black hole.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{technique}} to generate entanglement between distant cavities by using entanglement swapping involving atomic momenta. For the proposed scheme, {{we have two}} identical atoms, both initially in their ground state, each incident on far apart cavities with particular initial momenta. The two cavities are prepared initially in superposition of zero and one photon state. First, we interact each atom with a cavity in dispersive way. The interaction results into atom-field entangled state. Then we perform EPR state measurement on both atomic momenta state which is an analog of Bell measurement. The EPR state measurement is designed by passing the atoms <b>through</b> <b>cavity</b> beam splitters which transfers the atomic momentum state into superposition state. Finally, these atoms are detected by the detector. After the detection of the atoms, we can distinguish that cavities {{in one of the}} Bell states. This process leads to two distant cavity fields entanglement. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
