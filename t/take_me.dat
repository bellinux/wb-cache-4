5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what {{make a person}} unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> Home garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
