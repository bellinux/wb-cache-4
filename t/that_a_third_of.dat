5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations. There are no plans {{in the foreseeable future}} {{for the vast majority of}} BBC and commercial stations to transition from DAB to DAB+. Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{reproduction}} is complex, reflecting {{the differences in}} lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within {{the life cycle of}} a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 National Family Health Survey, it was {{reported}} that the city's total fertility rate is 1.8, which is below the replacement rate. Only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines (BCG, measles and full courses of polio and DPT), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut. The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births. The survey also reported <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic, and up to 20% of children are underweight, while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes.|$|E

5|$|One {{specific}} {{failure in}} the massive operation was the critical lack of transport aircraft for the operation, an unsolved flaw that had dogged every large-scale airborne operation the Allies had conducted. In the original planning for Varsity, an extra airborne division, the 13th, had been included; however, a lack of transport aircraft to drop this division led to it being excluded from the final plan. Thus, the unsolved problem of a shortage of transport aircraft meant <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the planned troops to be used were discarded, weakening the fighting power of the airborne formation. In the event, the airborne troops actually employed were sufficient to overwhelm the defenders.|$|E
5|$|The first {{election}} {{under the}} 1776 constitution {{took place in}} 1781, and the system would not change again until 1838. In the interim, {{a number of problems}} had cropped up in the appointment process, and the 1838 election saw the passage of a number of constitutional amendments that fundamentally changed how Senators were chosen. The electoral college was abolished, terms were lengthened to six years with rotating elections such <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the senate would be elected every two years, and a single Senator was chosen by direct election from each county and the City of Baltimore. The Senate no longer acted as the Governor's Council, although they would continue to confirm the Governor's appointments. Constitutional changes altered this new system slightly in 1851, when terms were shortened to four years, and 1864, when Baltimore City was given three Senate districts rather than one, but substantial change to the structure of the Senate did not come again until 1964.|$|E

25|$|Anti-gay {{groups have}} often argued that more {{homosexual}} men are sexual abusers than heterosexuals, {{on the grounds}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> abusers target boys rather than girls. This is far {{in excess of the}} proportion of gay men in the population. It is thus argued that gay men are disproportionately likely to offend.|$|E

Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping.|$|E

25|$|David Spiegelhalter of Cambridge University {{explained}} that the psychological effects of the media coverage include increased feelings of risk and vulnerability.

25|$|Generally speaking, women {{raised in}} the Western world or {{developed}} countries in Asia live long enough so <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> their life is spent in post-menopause. For some women, the menopausal transition represents a major life change, similar to menarche in the magnitude of its social and psychological significance. Although {{the significance of the}} changes that surround menarche is fairly well recognized, in countries such as the United States, the social and psychological ramifications of the menopause transition are frequently ignored or underestimated.|$|E

25|$|Allegations {{concerning}} {{the corruption of}} the anti-doping system possibly employed during the Games surfaced in 2015, continuing through that year and 2016.

25|$|To {{achieve these}} targets, China needs to address {{existing}} challenges to {{its efforts to}} control tuberculosis. Foremost is the serious epidemic of MDR tuberculosis. WHO estimates <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the world's cases of MDR tuberculosis are in China, even though the country has only 15% of the global burden of tuberculosis. The recent expansion of DOTS should help to limit the development of MDR tuberculosis. But reduction of the existing burden of multidrug resistance will take time, especially since poor-quality DOTS services in some areas and inappropriate treatment of tuberculosis {{in parts of the}} hospital system continue to generate new cases of MDR tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Many open slots for {{students}} at many private universities begin to fill up early {{in the last year}} of school. In 2001 it was estimated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> slots for next year's first-year class were filled by December, which was an increase from one-fifth a decade earlier. Estimates made around 2011 suggested that 45% of positions were taken by December. There are reports for specific schools filling up by December 2011 for the 2012–2013 first-year class. For example, American University filled 31% of its class; Columbia 45%, Davidson 40%, Emory 32%, Hamilton 38%, Kenyon 29%, Middlebury 45%, Sarah Lawrence 21%, Smith 20%, and others.|$|E

25|$|In Scotland teinds {{were the}} tenths of certain produce {{of the land}} {{appropriated}} {{to the maintenance of}} the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the Privy Council of Scotland provided <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the revenues of lands should be applied to paying the clergy of the reformed Church of Scotland. In 1925 the system was recast by statute and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a fixed value in money. The Court of Session acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.|$|E
25|$|Gutasaga {{contains}} {{legends of}} how the island was settled by Þieluar and populated by his descendants. It also tells <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the population had to emigrate and settle in southern Europe, a tradition associated with the migration of the Goths, whose name has the same origin as Gutes, the native name {{of the people of}} the island. It later tells that the Gutes voluntarily submitted to the king of Sweden and asserts that the submission was based on mutual agreement, and notes the duties and obligations of the Swedish King and Bishop in relationship to Gotland. According to some historians, it is therefore an effort not only to write down the history of Gotland, but also to assert Gotland's independence from Sweden.|$|E
25|$|For {{three years}} in a row, more than 30 percent of Mississippi's {{residents}} have been classified as obese. In a 2006 study, 22.8 percent of the state's children were classified as such. Mississippi had the highest rate of obesity of any U.S. state from 2005 to 2008, and also ranks first in the nation for high blood pressure, diabetes, and adult inactivity. In a 2008 study of African-American women, contributing risk factors were shown to be: lack of knowledge about body mass index (BMI), dietary behavior, physical inactivity and lack of social support, defined as motivation and encouragement by friends. A 2002 report on African-American adolescents noted a 1999 survey which suggests <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> children were obese, with higher ratios for those in the Delta.|$|E
