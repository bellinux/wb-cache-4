5|$|Because of the {{construction}} of an embankment at nearby Bainbridge Street, the Pennsylvania Railroad was forced to build a new station at West High Street in 1900. After 15years, the Pennsylvania replaced the station. The new station was constructed out of Indiana Limestone in a similar style to the nearby Masonic Homes built by the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. On July4, 1915, the Liberty Bell made a stop at the station while being transported to the PanamaPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California. The Pennsylvania began electrifying its line between Philadelphia and Harrisburg in 1937, a task which was completed on January15, 1938. In 1977, the deteriorating station building was closed. Prior to the introduction of the Keystone Service in 1981, the Elizabethtown station was served by <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Apple,</b> the Silverliner Service, and the Keystone. From 1991 to 1995, the Atlantic City Express served the station on weekends. The Three Rivers made stops in Elizabethtown in 1995 and 1996.|$|E
