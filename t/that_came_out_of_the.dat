5|$|MDSHA has {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} east–west corridor between the MD 28–MD 97 intersection at Norbeck and the I-95–MD 198 interchange, a corridor that forms the most direct route from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 portion of the corridor call for expanding the route to a four-lane divided highway from MD 650 to US 29 and widening the highway to six lanes from the Montgomery–Prince George's County line to west of I-95. The proposals also include adding a center turn lane to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike intersection and constructing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has also {{conducted a study}} concerning MD 198 between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed improvements are associated with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has greatly increased activity at Fort Meade. The preferred alternative <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study was to expand MD 198 from the Baltimore–Washington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-lane divided highway and to construct a flyover ramp from westbound MD 32 to westbound MD 198 to supplement the existing dumbbell interchange.|$|E

Another agreement <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pretoria Minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that {{a new way of}} governance was being created for South Africa, and that further violence would only hinder this process. However, violence still continued in Kwazulu-Natal, which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk. Moreover, internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached.|$|E

25|$|Whalers and sealers {{had been}} visiting the South Australian coast since 1802 and by 1819 {{there was a}} {{permanent}} camp on Karta, Kangaroo Island. Many of these men were escaped convicts, sealers, whalers who had brought Tasmanian Aboriginal women with them but they also raided the mainland for women, particularly Ramindjeri. Originally the most heavily populated area in Australia, a smallpox epidemic had travelled down the River Murray before colonisation, possibly killing {{a majority of the}} Ngarrindjeri. Funeral rites and cultural practices were disrupted, family groups merged and land use became altered.

25|$|During the Vietnam War the RAE {{maintained}} {{a force of}} about 1,000 personnel in South Vietnam where they served {{as part of the}} 1st Australian Task Force. Following {{the end of the war}} the size of the Australian Army was decreased in line with the abolition of the national service scheme and as a consequence of this and a number of lessons <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deployment to Vietnam the RAE underwent a series of changes. One of the most significant changes came in 1972 and was the decision to establish full regimental sized engineer units, as opposed to squadron or company sized units. These units were initially known as Field Regiments, but have subsequently become known as Combat Engineer Regiments. As a part of this restructuring the RAE was reorganised to raise one regiment for each brigade and the Corps lost its responsibility for maintaining water transport and engineering stores.|$|E

500|$|Yasmin Bannerman played local residents' campaigner Jessica in Series 3. Bannerman and Bathurst did {{not know}} that Jessica and David would have a {{full-blown}} affair after their kiss in Episode 3, as David was seen as too much of a [...] "jittery type". The character appears in five episodes. Bathurst was more impressed with the storylines <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affair, rather than the affair itself: [...] "It was the deception, the guilt and the recrimination rather than the actual affair, which was neither interesting nor remarkable".|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody {{came up to me}} and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E
500|$|Although the album's singles {{featured}} {{quite a few}} B-sides, only [...] "Exit Stonehenge" [...] ({{from the}} [...] "Spoonman" [...] single) was sourced from the Superunknown recording sessions in 1993.

[...] "Tighter & Tighter", [...] "No Attention", and [...] "An Unkind", all of which later appeared on the band's 1996 album, Down on the Upside, were attempted during the Superunknown recording sessions.

500|$|... 7 February {{marked the}} visit of Bolton Wanderers to Old Trafford on the 40th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, which killed seven United players, eight sports journalists and several club officials. Having gone a goal down to Bob Taylor's scrappy shot that bamboozled Gary Neville and Schmeichel, Andy Cole struck in a late {{equaliser}} with five minutes to go. In injury time, Gary Neville connected with a floating corner provided by Beckham, only for it to ricochet off the crossbar. Although they gained a point, United increased their lead due to their contenders' inability to close the gap. They typically left it late to snatch the three points in their next match – away to Aston Villa – but followed it up against Derby County with a somewhat polished 2–0 victory. The only drawback <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match was a hamstring injury suffered by Giggs that ruled {{him out of the}} FA Cup replay away to Barnsley and remained serious doubt for first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at Monaco. Giggs joined Scholes and Keane on the injury list, who both had knee injuries. Another early morning kick-off had meant United had the chance to open up an 11-point lead {{at the top of the}} table if they could beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. They did via a rare goal from Phil Neville, which also ended the Blues' title challenge. Although Arsenal had three games in hand, a third successive title was within United's grasp.|$|E
500|$|Bathurst reprised {{the role}} in the Cold Feet series, which ran for five years from 1998 to 2003. He {{described}} the character of David as an [...] "emotional cripple", originally with little depth. The third series features an affair between David and a political activist played by Yasmin Bannerman. Bathurst appreciated the opportunity to bring some depth to a previously one-dimensional character, but was more impressed with the storylines <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affair, rather than the affair itself: [...] "It was the deception, the guilt and the recrimination rather than the actual affair, which was neither interesting nor remarkable". Like other cast members, Bathurst was able to suggest storylines as the series went on; one episode features David celebrating his fortieth birthday and Bathurst suggested the character could get a Harley-Davidson motorbike. Granada paid {{for him to take}} motorcycle lessons and a test. On the day before taking his test, the filming of a scene where David takes off on his new bike was scheduled. Bathurst [...] "wobbled, missed the camera and crashed into the pavement", leading director Simon Delaney to exclaim it was the funniest thing he had ever seen. In another episode, David buys a racehorse – ostensibly as a birthday present for his wife – in a plot born out of Bathurst's own love of horseracing. The role made him more widely recognisable and he often received prospective scripts that were [...] "obvious rewrites of the character". He turned them down, preferring to play a [...] "good person", which would be more interesting from a dramatic point of view.|$|E
500|$|Higgins {{ventured into}} real estate at [...] first, {{and with the}} money that he saved as a logger, he started the Higgins Manufacturing Company to {{manufacture}} bricks. The business sparked his interest in oil and gas, as he used it for his kilns to burn the bricks evenly. He decided to travel to Pennsylvania to learn about these fuels and study the geographical features that give signs {{to the presence of}} underground oil. Studying geology on his own, he dedicated himself to finding these clues by reading all the United States Geological Survey reports and books that he could find. The details he learned reminded him of what some Beaumont locals back home referred to as [...] "Sour Hill Mound", a place where he frequently brought his Sunday school students for outings. This mound was described as [...] "sour" [...] due to the unpleasant sulfur smell <b>that</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> springs around it. Convinced that this salt dome mound had oil below it, Higgins first partnered with George O'Brien, George Carroll, Emma John, and J.F. Lanier to form the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company in 1892. It was during this time that other formally trained geologists dismissed the idea of finding oil along the gulf coast region of the United States. Higgins' personal integrity was even challenged by the local newspaper. However, his informal training in geology influenced his belief that the Spindletop field contained oil below due to the presence of mineral water and gas seepage, and he managed to convince the partners to proceed with the venture. Work began the following year, but all three of the shallow drilling attempts failed to locate oil due to the shifting sands and unstable clay under the hill. Higgins held onto his ownership and leases of land over the salt dome, but resigned from the company.|$|E
