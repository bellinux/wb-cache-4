5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects are needed, {{which is also}} the case for stochastic processes, to prove that <b>they</b> <b>exist</b> mathematically. There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a measurable space of functions, defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.|$|E

5|$|Vulcanoids, {{being an}} entirely new class of {{celestial}} bodies, would be interesting in their own right, but discovering whether or not <b>they</b> <b>exist</b> would yield insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. If <b>they</b> <b>exist</b> they might contain material {{left over from the}} earliest period of planet formation, and help determine the conditions under which the terrestrial planets, particularly Mercury, formed. In particular, if vulcanoids exist or did exist in the past, they would represent an additional population of impactors that have affected no other planet but Mercury, making that planet's surface appear older than it actually is. If vulcanoids are found not to exist, this would place different constraints on planet formation and suggest that other processes have been at work in the inner Solar System, such as planetary migration clearing out the area.|$|E
5|$|Vulcanoids, should <b>they</b> <b>exist,</b> {{would be}} {{difficult}} to detect due to the strong glare of the nearby Sun, and ground-based searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not reveal any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E

5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, <b>they</b> <b>exist</b> in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, {{it is impossible to}} control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Currently, major Italian opera theaters {{maintain}} ballet companies. <b>They</b> <b>exist</b> {{to provide}} incidental and ceremonial dancing in many operas, such as Aida or La Traviata. These dance companies usually maintain a separate ballet season and perform the standard repertoire of classical ballet, little {{of which is}} Italian. The Italian equivalent of the Russian Bolshoi Ballet and similar companies that exist only to perform ballet, independent of a parent opera theater is La Scala Ballet, which is {{under the direction of}} Frèdèric Olivieri. Since 1979 there has existed in Italy a modern dance company, the Aterballetto, based in Reggio Emilia. The company performs worldwide under the leadership of choreographer Mauro Bigonzetti.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{were also}} shipped from {{south-western}} Asia to Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Canary Islands, the Americas and Australia. Dromedaries were introduced into Spain in 1020 AD and to Sicily in 1059 AD. Camels were exported to the Canary Islands in 1405 during the European colonisation of the area, {{and are still}} extant there, especially in Lanzarote and {{to the south of}} Fuerteventura. Attempts to introduce dromedaries into the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil were made between the 17th and 19th centuries; some were imported to the western United States in the 1850s and some to Namibia in the early 1900s, but presently <b>they</b> <b>exist</b> in small numbers or are absent in these areas.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{exist in}} an {{alternate}} Domain, and {{are referred to}} as creatures with no natural defenses. Most believe that they are fictional creatures; but a few, including the Dewclaws, know that <b>they</b> <b>exist.</b> This was developed further in 2003 by the introduction of the character Danielle, a human who enters the animal world via the Bermuda Triangle and transforms into a rabbit. However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. The series features jokes on a variety of topics. Many draw satirical parallels between its world and ours, making fun and sometimes social commentary on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture, for example; in January 2008 the Predator's Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
5|$|Since HD 28185 b orbits in its star's {{habitable}} zone, {{some have}} speculated {{on the possibility}} of life on worlds in the HD 28185 system. While it is unknown whether gas giants can support life, simulations of tidal interactions suggest that HD 28185 b could harbor Earth-mass satellites in orbit around it for many billions of years. Such moons, if <b>they</b> <b>exist,</b> may be able to provide a habitable environment, though it is unclear whether such satellites would form in the first place. Additionally, a small planet in one of the gas giant's Trojan points could survive in a habitable orbit for long periods. The high mass of HD 28185 b, of over six Jupiter masses, actually makes either of these scenarios more likely than if the planet was about Jupiter's mass or less.|$|E
5|$|After Cain's disappearance, Mary becomes {{head of the}} Hargreaves. Augusta {{possesses}} Alexis, {{and seeks}} out Mary in the mausoleum Cain had built before leaving to confront Alexis. Augusta reveals that she manipulated Alexis into abusing his sons and trying to resurrect her for her amusement. Before she can kill Mary, Augusta triggers Cain's trap in the mausoleum and dies. Years later, Mary is married to Oscar and pregnant with their child, although she still waits for his return. Crehador, a medium close to Cain, sets up a tea party for Mary, fulfilling Cain's promise; he then reminisces on how he found Cain being held by Riff's corpse within the ruined tower. The bunkoban-exclusive epilogue expands the ending slightly. It shows an elderly Mary, who lies on her deathbed attended by a woman nearby and hears the laughter of Jizabel's ghost as he plays with his pet sheep. Sensing a presence nearby, she dies, and taking the form of her ten-year-old self, her soul joins Cain hand-in-hand at a tea party with their friends and loved ones—although <b>they</b> <b>exist</b> as spirits, a boy nearby can hear them.|$|E

5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that <b>they</b> <b>exist</b> externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E
5|$|Astaroth {{is shown}} to be a large, muscular, bald, dark-skinned {{humanoid}} with solid white eyes.

Astaroth stands 7 feet 3 inches tall, making him the largest character with a recorded height in the series.|$|E
5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in any manner or form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where <b>they</b> <b>exist,</b> performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E
