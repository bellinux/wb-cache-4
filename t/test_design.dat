25|$|One way of {{modelling}} constraints {{is using}} the refinement mechanism in the classification tree method. This, however, {{does not allow for}} modelling constraints between classes of different classifications. Lehmann and Wegener introduced Dependency Rules based on Boolean expressions with their incarnation of the CTE. Further features include the automated generation of test suites using combinatorial <b>test</b> <b>design</b> (e.g. all-pairs testing).|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{upheld the}} {{fairness}} {{and validity of}} the examinations that IOS developed and administered. IOS is an Illinois company that specializes in designing entry-level examinations and promotional examinations for fire and police departments; and other public safety and corporate organizations. The Court cited examples of how the IOS <b>test</b> <b>design,</b> criteria, and methodology included: interviews, observations, education, test format compliance, and independent [...] With that information, IOS produced a test that reduced adverse impact to the protected class.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>test</b> <b>design</b> {{requires}} that the substance be tested on one rabbit initially, {{and the effect of}} the substance on the skin must be ascertained before it can be introduced into the eye. If a rabbit shows signs of [...] "severe pain" [...] or distress it must be immediately killed, the study terminated and the compound may not be tested on other animals. In tests where severe eye irritancy is considered likely, a washout should closely follow testing {{in the eye of the}} first rabbit. In the UK, any departure from these guidelines requires prior approval from the Secretary of State.|$|E

[...] The Standards cover essential topics in testing including validity, reliability/errors of measurement, and fairness in testing. [...] The book also establishes standards related to testing operations including <b>test</b> <b>design</b> and development, scores, scales, norms, score linking, cut scores, test administration, scoring, reporting, score interpretation, test documentation, and rights and responsibilities of test takers and test users. [...] Finally, the Standards cover topics related to testing applications, including psychological testing and assessment, workplace testing and credentialing, educational testing and assessment, and testing in program evaluation and public policy.|$|E
