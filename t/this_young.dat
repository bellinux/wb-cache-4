5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know I asked him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that <b>this</b> <b>young</b> pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E
5|$|Jan Zamoyski {{was born}} on 19 March 1542 to Stanisław Zamoyski and Anna Herburt in Skokówka. He started his {{education}} in a school in Krasnystaw {{but when he was}} thirteen years old he was sent to study abroad; from 1555 to 1559 he was a page at the royal court in Paris. Already at <b>this</b> <b>young</b> age he attended lectures at the Sorbonne University and Collège de France. In 1559 he briefly visited Poland, then attended the University of Strasbourg; after a few months there he moved to University of Padua, where from 1561 he studied law and received a doctorate in 1564. During his years abroad he converted from Calvinism to Roman Catholicism.|$|E

5|$|Rand {{did not use}} a {{specific}} architect {{as a model for}} Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked <b>this</b> <b>young</b> woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the neighbor wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.|$|E
5|$|Austen met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never saw each other again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797. Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of <b>this</b> <b>young</b> man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. Austen received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, then realized she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. Austen biographer Park Honan suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} to a Telugu Naidu Family, Karthik began playing cricket {{at the age of}} 10, after a two-year stint living in Kuwait, where his father Krishna Kumar worked. He studied in Fahaheel Al- Watanieh Indian Private School while in Kuwait. Karthik was taught by his father, a first-division cricketer from Chennai. Disappointed that his own career was {{hindered}} when he was forced by his family to put his education first, Karthik's father did not want his son to suffer the same way, and trained him hard from an early age. Karthik honed his reflexes at <b>this</b> <b>young</b> age by having his father throw hard leather balls at him at high speed. Initially he played in the youth teams for Tamil Nadu as a batsman who was learning to keep wicket, and was regarded by Robin Singh as having very high levels of fitness.|$|E

5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which <b>this</b> <b>young</b> worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

30|$|Changes in {{legislation}} {{over the}} past several years have led to an increase in the conduct of pediatric clinical trials, and although the FDA PRO guidance acknowledges the importance of PRO measures in pediatric populations and applies the same standards for development, it does not provide specific recommendations to address the challenges of developing tools for use in <b>this</b> <b>younger</b> population. A working group convened by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research sought to address some of these challenges, such as determination of the recommended age for self-report, utilizing children as experts, and instrument design to facilitate accurate reporting (i.e., form design, electronic vs. paper-based) [17]. Results of this research support data collection in pediatric outcomes, however, in <b>this</b> <b>younger</b> age group, self-assessment is not possible and therefore caregiver reported observations were necessary.|$|R
