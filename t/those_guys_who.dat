[...] For the album, D'Angelo and the production personnel utilized antiquated, vintage equipment, including Wurlitzer musical instruments and dated effects boxes, as well as modern electronic devices such as drum machines and computers. Notable instruments used by D'Angelo were the Fender Rhodes electric piano and the Hammond organ. The album was later mastered by engineer Herb Powers Jr. at The Hit Factory mastering studio in New York City.|$|E

500|$|On {{top of his}} {{technical}} talent, Friday {{was physically}} very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: [...] "When {{he was in the}} line-up you'd have a centre-forward and a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as [...] "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. [...] "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. [...] "They couldn't get the ball off him. He was one of <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> could beat five players easily".

2500|$|Born in Akron, Alabama, Stephenson {{originally}} {{played baseball}} and football at the University of Alabama {{before he started}} his professional baseball career. A natural athlete who excelled in both sports, Stephenson had a good reputation at the university. Former University of Alabama president George H. Denny described Riggs as [...] "the embodiment of cleanliness, manliness, and courage." [...] He was an All-Southern fullback in 1919 and 1920. He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team. Stephenson sustained a shoulder injury in a football game in 1920 when he dropped back and was tackled {{by a pair of}} linebackers. His injury to his right shoulder was so bad that he had to end his football career as a quarterback, and as a result it greatly affected his throwing abilities. His throwing problems made it difficult for him to turn double plays, but his hitting compensated for those fielding woes. Stephenson quit school at Alabama and immediately made the jump to professional baseball, where he signed with the defending World Series champions Cleveland Indians at the age of 23.. Riggs was one of <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> went straight from college to the big leagues.|$|E

2500|$|After the Second World War all the British Army Commandos were disbanded and the {{commando}} {{role was}} taken over by the Royal Marines. However the present day Parachute Regiment, Special Air Service, and Special Boat Service can all trace their origins to the commandos. The Army Commandos were reborn in the 1960s, 29 light artillery regiment was tasked to become a commando regiment, men were asked to volunteer for the commando Course at CTCRM, most men did and they passed, 29 Commando Regiment RA was born. Later came 59 Commando Squadron Royal Engineers ( [...] now 24 Commando Regt RE [...] ) and many more smaller Army Commando attached units. Unlike RM recruits who have to start their training from scratch and learn everything, Army Commandos are already trained soldiers, who attend the All Arms Commando Course at The Commando Training Centre in Lympstone Devon, the course mirrors the last 8 weeks of the RM recruits training, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "Commando Phase". The Army Commandos provide specialist support that the Royal Marines can't provide themselves, many are parachute trained and both 29 and 24 provide Recce elements to the Commando Recce Force, the eyes and ears of 3 Commando Brigade. These Recce elements, 148 Commando Forward Observation battery from 29 and 59 Recce troop RE hold their own internal selection courses to make sure they get the best from their respective units.

The 148 teams can work by vehicle, parachute (land and sea) and also from submarines. The Army Commandos provide a very important asset to 3 Commando Brigade on the modern battlefield.|$|E
