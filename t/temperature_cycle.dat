40|$|SummaryBackground: Circadian clocks are {{synchronized}} by both light:dark <b>cycles</b> and by <b>temperature</b> fluctuations. Although it {{has long}} been known that <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> can robustly entrain Drosophila locomotor rhythms, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Results: We show here that <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> induce synchronized behavioral rhythms and oscillations of the clock proteins PERIOD and TIMELESS in constant light, a situation that normally leads to molecular and behavioral arrhythmicity. We show that expression of the Drosophila clock gene period can be entrained by <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> in cultured body parts and isolated brains. Further, we show that the phospholipase C encoded by the norpA gene contributes to thermal entrainment, suggesting that a receptor-coupled transduction cascade signals temperature changes to the circadian clock. We initiated the further genetic dissection of temperature-entrainment and isolated the novel Drosophila mutation nocte, which is defective in molecular and behavioral entrainment by <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> but synchronizes normally to light:dark cycles. Conclusions: We conclude that temperature synchronization of the circadian clock is a tissue-autonomous process that is able to override the arrhythmia-inducing effects of constant light. Our data suggest that it involves a cell-autonomous signal-transduction cascade from a thermal receptor to the circadian clock. This process includes the function of phospholipase C and the product specified by the novel mutation nocte...|$|R

50|$|Shallow 3-8 foot m {{horizontal}} {{heat exchangers}} experience seasonal <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> due to solar gains and transmission losses to ambient air at ground level. These <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> lag behind the seasons because of thermal inertia, so the heat exchanger will harvest heat deposited {{by the sun}} several months earlier, while being weighed down in late winter and spring, due to accumulated winter cold. Deep vertical systems 100-500 feet m deep rely on migration of heat from surrounding geology, unless they are recharged annually by solar recharge of the ground or exhaust heat from air conditioning systems.|$|R

40|$|Circadian systems include slave {{oscillators}} {{and central}} pacemakers, and the cores of eukaryotic circadian clocks described to date {{are composed of}} transcription and translation feedback loops (TTFLs). In the model system Neurospora, normal circadian rhythmicity requires a TTFL in which a White Collar complex (WCC) activates expression of the frequency (frq) gene, and the FRQ protein feeds back to attenuate that activation. To further test the centrality of this TTFL to the circadian mechanism in Neurospora, we used low-amplitude <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> to compare WT and frq-null strains under conditions in which a banding rhythm was elicited. WT cultures were entrained to these <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles.</b> Unlike those normal strains, however, frq-null mutants did not truly entrain to the same cycles. Their peaks and troughs always occurred {{in the cold and}} warm periods, respectively, strongly suggesting that the rhythm in Neurospora lacking frq function simply is driven by the <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles.</b> Previous reports suggested that a FRQ-less oscillator (FLO) could be entrained to <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles,</b> rather than being driven, and speculated that the FLO was the underlying circadian-rhythm generator. These inferences appear to derive from the use of a phase reference point affected by both the changing waveform and the phase of the oscillation. Examination of several other phase markers as well as results of additional experimental tests indicate that the FLO is, at best, a slave oscillator to the TTFL, which underlies circadian rhythm generation in Neurospora...|$|R

50|$|Though {{the period}} of the {{circadian}} clock is temperature compensated, the phosphorylation of KaiC can be stably entrained to a <b>temperature</b> <b>cycle.</b> The phosphorylation of KaiC was successfully entrained in vitro to temperature cycles with periods between 20 and 28 hours using temperature steps from 30 °C to 45 °C and vice versa. The results reflect a phase-dependent shift in the phase of the KaiC phosphorylation rhythms. The period of the circadian clock was not changed, reinforcing the temperature compensation of the clock mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Drosophila shows bimodal {{circadian}} locomotor rhythms with peaks around light-on (morning peak) {{and before}} light-off (evening peak). The rhythm synchronizes to light and <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> and the synchronization {{is achieved by}} two sets of clocks: one entrains to light cycles {{and the other to}} <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles.</b> The light-entrainable clock consists of the clock neurons located in the lateral protocerebrum (LNs) and the temperature-entrainable clock involves those located in the dorsal protocerebrum (DNs) and the cells located in the posterior lateral protocerebrum (LPNs). To understand the interaction between the light-entrainable and the temperature-entrainable clock neurons, locomotor rhythms of the mutant flies lacking PDF or PDF-positive clock neurons were examined. Under the light cycles, they showed altered phase of the evening peak. When exposed to <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles</b> of lower <b>temperature</b> levels, the onset of evening peak showed larger advance in contrast to those of wild-type flies. The termination of the peak also advanced while that of wild-type flies remained almost at the same phase as in the constant temperature.

This process consisted in the breakdown of carbon dioxide by anaerobic microorganisms that used the carbon in their metabolism and released the oxygen to the atmosphere.

50|$|Microprocessors {{were added}} to cycle each press based on {{temperature}} rather than the more inaccurate cycling by time, enabling greater operator control over heat and other variables that can create inconsistencies from record to record. Operators inspect each record as it comes off the press.Other technology employed helps mitigate variations in other factors that can compromise a record’s quality, such as pressure and vibration.Uneven contact between {{the surface of the}} press die, to which is attached the stamper (the mold that creates a vinyl record), results in temperature variations. These variations introduce variations in the width and depth of individual grooves on the record. Quality Record Pressings uses a vacuum system to ensure uniform die and stamper contact. As a result, the listener’s turntable needle tracks more smoothly and provides the listener with a more faithful reproduction of the music.QRP also uses an innovative double steam valve system that reduces die <b>temperature</b> <b>cycle</b> time as well as a more finely tuned level of temperature control of the heating and cooling process. Both reduce inconsistencies from record to record in the manufacturing process.And just as ambient temperature, humidity and variations in steam and water pressure affect the quality of a vinyl record, so do the minute environmental vibrations from nearby equipment. Unwanted harmonic vibration transmitted to the die during the pressing process causes distortion of the record’s grooves and other noise as well as other unwelcome changes in the physical structure of the grooves on a record. QRP uses custom-designed press isolation pads to mitigate the effect of these vibrations.As part of its record pressing operation, QRP also operates a plating department, setting it apart from other record pressing plants that don’t have that capability. The plating department headed by Gary Salstrom is where Lacquer master discs are given metal coatings to make the metal stamper that molds the records from heated vinyl.In 2010 the acquisition of Classic Records, of Los Angeles, California, by Acoustic Sounds, was announced by Kassem and Classic Records Mike Hobson. Acoustic Sounds acquisition of Classic Records included the “Quiex SV-P” vinyl formulation/process, “Clarity Vinyl”, the unique 200-gram “flat profile” tooling and all other aspects of Classic’s proprietary vinyl pressing technology.|$|E

The vasculature clock shows distinctive gene expression profiles compared to the clock in other tissues under light-dark cycles. However, {{it has not yet}} been established whether the vasculature clock also shows unique gene expression patterns that correlate with <b>temperature</b> <b>cycles,</b> another important environmental cue.
