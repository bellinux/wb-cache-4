25|$|The railway {{platforms}} lie at a {{lower level}} than the station entrance, and are within a <b>ticket</b> <b>barrier</b> enforced paid area. From north to south the station has two island platforms and a single side platform, {{with a total of}} seven numbered platform faces. Each platform is linked to both the main entrance concourse by stairs and lifts, and by stairs only to the second footbridge.|$|E
25|$|The new tram stop lies at {{a higher}} level than the station entrance, and at 90 degrees to railway platforms.

Like all other NET stops, pedestrian access between the platforms is permitted on the level via crossings {{at each end of the}} platforms. Ticket machines are located on both platforms, and the stop lies outside the <b>ticket</b> <b>barrier</b> enforced paid area of the railway station.|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to short}} platforms, {{passengers}} alighting at stations except Shrub Hill, Oxford and Hereford {{should listen to}} onboard announcements telling them from which coaches they should alight.

2500|$|The film {{opens in}} 1922 with Harold Lloyd (the {{character}} {{has the same}} name as the actor) behind bars. His mother and his girlfriend, Mildred, are consoling him as a somber official and priest show up. The three of them walk toward {{what looks like a}} noose. It then becomes obvious they are at a train station and the [...] "noose" [...] is actually a trackside pickup hoop used by train crews to receive orders without stopping, and the bars are merely the <b>ticket</b> <b>barrier.</b> He promises to send for his girlfriend so they can get married once he has [...] "made good" [...] in the big city. Then he is off.|$|E
2500|$|Wimbledon station {{presents}} an unusual procedure with the Oyster card pay {{as you go}} electronic ticketing system. Ordinarily, London Underground and National Rail passengers with Oyster cards must [...] "touch in" [...] {{at the start of}} their journey and [...] "touch out" [...] at the end; those who fail to [...] "touch out" [...] will be charged the maximum possible fare from their starting point. However, Tramlink passengers starting a journey at Wimbledon, after passing through the entry gates, {{will not be able to}} [...] "touch out" [...] at the end of their tram journey, since tram stops provide no facility to do so; instead they must [...] "touch in" [...] a second time on the tram platform at Wimbledon, after passing through the <b>ticket</b> <b>barrier,</b> and the system will then recognise that no tube journey has been made.|$|E

50|$|Larger metro {{stations}} in Amsterdam and Rotterdam {{as well as}} a number of railway {{stations in}} the Netherlands are only accessible by passing through a <b>ticket</b> <b>barrier.</b> These barriers are designed to make access to the platforms (and therefore any vehicle) impossible without checking in beforehand. When checking in at a <b>ticket</b> <b>barrier,</b> the gates are opened after a deposit has been collected from the stored value on the passenger's OV-chipkaart or when an appropriate travel product has been acknowledged. If no travel product (such as a single or return journey) has been loaded or no deposit can be collected because of insufficient funds on the card, the ticket barriers will refuse to open and access to the station is denied. Since traditional paper tickets will continue to be used for some rail journeys, such as for international travel or in case of e-tickets, at least one <b>ticket</b> <b>barrier</b> will be equipped with both an OV-chipkaart reader and a barcode reader. The latter can be used to open the gate by scanning the square barcode on paper tickets.|$|E
