5000|$|One of {{the factors}} bassists {{keep in mind when}} {{selecting}} a combo amp or an amp head is the amount of [...] "headroom" [...] that the amplifier will provide them, given their intended performance venue and music genre. [...] "Headroom" [...] refers to the amount by which the signal-handling capabilities of an audio system exceed a designated nominal level. Headroom {{can be thought of as}} a safety zone allowing transient audio peaks to exceed the nominal level without damaging the system or the audio signal, e.g., via clipping. In loud music genres and in genres where bassists seek a clean, clear bass tone, bassists seek to avoid power amplifier clipping, so they typically choose amplifiers which provide enough headroom to avoid power amp clipping. Headroom has been defined as a [...] "...safety zone or wiggle room"."Having enough headroom is essential for solid-state equipment like bass amplifiers and power amplifiers. If you lack this, you can expect a harsh mid range tone, a lack of dynamics and possibly blown speakers". Having enough headroom is also important for bassists seeking to retain a [...] "clean" [...] sound even in loud, high-volume performance settings.Bassists pairing an amplifier [...] "head" [...] of a certain wattage and a speaker cabinet (or speaker cabinets) with a certain wattage power-handling capacity may require advice from music store amplifier expert or an audio engineer. One of the reasons that many beginning bassists choose combo amps when they are starting is because with a combo amp, the manufacturer has ensured that the speaker and power amp are compatible from a power handling and impedance perspective. While there is a widespread belief that an amplifier with a rated wattage that is higher than <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>wattage</b> on a speaker cabinet will harm the speaker, in fact, a clean, un-clipped power amplifier signal can be above <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>wattage</b> of a speaker without damaging the speaker, as long as the power amp is sending out a clean, unclipped signal. There is a much higher risk of damaging a speaker when a clipped (unintentionally distorted) power amplifier signal is sent through it, even if the wattage is far below <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> <b>wattage</b> of a speaker. For example, a bassist could use a 700 watt power amp which is running with zero power amp clipping through a speaker cabinet rated at 500 watts without damaging the speaker; however, if a 100 watt power amp that is heavily clipping is plugged into the speaker cab, this could blow the speaker.|$|E

5000|$|... "Cranking an amp" [...] means {{turning up}} a guitar power {{amplifier}} {{well into the}} region at which power-tube distortion is produced, generating as much as twice <b>the</b> amplifier's <b>rated</b> non-distorting <b>wattage.</b> Pushing a guitar amp {{to such an extent}} can destroy components of an amplifier whether using an isolation cabinet, dummy load, power attenuator, or conventional guitar speaker cabinet. In particular, tubes wear more quickly when they are consistently pushed into saturation.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{tracking}} and monitoring in homes has gained momentum {{in recent years}} due to its important implications in energy conservation and economic savings. Many existing systems require deployment of large number of sensors to provide energy tracking of individual devices. Many other systems rely on statistical data or user inputs to disaggregate the total energy. In this report we present a cost effective and a single-point pluggable system which can track the energy consumption of individual devices. We also introduce evaluation metrics to verify the power disaggregation. The system uses a single plugin data acquisition unit to detect device events and a power meter to record the total power consumption. We test the system on a real circuit that models a house with different devices. Entracker could account and breakdown over 95 % of the total energy. Our estimation of the average device power consumption was close to <b>the</b> <b>rated</b> power <b>wattage</b> of <b>the</b> devices. ...|$|R

50|$|One {{other problem}} can happen with <b>the</b> <b>wattage</b> <b>rating</b> of <b>the</b> power supply. There are 2 Dell power {{supplies}} {{that were used}} for different Inspiron models which have the same plug assembly and voltage, a 65 watt supply model PA-6 and a 90 watt supply model PA-9. Some models (for example the Inspiron 1100) shipped with a PA-9. If a PA-6 (or equivalent aftermarket supply) is used in these models then the system might not boot at times. In such cases, it will light the battery light {{for a few seconds}} when the supply is plugged in. This can also happen if the power supply becomes marginal. Marginal supplies can show as supplying full voltage even if tested with a volt meter while the supply is plugged into the computer and an attempt is made to turn on the computer.|$|R

Based on existing headspace gas data for drums stored at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) and the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), over 30 percent of the contact-handled TRU waste drums contain flammable VOC concentrations greater than the limit. Additional requirements may be imposed for emplacement of waste in the WIPP facility. The conditional no-migration determination (NMD) for the test phase of the facility required that flame tests be performed if significant levels of flammable VOCs were present in TRU waste containers. This paper describes an approach for investigating the potential flammability of TRU waste drums, which would increase the allowable concentrations of flammable VOCS. A flammability assessment methodology is presented that will allow more drums to be shipped to WIPP without treatment or repackaging and {{reduce the need for}} flame testing on drums. The approach includes experimental work to determine mixture lower explosive limits (MLEL) for the types of gas mixtures observed in TRU waste, a model for predicting the MLEL for mixtures of VOCS, hydrogen, and methane, and revised screening limits for total flammable VOCs concentrations and concentrations of hydrogen and methane using existing drum headspace gas data and the model predictions...|$|R
