5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Imbudo passed about 35km (20mi) north of Yap. The JMA upgraded Imbudo to a severe tropical storm late on July18, {{around the same}} time that the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon. An increase in outflow to the south and to the north from a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT) caused a 36‑hour period of rapid development beginning on July19. During that time, the JMA upgraded Imbudo to typhoon status, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories as the storm approached the Philippines, and a 30km (20mi) wide eye formed. At 1200UTC on July20, the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated 1minute sustained winds of 240km/h (150mph), making it a super typhoon. By late on July20, the typhoon had developed concentric eyewalls, and the TUTT was moving away, <b>thus</b> <b>diminishing</b> outflow. Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12hours, before the innermost eye contracted to a diameter of 11km (7mi) in the midst of an eyewall replacement cycle. At 0300UTC on July22, Imbudo struck northern Luzon, with 1minute winds estimated at 205km/h (125mph) by the JTWC.|$|E

25|$|When organised, the {{defending}} team will offer no resistance until the attacking team has advanced {{to a certain}} height on the pitch. The pressure height, or at which depth the midfielders should start acting as first and second defenders, depends {{on a lot of}} factors. For example, as higher pressure is more tiring, it demands players with good stamina. In general, a defensive-minded team will tend to stay lower, <b>thus</b> <b>diminishing</b> defensive risks as opponents get less space.

25|$|Lucy and Desi had {{originally}} {{decided that the}} series would air on a biweekly basis, much like The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. Philip Morris, however, was insistent that the show air weekly, <b>thus</b> <b>diminishing</b> the possibility of Lucy continuing her film career alongside a television show. Another problem lay {{in the fact that}} Philip Morris wanted the series to originate from New York rather than Hollywood. At the time, most television shows were produced from New York with live broadcasts of the show airing for eastern and Midwest audiences. West Coast viewers were able to view live programs only through low-quality kinescopes, which derived their images by using a 35mm or 16 mm film camera to record the show from a television monitor. As videotape had not yet been developed, kinescopes seemed to be the only practical means to allow a live show to reach television markets on the West Coast. Complicating matters was that kinescopes were not available for immediate re-broadcast as in 1951 no coast-to-coast cable system was yet in service. Shows had to be sent to Hollywood, which delayed their airings for West Coast audiences by nearly a week. The process operated in the reverse for the few programs that originated live in Hollywood, such as The Ed Wynn Show, thus making blurry kinescopes of these shows the only available print for eastern audiences. Most sponsors, including Philip Morris, found this to be undesirable as most of the television audience lived east of the Mississippi at the time.|$|E

[...] Resorption is exacerbated by pressure on the bone; thus, long-term complete denture wearers will experience more drastic reductions to their ridges that non-denture wearers.

2500|$|Real life {{failures}} in naturally deposited mixed soils {{are not necessarily}} circular, but prior to computers, it was far easier to analyse such a simplified geometry.

[...] Such slips often occur {{after a period of}} heavy rain, when the pore water pressure at the slip surface increases, reducing the effective normal stress and <b>thus</b> <b>diminishing</b> the restraining friction along the slip line. [...] This is combined with increased soil weight due to the added groundwater. [...] A 'shrinkage' crack (formed during prior dry weather) {{at the top of the}} slip may also fill with rain water, pushing the slip forward. [...] At the other extreme, slab-shaped slips on hillsides can remove a layer of soil from the top of the underlying bedrock. [...] Again, this is usually initiated by heavy rain, sometimes combined with increased loading from new buildings or removal of support at the toe (resulting from road widening or other construction work). [...] Stability can thus be significantly improved by installing drainage paths to reduce the destabilising forces. [...] Once the slip has occurred, however, a weakness along the slip circle remains, which may then recur at the next monsoon.There are many more methods are also available ...|$|E

Let us assume, for simplicity's sake, that the lowest Man's skull has twice the capacity of that of the highest Gorilla.* ([Footnote] *It has been affirmed that Hindoo crania sometimes contain as little as 27 ounces of water, which would give a capacity of about 46 cubic inches. The minimum capacity which I have assumed above, however, is based upon the valuable tables published by Professor R. Wagner in his [...] "Vorstudien zu einer wissenschaftlichen Morphologie und Physiologie des menschlichen Gehirns." [...] As the result of the careful weighing of more than 900 human brains, Professor Wagner states that one-half weighed between 1200 and 1400 grammes, and that about two-ninths, consisting for the most part of male brains, exceed 1400 grammes. The lightest brain of an adult male, with sound mental faculties, recorded by Wagner, weighed 1020 grammes. As a gramme equals 15.4 grains, and a cubic inch of water contains 252.4 grains, this is equivalent to 62 cubic inches of water; so that as brain is heavier than water, we are perfectly safe against erring on the side of diminution in taking this as the smallest capacity of any adult male human brain. The only adult male brain, weighing as little as 970 grammes, is that of an idiot; but the brain of an adult woman, against the soundness of whose faculties nothing appears, weighed as little as 907 grammes (55.3 cubic inches of water); and Reid gives an adult female brain of still smaller capacity. The heaviest brain (1872 grammes, or about 115 cubic inches) was, however, that of a woman; next to it comes the brain of Cuvier (1861 grammes), then Byron (1807 grammes), and then an insane person (1783 grammes). The lightest adult brain recorded (720 grammes) was that of an idiotic female. The brains of five children, four years old, weighed between 1275 and 992 grammes. So that it may be safely said, that an average European child of four years old has a brain twice as large as that of an adult Gorilla.) ...|$|E
