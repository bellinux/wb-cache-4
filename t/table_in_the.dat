5|$|The torpedoes {{initially}} had {{a similar}} system where various rangefinders, especially the fifteen-foot rangefinder above the aft torpedo control tower, and deflection sights provided data to a Dreyer <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> torpedo TS adjacent to the 5.5-inch TS on the lower deck. However the Dreyer table was removed during Hoods 1929–1931 refit and the calculations {{were made in the}} torpedo control position in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Another bust of {{particular}} value is the marble portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by Edmé Bouchardon. It is also {{displayed in the}} library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745 imitation of a Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory and bearing in its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the library was woven in Portuguese India around 1730. It {{was given to the}} Cathedral chapter after 1806 and sold to the Musée de Cluny in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} {{the work for}} five soloists: two sopranos, alto, tenor and bass. The soloists {{are listed in the}} <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order SATB. For some recordings, only one soprano soloist is listed. Recordings with orchestras on period instruments in historically informed performances are highlighted. The first recordings in the 1960s combined the version in D major (BWV 243) with transposed Christmas interpolations. The type of orchestra is shown for an ensemble with period instruments in historically informed performance by green background.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{fitted in}} well at Stoke, as Waddington built {{a team of}} veteran players who were judged {{by some to be}} past their best. The Potters {{struggled}} near the foot of the First Division <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1967–68 and 1968–69 campaigns, before rising to ninth place in the 1969–70 season. Banks remained a reliable stopper for the club, though on 1 March 1969 he was knocked unconscious at Roker Park by Sunderland's Malcolm Moore, and his replacement David Herd conceded four goals in a 4–1 defeat. Banks also played a season for the Cleveland Stokers of the American United Soccer Association in the summer of 1968: he played seven of the short-lived club's 12 games in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Dover Athletic F.C. {{was formed}} in 1983 after the town's {{previous}} club, Dover, folded due to its debts. The new club took Dover's place in the Southern League Southern Division, with former Dover player Alan Jones as manager and a team consisting mainly of reserve players from the old club. Initially Athletic struggled, finishing second from bottom of the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1984–85 season. In November 1985 Steve McRae, who had succeeded Jones a year earlier, was sacked and replaced by Chris Kinnear.|$|E

Atlético then finished in {{the upper part of}} the national league <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following two seasons, but in 2004 it barely escaped relegation. In 2005 the club was demoted to the Série B, the second level of the Brasileirão.|$|E

His next tournament was the UK Championship, where he lost {{in the second round}} 5–6 against eventual champion Judd Trump. At the Masters, he again lost against Trump, this time 2–6 in the quarter-finals. At the German Masters, he reached his first ranking final since the 2010 World Open, and won 9–7 against Stephen Maguire, despite having trailed 0–4 against Andrew Higginson in the first round. He then reached the semi-finals of the Welsh Open, and the quarter-finals of the China Open, but lost 2–6 against Mark Selby and 4–5 against Maguire.|$|E
5|$|Statistically, Cumberland are {{the worst}} team {{in the history of}} first-grade rugby league in Australia. They only have won 12.5% of their games, lowest to Annandale (18.3%), who are also a defunct team. They won the wooden spoon for being last on the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1908 season. They had only one win which was 14–6 over Western Suburbs, and had their worst loss in their final game against Norths, 45–0. They lost six {{consecutive}} games from 9 May 1908 until 27 June 1908, a win, then a final loss. They scored an average 4.75 points each game whereas they had an average of 23.88 points scored against them.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} four quarterfinal matches in the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament opened Sacrifice. It pitted James Storm, {{accompanied}} by Jackie Moore and Sting, against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The match lasted eight minutes and fifty seconds. Near the end, Team 3D set up a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the ring. Sting then turned on Storm and lifted him off the turnbuckle and slammed him through the table. Devon covered Storm for the win, thereby advancing himself and Brother Ray in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 1921–22, saw {{the formation}} of a Northern section of the Third Division and the Third Division became Division Three South. This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and Fourth Division were formed, but for the moment, Palace were above all of that, and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the Fulham game. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following season, 1922–23, finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, with Obama {{elected president}} and his junior staffers working in the White House, Obama encouraged the group to hold the Seder again. The 2009 event {{was the first time}} that a sitting U.S. president conducted a Passover Seder in the White House. The White House switchboard was reportedly swamped with callers seeking a dinner invitation. The White House Seder was scheduled for the second night of Passover to allow Jewish staffers to spend the first Seder on the first night of Passover with their families. About 20 guests sat around a <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Old Family Dining Room reading the Haggadah and sampling the traditional Seder foods. Malia and Sasha Obama, being the youngest in attendance, recited the Four Questions and engaged in the search for the afikoman.|$|E

5|$|When the {{competition}} was revived in the 1990s, {{for the first two}} seasons all English sides playing in the First Division (2nd level) participated, but in the last two tournaments only 8 English teams played. In 1994/95, two of the clubs relegated from the Premiership were joined by six teams that had just missed out on promotion.

5|$|Huskisson's coffin {{was placed}} on a trestle <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Town Hall, draped with black velvet and covered with {{feathered}} plumes. Between 9.00 and 10.00am a stream of mourners were guided to the coffin {{by a group of}} truncheon men. At 10.00 two mutes guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, followed by the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had waited outside. These mourners marched six abreast, and were followed by the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, followed by two more mutes. Behind this pair of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, followed by Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers Thomas and Samuel. These in turn were followed by around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a prior commitment to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had curtains of delicate salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Arsenal welcomed Atlético Madrid, Rangers and Paris Saint-Germain to the Emirates Cup. The hosts {{regained the}} trophy winning {{both of their}} matches and scoring five goals; midfielder Jack Wilshere was twice named man of the match for his {{performances}} against Atlético Madrid and Rangers. Arsenal retained the Emirates Cup in 2010, but failed to top the <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next three tournaments. New York Red Bulls, who were captained by former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, won the Emirates Cup in 2011, after beating Paris Saint-Germain and drawing with the hosts. The tournament {{did not take place}} in 2012 due to the ongoing Summer Olympics in London; it was believed that the capital's infrastructure was not able to cater for the extra 100,000 supporters that usually attend the two-day event. When the Emirates Cup resumed in 2013, Turkish side Galatasaray earned nine points to finish top of the group, and a year later Valencia became the first Spanish winners of the tournament as the hosts lost their decisive game against Monaco.|$|E
5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. Devine tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up a table for Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him {{and set up the}} table for himself outside the ring, placing Devine on top. Guerrero then climbed a padded turnbuckle and jumped onto Devine with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the <b>table.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing Homicide into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because Homicide was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat from the top of a turnbuckle. Homicide followed with a splash from the top of a padded turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
