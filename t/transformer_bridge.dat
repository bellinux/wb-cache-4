A high sensitivity <b>transformer</b> ratio <b>bridge</b> system, which can measure loss tangents as low as 10 - 5, has been developed with the ability to measure these cables. A tuned amplifier was designed to help to extend the frequency range from 200 Hz to 20 kHz. Different model cables from Borealis AB with different semiconducting materials have been measured in the temperature range 15 °C to 120 °C. It is found that the semiconducting layers dominate the dielectric loss in the insulation system of the XLPE cables, when the outer semicon is treated as measuring electrode. In this case, steadily increasing dielectric loss has been measured at higher frequencies. The resistivity of the semiconducting materials was measured, which confirmed that the increasing slope is due to the semiconducting layers. After using conductive tapes to wrap the cable samples, monotonically decreasing losses were measured, corresponding to the actual dielectric frequency response of the XLPE cables.

The approach presented can precisely identify the converter ZVS boundaries for any given transformer coupling factor, which allows the selection of a magnetising inductance that is as high as possible to minimise conduction losses, while still maintaining ZVS over the entire operating power region.

The evaluation of the conductance data {{was carried out by}} extrapolation and minimisation techniques using the following theoretical conductance equations: the complete and modified forms of Pitts (8, 29) and Fuoss-Hsia(19, 30) and those of Falkenhagen-Leist-Kelbg(5) D'Aprano(20). and Murphy-Cohen(25). Quantitative results showed that magnesium, manganese and barium dithionates could be only treated as essentially fully dissociated electrolytes which exhibit ion pairing. All the oxalate and dithionate salts showed an increase in their conductances in a high-frequency field (normal Falkenhagen effect). This could be explained in terms of two effects: the ion atmosphere relaxation(5), and the relaxation of ion-pair equilibrium as calculated by Gilkerson(50). The above-mentioned electrolytes exhibited variations in the values of their association constants (second Falkenhagen effect) with frequency. Estimation has been made for the rate constants of the ion-pair dissociation rate by using Gilkerson theory.

Three dielectric spectroscopy techniques, which are frequency response analyzer and <b>transformer</b> ratio <b>bridge</b> in both frequency domain, and charging/discharging current system in time domain, were jointly {{used to measure the}} low loss XLPE cables in the frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 104 Hz at temperatures from 20 °C to 80 °C. Degassing effects and thermal ageing effects have also been studied with the spectroscopy techniques. Thermal-electric behaviour and maximum voltages for thermal breakdown have been theoretically simulated for the model cables. Three loss origins of the XLPE cables have been found with different loss mechanisms. Conduction loss due to thermally activated electron/hole hopping dominates the lower frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 1 Hz; Semicon loss due to its in series resistance with the insulation layer in cable equivalent circuit dominates the higher frequency range from 102 Hz to 104 Hz; intrinsic polarization loss of the XLPE insulation has dominant flat loss spectra in the mid-frequency range from 1 Hz to 102 Hz. Degassing was found to decrease the conductivity of the model cables, while thermal ageing greatly increased the conductivity. Thermal-electric simulation results with FEMLAB have shown that the position of maximum field changes from inner to outer insulation boundary under higher applied voltages.

A dielectric spectrometer {{was used for the}} frequency range 10 - 4 to 10 - 2 Hz. A bespoke noise-free power supply was constructed and used to measure the dc conductivity and, using a Fourier transform technique, it was also used to measure the very low dielectric tanδ losses encountered at frequencies of 1 to 100 Hz. Tanδ measurements of <; 10 - 5 were found in this frequency range and attributed to a β-mode dielectric relaxation lying above 100 Hz due to motion of chain segments in the amorphous region and an β-mode relaxation lying below 1 Hz window due to twists of chains in the crystal lamellae. The dc conductivity measurements were consistent with those of the dielectric spectrometer and indicate lower dc conductivities in vacuum degassed cables than have been previously reported for XLPE (less than 10 - 17 S. m- 1). The conduction process is thermally activated with an activation energy of approximately 1. 1 eV. Higher conductivities were found for non-degassed cables. A <b>transformer</b> ratio <b>bridge</b> was used for measurements in the range 1 to 10 kHz; loss in this region was shown to be due to the series resistance of the semicon layers.

The generators are three-phase, axial-flux, synchronous machines, comprising a rotor with an annular PM and ferromagnetic core, and a stator with multi-turn surface windings on a soft magnetic substrate. The fabrication of the PM generators, {{as well as the}} development of their high-speed spinning rotor test stand, was carried out by collaborators at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The machines are modeled by analytically solving 2 D magneto-quasistatic Maxwell's Equations as a function of radius and then integrating the field solutions over the radial span of the machine to determine the open-circuit voltage, torque and losses in the stator core. The model provides a computationally fast method to determine power and efficiency of an axial-air-gap PM machine as a function of geometry, speed and material properties. Both passive and active power electronics have been built and tested. The passive power electronics consist of a three-phase <b>transformer</b> and diode <b>bridge</b> rectifier. (cont.) The active power electronics consist of a switch-mode rectifier based on the boost semi-bridge topology which is used to convert the unregulated AC generator voltages to a regulated 12 V DC without the need for rotor position/speed or stator terminal current/voltage sensing. At the rotational speed of 300, 000 rpm, one generator converts 16. 2 W of mechanical power to electrical power. Coupled to the <b>transformer</b> and diode <b>bridge</b> rectifier, it delivers 8 W DC to a resistive load. This is the highest output power ever delivered by a microscale electric generator to date. The corresponding power and current densities of 57. 8 MW/m 3 and 6 x 108 A/m 2, respectively, are much higher than those of a macroscale electric generator. At the rotational speed of 300, 000 rpm, the generator and switch-mode rectifier delivered 5. 5 W DC to a resistive load at a power density three times that of the passive electronics.

30|$|Current <b>transformer</b> is a <b>bridge</b> {{between the}} primary and {{secondary}} equipment in power system, utilized for transferring large currents proportionally to currents with small amplitudes for secondary measuring and monitoring equipment and relay protective equipment. In case of a short-circuit incident, as the power system capacity and the voltage level increase, the short-circuit current will reach tens of times or even hundreds of times of CT rated current, leading to CT saturation. In that situation, CT cannot transfer the primary current correctly, which causes mis-operation or mal-operation of protection equipment and greater errors of fault location equipment. In response to this, manufacturers open a small air gap on the core of CT, which is about one-thousandth of the total length of the magnetic circuit. Among the CTs that have been widely put into use, the PR-type and the TPY-level of the TP-type {{are those who have}} air-gaps in their cores. The air-gapped CT can guarantee that the errors are within the permissible range of the relay protection in the steady state and the transient state. Establishing the simulation model of air-gapped CT and studying its transient characteristics will help to understand the role of air gap more accurately, and to guide the selection and design of air-gapped CT.|$|R
