5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{originally}} created Shikamaru {{in order}} {{for him to be}} the only winner of an early Naruto arc: the Chunnin Exams, based on his high intelligence. However, recommendations from his editors resulted in Kishimoto <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> fighting tournament between the ninjas in order to focus on a recently new introduced villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends becoming the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the series.|$|E

In the ensuing battle of Warsaw the much smaller Swedish force under Carl Nieroth guarding the city won a decisive victory. Paykull was captured along with secret documents which informed the Swedes of a possible attack on Warsaw by a larger Russian army under Peter.|$|E

5|$|A band {{formed by}} the American musicians Thomas Jude on guitars, Paul Morris on keyboards, Nick Douglas on bass and Tom Coombs on drums was {{assembled}} for the supporting tour. Doro was a more commercial offering than the previous album, but resulted in a flop in the US. On the contrary, it sold well in Europe, accelerating PolyGram's decision <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> publication of Doro's albums in America, where the commercial appeal of glam metal and classic rock acts was rapidly declining in favor of grunge and alternative rock. Doro concluded 1990 playing some dates in Germany, opening for Scorpions.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

In the same week that the two boys appeared in court, she received official notification of the intention to appoint her as an OBE. In order to protect her sons from further press intrusion she declined the honour. Later that year, while filming the third series of Sykes, she suffered a cancer scare and lost {{a considerable amount of}} weight. Despite this she refused <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> busy production schedule; when filming was completed on 5 December she underwent surgery at Charing Cross Hospital for what proved to be benign tumours on her kidneys.|$|E

During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling the peer that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rapidly}} deteriorating {{military}} {{situation for the}} German Army on the Eastern Front, it became increasingly important <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> flow of supplies from the Western Allies to the Soviet Union. By December 1943, the German Army was forced into continuous retreat. The Luftwaffe had been seriously weakened by four long years of war, and increasing Allied anti-submarine capabilities were steadily degrading {{the effectiveness of the}} U-boats. The only effective weapon at the disposal of the Germans in Norway was Scharnhorst—Tirpitz was badly damaged, and the four remaining heavy cruisers were committed to the Baltic. During a conference with Hitler on 19–20 December, Großadmiral Karl Dönitz decided to employ Scharnhorst against the next Allied convoy that presented itself. Erich Bey, by now promoted to Konteradmiral, was given command of the task force.|$|E
5|$|During an {{ice skating}} field trip at the lake, some of Oskar's fellow {{students}} discover Jocke's body. At the same time, Oskar finally {{stands up to}} his tormentors and strikes {{the leader of the}} bullies, Conny, {{on the side of the}} head with a pole, splitting his ear. Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a blood bond, and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilled blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Lacke turns up in time <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> attack. Virginia survives, but soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Seeking Lacke, Virginia visits Gösta, only to be fiercely attacked by Gösta's cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames.|$|E

30|$|MicroBlaze also {{supports}} reset, interrupt, user exception, break and hardware exceptions. For interrupts, MicroBlaze supports only one external <b>interrupt</b> source (connecting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> input port). If multiple interrupts are needed, an interrupt controller {{must be used}} <b>to</b> handle multiple <b>interrupt</b> requests <b>to</b> MicroBlaze. An <b>interrupt</b> controller is available for use with the Xilinx EDK software tools. The processor will only react <b>to</b> <b>interrupts</b> if <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> enable (IE) bit in the MSR is set to 1. On an <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> instruction in the execution stage will complete, while the instruction in the decode stage {{is replaced by a}} branch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> vector (address 0  ×  10). <b>The</b> <b>interrupt</b> return address (<b>the</b> PC associated with the instruction in the decode stage at the time of <b>the</b> <b>interrupt)</b> is automatically loaded into general-purpose register R 14. In addition, the processor also disables future <b>interrupts</b> by clearing <b>the</b> IE bit in the MSR. The IE bit is automatically set again when executing the RTID instruction.|$|R
50|$|Signals {{are similar}} <b>to</b> <b>interrupts,</b> <b>the</b> {{difference}} being that interrupts are {{mediated by the}} processor and handled by the kernel - thus, {{they are not a}} form of IPC - while signals are mediated by the kernel (possibly via system calls) and handled by processes. The kernel may pass an interrupt as a signal to the process that caused it (typical examples are SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL and SIGFPE).|$|R
5|$|In early March 1705 the Russian Field Marshal Boris Sheremetyev set up {{a meeting}} with the Saxon general Otto Arnold von Paykull in order to agree to a common course of action in the ensuing campaign. The basis for the {{strategy}} was a plan developed by Johann Patkul as early as 1703, which envisioned a joint strike which would neutralize the Swedish army. von Paykull, inspired by Patkul's blueprint, advocated {{it as a way to}} lure Charles and the main Swedish army out of Greater Poland eastward towards Brest-Litovsk. This was to be accomplished by having the combined forces of the main Russian army under Ogilvy and von Paykull's troops stationed at Brest, which would force Charles to meet them in battle. At the same time the main Saxon army would attack Charles from the rear by sweeping through Poland out of Saxony, ultimately catching the Swedish army exposed. The plan seemed rather daring to Patkul and he suggested that the allies should first crush Lewenhaupt's army, before Ogilvy's troops approached Charles. Otherwise Ogilvy's rear would be threatened. A compromise was made between the two strategies and it was decided that Sheremetyev should engage Lewenhaupt at the same time as Ogilvy marched towards the strongly fortified city of Grodno. The belief was that there, behind fortifications, Oglivy would be able to withstand Charles long enough for the main Saxon army to arrive from Kraków. Meanwhile, von Paykull would attack with his combined Saxon–Polish force towards Warsaw in order <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> coronation of Stanisław I.|$|E
5|$|The Bears' opening drive {{ended at}} Cleveland's 14-yard line when Cutler had his pass tipped in the endzone by T. J. Ward and intercepted by Tashaun Gipson. The Browns then scored on Billy Cundiff's 35-yard field goal, which was tied by Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yarder. Eventually, the Bears reached the Browns' 24-yard line on another drive, {{and after a}} penalty on Alshon Jeffery forced the Bears to kick a 46-yard field goal, the score was nullified by Corey Wootton's holding penalty, forcing Chicago to punt. With 8:01 in the first half, Cutler was again intercepted by Gipson, who {{returned}} the pick 44 {{yards for a touchdown}} and the 10–3 lead. With 24 seconds remaining in the half, Cutler connected on a 5-yard touchdown pass with Marshall to close the half at 10–10. Cutler ended the first half with 13 of 19 passes completed for 168 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. Early in the third quarter, Jason Campbell's pass for Greg Little was intercepted by Zack Bowman and returned 43 yards for the score. Cleveland's Edwin Baker eventually scored his first career NFL touchdown on a 2-yard run, and the Browns added to the score when Billy Winn punched the ball from Martellus Bennett, and Ward returned the fumble 52 yards for the 24–17 advantage. Eventually, Cutler guided the Bears from their own 5-yard line, culminating in a 45-yard touchdown pass to Jeffery after Gipson made an ill-timed leap and Julian Posey being unable <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> play with 10:59 remaining. With 5:41 left in the game, Cutler threw a 5-yard pass to Earl Bennett to take the 31–24 lead, which was extended by Michael Bush on a 40-yard touchdown run. Cutler's touchdown pass to Bennett was the twenty-ninth passing touchdown of the season, which ties the team record set in 1947 and 1995. With 1:03 to go, Campbell threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Josh Gordon, but the Bears recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal the victory, 38–31. The win marked the third time since 1970 that the Bears won all four games against an AFC division, and the first since 1986.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially {{wanted them to}} be as realistic as possible, but as this was being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The Dowsing mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of Dowsing, the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.|$|E
25|$|Interconnection of {{multiple}} generator sources into an electrical grid required development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and increased ability <b>to</b> safely <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> increasing short-circuit currents produced by networks. Simple air-break manual switches produced hazardous arcs when interrupting high voltages; these {{gave way to}} oil-enclosed contacts, and various forms using directed flow of pressurized air, or of pressurized oil, <b>to</b> cool and <b>interrupt</b> <b>the</b> arc. By 1935, the specially constructed circuit breakers used at the Boulder Dam project use eight series breaks and pressurized oil flow <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> faults of up to 2,500 MVA, in three cycles of the AC power frequency.|$|R
50|$|For {{reasons of}} performance, the handler will {{typically}} be initiated {{in the memory}} and execution context of the running process, to which it has no special connection (<b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> is essentially usurping the running context—process time accounting will often accrue time spent handling <b>interrupts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>interrupted</b> process). However, unlike <b>the</b> <b>interrupted</b> process, <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> is usually elevated by a hard-coded CPU mechanism to a privilege level high enough to access hardware resources directly.|$|R
