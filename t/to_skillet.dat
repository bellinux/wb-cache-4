5000|$|Skillet Glacier is in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, United States. The glacier is {{situated}} on the eastern cliffs of Mount Moran and is easily seen from Jackson Hole. The shape of the glacier led to the naming as the uppermost section of the glacier is long and narrow and then broadens abruptly more than halfway down the mountain into a larger area, giving it {{the shape of a}} skillet or frying pan. The glacier is one of twelve that remain in Grand Teton National Park and one of five glaciers located on Mount Moran. Mountain climbers consider the Skillet Glacier route to be the fastest and one of the easiest ways to climb Mount Moran, and was the route taken when the peak was first climbed in 1922, though it is rarely used in late summer due to poor footing. On November 21, 1950, A DC-3 crashed into Mount Moran, adjacent <b>to</b> <b>Skillet</b> Glacier, killing all 21 passengers aboard. The remains of the passengers and the plane are still on the mountain.|$|E

50|$|Skillet-fried or skillet-baked cornbread (often {{simplified}} <b>to</b> cornbread or <b>skillet</b> bread) is {{a traditional}} staple in the rural United States, especially in the South. This involves heating bacon drippings, lard or other oil in a heavy, well-seasoned cast iron skillet in an oven, and then pouring a batter made from cornmeal, egg, and milk directly into the hot grease. The mixture is returned to the oven to bake into a large, crumbly and sometimes very moist cake with a crunchy crust. This bread tends to be dense and is usually served as an accompaniment {{rather than as a}} bread served as a regular course. In addition <b>to</b> the <b>skillet</b> method, such cornbread also may be made in sticks, muffins, or loaves.|$|R
50|$|Revere Ware {{is a line}} of {{consumer}} and commercial kitchen wares introduced in 1939 by the Revere Brass & Copper Corp. Focusing primarily on consumer cookware such as (but not limited <b>to)</b> <b>skillets,</b> sauce pans, stock pots, and tea kettles. Initially Revere Ware {{was the culmination of}} various innovative techniques developed during the 30's, the most popular being construction of Stainless Steel with rivetlessly attached bakelite handles, copper clad bases and rounded interiors for ease of cleaning. Over the next 40+ years, Revere Ware would introduce new series to position itself in competition with other manufacturers at various price points, or for specific specialty markets. In the early 60's the profitability of Revere Ware began to level off. Coinciding with new series introductions, cost cutting measures were implemented in the manufacture of the traditional cookware. The bakelite handles were changed from two piece to one, and the thickness of utensil walls and copper cladding were reduced.|$|R

Furthermore, Andre wrote that [...] "as we have this eternal glory to look forward to, we can rest in the meantime in the songs that Remedy Drive has given to us- a bit of piano, guitar and drums moulded together to create different genre-related melodies all with the same focus- reminding creation of a Creator who has our future in His hands- urging us to trust Him as we open our hearts to His invading and pursuing love and redemption."

In another scene, Keough delivers a cast-iron <b>skillet</b> <b>to</b> Timberlake's cranium.

50|$|The effect Leidenfrost {{described}} is {{a phenomenon}} in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than its boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly. It is most commonly seen when cooking; one sprinkles drops of water in a <b>skillet</b> <b>to</b> gauge its temperature. If the skillet's temperature is {{at or above the}} Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the metal and takes longer to evaporate than it would in a skillet that is hot, but at a temperature below the Leidenfrost point. It has also been used in some dangerous demonstrations, such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, both enacted without injury to the demonstrator.|$|R

Then Skillet headlined their own Comatose Tour {{alongside}} Thousand Foot Krutch and traveled to approximately 30 cities. The tour started on March 28 and ran through May 11, 2008. Skillet toured again from April 2009 through June 2009 with Decyfer Down and Disciple. This tour was called Comatose Tour 2009 (essentially a second branch of the 2008 Comatose Tour). In fall of 2009, Skillet began touring with Hawk Nelson, Decyfer Down, and The Letter Black <b>to</b> promote <b>Skillet's</b> album Awake.

This marked the band's first absence from Universal Studios Orlando's Rock the Universe in five years due to conflicting schedules. However, they were able to perform the following year, in 2010. On September 26, 2009, Skillet appeared at Awakening Music Festival in Leesburg, Virginia, alongside Jeremy Camp, Kutless, Hawk Nelson, Disciple, Decyfer Down, and others.

5000|$|Cousances {{enameled}} {{cast iron}} skillets, pans, gratins, and pots were {{produced in the}} town of Cousances-les-Forges [...] and had features which distinguished them from their competitors, Le Creuset, Descoware of Belgium, and the Scandinavian Copco. Among those features were the base, which was left without enamel (like Copco) but sealed against rust with the final glaze (unlike Copco), and the skillet design which was a French version of the classic American skillet popularized by Griswold and WagnerWare, having two pour spouts, a cast on handle, and a lifting tab on the largest of the handled skillets. That skillet design was altered to include rounded sides for tossing/ sauteeing, and the lift tab being added <b>to</b> smaller <b>skillets</b> for easier pouring. That refinement made the Cousances 20 cm and 26 cm skillets a hit with cooks, who use the skillet as a saucepan for gravies and glazes, because the gravies could be made right in the skillet in which the chops or chicken was fried, and glazes could be perfected much more easily than in a deeper saucepan, and the finished product was easily poured into other containers thanks to the tabs, spouts and handles. The Cousances designs are now produced by Le Creuset from the original patterns, in the original foundry/factory. The small, round medallion style logo which once read [...] "Cousances, Made in France" [...] around the centimeter size, now reads [...] "Le Creuset, Made in France". Le Creuset has changed the colors of the cookware in the old Cousances patterns; but Cousances pots, pans, skillets, roasters and Dutch ovens are still to be found as used pieces, and are recognizable by the medallion logo, glazed natural color cast iron bottoms, which they share with the Le Creuset current line.|$|R
