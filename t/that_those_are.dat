25|$|During archaeological {{excavations}} in 2012 {{the remains}} of a skeleton pierced with an iron bar in the heart were found. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> {{the remains of}} the local nobleman Krivich (or Krivitsa), ruler of the fortress of Sozopol (castrofilax). Believed to be a very cruel person, the locals made sure that he would not come back to haunt the city after his death by piercing him with an iron bar in the chest. There are more than 100 medieval funerals similar to that of Krivitsa found all over Bulgaria. The remains were pierced with either an iron or a wooden bar through the chest {{to make sure that the}} dead will not rise from the grave as a vampire.|$|E

The label didn't have {{the legal right}} to use the name, but I didn't want to get {{involved}} in a legal battle...Keith's my man, just trying to make a little bit of money." [...] KutMasta Kurt stated that Thornton was reluctant to perform songs from the album, because the lyrics did not fit the music. John Lindland, who coproduced the final album under the name One-Watt Sun, stated in defense of the album, [...] "People say it's a fake. We don't have that feeling. We think <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> great tracks. It wasn't about remixing anything. They were our ideas, and Keith went on grooves that we sent to LA." [...] In response to Fanatik J's criticism of the album, One Watt Sun referred to him as being disgruntled {{as a result of the}} label discarding his music. According to Lindland, [...] "If we were him, we'd have [...] beef too".|$|E
500|$|After the {{surrender}} of General John Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga, Williams was exchanged on January 16, 1778. [...] During his imprisonment, Williams had been [...] promoted to colonel and given command of the 6th Maryland Regiment of the Maryland Line. [...] Shortly after his release, he stated {{in a letter to}} the governor of Maryland that the regiment contained [...] "...not above a hundred effective men... and <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> very indifferently clothed." [...] He further stated: [...] "I heartily desire to join the army as soon as possible but certainly it had better be reinforced by a regiment without a colonel than by a colonel without a regiment." [...] After joining Washington's army shortly before the Battle of Monmouth he learned that the regiment was noted for a looseness of discipline and was unable to stand with others in the line during battle. Soon after he took effective command, the 6th Maryland Regiment became known as the equal, if not superior, to any in the whole army.|$|E

2500|$|The Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht has a relic in its {{collection}} {{which is called}} [...] "the hammer of St. Martin of Tours" [...] (Latin: maleus beati Martini) It {{was made in the}} 13th or 14th century from a late Bronze Age stone axe from ca. 1,000 - 700 BC, though the dating is uncertain. The grip contains a Latin text saying [...] "Ydola vanurunt Martini cesa securi nemo deos credat qui sic fuerant ruicuri" [...] ("the pagan statues fall down, hit by St. Martin's axe. Let nobody believe <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> gods, who so easily fall down"). Legend says that the axe belonged to St. Martin, and was used to hit the devil and to destroy the heathen temples and statues.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{surnames}} {{are equal}} to given names, such as Joana Fernando, or André João, in which [...] "Fernando" [...] and [...] "João" [...] are surnames, not given names. It is rather improbable <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> patronymics; {{more likely they}} originated with people with no surnames, who were given two names {{for the sake of}} enhanced individuality. One can find today in Portugal and Brazil people who still use surnames that for other people are just given names, although they were passed from parents to sons for generations, such as Valentim, Alexandre, Fernando, Afonso (note the family name de Melo Afonso) and Antonio (note de Melo Antonio). Names like Dinis, Duarte, Garcia and Godinho were originally given names, but today they are used in Brazil almost exclusively as surnames, although Duarte and Dinis are still common given names in Portugal.|$|E

[...] Although he called the song catchy, Chris Richards of The Washington Post said Kingston [...] "hogs the mike" [...] on the song. Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic wrote about the lyrics, on the album review, <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> [...] "disturbing", but at the same time [...] "unintentionally hilarious." [...] She also criticized the production: [...] "There's not much to say about the kind of producer who thinks the use of the term 'shorty' with an elementary school gimmick is a good idea." [...] Luke O'Neil from The Boston Globe noted [...] "Sultry reggaeton is repackaged here for the tween set with Sean Kingston's 'Eenie Meenie.' Shorty' was never sung so literally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lengthening always occurs before lenis (short) consonants, {{for example}} in words like Daag (day), loose (listen), miir (we). Shortening, on the other hand, always occurs before long or fortis consonants, {{for example in}} Baseldytsch, {{the name of the}} dialect: whereas other dialects have long [...] in Baseldütsch or any other word with -dütsch (German) in it, Basel German always has short [...] or [...] /a:/ and /o:/ (as well as /ø:/), however, are usually not shortened, {{probably}} because of the shift from earlier /a:/ to /o:/. Another reason may be the fact <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> the only vowels that exist as such only as long vowels, i.e. whereas you can shorten [...] to , it is never possible to shorten [...] to [...] because * as such does not exist in Basel German. Some speakers, however, use short open vowels in a number of words, e.g. /hɔkkə/ instead of /ho:kkə/ ('hook'). Those speakers who use this pronunciation lack one minimal pair, since /hɔkkə/ also translates as 'crouch'. However, this shortening of /o:/ /ø:/ /a:/ /æ:/ is not general. Note however that /a:/ exists mainly in words of foreign origin such as /sa'la:tt/.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} quatrain, the beloved becomes [...] "now the world's fresh {{ornament}}". [...] "Fresh" [...] meaning new, young, beautiful, and vital and [...] "now" [...] perhaps {{meaning that the}} world did have another ornament before the youth but <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> gone and perhaps soon so will the youth. The next line, [...] "and only herald to the gaudy spring", means that the beloved is promised for life and growth just like each spring is. But [...] "within thine own bud buriest thy content", the youth only keeps his beauty and life to himself, instead of letting the world see in bloom. The word [...] "buriest" [...] suggests the youth digging his own grave and the end to his beauty. According to Philip J.T. Martin, in this line [...] "content" [...] means [...] "'all that he contains', which of course includes the power to beget children, {{and at the same}} time it means his 'contentment', now and more especially in the future, and the contentment which he could give to others". In the next line, [...] "and, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding", the speaker uses the paradox of the tender churl that makes waste in niggarding as the beginning of the turning point for the sonnet. He is setting up the couplet by saying that the youth is a worthless fellow by sinning and not procreating but that the speaker still loves him for his tenderness. The main theme of this quatrain ends with this line and it is that the youth may be a [...] "bud" [...] but can be the flower to the world and to not bloom is to make waste in that potential through one's own self-indulgence. To some scholars today, such as Helen Vendler, quatrain three is used a [...] "delay in wonder and admiration" [...] of the youth by the speaker. Philip Martin describes the third quatrain as a [...] "tone of self-love, as the poet sees it in the youth" [...] and it is [...] "not praise alone, nor blame alone; not one and then the other; but both at once".|$|E
