5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours {{such as those}} concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court. Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the K Foundation's publicist, Mick Houghton, {{claimed that}} the voting for the K Foundation's award was {{supposed}} to produce a tie, to illustrate <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> the Turner award committee, but that strangely the result had been a huge margin of victory for Whiteread. He speculated that the few thousand voters had just liked or rather disliked {{the sound of her}} name.|$|E
5|$|He criticised <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> {{chastity}} {{for women}} and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E

5|$|Several women poets made {{important}} contributions including: Basavanna's sister Nagalambike {{and his two}} wives, Gangambike and Neelambike, though Neelambike {{seems to have been}} the more prolific. Some female poets were wives of male poets in the Veerashaiva congregation. Notable among them are Satyakka, whose poems compare in quality to those of Akka Mahadevi, Kelavve (a dalit poet), whose poems scorn at the upper caste people, Mahadevi and Lingamma, who wrote poems in a mystic language, Amuge Rayamma and Akkamma, who penned poems on <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> religious pretences, Kadire Remavva (a spinner), who employed a cryptic language called bedagu in her poems, and Muktayakka, who is known for her debates with the patron saint Allama himself. Other names worthy of mention are Lakkamma, Ketaladevi, Guddavve and a princess called Bontadevi.|$|E
5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the word of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E
25|$|Children of God (1987) further {{expanded}} Jarboe's role, {{acting as}} a foil to Michael Gira's tales of suffering, torture and humiliation. The stories portrayed here, however, are ever the more unusual, given their juxtaposition—and admixture—with religious imagery. The intention was neither to mock nor embrace religion, but experiment with the power inherent in its messages and <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> many of its leaders.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{the image}} he builds of Tiberius {{throughout}} {{the first six}} books of the Annals is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly positive in the first books, and predominantly negative after the intrigues of Sejanus.

25|$|Many North American {{hardcore}} punk fans {{adopted a}} dressed-down style of T-shirts, jeans, combat boots or sneakers and crewcut-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts. The clothing style was {{a reflection of}} hardcore ideology, which included dissatisfaction with suburban America and <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> American culture. It was essentially deconstruction of American fashion staples—ripped jeans, holey T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and work boots. The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate hairdos, torn clothes, patches, safety pins, studs, spikes, etc.).|$|E

Bob Thiele of Flying Dutchman Records produced the album, and Scott-Heron {{was accompanied by}} Eddie Knowles and Charlie Saunders on conga and David Barnes on percussion and vocals. The album's 14 tracks dealt with themes such as the superficiality of television and mass consumerism, <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> some would-be black revolutionaries, and white middle-class ignorance of the difficulties faced by inner-city residents.

It is likely that Dickens's own youthful experiences contributed as well.|$|R

50|$|His best-known {{work is the}} Livsens Ondskab (1899) novel, {{depicting}} life in a small provincial Danish town, {{with the}} customs official Knagsted as a red-bearded satyrical Diogenes openly ridiculing <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snobbish bourgeois inhabitants, and Emanual Thomsen as a tragic struggler, trying to obtain the funds needed to regain his ancestral farm. In Knagsted (1902) he created a sequel, letting Knagsted comment on contemporary fashionable society in the Bohemian spa resort of Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary).|$|R
25|$|As a young adult, Tarzan meets a young American woman, Jane Porter. She, her father, {{and others}} of their party are marooned on exactly the same coastal jungle area where Tarzan's {{biological}} parents were twenty years earlier. When Jane returns to the United States, Tarzan leaves the jungle in search of her, his one true love. In The Return of Tarzan, Tarzan and Jane marry. In later books he lives with her {{for a time in}} England. They have one son, Jack, who takes the ape name Korak ("the Killer"). Tarzan is contemptuous of what he sees as <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> civilization, and he and Jane return to Africa, making their home on an extensive estate that becomes a base for Tarzan's later adventures.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, a {{small group}} of OutRage! members covertly formed a {{separate}} group to engage in a campaign of outing public figures who were homophobic in public but gay in private. The group took the name FROCS (Faggots Rooting Out Closeted Sexuality). Tatchell was the group's go-between with the press, forwarding their news statements to his media contacts. Considerable publicity and public debate followed FROCS's threat to out 200 leading public personalities from the world of politics, religion, business and sport. With Tatchell's assistance, members of FROCS eventually called a press conference to tell the world that their campaign was a hoax intended to demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> those newspapers that had condemned the campaign despite having themselves outed celebrities and politicians.|$|E
25|$|Moral aridity, <b>the</b> <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> {{contemporary}} {{life and the}} inability of people to find happiness in traditional ways such as love and marriage are the regnant themes {{in the works of}} Alberto Moravia. Usually, these conditions are pathologically typical of middle-class life; marriage is the target of works such as Disobedience and L'amore coniugale (Conjugal Love, 1949). Alienation is the theme in works such as Il disprezzo (Contempt or A Ghost at Noon. 1954) and La noia (The Empty Canvas) from the 1950s, despite observation from a rational-realistic perspective. Political themes are often present: an example is La Romana (The Woman of Rome, 1947), the story of a prostitute entangled with the Fascist regime and with a network of conspirators. The extreme sexual realism in La noia (The Empty Canvas, 1960) introduced the psychologically experimental works of the 1970s.|$|E
