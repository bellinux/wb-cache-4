She retrieved her old basketball chair, now somewhat mouldy and smelly, from the basement, and sought a game with her old team, RSV Lahn-Dill.

5|$|This {{film was}} shot mainly at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, {{and on his}} arrival at Southampton aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2, Cagney was mobbed by {{hundreds}} of fans. Cunard Line officials, who {{were responsible for the}} security at the dock, said <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything like it, although they had experienced past visits by Marlon Brando and Robert Redford.|$|E
5|$|The Mongol Empire's rise gave Western Christians the {{opportunity}} to visit lands that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before, and they set out in large numbers along the Empire's secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the Crusader states' salvation depended on an alliance with an Eastern monarch, was {{one reason for the}} numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include Franciscan explorers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in 1245 and William of Rubruck in 1253.|$|E

25|$|There was a three-issue Space Patrol comic {{series in}} the early 90s which purported {{to be of the}} TV series, but whose writer and artist {{admitted}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the show.

The chlorine gas that was used by the Germans caused injuries that treatment protocols had not yet been developed for. The only treatment that soothed the Canadian soldiers affected by the gas was the constant care they received from the nurses. Canadian nurses were especially well known for their kindness.|$|E
25|$|Some {{members of}} the French parliament, {{as well as other}} observers, {{publicly}} decried the intense lobbying by various groups and industries. Bernard Carayon, UMP deputy for the Tarn département, denounced lobbying, pressures and even blackmail on the part of certain groups on national TV. A number of parliamentarians said <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> such intense lobbying from all sides, including a grassroot effort from Internet users and free software advocates which inundated them with letters and emails. At one point, Senator Michel Charasse demanded that parliamentary staff clean out corridors of loitering lobbyists.|$|E

25|$|One of Vampires {{most celebrated}} {{sequences}} involves the astronauts performing {{an exploration of}} an alien, derelict ship discovered in a huge ruin {{on the surface of}} the planet. The crewmembers climb up into the depths of the eerie ship and discover the gigantic remains of long dead monstrous creatures. In 1979, Cinefantastique noted the remarkable similarities between this atmospheric sequence and a lengthy scene in the then-new Alien. The magazine also pointed out other minor parallels between the two films. However, both Aliens director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon claimed at the time that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> Planet of the Vampires.|$|E
25|$|At times, {{the lady}} {{could be a}} princesse lointaine, a far-away princess, and some tales told of men who {{had fallen in love}} with women whom <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen,</b> merely on hearing their {{perfection}} described, but normally she was not so distant. As the etiquette of courtly love became more complicated, the knight might wear the colors of his lady: where blue or black were sometimes the colors of faithfulness, green could be a sign of unfaithfulness. Salvation, previously found in the hands of the priesthood, now came from the hands of one's lady. In some cases, there were also women troubadours who expressed the same sentiment for men.|$|E
25|$|Once {{cleared to}} fly one class of {{aircraft}}, pilots could {{be asked to}} ferry any plane in that class even if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> that type of aircraft before. To do so they had Ferry Pilot Notes, a two-ring book of small cards with the critical statistics and notations necessary to ferry each aircraft. A pilot cleared {{on more than one}} class could be asked to fly an aircraft in any of the categories on which he or she was qualified. Thus even a pilot cleared to fly four-engined bombers could be assigned to fly a single-engined trainer if scheduling made this {{the most efficient way to}} get the aircraft to its destination.|$|E

25|$|In the 11 November 2007 episode, Simon Cowell retook {{his status}} as the holder of the fastest lap {{with a time of}} 1:45.90. According to Clarkson, the cameramen said <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> such {{consistency}} in the practice laps. However, Cowell was knocked off the top spot in Series 11 by Jay Kay, who now holds the fastest time in the Lacetti, although Clarkson selected the fastest of Jay Kay's times rather than the last run, which was slower than Cowell's time, seemingly due to a dislike of Cowell (he claimed earlier in the episode that Cowell had been {{at the top of the}} leaderboard for too long). Had this not happened, Cowell would have been knocked off the top by Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud.|$|E
25|$|Returning to the US, {{the newlyweds}} shared Webster's {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park and McKinney's Tymor farm, in Dutchess County, New York. In November 1915, Dear Enemy, {{a sequel to}} Daddy-Long-Legs, was published, and it too {{proved to be a}} bestseller. Also epistolary in form, it chronicles the adventures of a college friend of Judy's who becomes the superintendent of the orphanage in which Judy was raised. Webster became pregnant and according to family tradition, was warned that her pregnancy might be dangerous. She suffered severely from morning sickness, but by February 1916 was feeling better and was able to return to her many activities: social events, prison visits, and meetings about orphanage reform and women's suffrage. She also began a book and play set in Sri Lanka. Her friends reported that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her happier.|$|E
25|$|Sarada Devi {{received}} the highest reverence from the Ramakrishna Order and its devotees. Ramakrishna had bade her continue his mission {{after his death}} and wanted his disciples not to make any distinction between himself and her. According to her devotees and traditional biographers, the hospitality of Sarada Devi was unique and was characterised by motherly care and solicitude. Traditional accounts recount the mystical experiences of her devotees. Some dreamt {{of her as a}} goddess in human form though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her picture before. Others reportedly {{received the}}ir initiation from her in their dream. One such example is of Girish Chandra Ghosh, the father of Bengali drama, who reportedly saw Sarada Devi in a dream when he was nineteen years old and received a mantra. When he met her many years later, to his astonishment she was the same person in the dream.|$|E
50|$|The Aquitian Rangers {{are known}} to react oddly to things on Earth that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before.

25|$|Workers {{also had}} {{good reasons for}} discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable {{sanitary}} conditions, long hours at work (on {{the eve of the}} war a 10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11–12 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's fists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, {{from the point of view}} of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the social and political order.|$|E
25|$|Their white jerseys have {{provided}} three basic color combinations, {{two of which}} have been previously alluded to in this article. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in {{the first game of the}} 2003 season, when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the New York Jets, which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> that particular combination before. That year the Redskins wore it two more times. That look didn't appear again until midway through the 2005 season when the Redskins wore it in a road game against the St. Louis Rams. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination and the local media jokingly pointed out that the reason the Redskins were winning was their use of the white over white combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks, the Redskins wore the all-white uniforms, in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20–10. The Redskins continued to wear the white jerseys and white pants into the 2006 preseason. In the 2006 season, the Redskins started wearing black cleats, something that hadn't been done for quite a while. It was a surprise because they wore white cleats during the preseason. They would have to wear that color for the rest of the season, because the NFL usually asks teams to choose either black or white cleats to be worn throughout the season.|$|E

50|$|Primate gesture is {{at least}} {{partially}} genetic: different nonhuman apes will perform gestures characteristic of their species, even if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> another ape perform that gesture.
