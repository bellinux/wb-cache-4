5|$|With the {{introduction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Douglas</b> C-54 Skymaster four-engined transport aircraft, the United States Army Air Forces, observing that conventional gliders then in service would be an inefficient use of the C-54's power and capacity, determined that a requirement existed for a new, much larger assault glider. It was determined that the best solution to the requirement was the conversion of <b>the</b> <b>Douglas</b> C-47 Skytrain, already in large-scale production, to meet the requirement. The C-47 could be converted to a glider configuration with minimal alteration to the airframe, and would provide the required capacity.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{title of}} <b>Douglas</b> was {{restored}} in 1633 for <b>the</b> 'Red' <b>Douglas</b> line, when William Douglas, 11th Earl of Angus (1589-1660), was created First Marquess of Douglas by Charles I.|$|R
5000|$|The chief line of {{the family}} were <b>the</b> Earls of <b>Douglas</b> which {{represented}} <b>the</b> [...] "Black" [...] line, whereas Angus represented the [...] "Red" [...] Line.

5|$|Six years later, in 1919, {{the city}} {{was caught up in}} the Red Summer riots when {{thousands}} of whites marched from South Omaha to the courthouse to lynch a black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman.

5|$|Test {{data from}} the earlier Lockheed X-7 {{unmanned}} ramjet/rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7's wing and tail. Experience gained from <b>the</b> <b>Douglas</b> X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104. Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Douglas</b> XCG-17 was an American assault glider, {{developed}} by the conversion of a C-47 Skytrain twin-engine transport during World War II. Although the XCG-17 was successful in testing, the requirement for such a large glider had passed, and no further examples of the type were built; one additional C-47, however, was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration briefly during 1946 for evaluation, but was quickly reconverted to powered configuration.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas A-4G Skyhawk is {{a variant}} of <b>the</b> <b>Douglas</b> A-4 Skyhawk attack {{aircraft}} developed for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

The RAN received ten A-4Gs in 1967 and another ten in 1971, and operated the type from 1967 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell {{design was}} {{therefore}} reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company {{received a letter}} of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. On 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had <b>the</b> <b>Douglas</b> A-4 Skyhawk for ground attack and F-8 Crusader for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill {{the need for an}} all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.|$|E
