5|$|TNA {{management}} {{were very}} upset with Sean Waltman after he failed <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> {{participate in the}} Four Way Elimination Tag Team match. This anger was due to Waltman being one-half of {{the winners of the}} Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament. Despite not appearing on the show, Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete, but did not arrive at the arena in time. Waltman was not used by TNA until January15, 2006 when he appeared at their Final Resolution PPV event.|$|E
5|$|The temple's inner {{chambers}} {{centered on}} the sanctuary of the temple's primary god, which typically lay along the axis near {{the back of the}} temple building, and in pyramid temples directly against the pyramid base. The sanctuary was the focus of temple ritual, the place where the divine presence manifested most strongly. The form in which it manifested itself varied. In Aten temples and traditional solar shrines, the object of ritual was the sun itself or a benben stone representing the sun, worshipped in a court open to the sky. In many mortuary temples, the inner areas contained statues of the deceased pharaoh, or a false door where his ba was believed <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> receive offerings.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Ćorović noted that, in {{comparison}} with Dušan, who had also left a considerably extended state, Tvrtko was not an overly ambitious conqueror so much as he was an able statesman. Tvrtko, he wrote, used force when necessary but otherwise took care <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> Serbians as the legitimate heir {{rather than as a}} foreign subjugator and to the Croatians as the preferable ruler. Emphasizing his patience and diplomacy, Ćorović calls Tvrtko a man capable of making the most out of his opportunities.|$|E

5|$|After Parliament {{partially}} repealed the Townshend {{duties in}} 1770, Boston's boycott of British goods ended. Politics became quieter in Massachusetts, although tensions remained. Hancock tried {{to improve his}} relationship with Governor Hutchinson, who in turn sought to woo Hancock away from Adams's influence. In April 1772, Hutchinson approved Hancock's election as colonel of the Boston Cadets, a militia unit whose primary function {{was to provide a}} ceremonial escort for the governor and the General Court. In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock's election to the Council, the upper chamber of the General Court, whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor. Hancock's previous elections to the Council had been vetoed, but now Hutchinson allowed the election to stand. Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute. To avoid hostile crowds in Boston, Hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town; now he agreed to allow the General Court to sit in Boston once again, to the relief of the legislators.|$|E
5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} began <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about}} the sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the title}} of the episode and the {{invocation}} spoken by the character of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs of angels in Christian mythology. Christian angelology holds that there are three groupings of three choirs each. The Thrones are the third-highest ranking choir, belonging to the group charged with attending to God, and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice. Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, belong to the group appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity. Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions, and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons. Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping of angels, those most likely <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> mankind. Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others, teaching kings and heads of families the skills needed to lead.|$|E

The second part adopts a diachronic point of view; research on the Corpus of Historical English and on The Complete Shakespeare’s Works provides an insight into the development of happen <b>to</b> and <b>appear</b> <b>to.</b> The question of the degree of grammaticalization for these two structures will also be tackled, to reach the conclusion that even if happen <b>to</b> and <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> were created through a grammaticalization process, {{it can be argued that}} the process is incomplete, morphosyntactically speaking.

5|$|His most {{significant}} influence was {{the introduction of}} the idea of wild gardening, which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English Flower Garden. The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow, woodand, and waterside is taken for granted today, but was revolutionary in Robinson's time. In the first edition, he happily used any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy perennials and natives {{from other parts of the}} world—thus Robinson's wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson's own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the 'garden' is designed <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson's ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to Blizzard's {{official}} {{announcement of}} the playable character, the developers teased his release by modifying the Doomfist gauntlet in Numbani <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be stolen from its glass case. Blizzard finally confirmed the Doomfist's development with a teaser trailer in early July 2017, a week after news of the release leaked through the game's crash logs. The reveal cinematic was drawn in an anime-style by Wolf Smoke Studio, based in Shanghai, who had previously expressed and rallied interest in developing an anime in the game's fictional universe. Blizzard also sent an official Doomfist cosplayer to the San Diego Comic-Con and Overwatch World Cup Sydney qualifier. Soon after the reveal, Doomfist became playable on the game's test servers, {{where some of the}} character's powers were rebalanced to reduce punch distance and vertical mobility. The playable character was released for all platforms on July 27, 2017.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} in {{mid-19th century}} America {{for a candidate}} for high office not <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> seek it. Thus, Fillmore remained at the comptroller's office in Albany, and made no speeches; the 1848 campaign was conducted in the newspapers and with addresses made by surrogates at rallies. The Democrats nominated Michigan Senator Lewis Cass for president, with General William O. Butler his running mate, {{but it would be}} a three-way fight as the Free Soil Party, opposed to the spread of slavery, chose former president Van Buren. There was a crisis among the Whigs when Taylor also accepted the presidential nomination of a group of dissident South Carolina Democrats. Fearing that Taylor would be an party apostate like Tyler, Weed in late August scheduled a rally in Albany aimed at electing an uncommitted slate of presidential electors, but Fillmore interceded with the editor, assuring him that Taylor was loyal to the party.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the castle}} meres can still be seen to the west {{of the castle}}, {{although}} in the 16th century there were two lakes, much larger than today, complete with a wharf. This dramatic use of water to reflect the image of the castle is similar to that used at several other castles of the period, including Bredwardine and Ravensworth Castle. Water castles such as Framlingham made greater use of water than was necessary for defence and enhanced the appearance of the castle. The view from the Great Hall in the Inner Court would originally have included the gardens of the Lower Court, and these would have then been framed by the mere and the Great Park beyond. The area around the castle today remains a designed and managed landscape; although the Great Park is now covered by fields, the view still gives a sense of how the castle and landscape was meant <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> its late medieval owners.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2000, {{with the}} {{discovery}} of at least three bodies (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and orbit, it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the classification of planets in other planetary systems. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the first measurement of the size of Eris. That measurement had showed Eris (as it was mistakenly believed to be until the New Horizons mission to Pluto) <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet' at the time.|$|E
5|$|The early-to-mid 1800s were {{a period}} of intense debate on the particle-versus-wave nature of light. Although the {{observation}} of the Arago spot in 1819 may seem to have settled the matter definitively in favor of Fresnel's wave theory of light, various concerns continued <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be addressed more satisfactorily by Newton's corpuscular theory. Arago had suggested in 1838 that a differential comparison {{of the speed of}} light in air versus water would serve to prove or disprove the wave nature of light. In 1850, racing against Foucault to establish this point, Fizeau engaged L.F.C. Breguet to build a rotary-mirror apparatus in which he split a beam of light into two beams, passing one through water while the other traveled through air. Beaten by Foucault by a mere seven weeks, he confirmed that the speed of light was greater as it traveled through air, validating the wave theory of light.|$|E

5|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of anti-aligned extreme trans-Neptunian objects with orbits that intersect that of Planet Nine {{is the result}} of their resonant dynamics. Objects in mean-motion resonances with a massive planet are phase protected, preventing them from making close approaches to the planet. When the orbit of a resonant object drifts out of phase,} causing it to make closer approaches to a massive planet, the changes in the perturbations the planet exerts on the object alters its semi-major axis in the direction that reverses the drift. This process repeats as the drift continues in the other direction causing the orbit <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> rock back and forth, or librate, about a stable center when viewed in a rotating frame of reference. In the example at right, when the orbit of a plutino drifts backward it loses angular momentum when it makes closer approaches ahead of Neptune, causing its semi-major axis and period to shrink, reversing the drift.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} his staff were anxious for the {{president}} <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be recovering quickly, and the morning after his operation he saw visitors and signed a piece of legislation. Reagan left the hospital on the 13th day. Initially, he worked {{two hours a day}} in the White House's residential quarters, with meetings held there instead of the Oval Office. Reagan did not lead a Cabinet meeting until day 26, did not leave Washington until day 49, and did not hold a press conference until day 79. Ruge, the Physician to the President, thought recovery was not complete until October. Reagan's plans for the month after the shooting were canceled, including a visit to the Mission Control Center at Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in April 1981 during STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle. Vice President Bush instead called the orbiting astronauts during their mission. Reagan would visit Mission Control during STS-2 that November.|$|E

They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result {{in an area of}} high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E

5|$|The British {{television}} {{premiere of}} the video was extremely controversial. The video had not been ready when the track debuted in the UK singles chart. By {{the time it was}} finalised, the track had dropped in the chart. McCartney flew to London to premiere the video on the BBC1 TV show Top Of The Pops, but the show had a strict policy that no single that had dropped in position could feature on the programme and refused to show it. A furious argument ensued, with claims McCartney threatened to withdraw all his music from the corporation. As a compromise, the BBC offered to air the video two days later on The Late, Late Breakfast Show hosted by Noel Edmonds, a variety show that featured live music performances, but rarely aired videos. They agreed to show it on the programme only if McCartney appeared live and gave an interview. He reluctantly agreed and appeared with his wife Linda live on the show on Saturday, 29 October 1983; his first live UK TV appearance since 1973. The interview was stilted and the McCartneys made little or no effort to answer any of Edmonds' questions. After some reportedly hostile negotiations, the programme's entire show was built around the 'medicine men' theme of the video and the guest who had been booked to appear that week Olivia Newton John had to agree <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> promote the video in a skit, reportedly against her will and she expressed anger at having her 'starring' role in the show downgraded into a lesser guest spot {{to make way for the}} video and McCartney. The airing of the video on this highly rated show was successful as the track climbed back up the chart the following week and aired on Top Of The Pops on Thursday, 4 November 1983.|$|E
