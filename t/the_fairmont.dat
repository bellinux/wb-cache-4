5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fairmont</b> model {{opened up}} the luxury sector for the BA range. Externally, <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> could be {{distinguished}} from the other BA models with its 16-inch alloy wheels and grey mesh grille with chrome surround. Some of the standard features included traction control and dual-zone climate control air conditioning, an analogue clock on the top centre console stack, wood grain highlights, and velour upholstery. Automatic headlights, which turn off or on depending on surrounding environmental conditions, were now standard on <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> model. In addition to this, <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> also received illuminated footwells. The basic mechanical setup carried over from the XT, although buyers could opt for the Barra 220 V8 engine.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E

2500|$|The seventh {{generation}} Falcon, {{known as}} the [...] "FG", was announced at a press event on 17 February 2008. The FG moniker references <b>the</b> now discontinued <b>Fairmont</b> Ghia (with <b>the</b> Futura model also discontinued), consistent with a more streamlined range consisting of: Falcon XT, XR6 and XR8 and the G-series models Falcon G6 and G6E, replacing <b>the</b> base <b>Fairmont</b> and <b>the</b> top-of-the-range <b>Fairmont</b> Ghia (<b>the</b> latter's V8 variant now replaced by the G6E Turbo).|$|R

The premium sound system, which incorporated a full-colour LCD screen, was standard, and the centre console stack was characterised by an analogue clock.

5|$|The albums {{completed}} her United Artists/EMI contracts and Turner left the labels. Continuing her performing career with her second headlining tour, Wild Lady of Rock 'n' Roll, {{she continued to}} be a successful live act even without the premise of a hit record. Following an appearance on Olivia Newton-John's US TV special, Hollywood Nights, in 1979, Turner sought contract with Newton-John's manager Roger Davies. Davies agreed to work with Turner as her manager after seeing her perform at the Venetian Ballroom in <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> San Francisco hotel in February 1980.|$|E
50|$|Most of Blanco's early {{professional}} tour appearances were {{earned by}} qualifying for tournaments. He {{would do so}} by winning the qualifier's rounds that are usually played before the tournaments themselves, to fill one last tournament spot. It was that way {{that he was able}} to participate at <b>the</b> <b>Fairmonts</b> tournament in Scottsdale, Arizona, U.S. in 1996, for example.|$|R

5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. Anti-lock brakes were {{standard}} on all models; electronic brakeforce distribution was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of traction control for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front airbags were a standard fitment across the range; side-impact airbags were equipped on higher luxury levels such as <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont.</b> In a crash safety assessment conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
5|$|Pflueger, {{who started}} as a working-class {{draftsman}} and never went to college, established his imprint {{on the development of}} Art Deco in California architecture yet demonstrated facility in many styles including Streamline Moderne, neo-Mayan, Beaux-Arts, Mission Revival, Neoclassical and International. His work as an interior designer resulted in an array of influential interior spaces, including luxurious cocktail lounges such as the Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, the Patent Leather Bar at the St. Francis Hotel and the Cirque Room at <b>The</b> <b>Fairmont,</b> three of the most successful San Francisco bars in their day.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee (SYOGOC) was {{tasked with}} organising the inaugural Games. It was {{aided by a}} panel of advisors {{composed}} of Cabinet ministers and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Teo Ser Luck. In addition, an Inter-Ministry Committee was established with Niam Chiang Meng, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports as its chairman. Singapore also received some international support for the Games preparations. The People's Republic of China, host of the 2008 Summer Olympics, expressed its desire to assist Singapore in its preparations. Sebastian Coe, Lord Coe, Chairman of the London Organising Committee for the 2012 Summer Olympics, announced that members of his organising team, including coaches and administrators, planned to attend the event. The Bid Committee secured 4,310 guaranteed rooms in 36 hotels. The official hotel partner for the Games was <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> Singapore.|$|E

5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} base and sports models, Ford also marketed two luxury-oriented variants. The first of the two, known as <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> {{employed}} the same six-cylinder engine as the Futura and GLi. Building on the equipment level of the Futura, <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> gained, automatic climate control air conditioning, trip computer, power rear windows, oil pressure and battery level gauges, front and rear illuminated footwells, electric aerial and full velour interior. Exterior wise, a more prominent chrome front grille, a larger bonnet bulge, and differently shaped headlamps distinguished <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> from other EL models, as did 15-inch, 12-spoke alloy wheels. <b>The</b> <b>Fairmont</b> was also fitted with chrome insert side body mouldings and carried over the tail light lenses from the previous EF model.|$|E
25|$|Ford's next model Falcon, the XD (Project Blackwood), {{introduced}} in 1979, bore many external styling resemblances to the European Ford Granada, but was slightly larger and less luxurious. Improved body reinforcing allowed many reductions in component weight to be made, improving performance and braking. <b>The</b> <b>Fairmont</b> Ghia replaced <b>the</b> <b>Fairmont</b> GXL.|$|E
