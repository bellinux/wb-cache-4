5|$|In 1905, {{three years}} after the Apperson {{brothers}} split from Haynes, Haynes-Apperson was renamed the Haynes Automobile Company and Haynes launched a series of publicity campaigns. A parade of 2,000 cars was organized in New York City during 1908 and Haynes, whom many recognized as the inventor of the American automobile, led the parade down Broadway riding in the Pioneer. He was followed by ten Haynes cars, a model from each year to display <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology.</b> On his way to the parade, Haynes was unaware of the city's newly established speeding laws and was arrested for driving too fastin a car with a top speed of 15mph (17km/h)and taken to jail. He was soon able to see a magistrate who released him after learning that he was Elwood Haynes and had come to lead the parade. The celebration was intended to be a ten-year commemoration of the invention of the automobile, although earlier self-vehicles dated back nearly twenty years in Europe. Haynes donated the Pioneer to the United States Government in 1910 to be placed in the Smithsonian Institution where it is still on display in the National Museum of American History as the second oldest motorized vehicle in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Owing to the {{increasing}} complexity of regulation of cellular processes and the roles proteases play in them, bioinformatics {{continues to be an}} invaluable tool for degradomics. Software, databases, and projects developed for this purpose have accompanied <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology.</b> Software developed in the Overall Lab (CLIPPER) statistically evaluates cleavage site candidates determined by degradomic approaches. One web-based data site, WebPICS, incorporates and integrates cleavage site analysis from PICS experiments into MEROPS, the protease database. Another database, Termini oriented protein Function Inferred Database (TopFIND), serves as a knowledge base to integrate protein termini formed by protease processing with functional interpretations. By combining research literature and other biological databases including UniProt, MEROPS, Ensembl, and TisDB, the database comprehensively renders protein termini modifications accessible to a broad scientific community. Using TopFIND, terminal modifications can be identified and visualized across proteins thanks to all available in silico, in vitro, and in vivo findings. Using TopFINDer and Path FINDer software, research findings can be mathematically modelled into a network of pathways regulated by proteases, further contributing to the “protease web”.|$|E

In this age of technology, city dwellers seldom write their own Fai Chun. Instead, they purchase them in the stationery stores or shopping malls where a wide diversity of styles is offered.Thanks to <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology,</b> Fai Chun can be printed in multiple colors. Commercialization of Fai Chun can be seen when animated characters are used to attract children while sparkling decoration are used to attract adults. Moreover, the material of Fai Chun is no more limited to mere paper. Fai chun made by cloth, plastic and layers of cardboards are quite common. Nevertheless, the practice of writing Fai Chun continues in traditional areas, particularly in walled villages.|$|E

The veteran food photographer of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Saveur magazine Dave Hagerman mentioned that Instagram, one of the social media that has the most posts of ‘Camera Eats First’ photos, provides a way for people to share and indulge their common obsession of food globally, thus encouraging taking pictures of food for personal use. More importantly, keeping a photogenic food diary is being treated as a form of self representation, showing who they are from what they eat in accordance to the quote of “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.”, by the French philosopher and gourmand Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, 1825.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of the “synthetic situation” is arguably her most important, new concept. It {{is defined as a}} situation that “…invariably includes, and may in fact be entirely constituted by, on-screen projections…”. A synthetic situation, therefore, can manifest in many ways, both informal and formal. Examples include an online video chat, playing video games against others on the Internet or even a business deal done via videoconference. This idea {{can be seen as a}} result of <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> in recent years, and adds a new dimension to Goffman’s social situation where face-to-face interaction is required. Knorr Cetina explains the difference of the two situations by the use of surgery. A Goffmanian situation occurs when there is just the surgeon and the patient. A synthetic situation arises, however, when the surgeon uses technology like a scope and a screen in order to accomplish the task at hand. Without looking at the patient through the screen, the job would not be able to be done and would remain a face-to-face, social situation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> {{has enabled}} {{tasks that are}} too complex for human and {{extended}} human capabilities. Automation such as, GPS, traffic alert, and auto pilot, has been incorporated into aviation and {{has become one of}} the prime resources for critical decision making. With the sophistication and accuracy of current technology, humans have been relying on it excessively, which results in automation bias. Referenced from Human-Computer Studies, an experiment was conducted to measure the effects of automation bias on decision making. Two control groups were selected to monitor a specific task, with the first groups having access to reliable automation aid and the second group with no access to aid. The results showed that the second group in non-automated settings out performed their counterpart. The first group made more errors when not explicitly prompted by automation, moreover, they followed the instruction of automation even when it contradicted their decision. This experiment shows the example of automation bias and participants high degree of obedience to automation. Automation bias can lead to critical errors in pilot decision making, as it is one of the many difficulties in today's digital age.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his early}} life Bragge’s {{profession}} {{was that of}} a cabinetmaker. It was only with <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> that during the early sixties he was able to engage in photography. It is difficult to ascertain how he developed his skills in photography. Similar to many photographers, he began as a studio portrait photographer. He later travelled around the lower North Island, with his darkroom contained in a horse-drawn carriage. He travelled to small towns and took photos of the locations, some including the local people. It appears that he made postcards from the photos, and sold them to the townsfolk. They in turn would send these postcards to their relative in England, as a kind-of curio of what New Zealand was like. His photographic skill is very evident in the many photos he took during the Wairarapa expeditions. William Main states in his book, Bragge’s Wellington and the Wairarapa, [...] "Street scenes of 1869 are not rare, but those filled with people are." [...] This may explain the interest in Bragge’s photographs. A wide variety of his photos included people, some even believed to be of Bragge himself.|$|E

5000|$|Modernization of {{the health}} sector of {{developing}} nations recognizes that transitioning from 'traditional' to 'modern' is not merely <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> {{and the introduction of}} Western practices; implementing modern healthcare requires the reorganization of political agenda and, in turn, an increase in funding by feeders and resources towards public health. However, rather than replicating the stages of developed nations, whose roots of modernization are found with the context of industrialization or colonialism, underdeveloped nations should apply proximal interventions to target rural communities and focus on prevention strategies rather than curative solutions. That has been successfully exhibited by the Christian Medical Commission and in China through 'barefoot doctors'. Additionally, a strong advocate of the DE-emphasis of medical institutions was Halfdan T. Mahler, the WHO General Director from 1973 to 1988. Related ideas have been proposed at international conferences such as Alma-Ats and the [...] "Health and Population in Development" [...] conference, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation in Italy in 1979, and selective primary healthcare and GOBI were discussed (although they have both been strongly criticized by supporters of comprehensive healthcare). Overall, however, {{this is not to say}} that the nations of the Global South can function independently from Western states; significant funding is received from well-intention programs, foundations, and charities that target epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis that have substantially improved the lives of millions of people and impeded future development.|$|E
