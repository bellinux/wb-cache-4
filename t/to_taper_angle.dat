This provides non-destructive taper measurement with fast processing in manufacturing line. The laser ablation of a free end of the cantilever bar enables to generate a recoil pressure at the irradiated surface while resulting in external forcing function for the initiation of the flexural motion. Consequently, in the present study, laser induced ablation of free end tapered cantilever bar and resulting displacement and frequency of the flexural motion is examined. The study is extended to include influence {{of positive and negative}} bar <b>taper</b> <b>angles</b> on the flexural characteristics. In addition, deviation of displacement and frequency of the flexural motion due <b>to</b> <b>tapered</b> bar from the parallel bar is examined. It is found that the flexural characteristics of the <b>tapered</b> bar enable <b>to</b> determine <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> of the bar with high accuracy...|$|R

Two types of taper die with different die half angles (45 ° and 60 °) were prepared. The test lubricants used were paraffinic mineral oil VG 460 and Refined, Bleached and Deodorized (RBD) Palm stearin. The material of the workpiece (billet) was annealed with A 1100 aluminium. The experimental results were focused on the extrusion load, tool and workpiece surface roughness and plastic deformation of the workpiece.

Results from some {{studies show that}} pore pressure in accretionary wedges {{can be viewed as}} a dynamically maintained response to factors which drive pore pressure (source terms) and those that limit flow (permeability and drainage path length). Sediment permeability and incoming sediment thickness are the most important factors, whereas fault permeability and the partitioning of sediment have a small effect. In one such study, it was found that as sediment permeability is increased, pore pressure decreases from near-lithostatic to hydrostatic values and allows stable <b>taper</b> <b>angles</b> <b>to</b> increase from ∼2.5° to 8°-12.5°. With increased sediment thickness (from 100 - 8000 m), increased pore pressure drives a decrease in stable <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> from 8.4°-12.5° <b>to</b> <2.5-5°. In general, low-permeability and thick incoming sediment sustain high pore pressures consistent with shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high-permeability and thin incoming sediment should result in steep geometry. Active margins characterized by a significant proportion of fine-grained sediment within the incoming section, such as northern Antilles and eastern Nankai, exhibit thin <b>taper</b> <b>angles,</b> whereas those characterized by a higher proportion of sandy turbidites, such as Cascadia, Chile, and Mexico, have steep <b>taper</b> <b>angles.</b> Observations from active margins also indicate a strong trend of decreasing <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> (from >15° <b>to</b> <4°) with increased sediment thickness (from <1 to 7 km).|$|R

Thirty prototype cylindrical titanium alloy 5. 0 mm-diameter dental implants with different TIS-connection designs were divided into six groups and tested for their fracture strength, using a universal testing machine. These groups consisted of combinations of 3. 5 and 4. 0 mm abutment diameter, each with <b>taper</b> <b>angles</b> of 6 °, 8 ° or 10 °. 3 -Dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) was also used to analyze stress states at implant-abutment connection areas. In general, the mechanical tests found an increasing trend of implant fracture forces as the <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> enlarged. When the abutment diameter was 3. 5 mm, the mean fracture forces for 8 ° and 10 ° taper groups were 1638. 9 N± 20. 3 and 1577. 1 N± 103. 2, respectively, both larger than that for the 6 ° taper group of 1475. 0 N± 24. 4, with the largest increasing rate of 11. 1 %. Furthermore, the difference between 8 ° and 6 ° taper groups was significant, based on Tamhane's multiple comparison test (P< 0. 05). In 4. 0 mm-diameter abutment groups, as the <b>taper</b> <b>angle</b> was enlarged from 6 ° to 8 ° and 10 °, the mean fracture value was increased from 1066. 7 N± 56. 1 to 1241. 4 N± 6. 4 and 1419. 3 N± 20. 0, with the largest increasing rate of 33. 1 %, and the differences among the three groups were significant (P< 0. 05).
