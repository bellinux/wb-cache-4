5|$|Alexander's legacy {{includes}} the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism.

Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of Achilles, and he features prominently in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history.|$|E
