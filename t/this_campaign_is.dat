5|$|The Campaign of William Wallace {{acts as a}} {{tutorial}} campaign, {{much like}} the original Age of Empires game, and emphasises on how to move units, collect and gather resources, obtain and store holy relics and defeat the enemy, which in <b>this</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>is</b> presented as the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, commanded by the evil, torturous but skilled commander Edward Longshanks.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this. There is no evidence that any of these allies received any substantial aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War.|$|E
5|$|Even though <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> {{overshadowed by}} other {{battles of the}} revolution, {{it was one of}} the most important. The Maniates stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been {{defeated}} this decisively before. The women who defeated the Egyptians at Diros have been given the name of 'The Amazons of Diros'. This was the last invasion of Mani as Ibrahim abandoned any ideas of conquering it. On the April 26, 1827 the Turkish navy bombarded Oitylo with over 1,700 cannonballs hitting the town.|$|E

50|$|In 1944 (lasting until 1948), {{prominent}} U.S. {{policy makers}} launched a domestic propaganda campaign aimed at convincing the U.S. public {{to accept a}} harsh peace for the German people. One method used in <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> an attempt to remove the commonly held view that the German people and the Nazi party were separate entities. A key participant in <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> the Writers' War Board, which was {{closely associated with the}} Roosevelt administration.|$|R

5|$|Following Suleiman's {{unsuccessful}} Siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand {{launched a}} counter-attack in 1530 {{to regain the}} initiative and avenge the destruction brought by Suleiman's 120,000 strong army. <b>This</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> usually considered as {{the start of the}} Little War, the period of a series conflicts between the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire. An assault of Buda was driven off by John Zápolya, the vassal King of Hungary, but Ferdinand was successful elsewhere, capturing Gran (Esztergom) and other forts along the Danube river, a vital strategic frontier.|$|E
5|$|This {{campaign}} takes places {{years after}} the {{events that led to}} the First Crusade and capture of Jerusalem. Saladin (who the player acts as throughout <b>this</b> <b>campaign)</b> <b>is</b> first tasked with establishing himself in Egypt and removing the Crusaders there, in order to become Sultan of Egypt. A villainous Crusader by the name of Reynald de Chatillon has continuously violated the fragile peace between the Crusaders and the Saracens, causing great concern to Saladin. Raids by Crusaders in the Red Sea are eventually suppressed by the Saracens. At the Battle of Hattin, the Saracens win a decisive victory over the combined strength of the Knights Templar, Knights Hospitallers, Jerusalem and the English Crusaders, capture Reynold de Chatillon (who is the only prisoner executed by Saladin personally) and obtain a piece of the True Cross as an important relic.|$|E

In July 2007 <b>was</b> launched <b>campaign</b> "možná ti ulehčí cestu", which was primarily {{designed to provide}} much better market performance. Although <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> very successful, today, after three years, {{it is obvious that}} a basic goal of <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>was</b> not fulfilled. <b>This</b> thesis deals with detailed characterization of the whole campaign and with following testing and effects evaluation by using of series in-depth interviews and one focus group. Due to large amount of the gathered data about <b>campaign</b> I <b>was</b> able to identify strong and weak elements of <b>this</b> <b>campaign.</b> If it <b>was</b> possible I designed improvement of the weak elements. These designs were tested again to verify their potential effects...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of the secrecy of the campaign, {{detailed}} and systematic information of all of the activities carried out by the state is not existent, as {{a result of}} this the information known about the victims and actions of <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> limited. However, there were a number of notable incidents that were largely recorded by the church.|$|E

25|$|Mining, refining, and {{recycling}} of rare earths have serious environmental consequences if not properly managed. A particular hazard is mildly radioactive slurry tailings {{resulting from the}} common occurrence of thorium and uranium in rare-earth element ores. Additionally, toxic acids are required during the refining process. Improper handling of these substances can result in extensive environmental damage. In May 2010, China announced a major, five-month crackdown on illegal mining {{in order to protect}} the environment and its resources. <b>This</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> expected to be concentrated in the South, where mines– commonly small, rural, and illegal operations– are particularly prone to releasing toxic wastes into the general water supply. However, even the major operation in Baotou, in Inner Mongolia, where much of the world's rare-earth supply is refined, has caused major environmental damage.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Adal {{organised}} {{an effective}} army led by Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi that invaded the Abyssinian empire. <b>This</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> historically {{known as the}} Conquest of Abyssinia or Futuh al Habash. During the war, Ahmed pioneered the use of cannons supplied by the Ottoman Empire, which were deployed against Solomonic forces and their Portuguese allies led by Cristóvão da Gama. Some scholars argue that this conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of firearms such as the matchlock musket, cannons and the arquebus over traditional weapons. After the death of Imam Ahmad, the Adal Sultanate lost most of its territory in Abyssnian lands. In 1550 Nur ibn Mujahid assumed power after he killed Abyssinian emperor Gelawdewos. Due to constant Oromo raids both Adal and Abyssinian rulers struggled to consolidate power outside of their realms. During the rule of Muhammed Jasa in 1577 he transferred the capital from Harar to Aussa. The Adal Sultanate subsequently ended due to infighting with Afar tribes.|$|E
25|$|Kitchener warned French in January 1915 {{that the}} Western Front was a siege line {{that could not}} be breached, in the context of Cabinet discussions about amphibious {{landings}} on the Baltic or North Sea Coast, or against Turkey. In an effort {{to find a way to}} relieve pressure on the Western front, Lord Kitchener proposed an invasion of Alexandretta with Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), New Army, and Indian troops. Alexandretta was an area with a large Christian population and was the strategic centre of the Ottoman Empire's railway network— its capture would have cut the empire in two. Yet he was instead eventually persuaded to support Winston Churchill's disastrous Gallipoli Campaign in 1915–1916. (Churchill's responsibility for the failure of <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> debated; for more information see David Fromkin's A Peace to End All Peace.) That failure, combined with the Shell Crisis of 1915– amidst press publicity engineered by Sir John French– dealt Kitchener's political reputation a heavy blow; Kitchener was popular with the public, so Asquith retained him in office in the new coalition government, but responsibility for munitions was moved to a new ministry headed by David Lloyd George. He was a sceptic about the tank, which is why it was developed under the auspices of Churchill’s Admiralty.|$|E

500|$|A story-driven {{campaign}} entitled [...] "Road to Independence" [...] is also included, {{allowing the}} player {{to guide the}} British colonisation of America in three structured chapters. The first sees the player establish and develop the English colony of Jamestown, the second focuses on the British fighting both the French and their allied Native American nations in the French and Indian War, whilst the third has the player directing the American Continental Army against the British in the War of Independence. <b>This</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> goal-oriented and strictly historical, and also functions as a tutorial for the gameplay, both military, economic and political. Completion of [...] "Road to Independence" [...] unlocks the newly formed United States to use in a shorter, later version of the full campaign.|$|E
500|$|There {{seems to}} have been a {{northern}} campaign to Britannia that was aborted. <b>This</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> derided by ancient historians with accounts of Gauls dressed up as Germanic tribesmen at his triumph and Roman troops ordered to collect seashells as [...] "spoils of the sea". The few primary sources disagree on what precisely occurred. Modern historians have put forward numerous theories in an attempt to explain these actions. This trip to the English Channel could have merely been a training and scouting mission. The mission may have been to accept the surrender of the British chieftain Adminius. [...] "Seashells", or conchae in Latin, may be a metaphor for something else such as female genitalia (perhaps the troops visited brothels) or boats (perhaps they captured several small British boats).|$|E
500|$|Human Rights Watch (HRW)'s Africa {{division}} {{senior researcher}} Anneke Van Woudenberg {{wrote in a}} statement: [...] "We’ve spent years investigating the horrors perpetrated by the LRA in central Africa—Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic (CAR), and South Sudan. We gathered evidence at massacre sites—wooden clubs covered in dried blood, rubber strips from bicycle tires used to tie up the victims, and freshly dug graves—and spoke to hundreds {{of boys and girls}} forced to fight for his army or held captive as sex slaves. And we’re elated that #stopKony is a trending topic on Twitter—if anyone deserves global notoriety it’s Kony." [...] She added: [...] "Arresting Kony and other senior LRA leaders would reaffirm that those who commit mass atrocities will face justice. It will also help end the scourge {{of one of the most}} brutal rebel groups in Africa." [...] HRW's LRA researcher Ida Sawyer reaffirmed, [...] "we definitely support the message of the film and we think it's great that they're bringing so much attention to the film with Kony's crimes and the phenomena of the LRA." [...] Amnesty International, which had documented what it described as the LRA's [...] "horrific impact on the lives of thousands of civilians in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Uganda" [...] and for years had been calling for the LRA leaders to be arrested, welcomed the massive public response to the Kony 2012 campaign. Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: [...] "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>is</b> a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," [...] but added: [...] "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights", especially because [...] "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.|$|E
