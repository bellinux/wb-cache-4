500|$|Radiohead found touring {{stressful}} {{and took}} a break in January 1996. They sought to distance their new material from the introspective style of The Bends. Drummer Phil Selway said: [...] "There was {{an awful lot of}} soul-searching [...] To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring." [...] Yorke, Radiohead's primary lyricist, said at the time, [...] "we could really fall back on just doing another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all. And I'm deliberately just writing down all the positive things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> or see. I'm not able to put them into music yet and I don't want to just force it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Layton {{started off}} the 2008 federal {{election}} campaign with a speech {{similar to that}} of US presidential nominee Barack Obama. Layton denied he was trying to draw comparisons with Obama, saying [...] "I mean, I am a lot shorter than he is. He is a brilliant orator. I'm never going to claim to be that. But what I have noticed is that the key issues faced by the American middle class, the working people of the U.S. and their concerns about their families' futures, are awfully similar to the issues <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> in Canada." [...] Layton said that he has also written to Obama and Hillary Clinton saying that the North American Free Trade Agreement had hurt working people in both countries [...] "and those stories have to be told." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Connor is Sarah's son and {{the future}} leader of the human resistance. He is only 14 {{years old at the}} {{beginning}} of the show, turning fifteen in the season one finale. As the series progresses, John struggles with his feelings for Cameron, who is a Terminator. Dekker was cast after Headey secured the role of Sarah Connor. Regarding the Terminator films, Dekker says [...] "They are like my favorite films when I was younger. So it's very ironic that I'm getting to do this. And I know for the younger generation and for myself, John was equally important to me as Sarah was, and I know a lot of the people <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> from really, really care about John". Dekker describes his character as [...] "a continuation of Eddie Furlong's character" [...] but [...] "he's in a darker, more mature place now".|$|E
