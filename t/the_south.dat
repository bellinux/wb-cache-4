5|$|Controversy {{continued}} to flare in Britain {{and other countries}} regarding sporting links with South Africa. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> Africa rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack <b>the</b> <b>South</b> African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people tried to stop <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Africans from reaching the match venue by lying {{down in the middle}} of the street. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Africa rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic High and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Pacific High both {{influence}} {{the pattern of}} winds in Argentina.

This occurs throughout the year due to the atmospheric pressure being lower on land than in the ocean. Much of the north and central {{parts of the country}} are affected by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic High, with a strong influence in the eastern parts than in the west. This is due to the eastern parts being more frequently affected by <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic High, causing precipitation to decrease westwards.|$|E
