50|$|In {{a typical}} {{diverter}} switch powerful springs are tensioned by a low power motor (motor drive unit, MDU), and then rapidly released {{to effect the}} tap changing operation. To reduce arcing at the contacts, the tap changer operates in a chamber filled with insulating transformer oil, or inside a vessel filled with pressurized SF6 gas. Reactance-type tap changers, when operating in oil, must allow for the additional inductive transients generated by the autotransformer and commonly include a vacuum bottle contact in parallel with the diverter switch. During a <b>tap</b> <b>change</b> operation, the potential rapidly increases between the two electrodes in the bottle, {{and some of the}} energy is dissipated in an arc discharge through the bottle instead of flashing across the diverter switch contacts.|$|E

The purpose of condition monitoring is to obtain valuable information on, for example, the status of the insulation (or other important safety-related parameters). Data clustering techniques - such as the self-organizing map (SOM), have been applied to vibration monitoring and analysis of transformer on-load tap-changers (OLTCS). Using vibration monitoring, it can be observed that each <b>tap</b> <b>change</b> operation generates a signal that contains information about the condition of the tap changer contacts and the drive mechanisms. Obviously, different tap positions will generate different signals. However, there was considerable variability amongst normal condition signals for exactly the same tap position.

Voltage changes in medium voltage (MV) cables due to {{transformer}} <b>tap</b> <b>changes</b> will also change the current flowing through the cable, which will change the cable temperature. In order to extend the cable life, this paper aims to simulate and analyse the potential thermal lifetime improvement of cables through long-term <b>tap</b> <b>changes</b> within the statutory levels. Firstly, the IEC standard (60287) method for rating and modelling cables is applied to evaluate the cable temperature under different voltages and relative currents.

This study investigates the interferences and dynamics of a parallel and autonomous operation of HV/MV on-load tap changer (OLTC) control and autonomous PV inverter control. The focus of this investigation is to identify whether {{reactive power}} provided by PV inverters can cause an increase of HV/MV transformer <b>tap</b> <b>changes.</b> The analysis is based on simulations of a real German distribution grid with a high share of PV generation. To incorporate realistic power fluctuations of PV systems in the investigated grid, geographically distributed solar irradiation measurements are used as input data for the simulations. The simulations show that reactive power provided by PV inverters can {{lead to an increase}} of reactive power fluctuations over the HV/MV transformer and can thus cause a significant increase of OLTC <b>tap</b> <b>changes.</b> The number of additional <b>tap</b> <b>changes</b> depends on the reactive power control strategy of the PV inverters...|$|R

Voltage {{control is}} an {{essential}} part of the electricity transmission and distribution network system for maintaining voltage within statutory limits at the substation bus and at the consumer's point of supply. The most popular voltage control method on the transmission and distribution network system uses the on-load tap changer (OLTC) transformer. This study proposes the use of Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) systems on the on-load tap changers when two or more mismatched transformers are connected in parallel in order to control the voltage supply to local customers. The actual voltage recordings and on-load <b>tap</b> <b>change</b> operations for each of the paralleled transformers have been analyzed and modelled on MATLAB/Simulink in order to develop an improved control algorithm using Fuzzy Logic Control.

40|$|On-Load Tap Changers (OLTCs) are {{increasingly}} being considered to control the voltage in Low-Voltage (LV) distribution grids. Today, most OLTC control strategies are based on secondary transformer measurements, while a Field Measurement Based (FMB) control could increase the quality further. In this paper, field measurements, performed by a Distribution System Operator (DSO), are used to simulate the voltage quality improvement derived from implementing an OLTC with FMB control. Unfortunately, FMB control results in an unacceptable number of <b>tap</b> <b>changes,</b> so, {{in order to improve}} FMB control, two strategies {{to reduce the number of}} <b>tap</b> <b>changes</b> are presented. Next, an OLTC selection procedure is clarified. Both the voltage range of the OLTC and the tap position occurrence show that several OLTCs are not suited to increase the voltage quality. A voltage quality analysis shows that a well-selected OLTC with FMB control result in a significant increase in voltage quality, which allows more Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to be connected in the existing LV distribution grid...|$|R
40|$|Demand side {{management}} (DSM) {{is a key}} {{concept for}} smart grid. In order to achieve DSM, network stress information needs to be provided to the users, which normally requires two-way communication between users and an upper level control centre. Implementing such communication in large scale power networks will be both costly and introduces problems with security and privacy of data. On-load tap changes (OLTC) are used to adjust the voltage at the users’ side in response to network conditions. By detecting tap changes, {{an indication of the}} level of network stress can be provided to users without communicating with a control centre, which provides an economical and efficient measure for network stress. This paper presents a <b>tap</b> <b>change</b> detection algorithm based on Hilbert-transform phase-locked loops, Q-R decomposition windowed recursive least square algorithm and a hypothesis test, which can distinguish tap changes made by an OLTC transformer from the fluctuation in voltage caused by changes in loads.

30|$|The {{substantial}} resistive {{value of}} distribution lines forces the transformers {{to make their}} contribution in voltage regulation. At primary substations, on-load tap-changer (OLTC) transformer maneuvers the voltage downstream according to the sensor and relay commands. Unfortunately, the reverse current flow restricts its reliability. New generations of electronic switches in conjunction with vacuum chamber solutions [18], are under research with the premise of significant enhancement of consumer’s voltage profile. Reducing the voltage bandwidth at the distribution transformer, would allow higher PV penetration level with the risk of reaching under voltages in the feeders connected to the transformer. Furthermore, this action would increase the <b>tap</b> <b>change</b> operation frequency and hence, drive some customers to experience power supply difficulties. As a consequence, a second voltage control strategy is necessary.|$|E

At its core, the design employs a low-voltage high-current switch-mode amplifier to divert current {{out of the}} mechanical contacts and {{into a pair of}} anti-parallel thyristors. Commutation between transformer taps may then be performed by the thyristors. The amplifier and thyristors are placed outside the normal load current path and only conduct during a <b>tap</b> <b>change,</b> producing efficiency savings and improving robustness when compared to previous hybrid OLTC implementations. An amplifier control loop that autonomously produces zero-current conditions at switch opening and zero-voltage conditions at switch closure is demonstrated Experimental results investigating the wear characteristics of contacts operated under the new hybrid diverter are presented, along with comparison results from a passive-type switching scheme.

40|$|As the {{capacity}} of wind power installed in a radial distribution system (DS) increases, there is a concern that it may introduce more frequent <b>tap</b> <b>change</b> operations in substation transformers.

A case study shows that the changes on the FTC in DSs connected to relatively strong external grid is negligible up to significant level of penetration. But in DSs connected to a relatively weak external grid, a significant increase in the FTC has been observed as wind power penetration increases. Hence a further investigation is carried out to limit the FTC by using reactive power from local wind turbines. The results have shown that the methodology is very effective...|$|E

30|$|The {{increasing}} penetration {{level of}} photovoltaic (PV) power generation in low voltage (LV) networks results in voltage rise issues, {{particularly at the}} end of the feeders. In order to mitigate this problem, several strategies, such as grid reinforcement, transformer <b>tap</b> <b>change,</b> demand-side management, active power curtailment, and reactive power optimization methods, show their contribution to voltage support, yet still limited. This paper proposes a coordinated volt-var control architecture between the LV distribution transformer and solar inverters to optimize the PV power penetration level in a representative LV network in Bornholm Island using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The approach is to increase the reactive power contribution of the inverters closest to the transformer during overvoltage conditions. Two standard reactive power control concepts, cosφ(P) and Q(U), are simulated and compared in terms of network power losses and voltage level along the feeder. As a practical implementation, a reconfigurable hardware is used for developing a testing platform based on real-time measurements to regulate the reactive power level. The proposed testing platform has been developed within PVNET.dk project, which targets to study the approaches for large PV power integration into the network, without the need of reinforcement.|$|E

A direct method is proposed to estimate CVR factors using only data measured {{at the moment of}} the transformer <b>tap</b> <b>change.</b> The mean absolute deviation (MAD) direct method is proposed to consider direct methods and load variations. The proposed methods do not necessitate intentional tap changes for testing purposes. Instead, the voltage and load changes that occur when the tap changes, for voltage regulation purposes, are measured and utilized in the CVR factor calculation. The proposed methods were tested using data obtained from the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) system, and the results revealed that CVR factors for both active power and reactive power could be estimated using data measured in power distribution systems. Results of the CVR factor estimation for the active power revealed that the highest CVR factors occurred in winter, during which a large quantity of heating loads exist. In addition, the estimated CVR factors for the reactive power were higher than the estimated CVR factors for the active power because reactive power is more sensitive to voltage changes...|$|E

40|$|The on-load {{tap changer}} (OLTC) is used for voltage {{regulation}} on distribution networks. The traditional OLTC is a mechanical system limited {{by the number of}} tap changes it can perform before requiring maintenance and by the speed at which it can perform successive tap changes. An experimental validation of a new primary side hybrid diverter design for a 2 MVA 11 kV distribution transformer that addresses both longevity and speed limitations of the traditional OLTC is presented. An experimental apparatus is discussed that is used to simulate the inter-tap voltage and load currents appropriate for the target transformer, allowing long-term, continuous and low-cost testing of candidate diverter designs. The wear experienced by identical sets of contacts operating under the new `active' diverter is compared to that under a `passive' diverter scheme. The contact damage caused by the heavy arcing in a traditional OLTC diverter is also shown. The proposed diverter design effectively eliminates arcing and produces extremely high contact lifetimes in excess of 107 operations, compared to the passive scheme which may be expected to provide around 105 operations with contacts of a similar size.

Voltage magnitudes along the feeders shown in Fig.  11 can compare results of applying different reactive power control curves with/without OLTC voltage control with a representative loading case (Load 4), at diverse PV penetration levels for the most significant hour of the profile (1 – 2 pm). Load 4 profile is considered to be the most suitable for sharing the same measurement time (summer) with the PV production. The tap changer voltage boundary, based on a weighted average network value, is set at ± 5 % of the reference value (1 pu). The grayish area symbolizes the bus voltage above 1.05 pu which may lead to a <b>tap</b> <b>change</b> in the transformer if the average exceeds this boundary. Despite that all inverters under cosφ(P) configuration contribute equally to the grid voltage support, the overvoltage limit is reached around 60 % of solar integration (green line). However, with coordination with OLTC, the voltage level drops about 0.03 pu within the limits. On the contrary, when Q(U) method is activated, bus voltages remain closer to the reference throughout the line length, especially with large PV power distributed.|$|E
