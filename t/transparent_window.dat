25|$|Each {{denomination}} {{contains the}} EURion constellation {{on both the}} obverse and reverse to deter counterfeiting by reproduction using imaging software and photocopiers, the second Canadian banknote series to include it after the Canadian Journey Series. On the obverse, the pattern occurs flanking the <b>transparent</b> <b>window,</b> with denominations having the same pattern {{on the right and}} different patterns on the left. On the reverse, it occurs in the lower strip containing the banknote's serial number.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Bank Negara {{issued a}} new RM10 note with {{additional}} security features including the holographic strip previously only {{seen on the}} RM50 and RM100 notes. A new RM5 polymer banknote with a distinctive <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> was also issued. Both new banknotes are almost identical to their original third series designs. At one time, Bank Negara announced its intention to eventually phase out all paper notes {{and replace them with}} polymer notes.|$|E
25|$|The Australian ten dollar {{banknote}} {{was issued}} when the currency was {{changed from the}} Australian pound to the Australian dollar on 17 February 1966; it replaced the £5 note which had similar blue colouration. There have been four different issues of this denomination, a paper banknote, a commemorative hipolymer note to celebrate the bicentennial of Australian settlement (the first polymer banknote of its kind), the 1993-2017 polymer note, and from September 2017 a polymer note featuring a <b>transparent</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{technique}} {{is limited to}} imaging 1 to 2mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering {{is too small to}} be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and images can be obtained ‘non-contact’ or through a <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> or membrane. It is also {{important to note that the}} laser output from the instruments is low – eye-safe near-infra-red light is used – and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{melting point}} {{apparatus}} {{for the analysis}} of crystalline solids consists of an oil bath with a <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> (most basic design: a Thiele tube) and a simple magnifier. The several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the oil bath. The oil bath is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the magnifier (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed. In large/small devices, the sample is placed in a heating block, and optical detection is automated.|$|E
25|$|These are {{the first}} Canadian notes {{produced}} on polymer. In place of a watermark are two visual features: a translucent maple leaf and a <b>transparent</b> <b>window.</b> The leaf includes a security feature that, when viewed close to the eye with a single-point light source behind, produces a circular image displaying the note's denomination. The window is fringed by maple leaves; at its top is a smaller version of the portrait, and at its bottom a light-refracting metallic likeness of an architectural feature from the parliament buildings. The portraits on the face are more centred on the note. The backs of the notes introduce new cultural and thematic imagery, but the literary quotation is not continued. The polymer notes continue the tactile feature, from the Canadian Journey series.|$|E
50|$|Adults are yellow with a {{prominent}} brown triangle on each forewing costa, {{a pair of}} black spots near each hindwing tornus, and a number of <b>transparent</b> <b>windows.</b> The wings have an iridescent sheen.|$|R
50|$|The moth {{is about}} 20 mm. Adults are black with <b>transparent</b> <b>windows</b> {{in the wings}} and a black and yellow banded abdomen. The hindwings are {{only about half the}} span of the forewings.|$|R
50|$|APLI can be {{coupled to}} an {{existing}} atmospheric pressure (AP) ion source with APLI. In principle only the ionizing laser light {{has to be}} coupled into the existing ion source trough UV <b>transparent</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
25|$|The PREP is a {{mechanism}} to make public {{the results of the}} election. As soon as the polls closed and the votes were tallied in each polling place, a copy of the acta de escrutinio (the official tallies from the polling place) was sealed in a special envelope with a <b>transparent</b> <b>window.</b> It was then sent to a Center for Information Collation and Transmission (Centro de Acopio y Transmisión de Datos or CEDAT) that was located in the corresponding electoral district. There, the information was captured and transmitted to the central offices of the IFE for public dissemination. The information was then backed up and made public on the IFE website and a number of mirrors. The PREP is not an estimate or a statistical exercise, but rather the full unofficial returns from each polling place, as they were computed at the polls {{on the day of the}} election. They are not official returns, since the tallies must be certified by the District's Electoral Council before they become official. The PREP would continue to collate data until all polling places reported or until the early morning hours of Monday July 3. If the tally sheets contained certain inconsistencies (e.g., blank entries rather than zeros, illegible totals, etc.), then they were reported separately, under the heading of Irregular, as per prior agreement between the parties, and were not added to the totals as they were received. Where possible, their results were added when the final report was made on Monday morning.|$|E
2500|$|The reverse {{features}} the passenger train Canadian {{passing through the}} Canadian Rockies, symbolising the country's monumental feat of building a pan-Canadian railway. The depiction of the train {{is based on a}} photograph commissioned by the Bank of Canada taken at Jasper National Park in Alberta. The banknote designers retained the locomotive identifier 6403 in the design. The depiction of the Canadian Rockies is a composite rendering based on photographs of several notable peaks and ridges: reading from the left are the shoulder of Lectern Peak and Aquila Mountain; Redan, Esplanade and Gargoyle mountains in the centre, and Mount Zengel, part of the Victoria Cross Range, in the right. On announcing the design in 2013, the Bank of Canada had originally said the image included Mount Edith Cavell and Marmot Mountain are {{to the left of the}} <b>transparent</b> <b>window,</b> Esplanade Mountain is to the right of the <b>transparent</b> <b>window,</b> and Palisade Mountain and Pyramid Mountain of the Victoria Cross Ranges. However, a query led the Bank to issue a correction in July 2014. [...] A simplified adaptation of a map of the Via Rail network of passenger trains provided by Natural Resources Canada is visible between the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> and the image of the train.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinctive}} lure of Thaumatichthys {{is achieved}} by an [...] "upside-down" [...] orientation of the illicium (the [...] "fishing rod"): its base {{is embedded in the}} skin fold connecting the anterior ends of the premaxillaries, and the short illicium projects down and back so that the esca at the tip hangs down from the roof of the mouth. The escal bulb terminates in a pair of forked tendrils and bears varying numbers of lateral lobes and a single curved denticle. The size of the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> in the bulb can be adjusted to change the amount of light emanating from the lure.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 30 mm. The wings are black {{with a number}} of <b>transparent</b> <b>windows.</b> There are transverse black and yellow bands on the body, the thorax is black and the head is yellow.|$|R
50|$|Since many {{operations}} require transparency (for example spatial anti-aliasing, {{especially during}} font rasterization, and transparency effects in window managers, such as <b>transparent</b> <b>windows</b> or menus), this limitation caused problems, and Xrender was implemented to address it.|$|R
50|$|Blind spots exist where areas {{behind the}} sail are {{obscured}} from {{the view of}} a helmsman on a sailboat or windsurfer. This is especially true when they are heeled over; consequently, <b>transparent</b> <b>windows</b> are sometimes sewn into the sails.|$|R
2500|$|By late 2011, the $100 {{banknote}} {{had been}} counterfeited, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested four individuals of a counterfeiting operation in Richmond, British Columbia and seized counterfeit bills {{with a face}} value of [...] of partially completed $100 banknotes. In May 2013, counterfeit $100 banknotes were found in circulation in New Westminster {{and other parts of}} the Lower Mainland in British Columbia. They were described by New Westminster police sergeant Diana McDaniel as [...] "very well done", but they were missing three security features in the reproduction—a line of printed numerals in the <b>transparent</b> <b>window,</b> the flag atop the East Block in the lower metallic foil, and the raised ink. About 175 copies of the banknotes were found in circulation.|$|E
60|$|When Scrooge awoke {{it was so}} dark, that, {{looking out}} of bed, he could {{scarcely}} distinguish the <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} to fabricate ultrathin (down to 20 nm) uniform electron <b>transparent</b> <b>windows</b> at dedicated locations in a SiN membrane for in situ transmission electron microscopy experiments. An electron-beam (e-beam) resist is spray-coated on the backside of the membrane in a KOH- etched cavity in silicon which is patterned using through-membrane electron-beam lithography. This is a controlled way to make <b>transparent</b> <b>windows</b> in membranes, whilst the topside of the membrane remains undamaged and retains its flatness. Our approach was optimized for MEMS-based heating chips but {{can be applied to}} any chip design. We show two different applications of this technique for (1) fabrication of a nanogap electrode by means of electromigration in thin free-standing metal films and (2) making low-noise graphene nanopore devices...|$|R
2500|$|The release {{focused on}} updates to Coherence, with support for Exposé, <b>window</b> shadows, <b>transparent</b> <b>windows,</b> {{and the ability}} to overlap several Windows and Mac windows. Further, Parallels' Image Tool was updated to allow [...] one to change their virtual hard disk format between plain and expanding.|$|R
50|$|Graphic overlay {{nameplates}} {{are constructed}} from hard-coated polycarbonate, hard-coated polyester or UV resistant polyester. Graphic overlay nameplates differ from generic nameplates {{in that they}} feature <b>transparent</b> <b>windows,</b> selective texturing, embossing, abrasion protection and chemical resistance. A graphic overlay is usually over some sort of LEDs, windows, switch, or control panel.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{transparent}} {{windows in}} the note. The <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> on the centre right side (when looking at the obverse) is oval-shaped and contains the denomination of the currency (5, 10, 20, etc.) embossed in the transparent section. The <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> on the left hand side is {{in the shape of}} a curved fern leaf.|$|E

5000|$|The eight smaller toys had a {{spring-loaded}} [...] "instant transformation" [...] feature {{like the}} smallest toys {{of the first}} Beast Wars line also had. These toys were designed to have <b>transparent</b> <b>windows</b> and [...] "light pipe" [...] eyes, but those parts were cast in opaque plastic, much like the first year Beast Wars toys, probably to lower production costs.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 60 mm. Adults are dark brown, with white edges to {{the wings and}} white bars across the wings and abdomen. The ends of the white bar show as <b>transparent</b> <b>windows</b> on the wings. In resting position, these bars are aligned on each side to form a single stripe. The underside has tufts of bright red hair.|$|R

50|$|Comparing to the {{previous}} version, the 2009 version of the card, which was introduced on 24 August 2009, contains the same information as {{the previous}} version. The design, however, was significantly changed with a white background colour, a <b>transparent</b> <b>window</b> {{on the right side}} of the card, a second ghost image located in the <b>transparent</b> <b>window,</b> and the replacement of optical stripe with a 2-D barcode.|$|E
25|$|A {{new series}} of notes was {{introduced}} in 1992. The obverse of each note featured a notable New Zealander, while the reverse featured a native New Zealand bird and New Zealand scenery. In 1999, polymer notes replaced the paper notes. The designs remained much the same, but were changed slightly to accommodate new security features, with the most obvious changes being the two <b>transparent</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Mac OS X applications, heads-up {{displays}} (or HUDs) {{usually take}} the form of miniature, darkly-colored, <b>transparent</b> <b>windows</b> which are revealed outside the window of the currently-running application. Their purposes vary, from simply displaying information concerning a currently-running task, to displaying the tools for carrying out the task. HUDs often overlap with palettes, a similarly-functioning GUI element that usually fits the general interface of the main parent application (see Dashboard).|$|R
40|$|Abstract − The {{main problem}} in {{operation}} of industrial turbidimeters is buildup of parasitic deposits on <b>transparent</b> <b>windows</b> of light sources and photodetectors. Two {{different ways of}} solving the problem of noise-immune measurements of turbidity are discussed. The first way consists in realization of so called turbidimeters with variable gauge length. Another way lays {{in the field of}} use of photosensor arrays and image processing. In both cases presence of an automatic cleaning system is necessary...|$|R
