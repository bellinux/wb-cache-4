5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fall</b> {{line is the}} geomorphologic {{break between}} the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It {{is at this point}} that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because of the need for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> line. In Georgia, <b>the</b> <b>Fall</b> Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E
