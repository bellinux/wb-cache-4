5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane has noted that there are three views. The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of {{drug use}} and {{whether it should be}} legalised or decriminalised, {{provided}} on prescription to registered addicts, or penalised more harshly. High numbers (95% according to the Home Office) of street prostitutes in the United Kingdom have a history of substance abuse, and prostitution is one means of funding addiction, known to have been used by all five of the victims.|$|E
5|$|This cut-marked human bone {{assemblage}} {{represented the}} largest yet identified from within a Neolithic long barrow in southern Britain, although similar evidence for dismemberment {{has been found}} from other Neolithic British sites, such as West Trump, Eyford, Aldestrop, and Haddenham. There are two possibilities for how this material developed. The first is that {{the bodies of the}} dead were excarnated or exposed to the elements, followed by a secondary burial within the tomb. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they were placed in the tomb, where the flesh decomposed, before the bodies were then rearranged within the tomb itself. These practices may have been accompanied by other ritualistic or ceremonial practices, direct evidence for which does not survive.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{regulation}} <b>was</b> unacceptable even it {{were effective}} {{in terms of}} administration and health because it violated human liberty.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese Calculus of Deterrence: India and Indochina {{compared}} two {{situations in}} which China's decision-makers moved to deter foreign powers.

25|$|Einstein's {{explanation}} {{arises from}} two postulates: The first <b>is</b> Galileo's idea <b>that</b> the physical laws {{are the same}} for all observers that move with constant velocity relative to each other. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> speed of light is the same for every observer.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{references to}} Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources. There {{have been few}} attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre-Galfridian tradition as a whole, {{rather than in a}} single text or text/story-type. A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material. The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster-hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats. Some of these are human threats, such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum, but the majority are supernatural, including giant cat-monsters, destructive divine boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and witches. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pre-Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore (particularly topographic or onomastic folklore) and localised magical wonder-tales, the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape. The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn. On the one hand, he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners. On the other, his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods, and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{theories}} about the process that led Takenaga's unit to the decision to surrender. The first {{is that all of}} the members of the unit were involved in the decision, and <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> only the officers were involved.|$|E
25|$|Debate {{around the}} best method of tick removal is based around two main concerns. The first is that the method of removal could cause further {{injection}} of noxious substances (allergens, paralysing toxins and infectious micro-organisms). <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the method may leave the 'head' (really just the tick's mouthparts) embedded in the skin.|$|E
50|$|Current {{rules for}} model boats at Spreckels Lake.The Recreation and Parks Department added two new rules in May, 2015. The first change <b>was</b> <b>that</b> ALL boats <b>were</b> now {{required}} {{to observe the}} 15 MPH speed limit. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> model aviation <b>was</b> now prohibited at the lake.|$|R
2500|$|... 1900: David Hilbert poses his [...] "23 questions" [...] (now {{known as}} Hilbert's problems) at <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. [...] "Of these, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of proving <b>the</b> {{consistency}} of the 'Peano axioms' on which, as he had shown, the rigour of mathematics depended".

2500|$|During pre-trial formalities in September, Ingabire's defence lodged two motions. The {{first was}} against the {{territorial}} jurisdiction of the High Court for acts allegedly committed while Ingabire was resident in <b>the</b> Netherlands. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Ingabire's prosecution under the 2008 [...] "genocide ideology" [...] law amounted to retrospective application as all evidence provided dated from before 2007.|$|R
25|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{concerning the}} origin of the Ertebølle population are therefore possible and have been proposed. One is that in the remains we are seeing an intermediate phase {{in the evolution of the}} Nordics. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Ertebølle population were an admixture of agrarian southerners with indigenous Cro-magnons over a permeable border. Both views are supported by the evidence.|$|E
25|$|To the east, {{the city}} is bordered by a low {{escarpment}} called the Darling Scarp. Perth is on generally flat, rolling land– {{largely due to the}} high amount of sandy soils and deep bedrock. The Perth metropolitan area has two major river systems: the first is made up of the Swan and Canning Rivers; <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of the Serpentine and Murray Rivers, which discharge into the Peel Inlet at Mandurah.|$|E
25|$|Two {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward regarding the origin of Burlington's name. The first {{is that it was}} named after Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, and <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the name honors the politically prominent and wealthy Burling family of New York. While no Burling family members are listed as grantees of the town, the family held large tracts of land in nearby towns, some of which were granted on the same day as Burlington.|$|E

5|$|When Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814, {{he learned}} of several {{traditional}} tales relating to the area and the clan. He <b>was</b> told <b>that</b> the Fairy Flag had three magical properties. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it multiplied {{the number of men}} upon a battlefield. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> when it <b>was</b> spread upon a nuptial bed, it ensured fertility. The third <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it brought herring into the loch.|$|R
25|$|Neural network {{research}} stagnated after {{machine learning}} research by Minsky and Papert (1969), who discovered two key {{issues with the}} computational machines that processed neural networks. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> basic perceptrons <b>were</b> incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> computers didn't have enough processing power to effectively handle the work required by large neural networks. Neural network research slowed until computers achieved far greater processing power.|$|R
25|$|Although it {{is common}} to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his {{principle}} can be expressed in three simple statements. The first is that male reproductive success increases with the number of mates they attempt to copulate with, while female reproductive success does not. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> male reproductive success will show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.|$|E
25|$|The focus spread {{is related}} to the depth of focus. Ray (2000, 56) gives two {{definitions}} of the latter. The first is the tolerance of the position of the image plane for which an object remains acceptably sharp; <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the limits of depth of focus are the image-side conjugates of the near and far limits of DOF. With the first definition, focus spread and depth of focus are usually close in value though conceptually different. With the second definition, focus spread and depth of focus are the same.|$|E
25|$|Two time-honoured {{constitutional}} principles were {{in conflict}} during the crisis. The {{first is that}} a ministry drawn from {{the majority of the}} lower house may continue to govern until it has lost the confidence of the House. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a ministry may not continue to govern once supply has been exhausted. The potential of conflict has been resolved in the United Kingdom, where the House of Lords no longer has the power to block money bills. To date it has not been resolved in Australia. The crisis of 1975 may be repeated in the future, though it is unlikely.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|R

25|$|The {{cause is}} unknown, but {{is thought to}} result from {{abnormalities}} of the veins inside the testicles, leading to a backup of blood that cannot flow, which in turn causes swelling. There are three main theories as to the anatomical cause; the first {{has to do with}} the geometry of the veins, wherein the vein on the left side connects to the larger outflowing vein at a right angle, which tends to fail; <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> valves that are supposed to prevent backflow fail (venous insufficiency); the third is that pressure in upstream arteries creates a “nutcracker” syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The first {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} chacmool is an offering table (or tlamanalco) to receive gifts such as pulque, tamales, tortillas, tobacco, turkeys, feathers and incense. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the chacmool was a cuauhxicalli to receive blood and human hearts; this use is particularly relevant to the Aztecs, who used a cuauhxicalli bowl {{in place of the}} usual disc-altar. These bowls may have accepted these blood offerings directly or may have been holders for portable cuauhxicalli bowls that were placed within them. A chacmool from Tlaxcala has a bloodied heart sculpted on the underside, supporting this interpretation.|$|E
25|$|The blade {{geometry}} {{was highly}} {{variable in the}} tests, so {{it is likely that}} the negative dependence of the dimensionless force on Reynolds number is the major factor. This whistle has two features that separate it from the other whistles described here. The first is that there are a multiplicity of these dipole sources arrayed around the periphery, that most likely are radiating at the same frequency, but incoherently. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> blade motion creates a steady, but rotating, pressure field at each blade. The rotating steady force creates a rotating dipole field which has an influence in the geometric near field. The feedback is Class I (hydrodynamic) and there is no indication that stages other than Stage 1 occur.|$|E

25|$|S.O.Y. Keita and A.J. Boyce, {{authors of}} Variation in Porotic Hyperostosis in the Royal Cemetery Complex at Abydos, Upper Egypt: A Social Interpretation, {{examined}} forty-four skulls from the funerary complex of King Djer {{and discovered that}} those buried outside the tomb enjoyed better health {{than those in the}} actual tomb. This can be interpreted in two ways. First, those buried outside the tomb were believed to have enjoyed better health because they were wealthier, and consequently, had better nutritional standards. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> those buried inside the royal tomb could afford {{to take care of their}} illness-ridden children. Whichever explanation is correct, there is such a statistically significant difference that these two groups most likely did not share the same social status.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} {{on whether}} an uprising is an insurgency or a belligerency {{has not been}} as clearly codified as many other areas covered by the internationally accepted laws of war for two reasons. The first is that international law traditionally does not encroach on matters that are solely the internal affairs of a sovereign state, but recent developments such as the responsibility to protect, are starting to undermine the traditional approach. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> at the Hague Conference of 1899, there was disagreement between the Great Powers who considered francs-tireurs to be unlawful combatants subject to execution on capture, and smaller states, which maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants. The dispute resulted in a compromise wording being included in the Hague Conventions known as the Martens Clause from the diplomat who drafted the clause.|$|E
25|$|Assuming that {{a problem}} exists, many have offered {{suggestions}} for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those suggestions are along three lines. The first is that the military must {{reach out to the}} civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military to find ways to talk to civilians, not the other way around. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> civilians must articulate a clear vision of what they expect in terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{promising}} {{first year}} sales, two factors worked against the Marquette. The first involved Oldsmobile, which lost sales to Marquette; <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Buick executives {{did not feel}} <b>that</b> enough Marquettes <b>were</b> sold to warrant the extra burden {{on the bottom line}} given the state of the economy. Buick gave no advance warning of the termination of the Marquette; just four months before the shutdown, 4,000 Marquette signs were shipped to dealers in the hope of better days ahead.|$|R

5|$|Vienne and Perez held several {{meetings}} on the track, one {{including the first}} appearance in France by the American sprinter Major Taylor, and then looked for further ideas. In February 1896 they hit {{on the idea of}} holding a race from Paris to their track. This presented two problems.
