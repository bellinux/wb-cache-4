5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> Palace Hotel was {{designed}} by F.J.Wills and constructed in 1925–30. The entrance was rebuilt in 1968, with the original being moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum. <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> underwent extensive redevelopment in the mid-20th century. The length of road from St Mary's eastwards up to St Clement's was widened in 1900, subsuming the former Holywell Street which forked from <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> and ran parallel with it to the north, leaving the two churches of St Mary Le Strand and St.Clement Danes as islands in {{the centre of the}} road. Gaiety Theatre was demolished, to be replaced by Citibank House, while Villiers House and New South Wales House were both built in 1957–59. New South Wales House was subsequently demolished in 1996 and replaced by an office block. In 1998, a statue of Oscar Wilde was built at the junction of Adelaide Street and Duncannon Street, adjoining the western end of <b>the</b> <b>Strand.</b>|$|E

5|$|The road's {{name comes}} from the Old English strond, meaning {{the edge of a}} river, as it {{historically}} ran alongside the north bank of the River Thames. The street was popular with the British upper classes between the 12th and 17th centuries, with many historically important mansions being built between <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> and the river. These included Essex House, Arundel House, Somerset House, Savoy Palace, Durham House and Cecil House. The aristocracy moved to the West End over the 17th century, following which <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> became well known for coffee shops, restaurants and taverns. The street was a centre point for theatre and music hall during the 19th century, and several venues remain on <b>the</b> <b>Strand.</b> At the east end of the street are two historic churches: St Mary le Strand and St Clement Danes.|$|E

5000|$|Circular {{molecules}} of DNA, such as plasmids and typical mitochondrial genomes, consist of two strands of DNA called <b>the</b> heavy <b>strand</b> (or H-strand) and <b>the</b> light <b>strand</b> (or L-strand). <b>The</b> two <b>strands</b> have different masses due to different proportions of heavier nucleotides. While {{this difference is}} not known to have any functional significance, {{it can be used}} in the laboratory to segregate <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> of denatured DNA, and hence to analyze <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> separately.|$|R
50|$|In DNA, the 5' carbon {{is located}} at the top of <b>the</b> leading <b>strand,</b> and <b>the</b> 3' carbon {{is located at}} the lower section of <b>the</b> lagging <b>strand.</b> <b>The</b> nucleic acid {{sequences}} are complementary and parallel, but they go in opposite directions, hence the antiparallel designation. The antiparallel structure of DNA is important in DNA replication because it replicates <b>the</b> leading <b>strand</b> one way and <b>the</b> lagging <b>strand</b> <b>the</b> other way. During DNA replication <b>the</b> leading <b>strand</b> is replicated continuously whereas <b>the</b> lagging <b>strand</b> is replicated in segments known as Okazaki fragments.|$|R

5|$|The west part of <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> was in {{the parish}} of St Martin in the Fields and in the east it {{extended}} into the parishes of St Clement Danes and St Mary le Strand. Most of its length {{was in the}} Liberty of Westminster, although part of the eastern section in St Clement Danes was in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex. <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> was the northern boundary of the precinct of the Savoy, which was approximately where the approach to Waterloo Bridge is now. All of these parishes and places became part of <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> District in 1855, except St Martin in the Fields which was governed separately. <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> District Board of Works was based at No. 22, Tavistock Street.

40|$|A {{fragment}} of the rpoB gene, including the region {{shown to be}} involved in rifampicin resistance, was amplified from 15 rifampicin-resistant and 6 rifampicin- sensitive clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One of the primers, employed in PCR, was biotinylated. <b>The</b> biotinylated <b>strand</b> of <b>the</b> PCR product was separated from <b>the</b> unbiotinylated <b>strand</b> using streptavidin magnetic beads. Both <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> were subjected to single strand conformation polymorphism in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA bands were silver stained to study their migration pattern. A shift in the migration of either of <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> of <b>the</b> test strain compared to <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> from a control rifampicin-sensitive strain was considered as indicative of resistance. This strategy was found to ease the visualization of shift in the migration of <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> in 17 of 21 samples and thereby detection of mutations...|$|R

The philatelist Stanley Gibbons opened a shop at No.435 in 1891. It moved to No.391 in 1893, and is now currently based at No.399.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, <b>The</b> <b>Strand</b> {{became a}} newly fashionable address and many avant-garde writers and thinkers {{gathered}} here, among them Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens, John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson and the scientist Thomas Henry Huxley. No.142 {{was the home}} of radical publisher and physician John Chapman, who published contemporary authors from this house during the 1850s and edited the journal Westminster Review from 1851. George Eliot lived at No.142 between 1851 and 1855. Virginia Woolf regularly travelled along <b>the</b> <b>Strand,</b> and a King's College building named after her is in nearby Kingsway.|$|E
5|$|Other {{significant}} palaces along <b>the</b> <b>Strand</b> include Worcester House, {{formerly the}} Inn, or residence, of the Bishop of Carlisle, Salisbury House, used for royal lodgings in the 15th and 16th centuries, Hungerford House, which was demolished and replaced, in turn, by Hungerford Market and Charing Cross station and Northumberland House, a large Jacobean mansion, the historic London {{residence of the}} Dukes of Northumberland; built in 1605 and demolished in 1874. Northumberland Avenue now occupies the site. The official residence of the Secretary of State, next door at No.1 <b>the</b> <b>Strand,</b> became the first numbered address in London.|$|E

25|$|The {{first is}} {{the best known of}} these {{mechanisms}} and is used by the cellular organisms. In this mechanism, once <b>the</b> two <b>strands</b> are separated, primase adds RNA primers to <b>the</b> template <b>strands.</b> <b>The</b> leading <b>strand</b> receives one RNA primer while <b>the</b> lagging <b>strand</b> receives several. <b>The</b> leading <b>strand</b> is continuously extended from the primer by a DNA polymerase with high processivity, while <b>the</b> lagging <b>strand</b> is extended discontinuously from each primer forming Okazaki fragments. RNase removes the primer RNA fragments, and a low processivity DNA polymerase distinct from the replicative polymerase enters to fill the gaps. When this is complete, a single nick on <b>the</b> leading <b>strand</b> and several nicks on <b>the</b> lagging <b>strand</b> can be found. Ligase works to fill these nicks in, thus completing the newly replicated DNA molecule.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device {{for the production}} of flexible electrical stranded wires cut to length and prefabricated for assembly, whereby <b>the</b> <b>stranded</b> wires are wrapped by a common insulation sheath. <b>The</b> <b>stranded</b> wires are stripped at <b>the</b> <b>stranded</b> wire end by a stripping unit, twisted and then welded rigidly together by an ultrasound welding unit. The ultrasound welding unit and the stripping unit are combined in one unit. The stripping unit is assigned a sensor and the entire device is coordinated by an electric control. Welding of <b>the</b> <b>stranded</b> wire end is performed without the supply of additional materials such as solder and without the use of separately produced parts such as wire end sleeves or other terminal parts...|$|R
50|$|At high frequencies, current travels {{near the}} surface of the wire because of the skin effect, {{resulting}} in increased power loss in <b>the</b> wire. <b>Stranded</b> wire might seem to reduce this effect, since the total surface area of <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> is greater than the surface area of the equivalent solid wire, but ordinary stranded wire does not reduce the skin effect because all <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> are short-circuited together and behave as a single conductor. A stranded wire will have higher resistance than a solid wire of the same diameter because the cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>stranded</b> wire is not all copper; there are unavoidable gaps between <b>the</b> <b>strands</b> (this is <b>the</b> circle packing problem for circles within a circle). A <b>stranded</b> wire with <b>the</b> same cross-section of conductor as a solid wire is said to have the same equivalent gauge and is always a larger diameter.|$|R
