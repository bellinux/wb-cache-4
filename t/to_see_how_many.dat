The best performance is still two strokes (Christian Ude, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013; Dieter Reiter, 2015, 2016, 2017), {{and there was also}} 19 strokes required (Thomas Wimmer, 1950).|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} {{that had been}} {{occurring}} during this time was {{the adoption of the}} pitch count. Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in baseball's history. Now pitching coaches watched <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 100 to 125, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms. Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as closers.|$|E
25|$|Roberts and Davies held an {{unofficial}} contest <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> references to Christie's works could be inserted. Titles that were noted were: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd; Why Didn't They Ask Evans; The Body in the Library; The Secret Adversary; N or M?; Nemesis; Cat Among the Pigeons; Dead Man's Folly; They Do It With Mirrors; Appointment with Death; Cards on the Table; Sparkling Cyanide; Endless Night; Crooked House; Death in the Clouds; The Moving Finger; Taken at the Flood; Death Comes as the End; Murder on the Orient Express and The Murder at the Vicarage. A deleted scene referred to The Man in the Brown Suit, {{referring to the}} Doctor's clothing. The narrative itself parallels several of Christie's novels: the jewel theft storyline parallels The Secret of Chimneys; Miss Chandrakala's death was influenced by And Then There Were None; and the Colonel's revelation {{that he was not}} disabled paralleled a key concept of The Pale Horse. In an email conversation with journalist Benjamin Cook, Davies admitted he had initially added a reference to the original title of And Then There Were None, Ten Little Niggers, but decided it was too risky.|$|E

The Fred role was played by William Frawley, who was actually 22 years her senior. Despite their exceptional chemistry, comedic timing, and musical prowess together onscreen, Vance and Frawley did not get along offscreen. According to some reports, things first went sour when Frawley overheard Vance complaining about his age, stating that he should be playing her father instead of her husband. She used to skim through the script before she memorized her lines <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> scenes she had with [...] "that stubborn-headed little Irishman."

At the Potsdam conference, with the U.S. operating {{under influence of}} the Morgenthau plan, the victorious Allies decided to abolish the German armed forces {{as well as all}} munitions factories and civilian industries that could support them. This included the destruction of all ship and aircraft manufacturing capability. Further, it was decided that civilian industries which might have a military potential, which in the modern era of [...] "total war" [...] included virtually all, were to be severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany's [...] "approved peacetime needs", which were defined to be set on the average European standard. In order to achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> factories Germany required under these minimum level of industry requirements.|$|E
2500|$|A {{popular and}} long-running {{feature of the}} show is [...] "Flash Friday", in which men are {{encouraged}} to drive with their headlights on and women are encouraged to expose their breasts to such vehicles. The feature began as a one-time bit; while on the air, Leykis recalled a radio host he listened to as a child, who asked his listeners in New York apartments to flash their lights on and off and then to look outside <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> neighbors were doing the same, as a way to gauge the audience size (Jean Shepherd). Leykis asked his listeners to do the same with their car headlights, and a few minutes later, jokingly suggested that women flash their breasts. A listener called in to report that he saw a woman flashing fellow drivers, and it became a regular feature of the show. Both women and men commonly call during the Friday broadcast to alert other listeners as to their location, and to recount stories of flashing or being flashed, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|The Rays {{would send}} a fifth player, making it the most they had ever sent to one All-Star Game, which was a record {{that had been set}} the {{previous}} season. Carlos Peña, who had never been to the All-Star Game, was a nominee for the All-Star Final Vote, a process in which fans choose one of five players in each league to take the final roster spots on the All-Star squads. Voting began after the initial All-Star rosters were announced. To help garner votes for Peña, the Rays started the [...] "Vote for 'Los" [...] campaign, having T-shirts made with Peña's face on them which players wore during batting practice. The Rays asked fans to bring their laptop computers to Tropicana Field and vote online during the game, as well as using advertisements, online commercials, fliers, merchandise, and even a video message from comedian Rob Schneider. Despite all efforts, Peña would ultimately finish fourth in the voting. Brandon Inge of the Detroit Tigers received the most votes to get the last remaining spot. Even though he didn't win, Peña said he was flattered and humbled <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> were in support of him to make the All-Star Game. Peña would eventually make the team anyway as a replacement to Dustin Pedroia, who would have been the starting 2nd baseman, as he pulled out due to a [...] "serious family health matter" [...] involving his wife.|$|E
2500|$|Bieber {{endorsed}} Adidas, beside Derrick Rose and Venus Williams, in 2012. He {{became the}} new [...] "face" [...] and [...] "body" [...] of Calvin Klein in early 2015. In 2010, Bieber met Sam and John Shahidi, {{and he helped}} them develop the photo sharing app Shots. Shots was intended as an anti-bullying app, {{in which it was}} not possible to comment on others' pictures or <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> [...] "likes" [...] another had received. Bieber was an investor in Shots. Boxer Floyd Mayweather also invested, and Bieber and Mayweather became friends through their business with Shots. At its peak, Shots had over 10 million users; Twitter tried to buy the app for US$150 million. With users dropping in 2016, Shahidi decided to change focus and rebrand Shots to Shots Studios, a talent agency and production company for online videos. Bieber is also an investor and active business partner in Shots Studios; Shahidi said that [...] "Justin is not just an investor, he's a partner (...) So he's got to be on the same page as Sam and I. He's got to really like the person. He's got to appreciate their art, whether it's comedy or music, and also like them as a person as well". In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington. He has bandwagoned four fragrances as of 2014. He launched his debut fragrance, Someday, in 2011; it grossed more than three million US dollars in sales, at Macy's, in just under three weeks, which industry experts regard as a successful celebrity-led launch. On the heels of that 2011 best-seller, he launched his second fragrance, Girlfriend, in June 2012. His third fragrance, The Key, was launched in July 2013, and his latest fragrance, Justin Bieber Collector's Edition, launched in 2014.|$|E
