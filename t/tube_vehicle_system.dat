40|$|Abstract: Design the {{structure}} of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention and set up the system dynamic model. Based on the Matlab/Simulink, establish the dynamic simulation <b>system</b> of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention for the Chery A 3 car. Using the brake / drive integrated ESP control principle, based on the simulation model, respectively simulate and analyze the ESP control performances of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention on different simulation conditions. The study results indicate that when there is no ESP control or ESP control <b>system</b> failure, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention can simulate the ESP control performances of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> effectively, the ESP control performances of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention have remarkable consistency. The theory of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> for overturning prevention for the ESP control performances test provides a basis for the vehicle stability control performance research. ...|$|R
40|$|Scale and {{complexity}} {{have been the}} topical elements of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> development for years. Whereas traditional systems engineering methods have been {{believed to be the}} solution to vehicle design challenges, recent shifts in the vehicle domain question their adequacy. Specifically, the character of <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems,</b> and their development environment, has shifted away from singular-use independent systems to multipurpose collaborating systems. The characteristics of this change are contained within the themes of scale, diversity, and dynamics. Each of these dimensions is contributing to the “wickedness ” of <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems</b> in understanding, development, deployment, and maintenance. Such complexity and dynamics of interactions, by both users and developers, make <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems</b> exhibit the characteristics of Ultra-Large Scale (ULS) systems. The scale and concerns of <b>vehicle</b> <b>system</b> development challenge traditional approaches, and demand new fundamental research to reason the design, manage the scale, and create the capability for developing future <b>vehicle</b> <b>systems.</b> 1...|$|R
