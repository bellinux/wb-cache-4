40|$|We {{analyzed}} a three-locus {{model of}} genetic hitchhiking with one locus experiencing positive directional selection and two partially linked neutral loci. Following the original hitchhiking approach by Maynard Smith and Haigh, our analysis is purely deterministic. In {{the first half}} of <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> phase after a favored mutation has entered the population, hitchhiking may lead to a strong increase of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two neutral sites if both are < 0. 1 s away from <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> site (where s is the selection coefficient). In the second half of <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> phase, <b>the</b> main effect of hitchhiking is to destroy LD. This occurs very quickly (before the end of <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> phase) when <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> site is between both neutral loci. This pattern cannot be attributed to the well-known variation-reducing effect of hitchhiking but is a consequence of secondary hitchhiking effects on the recombinants created in <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> phase. When <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> site is outside the neutral loci (which are, say, < 0. 1 s apart), however, a fast decay of LD is observed only if <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> site is in the immediate neighborhood of one of the neutral sites (i. e., if the recombination rate r between <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> site and one of the neutral sites satisfies empty...|$|R

30|$|The {{motivation}} selector’s {{responsibility is}} to select a single motivation based on current attributes, internal levels, motivations and beliefs.

Then, it evaluates the urgency of <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> motivation; if <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> motivation {{is in a state}} of urgency – implying that the associated need or needs must be immediately satisfied – the action list is emptied. This essentially cancels all planned actions in favor of <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> motivation’s urgency. Then, the action planner checks if the IVA is already committed to <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> motivation (that is, checks if there already is a complex action sequence in the action list previously generated so as to serve <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> motivation) and, if not, it appends the newly-generated complex action sequence to the action list.
