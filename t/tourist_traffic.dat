5|$|Due to the area's vacationers, many {{of which}} come from New York and Northern New Jersey, Route 37 is {{routinely}} congested with seasonal traffic in the summer, especially on and around the Mathis and Tunney Bridges and at the Garden State Parkway interchange as heavy <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> converges on the shore. Additionally, the road sees congestion due to the area's rapid growth in commercial development.|$|E
5|$|The Port Adelaide line, which {{until that}} time had still used horse trams, began to be {{converted}} to electric operation in 1914 and opened 3 April 1917 A line from Magill to Morialta opened in 1915 for weekend <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> with only a single return service on weekdays. The line ran in the valley of 4th creek, {{a tributary of the}} River Torrens, across farmland and along unmade and ungazetted roads.|$|E
50|$|The Abbeyshrule Aerodrome {{is located}} {{just outside the}} village, {{permitting}} swift business access to Paris Beauvais, while the Royal Canal has been successfully reopened to extensive <b>tourist</b> marine <b>traffic</b> in recent years.|$|R
5000|$|Private car:In the <b>tourist</b> season <b>traffic</b> {{problems}} can be expected on roads to Saint-Tropez, so {{the fastest way to}} travel is by scooter or bike. There is no direct highway to the village. There are three main roads to Saint-Tropez: ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the busy}} <b>tourist</b> season, <b>traffic</b> at the ferry often backs up, even at night, causing {{people to have}} to wait several ferry cycles to get to the other side. This causes {{frustration}} for commuters who use the ferry to get to and from work.|$|R
5|$|The {{illustration}} shows {{a typical}} Bayford/Gulf filling {{station in the}} UK, still associated with a service garage, restaurant and retailing facilities. It is in an isolated location, five miles (8km) south of Wooler in the Cheviot Hills, catering to both local residents and passing <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic.</b> It is not vulnerable to competition from supermarkets and provides something of a local community center.|$|E
5|$|The toll {{collected}} by Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj from the A2 motorway {{in the first}} quarter of 2011 amounted to 27.7 million kuna (3.61 million euros); however, this period does not include the significantly increased <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> during the summer. In 2010, Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj collected 166.9 million kuna (22.4 million euros) from A2 tolls.|$|E
5|$|Variations between AADT {{and average}} summer daily traffic (ASDT) traffic volumes are {{attributed}} {{to the fact that}} the motorway carries substantial <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> to the Adriatic Sea resorts during the summer. On average, the tolled section of the A2 motorway carries 90% more ASDT than AADT. The largest increase, 125%, of the ASDT relative to the AADT is observed on the Đurmanec–Trakošćan section.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built to allow tall ships underneath. This gave the bridge steep {{gradients}} that cause heavy vehicles to slow down, resulting in congestion during rush hour and the summer <b>tourist</b> season: <b>traffic</b> can back up both on the bridge and on the approaches.|$|R
50|$|The South East Northumberland Rail Users Group {{would like}} to see the station re-opened for local and <b>tourist</b> (for Lindisfarne) <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Empire State Building anchors {{an area of}} Midtown which {{features}} other major Manhattan landmarks as well, including Macy's Herald Square, Koreatown, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and the Flower District. Collectively, these sites contribute to a significant volume of commuter and <b>tourist</b> pedestrian <b>traffic</b> traversing the southern portion of Midtown Manhattan.|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of Gyeongju's <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> {{is due to the}} city's promotion of itself as a site for various festivals, conferences, and competitions. Every year since 1962, the Silla cultural festival has been held in October to celebrate and honour the dynasty's history and culture. It {{is one of the major}} festivals of Korea. It features athletic events, folk games, music, dance, literary contests and Buddhist religious ceremonies. Other festivals include the Cherry Blossom Marathon in April, the Korean Traditional Liquor and Cake festival in March, and memorial ceremonies for the founders of the Silla Dynasty and General Kim Yu-sin.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{has several}} British-style public schools, which attract pupils {{from all over}} India and a few {{neighbouring}} countries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu comprising indigenous Bengali, Nepali, Lepcha, Bhutia, Tibetan, and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, alongside its neighbouring town of Kalimpong, was {{the centre of the}} Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s. The town's fragile ecology has been threatened by a rising demand for environmental resources, stemming from growing <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> and poorly planned urbanisation.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} {{the building of}} a line through Lier started in 1895, and construction commenced in 1901. The line opened on 12 July 1904 and was initially profitable, in part because of <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic.</b> In 1920, the Drammen Line was converted to standard gauge, resulting in expensive transshipment between the two lines. This and falling traffic caused the line to become unprofitable. The Lier line was closed for ordinary traffic on 23 October 1932. All traffic ceased on 1 January 1937 and the track was demolished shortly afterwards.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{passenger}} train services operate using modern diesel locomotives and railcars but the Zillertal Railway also has several steam locomotives which are used with heritage veranda rolling stock for special trains targeting <b>tourists.</b> Goods <b>traffic</b> is carried; standard gauge wagons from and to the main line network are carried on transporter wagons.|$|R
50|$|As of 2010, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} an abutment of a bridge on the Rio Ytay, the <b>tourist</b> steam train <b>traffic</b> has been suspended until repairs can be effected.|$|R
25|$|Following a {{deal between}} White Pass and the United Transportation Union {{representing}} Alaska {{employees of the}} road, the White Pass Route was reopened between Skagway and White Pass in 1988 purely for <b>tourist</b> passenger <b>traffic.</b> The White Pass Route also bid on the ore-haul from the newly reopened Faro mine, but its price was considerably higher than road haulage over the Klondike Highway.|$|R
5|$|The {{variations}} {{between the}} AADT and the ASDT traffic volumes {{are attributed to}} the fact that the motorway carries certain <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> from Hungary to the Croatian motorway network and ultimately to the Adriatic Sea. On average the motorway carries 15% increased volume of traffic during summer months. As the Hungarian M6 motorway is gradually extended towards the Croatian border and the A5 motorway's northern terminus, the number of tourists traveling along this route in summer months is increasing.|$|E
5|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted and reported by Hrvatske autoceste, the operator of the motorway, and {{is published by}} Hrvatske ceste. Variations between AADT and average summer daily traffic (ASDT) traffic volumes are attributed {{to the fact that}} the motorway carries substantial <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> to the Adriatic Sea resorts during the summer. On average, the A5 motorway carries 14% more ASDT than AADT. The largest increase, 15%, of ASDT relative to AADT is observed on the Đakovo–Sredanci section.|$|E
5|$|Variations between AADT {{and average}} summer daily traffic (ASDT) traffic volumes are {{attributed}} {{to the fact that}} the motorway carries substantial <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> to the Adriatic Sea resorts along the Istria peninsula. On average, the A9 motorway carries 218% more ASDT than AADT. The largest increase of the ASDT relative to the AADT is observed on the Nova VasVišnjan section, at 229%. BINA Istra expects the motorway to carry more than 20,000 vehicles per day during peak tourist season periods.|$|E
50|$|Tourism {{commands}} a large {{fraction of}} Jeju's economy. Jeju's temperate climate, natural scenery, and beaches {{make it a}} popular tourist destination for South Koreans as well as visitors {{from other parts of}} East Asia. The most popular tourist spots on the island are Cheonjeyeon and Cheonjiyeon waterfalls, Mount Halla, Hyeobje cave, and Hyeongje island. There is a variety of leisure sports that tourists can take part in Jeju including golf, horse riding, hunting, fishing, mountain climbing, etc. Depending on the season, Jeju hosts many festivals for tourists including a penguin swimming contest in winter, cherry blossom festival in spring, the midsummer night beach festival in summer, and Jeju horse festival in autumn, among others. For most <b>tourists,</b> <b>traffic</b> to and from the island is mainly taken through Jeju International Airport and transport within the island by rental cars. Some local products are popular with tourists, including Jeju's special tile fish and mandarin oranges, as well as souvenirs and duty-free shopping.|$|R
50|$|Anderson's Corner became {{far less}} busy with through <b>tourist</b> and other <b>traffic</b> after the interstate opened, not unlike many older {{business}} {{areas in the}} United States during that era of the mid-20th century.|$|R
50|$|On November 20, 2011, the Jakarta {{administration}} inaugurated the city's first railways tourism package {{aimed at}} attracting more <b>tourists</b> and reducing <b>traffic</b> congestion from Gambir railway station to the Tanjung Priok railway station.|$|R
5|$|While that {{construction}} was being done, MDOT truncated US10 at Bay City in 1986; this removed the concurrency between US10 and US23 that existed since 1926. A {{few years later}} in 1992, the freeway concept for the northeastern LP was revived again when MDOT initiated plans to study and build a new US23 freeway from Standish northerly to Tawas City, Oscoda or Alpena. This proposal was brought up due to {{a high level of}} <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> along the current routing since the mid-1960s. The FHWA mandated additional environmental studies for the project in 2000, and MDOT withdrew the proposals two years later.|$|E
5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> adds to the congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become bottlenecks at such times. The alternative to the bypass is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues. Despite being a shorter and a more direct route, those avenues are much more congested than the bypass at rush hours and they contain at-grade intersections and traffic lights at some of their junctions.|$|E
5|$|The A9 {{motorway}} {{spans the}} peninsula of Istria {{and is a}} significant north–south motorway in Croatia connecting Pula, the largest city {{in the south of}} the region, to the cities of Rovinj, Poreč, Novigrad, Umag; and ending at Kaštel and Plovanija at the border crossings into Slovenia south of Koper. This part of the road network of Croatia is also a part of European route E751; KoperKanfanarPula and KanfanarRijeka. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of economic development, especially for tourism and as a transit and transport route. The road carries significant transit and <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> as it runs along Adriatic Sea coast linking a large number of tourist resorts.|$|E
2500|$|Since 18 July 2014, it {{has been}} {{relocated}} to Suffolk Street, {{in front of the}} Tourist Information Office, in order to make way for Luas track-laying work to be completed at the old location. Due to the increase in <b>tourist</b> foot <b>traffic,</b> and a common penchant for being [...] "handsy", the statue has been groped often enough that the bronze hue has begun to wear off on the bosom.|$|R
50|$|Some {{lines were}} {{converted}} to standard gauge, while most lines have been demolished. In the 21st century, only the Roslagsbanan commuter rail still functions as a commercial railway. There are also <b>tourist</b> or heritage <b>traffic</b> on some lines.|$|R
50|$|Frequent ferry services, {{operated}} by JR West (JR Miyajima ferry) and by Miyajima Matsudai <b>Tourist</b> Ship, carry <b>traffic</b> between {{the island and}} the mainland. The trip takes about ten minutes. There is an hourly express passenger ferry to Hiroshima harbour.|$|R
5|$|The city of Gyeongju was {{united with}} the nearby rural Gyeongju County in 1995 {{and is now}} an urban–rural complex. It is similar to 53 other small- and {{medium-sized}} cities with a population under 300,000 people in South Korea. As well as its rich historical heritage, Gyeongju today {{is affected by the}} economic, demographic, and social trends that have shaped modern South Korean culture. Tourism remains the major economic driver, but manufacturing activities have developed due to its proximity to major industrial centers such as Ulsan and Pohang. Gyeongju is connected to the nationwide rail and highway networks, which facilitate industrial and <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|US113 {{serves as}} an {{important}} route carrying local and through traffic along with <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> bound for the Delaware Beaches and Ocean City, Maryland to the east; as such the highway experiences congestion in the summer months when tourism to the beach areas is at its highest. Access from US113 to the beach areas is provided by US9 and DE404 toward Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, and Dewey Beach; DE26 toward Bethany Beach; DE54 toward Fenwick Island; MD90 toward northern Ocean City; US50 toward downtown Ocean City; and MD376 toward Assateague Island. US 113 {{also serves as a}} part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the beach communities to inland areas to the north. All of US113 is part of the National Highway System.|$|E
5|$|The A2 {{motorway}} is {{an important}} north–south motorway in Croatia, connecting {{the capital of the}} country, Zagreb, to Graz, Austria, via Maribor, Slovenia, as well as Vienna and other destinations along the Pyhrn route. The motorway follows a route through the Hrvatsko Zagorje region. Part of the road network of Croatia, the motorway is also part of European route E59 Zagreb–Graz–Vienna–Prague. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of economic development, especially for tourism and as a transit transport route. The road carries significant transit and <b>tourist</b> <b>traffic</b> as it connects to the Zagreb bypass segment of the A3 motorway, which serves as a hub distributing the southbound traffic to either eastbound A3 or southbound A1, and vice versa. As of the June 1997 Pan-European Transport Conference in Helsinki, the motorway is part of the Pan-European Corridor Xa.|$|E
50|$|The {{village is}} a quiet place in the evenings and it sees much passing trade during the day {{throughout}} the summer as it is situated on the D660 which runs north to south. Although the road occasionally becomes fairly busy during the peak <b>tourist</b> months, <b>traffic</b> never becomes sufficiently heavy {{to be considered a}} disturbance. As with many places around here, its population increases with the coming of summer and 'les grandes vacances', but its quiet charm never really succumbs at all.|$|R
5000|$|Meshael Alayban is a Saudi {{woman who}} was accused of human {{trafficking}} in Irvine, California. She is the wife of Prince Abdulrahman, son of Nasser bin Abdulaziz. She was present on a <b>tourist</b> visa. Human <b>trafficking</b> charges were dropped on Friday Sept 20, 2013.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway {{began in}} November 1905. The {{majority}} of {{the route of the}} new railway followed the colliery tramway, but with several of the steeper gradients and sharper curves eased. The colliery line was also extended west to the new terminus at Machrihanish. The work was completed in 1906 and the railway opened on 18 August 1906. It was an immediate success, attracting 10,000 passengers in its first three weeks of operation and replacing the horse-drawn <b>tourist</b> charabanc <b>traffic</b> in Campbeltown.|$|R
