50|$|After {{the civil}} parish (freguesias), the Portuguese concelho {{is the most}} stable {{territorial}} subdivision within the country, with over 900 years of history. Founded in the royal charters attributed to parcels and <b>territorial</b> <b>enclaves,</b> {{in order to establish}} a presence by the Crown, rather than personal fiefdoms of the nobility and aristocracy. This municipal institution changed throughout history: many were abolished and reconstituted based on the political necessity; first they were subject to the specifics of each charter (which varied based on conditions and circumstances), and then based on national laws established during the Liberal era.|$|R
2500|$|Twenty-two nationalities {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} republics {{with a degree}} of local self-government and representation in the Council of Nationalities in the Supreme Soviet.

Joseph Stalin's 1913 definition of a nation as [...] "a historically constituted and stable community of people formed on the basis of common language, territory, economic life, and psychological makeup revealed in a common culture" [...] was retained by Soviet authorities throughout the 1980s. However, in granting nationalities union republic status, three additional factors were considered: a population of at least 1 million, territorial compactness, and location on the borders of the Soviet Union.|$|R

Its originality resides in the focus on the role of an external aristocratic lineage, when previous studies of such areas have tended to focus on the dynamics of local concejil government. Whilst recent studies highlight the importance of local elites in the process of territory building prior to royal intervention, the projection of some of those groups was relatively limited at a national scale and was circumscribed in many cases to areas controlled by the local councils. This {{was the case with the}} Riaza Valley, similarly split into small <b>territorial</b> <b>enclaves,</b> in which the influence of an external aristocratic lineage, the Azas, became stronger with the passage of time...|$|R
40|$|Private {{international}} law applies to cases governed by private law which involve factual connections with several countries. A major issue governed by private {{international law}} {{is the question of}} which country’s law should be applied to determine the merits of a dispute. This thesis focuses on choice of law in respect of transnational contracts. It compares the legal principles concerning choice of law adopted by way of European harmonization with those currently utilized in the United Arab Emirates. The purpose of this comparison is to find points which are not addressed in the United Arab Emirates law under its Civil Transactions Code, or on which its provisions are unsatisfactory. In particular, the absence of any special provisions on choice of law for contracts such as consumer, insurance, and employment contracts which involved disparity of bargaining power between the parties, is considered. The thesis proposes new provisions which could usefully be adopted in the UAE by way of amendment to its Civil Transactions Code {{in the light of the}} European solutions under the Rome I Regulation. Attention is also given to a recently established <b>territorial</b> <b>enclave,</b> the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), which has its own legal system, based on an English model, and is designed to attract international businesses and investors. Thus the thesis examines choice of law under DIFC law, and (in view of the rapid development of the DIFC legal order, and the numerous issues therein which have not yet been fully resolved) also considers other areas of {{private international law}} in the DIFC (such as judicial jurisdiction, arbitration and the enforcements of judgments and awards) ...|$|E

Then, this article presents, objectively, the reflections developed in recent {{research in the area of}} the Urban Geography, that had as in case that analytical Diamantina, and it has for objective pointing with respect to the urgency of if treating the called Brazilian historical cities, as much in boardings of scientific research how much in the practical one of the urban territorial planning, while inserted in the totality world.

Lebanon is used as a case study to steer the debate and increase the understanding of the factors fermenting communal tensions that are the root causes of conflict.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} how the EU relates to its <b>territorial</b> <b>enclaves,</b> Ceuta and Melilla located within Morocco. As this study is based on the theoretical foundations of the Copenhagen School it has focused on how the EU relates to its enclaves in terms of security. More specifically its aim was to uncover if a securitization of the enclaves had been initiated by the EU, the nature of the process and whether the securitization has been successful. The area of threat was recognized as immigration or specifically illegal immigration through the enclaves. The study was conducted using a qualitative text analysis, the Anglo-Saxon direction of discourse analysis found in the writings of Chantal Mouffe and Ernesto Laclau. The material consisted of EU official documents relating to the enclaves. The discourse analysis was conducted by the deconstruction of the discourse using concepts like nodal points, floating signifiers and the search for temporary closure of discourse. The analysis uncovered the securitizing move, the referent object and an audience acceptance of the threat. This has led to the legitimization of unconventional measures and the realization of the securitization of the enclaves. ...|$|R
40|$|In Kosovo, {{the concept}} of human {{security}} is invoked in a three-fold manner. First of all, {{the international community has}} applied human security for the purpose of maintaining a fragile peace and stability in Kosovo. For the international community, maintaining the fragile peace meant tolerating the establishment and operationalization of Serbian parallel institutions. This leads to the second application of human security: the parallel institutions claim that their existence is necessary to provide human security for the Serbian community in Kosovo. Consequently, this undermines the capacity of Kosovo’s public institutions to exercise legal authority in the north of Kosovo and in other <b>territorial</b> <b>enclaves.</b> Parallel to this, Kosovo’s institutions have viewed the human security approach as a means to prove the institutional capacity of independent self-government to provide inclusive security, welfare, and integration policies for all people in Kosovo, with a special emphasis on ethnic minorities. Accordingly, human security is used by different actors in Kosovo to pursue different political agendas, which have not resulted in achieving the primary goal of furthering human welfare and fulfilment beyond mere physical security. To the contrary, the (ab) use of human security has created the conditions for fragile governance, protracted ethnic destabilization, and stagnating economic and human development...|$|R
5000|$|Spain {{possesses}} two <b>territorial</b> <b>enclaves</b> on Africa's Mediterranean coast (Ceuta and Melilla) {{that are}} also claimed by Morocco and sometimes cause bilateral tensions. Other territorial disputes and the Western Sahara issue also sometimes cause tension. In October 2001, Morocco recalled its ambassador from Madrid after pro-Saharan groups in Spain conducted a mock referendum {{on the fate of}} the region. In the July 2002 Perejil Island crisis, Spanish troops ejected Moroccan soldiers from the uninhabited Perejil Island off the Moroccan coast; Spain asserted that it had controlled the island for centuries. Diplomatic ties were not restored until January 2003. That July, Morocco complained that Spain lacked neutrality on the Sahara issue when it chaired the United Nations Security Council and, in October, Spain suspended arms sales to Morocco due to the Perejil crisis. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero visited Morocco in April 2004, and King Juan Carlos I visited in January 2005; on both occasions, joint statements called for a negotiated settlement to the Sahara issue—the Moroccan position. However, visits to Ceuta and Melilla by the Spanish prime minister in January 2006 and monarchs in November 2007 again set back relations. The two neighbours also have an unresolved dispute concerning territorial waters between Morocco and the Spanish Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Morocco's [...] "super port" [...] at Tangier will pose competition that concerns Spanish ports. Financed by Arab states of the Persian Gulf, its construction began in June 2009. It is expected to achieve full capacity in 2014.|$|R
