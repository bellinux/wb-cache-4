Sometimes the rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls, a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke (illustration 2).|$|E

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} dealing with the study of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> fields in <b>the</b> Krkonoše Mountains. One of the {{features}} with which it is dealing is their distribution in the study area and it searches the influence of this distribution in the dependance on the morphometric character of the relief. Moreover, the inner and outer characteristics of the structure of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> fields are being studied. The outer structure was firstly investigated {{on the basis of the}} morphometric characteristics observed in DMR (digital model of relief) and orto photo maps and subsequently the characteristics of the inner structure were studied during the terraine geomorphologic researching. The following data were observed - for the outer characteristics: litology, exposition of the slope, angle of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> fields, area (log), index of the solar radiation, the length of the axis x and y of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> fields, excentricity of the shape of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> field, <b>the</b> altitude; and for the outer characteristics: deviation of the axis x from the downslope, the location of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> angularity of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> 'R' values, <b>the</b> length of the axis x and y of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> <b>the</b> height of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> excentricity of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> inclination of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> and angle of <b>the</b> <b>block.</b> <b>The</b> influence of the given characteristics on the accumulation of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> fields and [...] ...|$|R

30|$|The {{images of}} a {{resistive}} block model are shown in Figure  5 a-g. The images show that the geometries of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> are well resolved. <b>The</b> <b>block</b> of <b>the</b> dipole-dipole image nearly matches <b>the</b> true <b>block</b> than Schlumberger and Wenner (Figure  5 a-c). The reconstructed resistivity of the model images ranges from 237.89 to 302.85 Ωm indicating that the resistivity of <b>the</b> true <b>block</b> (500 Ωm) is underestimated (Table  2). However, the reconstructed resistivity of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> resulting from maximum image {{is closer to the}} true model followed by dipole-dipole while the Wenner image gives the least representation. Although, the depth of burial of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> is resolved, <b>the</b> reconstructed <b>block</b> appears deeper than <b>the</b> actual <b>block’s</b> position. <b>The</b> vertical displacement of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> from <b>the</b> actual position of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> for all <b>the</b> seven images is presented in Table  3. The Table shows that <b>the</b> <b>block</b> of maximum image is least displaced at about 0.122  m from the centre of the true model followed by <b>the</b> <b>block</b> in image of dipole-dipole with displacement of 0.125  m while <b>the</b> <b>block</b> in <b>the</b> inverse model has the biggest displacement of 0.196  m from the center of <b>the</b> true <b>block.</b> As presented in Tables  4 and 5, the maximum image gives the smallest errors in trying to reproduce <b>the</b> <b>block</b> and background of the model. This is closely followed by dipole-dipole image for the individual arrays. Thus, taking into account the quality of the image, the mean resistivity, the estimated errors and the position of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> relative to <b>the</b> true <b>block</b> position, <b>the</b> image of maximum approach provides more reliable and detailed information about <b>the</b> <b>block</b> model than <b>the</b> rest of the images. As a result, it is the most appropriate approach for imaging <b>the</b> resistive <b>block</b> models followed by dipole-dipole image.|$|R

5|$|Pistorius {{is always}} slow in {{starting}} a race because the flexible blades {{do not provide}} thrust out of <b>the</b> <b>blocks.</b> Pistorius must begin from an awkward position, swing his leg to the outside and pop straight up from <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> to begin running, when the preferred method is to push off with horizontal force. For the first 30 meters of a race, he keeps {{his head down and}} takes short, quick strides. As he establishes a rhythm, he can raise his head and increase his speed. While some runners jog up and down, losing energy, Pistorius directs energy forward, looking somewhat like he is rolling on wheels. He also compensates for the adjustments ankles make on the turns, breaking the curves into short, straight lines. According to his coach Ampie Louw, Pistorius may {{be able to use the}} inward lean to generate force and come out of a turn going faster.|$|E

5|$|The ice-cutting {{involved}} several {{stages and}} was typically {{carried out at}} night, when the ice was thickest. First the surface would be cleaned of snow with scrapers, {{the depth of the}} ice tested for suitability, then the surface would be marked out with cutters to produce the lines of the future ice blocks. The size of <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> varied according to the destination, the largest being for the furthest locations, the smallest destined for the American east coast itself and being only 22inches (0.56 m) square. <b>The</b> <b>blocks</b> could finally be cut out of the ice and floated to the shore. The speed of the operation might depend on the likelihood of warmer weather impacting on the ice. In both New England and Norway, harvesting occurred during an otherwise quiet season, providing valuable local employment.|$|E
5|$|The primary Portland Farmers Market location, {{held in the}} South Park Blocks every Saturday from March to December attracts up to 14,000 {{people per}} weekend to the local food booths.

5000|$|Because {{the surface}} is horizontal, the normal force is {{constant}} and equal to the weight of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> or N=mg.

5|$|After Hearst {{conveyed}} {{his enthusiasm}} for the project, Beloso sold Byne the stones for $85,000, including the cloister, the chapter house, the refectory and the dormitory for novices. With Byne's commission, Hearst was to pay $97,000, a price roughly equivalent to $ as of 20. Byne started immediately on the project, organizing men and materials, and beginning the removal of stones. Hearst's main architect Julia Morgan sent her associate architect Walter T. Steilberg who arrived on March 9, 1931. Steilberg recommended that Hearst buy the old church portal, which he did, at Byne's price of $1,500. Under the direction of Byne and Steilberg, the monastery was carefully labeled as it was dismantled stone by stone. Antonio Gomez, the local foreman praised by Byne and Steilberg, numbered <b>the</b> <b>blocks</b> on architectural drawings and painted the number in red {{on the back of}} each stone.|$|E
