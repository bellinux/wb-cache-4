5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E

The city's intention was <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> and upgrade the airport in order for the economy and tourism <b>to</b> <b>expand.</b> City mayor Peter Milobar and members of the Kamloops Indian Band praised its expansion.

5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> their mouths, {{which allow}} them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> their mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E

5|$|The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, {{is defined}} by {{regional}} kingdoms and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared {{to make way for}} the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.|$|E
5|$|The W.F. Stanley and Co. company {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> after Stanley's death, {{moving to}} a factory in New Eltham (The Stanley Scientific Instrument Works) in 1916. During World War I, the factory was requisitioned by the government.

After the war, the company continued <b>to</b> <b>expand,</b> participating in many large project– for example, RMS Queen Mary and Royal Navy ships used the company's compasses and other navigational instruments. The company went into liquidation in July 1999– the main factors were not investing the proceeds of the sale of the factory land to buying new machinery, the high value of the pound affecting export orders, and the loss of Ministry of Defence orders following the end of the Cold War.|$|E

As a result, plans <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> the force to a 6th Division were shelved and its manpower distributed amongst the other five divisions, while the five divisions were amalgamated together under the banner of the Australian Corps, thus effectively allowing the 4th Division, which was struggling to maintain its numbers to act as a depot formation within the Corps with the other three divisions providing most of the combat power.|$|E
