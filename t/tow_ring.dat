50|$|The low {{tow hitch}} {{position}} and small <b>tow</b> <b>ring</b> means {{they were really}} only suitable for towing behind an M7, as they dragged at quite an angle when hitched to a Weasel. An M7 tractor could tow two loaded M19 trailers on solid going such as an ice or snow-covered road, and when rougher ground was to be traversed it would drop one unit and shuttle them across the rougher ground one at a time.|$|E
50|$|In transportation, a pintle hitch {{is a type}} of {{tow hitch}} that uses a <b>tow</b> <b>ring</b> {{configuration}} to secure to a hook or a ball combination for the purpose of towing an unpowered vehicle. As a weapon mount a pintle-mount is used with machine guns as the mounting hardware that mates the machine gun to a vehicle or tripod. Essentially the pintle is a bracket with a cylindrical bottom and a cradle for the gun on top; the cylindrical bottom fits into a hole in the tripod while the cradle holds the gun.|$|E
5000|$|The boat must be {{equipped}} with a ski rope and handle. The tow rope must be sufficiently long for maneuvering, with a recommended length of 75 ft (within tolerance) although length varies widely {{depending on the type}} of water skiing and the skier's skill level. Competition requirements on rope construction have changed over the years, from [...] "quarter-inch polypropylene rope" [...] in 1992 to the 2003 flexibility as long as the same specification is used [...] "for the entire event." [...] The rope and handle are anchored to the boat and played out at the stern. This anchor point on a recreation boat is commonly a <b>tow</b> <b>ring</b> or cleat, mounted on the boat's stern. For more dedicated skiers, a metal ski pylon is placed in the center of the boat in front of the engine to connect the skier. This pylon is mounted securely, since a skilled slalom skier can put a considerable amount of tension in the ski rope and the pylon.|$|E
50|$|Weeks and his Marines of the 4th Platoon disembarked from Kane; twenty men and two {{officers}} loaded onto one Higgins landing craft while the remaining ten loaded onto two rubber boats, which were towed in line astern to the Higgins boat. During the first 2000 yards, due to heavy seas, the <b>towing</b> <b>rings</b> were {{pulled out of}} both rubber boats and the Marines attempted to maintain the movement by grasping the towline and bracing their feet against the rubber cross pieces.|$|R
2500|$|The {{wreck of}} the Sagamore was {{discovered}} at [...] in 1962 by Jack Brosco and Robert McCormick of Sault Ste. Marie in [...] of water, mostly intact and sitting upright on a gravel bottom.Scuba diver and shipwreck historian Cris Kohl reports that the Sagamore is [...] "probably {{the best example of}} a whaleback steamer that can be found anywhere under the surface of the Great Lakes." [...] Kohl describes the Sagamore as a long shipwreck of with impressive triple <b>tow</b> <b>rings</b> mounted on her blunt-nosed bow, wide open hatches for easy access, and comfortable ambient lighting for swimming inside her hull. Kohl and other divers warn that the Sagamore is not usually buoyed as she lies {{in the middle of the}} busy freighter shipping lane near the Soo Locks.|$|R
50|$|The 28/32 cm NbW 41 was a six-barrelled rocket {{launcher}} {{mounted on a}} two-wheeled carriage. Two stabilizer arms and a spade under the <b>towing</b> <b>ring</b> served to steady the carriage while firing. It used two different rockets. The open metal frames of the launcher were sized to fit the 32 cm rocket, but adapter rails were provided to allow the 28 cm rockets to fit. The 28 cm Wurfkörper Spreng (Explosive missile) rocket weighed 82 kg and had a 50 kg high-explosive warhead. The 32 cm Wurfkörper Flamm (Incendiary missile) was normally filled with 50 L (45 kg) of incendiary oil (Flammöl), but could carry poison gases or decontamination fluids. The oil could cover 200 m2 Both rockets were spin-stabilized and electrically-fired. They had a prominent exhaust trail that kicked {{up a lot of}} debris, so the crew had to seek shelter before firing. This meant that they were easily located and had to displace quickly to avoid counter-battery fire. The rockets were fired one at a time, in a timed ripple, but the launcher had no capability to fire single rockets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{wreck of}} the Sagamore was {{discovered}} at [...] in 1962 by Jack Brosco and Robert McCormick of Sault Ste. Marie in 45 to 65 ft of water, mostly intact and sitting upright on a gravel bottom.Scuba diver and shipwreck historian Cris Kohl reports that the Sagamore is [...] "probably {{the best example of}} a whaleback steamer that can be found anywhere under the surface of the Great Lakes." [...] Kohl describes the Sagamore as a long shipwreck of with impressive triple <b>tow</b> <b>rings</b> mounted on her blunt-nosed bow, wide open hatches for easy access, and comfortable ambient lighting for swimming inside her hull. Kohl and other divers warn that the Sagamore is not usually buoyed as she lies {{in the middle of the}} busy freighter shipping lane near the Soo Locks. The Sagamore's wreck was stripped of her artifacts over the years. Michigan’s Antiquities Act of 1980 prohibited the removal of artifacts from shipwrecks on the Great Lakes bottomlands. The Evening News reported a Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment 1992 raid on the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum and its offices that found evidence of 150 artifacts illegally removed from the state-claimed bottomlands, including artifacts from the Sagamore. [...] Following a settlement agreement, a single sheave block, shaving mug, pocket watch, mallet, pickax, saucer, and pitcher from the Sagamore are now the property of the State of Michigan and are on loan for display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum.|$|R
