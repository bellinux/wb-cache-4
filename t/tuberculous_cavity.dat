The denuded ribs and the bag were then removed, leaving a permanent concavity in the chest wall after the skin had been sutured into place.

40|$|Opinion {{appears to}} differ {{regarding}} the pathology of the vessels in lungs affected by miliary and chronic tuberculosis. Kaufmann (1929) emphasized obliterative {{changes in the}} pulmonary arteries. Boyd (1950) speaks of an endarteritis obliterans in vessels without specifying their origin. Cahnette (1923) mentioned the formation of small pedun-culated, pear-shaped " aneurysms of Rasmussen " in branches of the pulmonary artery which traverse the walls of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>cavities.</b> The same aneurysmal dilatations were also pointed out by Kaufmann. Pagel (Kayne, Pagel, and O'Shaugh-nessy, 1948), on the other hand, believes that younger tubercles, and even older foci, contain blood vessels. He contends that the cells par-ticipating {{in the formation of}} the tubercle are generally derived from elements of connective tissue " which have an inherent tendency to vessel for-mation. " Thus young tuberculous tissue is rich in capillaries and older foci are vascularized at the periphery. Coryllos (1933) speculated on the possible clinical significance ofendarteritis in the pulmonary arteries, and thought that this was probably beneficial in controlling the activity of tubercle bacilli. He considered that collapse therapy accomplished the same purpose by reducing the pulmonary artery bed and resting the lung. The oxygen requirements of the tubercle bacillus would thus be interfered with and its activity curtailed. Cournand and Richards (1941) also attribute the benefits ofcollapse therapy to the reduction of oxygen and blood available to the tubercle bacilli in the affected lungs. Rich (1944) thinks it reasonable to presume that the exacting oxygen requirements of the tubercle bacillus play some part in limiting its multiplication in vivo, and particularly within tuberculous lesions. Although little is known of the rate at which oxygen diffuses into areas o...|$|R

Development of resistance of the isolates to the antibiotics which were used for therapy was also tested. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. Bacterial flora in bronchial tubes were chiefly Streptococcus, Micrococcus, Sarcina, Mycococcus, Nocardia and Yeast. Gram negative rods were seldom isolated. 2. Streptococcus as well as staphylococcus were always dominant when human whole blood was added in media. In many cases, red or pink pigmented Micrococcus were isolated (20 cases out of 30). Those organisms were idantified as Micrococcus rhodochrous and Micrococcus cinnabareus which were recently rearranged as Mycococcus by krassilnikov. 3. Aboundant colonies of Nocardia and Nocardia like organisms were found in plates when the human blood media were used. After much mycological investigation, those organisms were classified into 4 species of Nocardia. 4. Viable bacterial count of per gram of the branchial fluid was carried out. In one case, 2, 200 × 10 ^ 3 bacteria were counted, while 63 × 10 ^ 3 in the other case. 5. The isolated Gram positive cocci such as red and yellow Mycococcus, Staphylococcus and Sarcina were resistant to streptomycin, growing well at the concentration of 1, 000 meg/ml of the drug.

40|$|First of all, we {{investigated}} the origin, {{the construction and}} distribution of the bronchial arteries and veins in adult rabbits, and then observed various changes of the blood vessels in experimental cavities and caseous foci and also studied the effects of streptomycin and isoniazide on the blood vessels of the cavity wall. The summary findings of the present experiments are described in the following. 1) In ten out of the fifteen rabbits emloyed, the bronchial artery originates from the right supreme intercostal artery; in three cases, {{in addition to this}} origin, it originates also from the left supreme intercostal artery; and in another case from the intercostal thoracic artery; while in the remaining one from the arc of the aorta. 2) The bronchial veins are divided into the extra-pulmonary and the intra-pulmonary veins. The former arises from the submucous blood vessels located in the proximal part of the third bronchus, and running along with the bronchial artery, finally empties into the superior Vena cava; while the latter, originating from the submucous capillaries in the distal part of the third bronchus, and after anastomosing with one another in the capsule of the bronchus, is communicated with the pulmonary veins. 3) In the caseous foci, although blood vessels are obliterated, capillaries are newly formed around the main trunks of the pulmonary artery and vein as well as around their residual branches. 4) These caseous foci are supplied with arterial blood from the bronchial arteries, the blood vessels in the bronchial wall, and the newlyformed vessels of pulmonary arterial origin. 5) The capillaries in the cavity wall are classified into three types according to their origins; namely, Type I, those regenerating from fine branches of the pulmonary vessels; Type &# 8545;, those regenerating from the main trunk of the pulmonary vessels; and Type &# 8546;, those regenerating from the bronchial artery situated in the orifice of the drainage bronchus. 6) The <b>tuberculous</b> <b>cavities</b> only in the orifice of the drainage bronchus receive an abundant supply of arterial blood directly from the bronchial artery, but those in other regions receive a scanty blood supply indirectly from the anastomoses between the bronchial artery, its sister vessels and the pulmonary artery. 7) The regeneration of blood vessels in tuberculous foci has been confirmed to occur not only in the bronchial artery and its sister blood vessels but also in the pulmonary artery and vein as well. 8) The constructions of blood vessels in the cavities treated with streptomycin or isoniazide present no significant difference from those of the control. 9) The regeneration of blood vessels and hyperemia in the cavity wall of the cases treated with streptomycin present no significant difference from those observed in the control, but the cases treated with isoniazide show marked hyperemia, newly-formed vessels, and occasional bleedings. </p...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} {{which has been}} invoked {{to account for the}} progressive disappearance of tubercle bacilli from certain types of <b>tuberculous</b> lesions (closed <b>cavities,</b> cold abcesses, etc.) is the low oxygen tension prevailing in these areas. As far as is known, tubercle bacilli depend upon molecular oxygen for growth, and the rate and extent of their multiplication decredse rapidly in proportion as the oxygen tension falls below that of ordinary air (1 - 4). It appears, moreover, that anaerobic conditions are unfavorable to the maintenance of their viability, and metabolic activity (5, 6). Low oxygen tension is, of course, only one of the characteristics of the closed tuberculous lesion which renders its physicochemical environment different from that prevailing {{in the rest of the}} body. Among other differences which can be surmised to be of importance for the multiplication and survival of tubercle bacilli, are the concentration of C 02 in the aqueous and the gaseous phases and the presence of organic acids produced by anaerobic metabolism and of other unusual substances released from the tissues by autolytic processes...|$|R

CASE REPORT A 33 year old Negro male, in October, 1951, while working in an industrial plant, first noted onset of generalized malaise, weakness, intermittent elevation in temperature, anorexia, night sweats, exertional dyspnea and a 15 pound weight loss. He developed a slightly productive cough, yielding a half ounce of sputum daily. A chest film taken at the Philadelphia General Hospital revealed a large left apical cavity. Sputum was positive for acid-fast bacilli. He was instructed to remain in bed while awaiting hospitalization. Immediate hospitalization could not be accom-plished.

He required 3 units of packed cells. Chest radiography showed scattered nodular and reticular parenchymal shadows (Figure 1). An urgent angiogram was carried out for bronchial artery em-bolization. Unfortunately, the bronchial arteries could not be cannulated. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a well-defined 7. 3 × 6. 1 cm mass involving the right lower lobe (Figure 2), suggestive of a partially thrombosed pulmonary artery aneurysm with impending rupture. The lung parenchyma showed evidence of extensive tuberculosis and bronchiectases especially in the right lower lobe. A hurried suboptimal emergency pulmonary angiogram was performed, which seemed to confirm the diagnosis. An emergency right pneumonectomy was carried out. The right lung was extensively adherent to the parietes and a firm mass was palpable in the lower lobe. The operative field was soiled during the resection. Less than 24 hours after an uneventful extubation, the patient developed progressive cardiorespiratory failure.

A. -F. -G. test and Z. -H. test surpass Z. -N. test and Kuroda test in the rate of bacillus detection {{as well as in the}} rate of determining granulation paterns. 2. In Z. -N. test the acid resistance of bacilli coincides relatively well with the growth rate, showing a negative tendency in the growth rate along with the decrease in the acid resistance; whereas in A. -F. -G. test along with the improvement of focus a decrease in the number of acid fast type of bacilli, showing an accompanying increase of the growth (-) tendency. On the other hand, in Z. -H. test the changes in the stainable type bacilli do not necessarily coincide with the nature of focus and growth rate. Moreover, the acid resistance roughly parallels with the deformation of bacilli, and along with a decrease in the acid resistance an increase in the deformation of bacilli can be recognized, especially a granulation tendency becomes marked. 3. According to the kinds of foci, bacilli in the <b>tuberculous</b> <b>cavity</b> are greated in number and the growth (positive) rate is highest, showing an increasing tendency of long bacilli, while in the inspissated cavity the long bacilli are decreased in number and short bacilli show an increasing tendency; and in the encapsulated caseous focus the granulation tendency becomes marked. Namely, with the improvement in foci bacilli tend to decrease, showing a concurrent decrease in the growth rate(-), and moreover, with the healing of foci an increasing tendecy of short bacilli as well as the fibrilllation and granulation tendencies of bacilli can be recognized. 4. In the case where bacilli are being expelled by chemotherapy of the focus, the greater the amount of antituberculous agent used, the greater is the increase in the growth rate (positive), showing a marked increasing tendency in the number of long bacilli as well as a higher acid resistance by the A. -F. -G. test. In the cavity where there occurs no expulsion of bacilli, the greater the amount of therapeutic agent used, the greater is the increasing tendency of the growth rate(-) as well as the number of short bacilli. Further more, on the whole the granulation tendency grows more marked as the amount of chemot herapeutic agent is increased. There is no correlation between the concurrent use of INH, collapse treatment of the lung, and bacillus shape. Likewise no relationship can be recognized between the duration from the onset of disease to operation, culture results, the shape and stainability of bacilli. There can berecognized on the whole no correlation between the resistance against drug and the length of bacilli, and in the case of acid fast bacilli the change in the shape of bacilli is somewhat less and the acid resistance is relatively well maintained. In the case of stainability (positive) and cnlture (-) bacilli, the decrease in the resistance and shortening deformation and granulation tendency are marked...|$|E
40|$|The roentgenogrms of 339 surgically treated cases wer e {{studied in}} this report. The plain roentgenography, {{retrograde}} pyelography and excretory pyelography {{were used as}} a routine examination to diagnose the renal tuberculosis in our clinic. If necessary, the intravenous nephrography, pneumoretroperitoneum, translumbar aortography, direct pyelography, seriography and enlargement radiography were performed. The roentgenological findings in renal tuberculosis were described in detail {{and the value of}} each method was discussed. The abnormal calcification in renal region was revealed by the plain roentgenography in 20 (5. 9 %) cases. The total and partial cement kidney were present in 9 and 4 cases respectively. This method should be used in all cases. Retrograde pyelography was tried in all case s, and pyelograms were obtained in 169 (49. 9 %) cases succesfully. Almost in all cases the pyelogram showed the lesions in renal pelvis and calices honestly. However, the closed tuberculous cativy in which the contrast medium could not enter was present in 43 (25. 4 %) of the 169 cases. Excretory pyelogsaphy was performed in 213 cases. It off e rs a fairly accurate picture of kidney function in accordance with the destruction of renal parenchym, so it has a great importance not only in the diagnosis but also in the determination of treatment. The cases, whose kidney function was impaired seriously and whose pyelogram could not show the pelvis and calices clearly and sufficiently, were 135 (66. 4 %), and the pathological changes in nephrectomized kidney of these were too extensive to treat by chemotherapy only. It is very interesting that the nearly closed <b>tuberculous</b> <b>cavity</b> could be visu a lised by excretory urography, on the other hand it was impossible to visualise it by retrograde pyelography in some cases. The incidence of the closed cavity is promoted by the chemotherapy, and such cases are resistant to the medical treatment. Diagnosis of such lesion is a very important metter, and many other assistant procedures are used to this purpose. Pneumoretroperitoneum is a useful method to outlining the kidney, but if the a d hesion of the perirenal tissue is firm, it is impossible to clarify the kidney outline. I have been unable to recognize the kidney outline in 11. 5 % of the cases. Direct pyelography is carried out by meens of translumbar direct puncture of the kidney. This is valuable in tuberculous hydronephrosis in which a pyelogram can not be obtained by usual urography. There is no serious complication, if the case is selected properly. Aortography was performed in 11 cases. The pictures of these cases and aortograms of the nephrectomized kidney were illustrated and the details of these cases were described. Translumbar injection of the aorta with a contrast medium permits a accurate visualisation of the arterial blood supply of the tuberculous kidney. I found in a number of cases, that the extent of the lesion could be visualised and assesed on the arteriogram and nephrogram, and that the diagnosis of closed cavity and the estimation of destruction in parenchym could be possible. Then this method may be valuable in tuberculous pyonephrosis, if its pyelogram can not be obtained by urography and the presence of kidney is doutful. Sometimes aortogam affords a great help in determinating the safe extent of the resection when partial nephrectomy is applicable. If pyelogram arouses suspision of the closed lesion, aortography should be carried out with no hesitation. The serial aortography is a very useful procedure to know each stadium of aortography. The arterial phase, nephrography phase and venous phase are different from each other. And it is important that man should try to obtain a clear and complete roentgenogram in any method, especially in arteriography...|$|E
