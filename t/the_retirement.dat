40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes <b>the</b> Modernized <b>Retirement</b> System {{introduced in the}} National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016. Specifically, this thesis determines if <b>the</b> Modernized <b>Retirement</b> System is likely to affect manpower levels. A survey was conducted within the active component of the U. S. Marine Corps to compare expected lengths of service between <b>the</b> current <b>retirement</b> system and <b>the</b> Modernized <b>Retirement</b> System. <b>The</b> analysis utilizes Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for expected lengths of service and probit regression models to evaluate various <b>retirement</b> choices under <b>the</b> Modernized <b>Retirement</b> System. <b>The</b> results of the analysis indicate the U. S. Marine Corps will experience a change in expected lengths of service for officers and enlisted Marines under <b>the</b> Modernized <b>Retirement</b> System. On average, enlisted Marines exhibit an approximate 2 percentage-point difference in length of service while officers exhibit an approximate 15 percentage-point difference across <b>the</b> two <b>retirement</b> systems. As <b>the</b> U. S.

30|$|In {{practice}} what we assume is that - conditional on observables - whether the partner {{is eligible for}} retirement pensions only {{has an impact on}} <b>the</b> individual’s <b>retirement</b> decision through <b>the</b> partner’s <b>retirement</b> decision, as opposed to directly having an effect. Note that our exogeneity assumption does not imply that partner’s eligibility for retirement pensions does not affect ones’ <b>retirement</b> decisions. <b>The</b> assumption is that it does so but only through <b>the</b> actual <b>retirement</b> decision of <b>the</b> partner. Under this assumption, our estimates of β are interpreted as the effect of <b>the</b> partner’s <b>retirement,</b> induced through eligibility for <b>retirement</b> pensions, on <b>the</b> individual’s <b>retirement</b> decision.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} applying private sector retirement plan principles to <b>the</b> military <b>retirement</b> system. <b>The</b> increasing cost and generosity of military retirement coupled with political pressures to reduce federal spending have focused attention on reforming <b>the</b> military <b>retirement</b> system. Previous studies of <b>the</b> military <b>retirement</b> system are addressed and critiqued. Private retirement options are reviewed and a 401 (k) plan is proposed to replace <b>the</b> current military <b>retirement</b> system. <b>The</b> new <b>retirement</b> system would eventually reduce federal outlays for military retirement by 66 percent while covering all service members. <b>The</b> role of <b>retirement</b> compensation in shaping force structure and retention are addressed. The thesis concludes that privatizing military retirement is feasible and less costly than <b>the</b> current military <b>retirement</b> system while still meeting most of the objectives of military retirement compensation.

30|$|Some notable {{insights}} can {{be obtained}} from the results. We observe that in the two wage distributions <b>the</b> elected legal <b>retirement</b> age under <b>the</b> Downsian criterion is higher than that under the Right-wing criterion. The reason is the larger redistribution associated with the Downsian criterion. It is also worth noting the comparison between <b>the</b> optimal <b>retirement</b> ages of <b>the</b> poorest and the richest individuals under the two political criteria. In both wage distributions, the larger the redistribution is, the closer to <b>the</b> elected <b>retirement</b> age <b>the</b> optimal <b>retirement</b> ages of <b>the</b> poorest and the richest individuals will be and, consequently, the lesser the disutility imposed by <b>the</b> mandatory <b>retirement</b> will be.|$|R
