25|$|In the 2009 {{revision}} of the phase descriptions, the WHO has retained {{the use of a}} six-phase approach for easy incorporation of new recommendations and approaches into existing national preparedness and response plans. The grouping and description of pandemic phases have been revised to make them easier <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> <b>more</b> precise, and based upon observable phenomena. Phases 1–3 correlate with preparedness, including capacity development and response planning activities, while phases 4–6 clearly signal the need for response and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, periods after the first pandemic wave are elaborated to facilitate post pandemic recovery activities.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to all the training usually given to Chemical Technologists in their respective degree (or one given via an associate degree), a Chemist is also trained <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> details related to chemical phenomena so that the chemist can be capable of more planning on the steps to achieve a distinct goal via a chemistry-related endeavor. The higher the competency level achieved {{in the field of}} Chemistry (as assessed via a combination of education, experience and personal achievements), the higher the responsibility given to that chemist and the more complicated the task might be. Chemistry, as a field, have so many applications that different tasks/objectives can be given to workers/scientists with these different levels of education and/or experience. The specific title of each job varies from position to position, depending on factors such as the kind of industry, the routine level of the task, the current needs of a particular enterprise, the size of the enterprise or hiring firm, the philosophy and management principles of the hiring firm, the visibility of the competency and individual achievements of the one seeking employment, economic factors such as recession or economic depression, among other factors, so this makes it difficult to categorize the exact roles of these chemistry-related workers as standard for that given level of education. Because of these factors affecting exact job titles with distinct responsibilities, some chemists might begin doing technician tasks while other chemists might begin doing more complicated tasks than those of a technician, such as tasks that also involve formal applied research, management, or supervision included within the responsibilities of that same job title. The level of supervision given to that chemist also varies in a similar manner, with factors similar to those that affect the tasks demanded for a particular chemist.|$|E

500|$|As Edward {{was growing}} up, {{he was able}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> and more {{government}} business. However, his actual involvement in decisions {{has long been a}} matter of debate, and during the 20th century, historians have presented the whole gamut of possibilities, [...] "balanc an articulate puppet against a mature, precocious, and essentially adult king", in the words of Stephen Alford. A special [...] "Counsel for the Estate" [...] was created when Edward was fourteen. Edward chose the members himself. In the weekly meetings with this Council, Edward was [...] "to hear the debating of things of most importance". A major point of contact with the king was the Privy Chamber, and there Edward worked closely with William Cecil and William Petre, the Principal Secretaries. The king's greatest influence was in matters of religion, where the Council followed the strongly Protestant policy that Edward favoured.|$|E
500|$|Gaara's backstory {{became one}} of Kishimoto's {{favorite}} stories from Part I; Kishimoto had to revise his illustrations in such chapters as he wanted readers <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> of Gaara's mental state. The character was originally {{going to be called}} Kotarou Fuuma, but Kishimoto's editor highly refused to give him that name. As a result, he was given the name Gaara why he felt more suitable to the fact he always uses sand. By 2013, Kishimoto stated he still did not understand why such name was discarded. Nevertheless, he refrained from giving him of giving him a complete name like Gaara Yuzawa. Another early name was a younger child named [...] "Kumomaru" [...] but was avoided by Kishimoto. However, after multiple changes, he became Gaara. Due to his importance in the manga as a result of being Naruto's foil, Kishimoto added the kanji for [...] "love" [...] in his head to complement his name (part of Gaara's name can be read as [...] "love").|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, {{with the exception of}} the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is happening to them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. [...] "The first episode is written in a way that you could never do a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in," [...] said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.|$|E

500|$|Hollywood-based Mark Garbarino was Chopra's makeup artist. At first, {{they wanted}} her to look exactly like Kom by using {{prosthetic}} makeup. Chopra did a prosthetic test in the United States which included heavier eyelids for a more East-Asian look. However, the final result did not appeal to the makers. Also, the prosthetic would not hold during filming of the heavy-action boxing scenes. It was later reported that Chopra's look would be created post production by using visual effects. However, the results were unsatisfactory and hence this idea was also dropped. Chopra said [...] "We tried a bunch of stuff – Visual effects, prosthetics, makeup, [...] it looked too gimmicky. That's when {{we decided to go}} with just carrying the essence of the film, rather than the outer, cosmetic part." [...] Later, Uday Shirali, Chopra's makeup artist since Agneepath (2012), was hired. For creating boxing scars, makeup artist Subhash Shinde was employed. His biggest challenges were to make the fight marks look as realistic as possible as it required {{a lot of time and}} detailing. He stated, [...] "Every punch or scar needed to look real, change colour and age with time on screen, and shouldn't look like they were created using makeup." [...] He did some research by visiting hospitals <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> about skin injuries.|$|E
500|$|Anime and manga {{publications}} {{have mostly}} praised Gaara's character. IGN noted that Gaara was an [...] "anti-Naruto", possessing a [...] "dark, solemn character" [...] {{as opposed to}} Naruto's continuous cheer and excitement. In another review, IGN also called Gaara's background [...] "emotional" [...] and [...] "a tad creepy" [...] due to the disparity between the development of Naruto's and Gaara's personalities. Anime News Network celebrated the [...] "depth and emotion" [...] that Naruto's and Gaara's similarities added to the plot, and commented that [...] "nowhere in the entire series run does Naruto shine brighter than in the peak period of his battle against Gaara". They also complimented Kishimoto's visual presentation of Gaara in the manga, referring to [...] "chilling [...] of Gaara's crazed, exposed face". Mania Entertainment noted that Gaara and Sasuke's first fight shows how the former has a [...] "fragile" [...] psyche despite his violent attitude. His backstory was also praised by Mania Entertainment since it includes [...] "a ton of legitimate emotion" [...] allowing viewers from the series <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>more</b> Gaara's personality. DVD Talk writer Todd Douglass Jr. enjoyed the similarities between Gaara and Naruto {{as well as the}} former's state after being defeated by the latter. His return to aid the Konohagakure ninjas to fight has been praised by Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime who was mostly focused on Gaara's change of hearts. Liam O'Brien, Gaara's voice actor in the English dubbed version of the anime, has been praised. IGN noted that he did an [...] "excellent job" [...] of making Gaara sound terrifying to the viewer, and Anime News Network noted him {{as one of the best}} voice actors in the series.|$|E

2500|$|In {{line with}} other writers {{of short stories}} of the time like Poe, Melville's {{narrative}} structures stimulate readers to look beyond their initial readings <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>more.</b> This view of [...] "the stories to have a hidden text" [...] {{has proven to be}} persuasieve. Writing in the twenty-first century, Bryant makes essentially the same point when he notes that [...] "carefully modulated ironies" [...] are put to such use that [...] "the brightness of sentiment and geniality would be made to reveal its darker edges: deception, sexuality, alienation, and poverty." ...|$|E
