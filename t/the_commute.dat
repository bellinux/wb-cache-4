5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during <b>the</b> <b>commute</b> to a 6am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E

California legislators wrote Assembly Bill 1853 in 1977 to allow local transit districts along the line to make bulk purchases of tickets for resale at a loss, subsidizing commuters reliant on the Peninsula Commute until 1980; more importantly, the bill also authorized the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to begin negotiating with SP to operate the passenger rail service and acquire the right-of-way between San Bruno and Daly City.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} year, Newlywed and Days wore down Password. CBS daytime head Fred Silverman, {{who was not}} a {{personal}} fan of the genre, had seen enough by Spring 1967 and decided to cancel Password. The cancellation occurred after squabbles over where the show would be taped (New York City or Hollywood). Silverman wanted the show permanently moved to CBS Television City (where it was moved for part of the 1966–1967 season to allow the show to tape in color, as CBS' New York studios had dragged out its full switch to colorization). Host Ludden had moved to California at that time, and commuted back to New York for {{the last part of the}} 1966–1967 season.
