5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E

5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, {{selegiline}} and rasagiline) {{increase the}} amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> but this was later disproven.|$|E

40|$|Background: An {{outbreak}} of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), comprising 185 cases linked to healthcare facilities, occurred in the Republic of Korea from May to July 2015. Owing to the nosocomial nature of the outbreak, it is particularly important {{to gain a better}} understanding of the epidemiological determinants characterizing <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> MERS <b>death</b> in order to predict <b>the</b> heterogeneous <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in medical settings. Methods: We have devised a novel statistical model that identifies <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> MERS <b>death</b> during <b>the</b> outbreak in real time. While accounting for the time delay from illness onset to death, risk factors for death were identified using a linear predictor tied to a logit model. We employ this approach to (1) quantify <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and (2) characterize the temporal evolution of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as case ascertainment greatly improved during the course of the outbreak. Results: Senior persons aged 60 years or over were found to be 9. 3 times (95 % confidence interval (CI), 5. 3 – 16. 9) more likely to die compared to younger MERS cases. Patients under treatment were at a 7. 8 -fold (95 % CI, 4. 0 – 16. 7) significantly higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> compared to other MERS cases. The CFR among patients aged 60 years or older under treatment was estimated at 48. 2 % (95 % CI, 35. 2 – 61. 3) as of July 31, 2015, while the CFR among other cases was estimated to lie below 15 %. From June 6, 2015, onwards, the CFR declined 0. 3 -fold (95 % CI, 0. 1 – 1. 1) compared to the earlier epidemic period, which may perhaps reflect enhanced case ascertainment following major contact tracing efforts. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> MERS <b>death</b> was significantly associated with older age as well as treatment for underlying diseases after explicitly adjusting for the delay between illness onset and death. Because MERS outbreaks are greatly amplified in the healthcare setting, enhanced infection control practices in medical facilities should strive to shield risk groups from MERS exposure...|$|R
