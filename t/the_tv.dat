5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> and the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This direction is used when <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output from <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E

5|$|Lake {{initially}} thought Microsoft was {{not particularly}} enthusiastic about the idea, but had accepted the pitch mainly because of Microsoft's vision of having Xbox One as an entertainment device with rich TV features at that time.

As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> show were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the bond between <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> show, composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.|$|E
