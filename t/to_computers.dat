5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades {{is a very}} delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began {{to be made in}} the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom, which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over <b>to</b> <b>computers,</b> and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access <b>to</b> <b>computers,</b> primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays. The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing. Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and compare the social skills of students addicted <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games with normal students. The dependent variable {{in the present study}} is the social skills. The study population included all the students in the second grade of public secondary school in the city of Isfahan at the educational year of 2009 - 2010. The sample size included 564 students selected using the cluster random sampling method. Data collection was conducted using Questionnaire of Addiction <b>to</b> <b>Computer</b> Games and Social Skills Questionnaire (The Teenage Inventory of Social Skill or TISS). The results of the study showed that generally, {{there was a significant difference}} between the social skills of students addicted <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games and normal students. In addition, the results indicated that normal students had a higher level of social skills in comparison with students addicted <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games. As the study results showed, addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games may affect the quality and quantity of social skills. In other words, the higher the addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games, the less the social skills. The individuals addicted <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games have less social skills...|$|R

Computer self-efficacy beliefs of the teacher candidates in this study were measured by a scale developed by Aşkar and Umay (2001). The academic achievement and introduction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> course scores of the teacher candidates were gathered from the Registrar’s office at Atatürk Teacher’s Academy. The mean scores of the computer self-efficacy beliefs of the male teacher candidates were higher, their academic achievement and introduction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> course scores were lower compared to the female teacher candidates. There was not any significant correlation among the teacher candidates’ computer self-efficacy beliefs with academic achievement and introduction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> course scores.

40|$|Abstract Background: Addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> (video) {{games in}} {{adolescents}} {{and its relationship}} with educational progress has recently {{attracted the attention of}} rearing and education experts as well as organizations and institutes involved in physical and mental health. The current research attempted to propose a structural model of the relationships between parenting styles, mothers’ occupation status, and addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games, self-control, and educational progress of secondary school students. Methods: Using multistage cluster random sampling, 500 female and male secondary school students in Kerman (Iran) were selected and studied. The research tools included self-control, parenting styles, and addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games questionnaires and a self-made questionnaire containing demographic details. The data was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and route analysis (in LISREL). Findings: We found self-control to have a linking role in the relationship between four parenting styles and educational progress. Mothers’ occupation status was directly and significantly correlated with addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games. Although four parenting styles directly and significantly affected addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games, the findings did not support the linking role of addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games in the relationship between four parenting styles and educational progress. Conclusion: In agreement with previous studies, the current research reflected the impact of four parenting styles on self-control, addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games, and educational progress of students. Among the parenting styles, authoritative style can affect the severity of addiction <b>to</b> <b>computer</b> games through self-control development. It can thus indirectly influence the educational progress of students. Parents are recommended to use authoritative parenting style to help both self-management and psychological health of their children. The employed mothers are also recommended to have more supervision and control on the degree and type of computer games selected by their children...|$|R

25|$|Within lexical semantics, {{especially}} as applied <b>to</b> <b>computers,</b> modeling word meaning is easier when a given word is {{understood in terms}} of related words; semantic networks are therefore important in computational linguistics. Still, other methods in phonology (e.g. optimality theory, which uses lattice graphs) and morphology (e.g. finite-state morphology, using finite-state transducers) are common in the analysis of language as a graph. Indeed, the usefulness of this area of mathematics to linguistics has borne organizations such as , as well as various 'Net' projects, such as WordNet, VerbNet, and others.|$|E
