5|$|The {{race was}} planned {{to begin at}} 2:30 AM local time by the organizers, but due to large crowds and some {{participants}} arriving late, the race officially started at 2:43. The riders formed three groups on the road, of which the first one contained twenty riders when it passed through <b>the</b> <b>checkpoint</b> in Brescia. The group further thinned to sixteen {{by the time it}} reached Verona, and to eleven when it arrived at <b>the</b> <b>checkpoint</b> in Vicenza. From the group, the sprint to the finish line was mainly contested by Giovanni Micheletto and Giuseppe Santhià, of which the former managed to win the leg. With Atala-Dunlop's Micheletto winning the stage and his teammate Carlo Galetti finishing third, Atala-Dunlop acquired seven points and the lead in the race.|$|E

During the Aktion on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes– which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16– were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary.

5|$|Opinions on the game's mid-level {{checkpoint}} {{system were}} mixed.

5|$|After DNA damage, {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle {{and gives the}} cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting <b>the</b> <b>checkpoint</b> activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{sets out}} to present the {{integration}} of the scheduling of deadline-constrained checkpointing in a batch scheduler for dynamic environments such as virtual clusters. <b>The</b> <b>checkpointing</b> scheduler implemented focuses on <b>the</b> parallel <b>checkpointing</b> on a unique server of long-running independent applications in a virtual cluster made up of free resources for long periods of an intranet network, assuming that the resources must be released within a delay T. As parallel checkpointing on a unique server can face bandwidth constraints, <b>the</b> <b>checkpointing</b> scheduler uses a func tion that gives the aggregated bandwidth suitable for <b>the</b> parallel <b>checkpointing</b> of m applications of aggregated size V to solve <b>the</b> deadline-constrained <b>checkpointing</b> problem within <b>the</b> deadline T. Specifically, we present the integration of <b>the</b> <b>checkpointing</b> scheduler in <b>the</b> batch scheduler OAR. This implementation uses data from the OAR database for <b>the</b> <b>checkpointing</b> scheduling. It is portable and can be easily modified to interact with any other batch scheduler, provided that the structure of the database is known and an estimator of the bandwidth of the system suitable for parallel checkpointing available. Experimental results obtained on a virtual cluster built on GRID 5000 show that the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>checkpointing</b> scheduler does not induce a significant overhead on checkpointing mechanisms.

40|$|A "consistent checkpointing" {{algorithm}} saves {{a consistent}} {{view of the}} distributed system state on stable storage. The loss of computation upon a failure can be bounded by taking consistent checkpoints with adequate frequency. <b>The</b> traditional consistent <b>checkpointing</b> algorithms require <b>the</b> different processes to save their state {{at about the same}} time.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport. At 07:15, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, {{arriving}} at the passenger security checkpoint {{a few minutes later}} at 07:18.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new checkpointing coordination scheme which utilizes the communication {{pattern of the}} cooperating processes.

5|$|Midtown Madness {{features}} 4 single-player modes: Blitz, Circuit, Checkpoint, and Cruise.

The Circuit mode curtains off most of the city to resemble race tracks and pits the player against other cars. <b>The</b> <b>Checkpoint</b> mode combines the features of Blitz and Circuit has the player race against other cars to a destination—but also adds the complication of other traffic, such as police cars and pedestrians. In the Cruise mode, the player can simply explore the city at their own pace. All of these modes except Cruise are divided into missions; completing one unlocks the next. Environmental conditions that traverse all modes include weather (sunny, rainy, cloudy, and snowy), time of day (sunrise, afternoon, sunset, and night-time), and the density of pedestrians, traffic, and police vehicles. The heads-up display includes, alongside information about the race, a detailed map, but this display can be turned off.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, <b>the</b> <b>checkpoint</b> and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E
40|$|Checkpointing {{algorithms}} {{are classified}} as synchronous and asynchronous in the literature. In synchronous checkpointing, processes synchronize their checkpointing activities so that a globally consistent set of checkpoints is always maintained in <b>the</b> system.

In asynchronous checkpointing, processes take checkpoints without any coordination with others. Asynchronous checkpointing provides maximum autonomy for processes to take checkpoints; however, some of <b>the</b> <b>checkpoints</b> taken may not lie on any consistent global <b>checkpoint,</b> thus making <b>the</b> <b>checkpointing</b> efforts useless.
