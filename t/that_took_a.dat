5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> long time to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E

5|$|Arévalo's {{response}} {{toward the}} non-communist unions was mixed. In 1945, he criminalized all rural labor unions in workplaces {{with fewer than}} 500 workers, which included most plantations. One of the few unions big enough to survive this law was of the banana workers employed by the UFC. In 1946 this union organized a strike, which provoked Arévalo into outlawing all strikes until a new labor code was passed. This led to efforts {{on the part of}} employers to stall the labor code, as well as to exploit workers as far as possible before it was passed. The unions were also damaged when the US government persuaded the American Federation of Labor to found the Organización Regional Internacional del Trabajo (ORIT), a union <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> virulently anti-communist stance.|$|E
5|$|Butch {{women were}} not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were {{pervasive}} and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further identified {{members of a group}} that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E
5|$|The CLR's {{ability to}} manage its high {{passenger}} numbers was constrained by the service interval that it could achieve between trains. This was {{directly related to the}} time taken to turn around trains at the termini. At the end of a journey, a locomotive had to be disconnected from the leading end of the train and run around to the rear, where it was reconnected before proceeding in the opposite direction; an exercise <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> minimum of 2½minutes. Seeking to shorten this interval, the CLR published a bill in November 1900 for the 1901 parliamentary session. The bill requested permission to construct loops {{at each end of the}} line so that trains could be turned around without disconnecting the locomotive. The loop at the western end was planned to run anti-clockwise under the three sides of Shepherd's Bush Green. For the eastern loop the alternatives were a loop under Liverpool Street station or a larger loop running under Threadneedle Street, Old Broad Street, Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and returning to Threadneedle Street. The estimated cost of the loops was £800,000 (approximately £ today), most of which was for the eastern loop with its costly wayleaves.|$|E

5|$|Though Lavender {{seemed to}} pitch well {{to begin the}} 1916season, his record of 1–6though June10 was a direct {{contrast}} to his low 2.89ERA. In his next start, against the Giants on June14, he allowed only an infield single to Benny Kauff. The New York Sun noted that Kauff's single was {{as a result of}} a ground ball <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> bad hop and bounced away from the fielder. Lavender continued to pitch well throughout the season, both starting and in relief, culminating with a complete game shutout against Pittsburgh on September9, his fourth shutout of the season. However, in his last four appearances, he was credited with the loss in three, and his ERA rose from 2.05 to 2.83. His season win–loss record was 10–14 in 36 games and 188innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic eruptions {{vary widely}} in strength. On the one extreme there are effusive Hawaiian eruptions, which are {{characterized}} by lava fountains and fluid lava flows, which are typically not very dangerous. On the other extreme, Plinian eruptions are large, violent, and highly dangerous explosive events. Volcanoes are not bound to one eruptive style, and frequently display many different types, both passive and explosive, even {{in the span of}} a single eruptive cycle. Volcanoes do not always erupt vertically from a single crater near their peak, either. Some volcanoes exhibit lateral and fissure eruptions. Notably, many Hawaiian eruptions start from rift zones, and some of the strongest Surtseyan eruptions develop along fracture zones. Scientists believed that pulses of magma mixed together in the chamber before climbing upward—a process estimated to take several thousands of years. But Columbia University volcanologists found that the eruption of Costa Rica’s Irazú Volcano in 1963 was likely triggered by magma <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> nonstop route from the mantle over just a few months.|$|E

25|$|Like many CPUs of its era {{the cycle}} timing of some {{instructions}} varied {{depending on the}} source operand(s).

To create a function <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> fixed cycle count required the addition of extra code after the multiply instruction. This would typically consume extra cycles for each bit that wasn't set in the original multiplication operand.|$|E

25|$|The Phillies were 47–58, 15 {{games behind}} the first-place Nationals, and 10 games behind the second wild card after their {{series against the}} Nationals on August 2. The Phillies started the month by taking 2 of 3 from the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game 3 victory was huge for Ryan Howard, who had {{struggled}} since coming off his injury. After getting booed by striking out when the game was tied in the 8th inning {{with the bases loaded}}, Ryan Howard came through by hitting an RBI single with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to win the game and the series. The victory also put them out of last place in the NL East {{for the first time since}} June 27. The Phillies then took 1 of 3 from the Braves, a team that they got swept by in the past 2 series. In game 1 of the series, the Phillies saw their sellout streak end when the Phillies did not have a sell-out crowd. This ended their streak at 257 games, the third-longest sellout streak in MLB history. The Phillies then took 2 of 3 from the St. Louis Cardinals and came back from 3 runs down to win game 3 in extra innings. The Phillies then also took 2 of 3 from the Miami Marlins. The Phillies then split the series at 2–2 against the Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds. After their game 4 win against the Reds, the Phillies moved up to third place in the division for the first time since April 12. The Phillies then pulled off a three-game sweep of the Nationals, marking their second three-game sweep of the season. The Phillies would however take just 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. To finish the month, the Phillies would pull off a comeback win against the Braves in game 1 on August 31. The Phillies ended up taking 2 of 3 from that series. They could have swept the series, but the Phillies blew a 7–3 lead in the bottom of the 9th inning in game 3. The Phillies finished August by going 17-12, their best month of the season overall so far. However, Carlos Ruiz, who had been the star of the Phillies with his remarkable performance this season, had to sit out for 4–6 weeks because of a fractured knee <b>that</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> beating throughout the month. Ruiz was replaced by Erik Kratz due to catcher Brian Schneider also suffering an injury. This month also saw a huge improvement by Kyle Kendrick. After Charlie Manuel got really disappointed in an awful outing by Kyle in a 12-6 loss when he allowed 6 runs, he has been the hottest Phillies's pitcher since. Right away in his next outing, he shut the Miami Marlins out, allowing no runs. He did the same in his next outing against a normally strong Milwaukee Brewers offense. Although in his next outing Kyle allowed a 2-run home run against the Washington Nationals, Kendrick received his 3rd win in a row when the Phillies won 4-2. Kendrick picked up his fourth win in a row when the Phillies won 3-2 against the New York Mets.|$|E
