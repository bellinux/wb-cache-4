The effects of such an alignment had been debated for some time, with studies both linking conjunction to several major earthquakes and debunking the theory entirely. Several similar alignments have occurred in the past without resulting in any additional natural activity on Earth. The predicted conjunction did occur in May 2000, with no consequence on Earth.|$|E

Other protected ecological sites include the mangrove forests of Pichavaram in Tamil Nadu, the backwaters of Pulicat lake in Tamil Nadu and Vembanad, Ashtamudi, Paravur and Kayamkulam lakes in Kerala. The Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 10,500km² of ocean, islands and the adjoining coastline including coral reefs, salt marshes and mangroves.

The result of this research shows that, <b>the</b> coordinate <b>conjunctions</b> found are and, but, or, for, so and still. Meanwhile <b>the</b> subordinate <b>conjunctions</b> found are where, when, that, before, how, as long as, as soon as, since, if, because, while, until, than, once, and as. Coordinate conjunctions connect words, phrases, clauses, and sentences. Meanwhile subordinate conjunctions connect clauses as in the concept. Besides, <b>the</b> subordinate <b>conjunctions</b> found also connect phrase and clause, and clause and sentence where these two things are not appropriate with the concept used, and the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>conjunctions</b> are fit to the concept...|$|R

English reason clauses are subsumed {{under the category}} of subordinate clauses and as such they accompany matrix clauses in the complex sentences.

The main aim of the present work is the analysis of English reason clauses {{introduced by}} <b>the</b> <b>conjunctions</b> since and as in terms of their position and the semantic relationship between them and their matrix clauses. For the purpose of the latter, also their syntactic functions are studied. Furthermore, the analysis is concerned with the factors which may be influential in the choice of the position of reason clauses. The analysis is performed on one hundred examples of English reason clauses introduced by <b>the</b> <b>conjunctions</b> since and as (50 examples introduced by since and 50 by as) that have been extracted from the works of prose by the means of the British National Corpus...|$|R
