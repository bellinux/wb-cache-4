40|$|After {{several decades}} of {{research}} on phraseology, {{one of the most}} controversial topics of this multi-faceted discipline remains the borderline between ordinary constructions (what John Sinclair called the open-choice principle) and phraseology (Sinclair's idiom principle).

The criterion of frequency might be invoked, but then you would have to conclude that 'take the third exit' is also a set phrase, because it is particularly frequent (on the Web at least). And what do you do with other borderline cases such as <b>take</b> <b>the</b> form, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> time, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> lead, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> necessary action, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> offensive, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> risk, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> same approach, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> train to, etc. ?
