5|$|In Japan, kitsunetsuki {{was noted}} {{as a disease}} {{as early as the}} Heian period and {{remained}} a common diagnosis for mental illness until the early 20th century. Possession was <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Dr. Shunichi Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered kitsunetsuki. The belief has lost favor, but stories of fox possession still occur, such as allegations that members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult had been possessed.|$|E
5|$|The Dwarfie Stane tomb on {{the island}} of Hoy is made from a single huge block of red {{sandstone}} with a hollowed-out central chamber. This style is quite unlike any other Neolithic Orkney site and probably dates from about 2500 BC. It was the first Orcadian ancient monument to be described in writing, appearing in the 16th century Descriptio Insularum Orchadiarum by Joannem Ben who provided <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> its existence as having been built and used by giants.|$|E

It claims that the green represented the hope of the Portuguese people, while the red represented the blood of those who died serving the nation. Sources believe these noble meanings are far from the truth and are nothing more than propaganda, to provide an honourable justification to their choice.|$|E

5|$|Producers Avi Arad and Gale Anne Hurd {{started the}} {{development}} for Hulk in 1990, {{the same year}} the final TV movie based on the 1970s TV series aired. They set the property up at Universal Pictures in 1992. Michael France and Stan Lee were invited into Universal's offices in 1994, with France writing the script. Universal's concept {{was to have the}} Hulk battle terrorists, an idea France disliked. John Turman, a Hulk comic book fan, was brought to write the script in 1995, getting approval from Lee. Turman wrote ten drafts and was heavily influenced by the Tales to Astonish issues, which pitted the Hulk against General Ross and the military, the Leader, Rick Jones, the atomic explosion origin from the comics, and Brian Banner as <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> Bruce's inner anger. Universal had mixed feelings over Turman's script, but nonetheless future screenwriters would use many elements.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance left {{a legacy}} across {{intellectual}} fields including poetry, historical writing and architecture, which {{continued into the}} seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. A growing number of Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing confidence in their own literature. Part of <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> the sudden flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment, is that the country already had a history of achievements in philosophy, poetry, music, mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe. From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine, law, philosophy, geology and history. Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, {{and the amount of}} deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the whole number rule. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.|$|E

5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a bit too much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of defender Sol Campbell and retirement of striker Dennis Bergkamp {{in the summer of}} 2006, Gilberto was announced as Arsenal's vice-captain for the 2006–07 season. He began the season well, as he scored the first ever goal at the Dutch DSB Stadion in a pre-season friendly match. He then scored Arsenal's first ever goal in a competitive match at the Emirates Stadium in a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa. His good form continued for Arsenal as he scored several league goals, garnering praise for his performances as stand-in captain while Thierry Henry was injured. Gilberto and his agent (Paulo Villana) also reiterated the player's desire to honour his contract with the Gunners. Meanwhile, Gilberto's good form carried through to {{the second half of the}} season. Even though Arsenal only managed to finish fourth in the league, he ended the season as Arsenal's second highest scorer with 10 Premier League goals. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> his unusually high tally is the fact that Henry suffered two lengthy injury spells, in which Gilberto stepped up as captain to take penalties. Gilberto's goal scoring record combined with his own good form in midfield and his leadership of Wenger's youthful squad led some Arsenal fans and football pundits to label Gilberto as Arsenal's best player of the season, and one of the best in the Premier League.|$|E

The Cabinet also refused offers of food shipments from several different nations. When such shipments did begin to increase modestly in late 1943, the transport and storage facilities were understaffed and inadequate.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that, {{just like the}} cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation left over from the Big Bang, there is a background of low-energy neutrinos in our Universe.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to most intestinal helminthiases, where the heaviest parasitic loads tend {{to occur in}} children, hookworm prevalence and intensity can be higher among adult males. <b>The</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> this is that hookworm infection tends to be occupational, so that coworkers and other close groups maintain a high prevalence of infection among themselves by contaminating their work environment. However, in most endemic areas, adult women are the most severely affected by anemia, mainly because they have much higher physiological needs for iron (menstruation, repeated pregnancy).|$|E

25|$|It is {{interesting}} that the Court of Chancery was acting, here, in its most ancient role, that of a court of conscience. This entailed the moral law applied to prevent peril to {{the soul of the}} wrongdoer through mortal sin. The remedy was given to the plaintiff (the Crown, in this case) to look after the wrongdoer's soul; the benefit to the plaintiff was only incidental. This is also <b>the</b> <b>explanation</b> <b>for</b> specific performance, which compels the sinner to put matters right. The whole conception is mediæval in origin.|$|E
25|$|The asset flow {{equations}} {{have been}} used to study the formation of bubbles from a different standpoint in where it was shown that a stable equilibrium could become unstable with the influx of additional cash or the change to a shorter time scale {{on the part of the}} momentum investors.
