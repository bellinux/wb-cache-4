40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect that listening to recordings of <b>their</b> own <b>performances</b> has on piano performers. Music students, majoring in piano performance, each played while <b>their</b> <b>performances</b> were recorded. They then marked their scores with a pencil, while listening to their recordings, indicating the differences between what they focused on while playing versus what they listened for in their recordings. They were requested to express their feelings about listening to their recordings after they performed twice. The results showed that performers considered <b>their</b> <b>performances</b> were improved by listening to their recordings. On the other hand, some aspects of <b>their</b> <b>performances</b> did not improve because they were too aware of imperfections. As performers recognized <b>their</b> <b>performances</b> by listening to their recordings, they found solutions to problems about <b>their</b> <b>performances</b> through trial and error...|$|R
