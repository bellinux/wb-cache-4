T. to get information on Beauty of Nature's deal with a Japanese department store, he lets Ashley in on his and her brother Jack's (Peter Bergman) plans to obtain Beauty of Nature. Ashley and Tucker go to Japan and discover Victor's daughter, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), bribing the Japanese Minister of Zoning with an antique gun. They commiserate over how their mother's abandoned them and make love for the first time. However, Ashley still {{wants to be with}} Neil and Tucker decides to give her some space. When Neil breaks up with Ashley, Tucker tries to cheer her up. With help from Jill, Tucker and Ashley confront Victor about Victoria bribing the Japanese official with the antique gun. However, Ashley decides against turning Victor into <b>the</b> <b>feds</b> to protect the company and her daughter, and Tucker agrees to obtain Beauty of Nature another way. Tucker supports Ashley when she must testify against Adam and helps Ashley get past her insecurities about their relationship as well her ability to work as CEO. Tucker goes ahead with his plan, and makes Jack co-CEO despite their plans for BON being stalled and they discuss using Abby to get to Victor. Despite being rejected by her family, Tucker supports Katherine when her great-grandson Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll) is presumed dead. Meanwhile, Katherine warns Tucker that she will back Victor in Abby's lawsuit and Abby becomes suspicious of Tucker when she sees him comforting Jill due Katherine cutting both of them out when her husband, Murphy (Michael Fairman), is hospitalized. Tucker is about to hire Diane Jenkins (Maura West) and they end up sleeping together; however he changes his mind when he learns that Diane lied about her previous job. Victoria reveals that she is pursuing Beauty of Nature in the lawsuit and she promises to sell it to him, on the condition that she is the CEO of the newly merged cosmetics company. Tucker buys Abby a horse for her birthday, her parents disapprove and he and Ashley get engaged on Christmas Eve.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates whether <b>the</b> Federal Reserve's (<b>Fed's)</b> private Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecasts, as {{reported}} in the Greenbook of the Fed, contain information about future real and excess stock returns. I implement long-horizon regressions to analyse the predictive power of <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> GDP growth forecasts. The regressions conclude that <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> GDP growth forecasts can be used to predict long- and short-term stock returns. The size of the coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> orthogonal GDP growth forecast indicates that 1 % increase in <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> forecast predicts 2 - 4 % decrease in real and excess stock returns. The regressions considering the size effect suggest that the predictive power of <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> GDP growth forecasts increases as the size of the portfolio decreases. A comparison of <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> forecasts and <b>the</b> commercial forecasts shows that <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> GDP growth forecasts contain information that does not exist in the commercial forecasts. I investigate the sources of <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> superior private information and predictive power. Analysis suggests that the source of the predictive power of <b>the</b> <b>Fed's</b> GDP growth forecasts is the private information about future surprise monetary policy actions embedded in them. ...|$|R
40|$|To make {{financial}} conditions {{more supportive of}} economic growth, the Federal Reserve has purchased large amounts of longer-term securities in recent years. <b>The</b> <b>Fed’s</b> resulting securities portfolio has generated substantial income but may incur financial losses when market interest rates rise. Such interest rate risk appears modest, especially relative to <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> policy objectives of full employment and price stability. In {{the midst of the}} recent financial and economic crisis, with short-term nominal interest rates essentially lowered to zero, the Federal Reserve started expanding its portfolio of longer-term securities in order to spur economic growth, reduce unemployment, and avoid deflation. However, <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> purchases of longer-term securities have been controversial, {{in part because of the}} associated interest rate risk, including the possibility that increases in interest rates will cause the market value of <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> portfolio to fall. For example, former Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin (2010) argued that “major holdings of long-term securities expose <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> balance sheet to potentially large losses if interest rates rise. Such losses would result in severe criticism of the Fed and a weakening of its independence. ” This Economic Letter provides a financial assessment of <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> interest rate risk and places that risk in the context of <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> macroeconomic goals for monetary policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is twofold. First, we {{characterize}} <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> systematic response to technology shocks and its implications for U.

Second, we evaluate the extent to which those responses can be accounted for by a simple monetary policy rule (including the optimal one) {{in the context of a}} standard business cycle model with sticky prices. Our main results can be described as follows: First, we detect significant differences across periods in the response of the economy (as well as <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s)</b> to a technology shock. Second, <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> response to a technology shock in the Volcker– Greenspan period is consistent with an optimal monetary policy rule. Third, in the Pre-Volcker period <b>the</b> <b>Fed’s</b> policy tended to overstabilize output at the cost of generating excessive inflation volatility.
