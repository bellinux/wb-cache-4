5|$|The {{origins of}} Emilia can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} wave that crossed northern Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 16. The system moved westward, developing a well-defined {{low pressure area}} about 525miles (850km) southwest of Acapulco by July 19. The next day, its forward motion had shifted to a slow north-northwest track, and with its convection continuing to organize around the low, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked on the potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Early on July 21, its thunderstorm activity organized enough for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Six-E, located to the southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|The Tu-70 was {{completed}} in October 1946, but did not make its first flight until 27 November. It began manufacturer's trials in October, but an engine fire on the fourth flight caused it to make a crash-landing. This was <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> design defect in the American-built supercharger-control system, but identifying the problem and fixing it prolonged the manufacturer's trials through October 1947. It was redesignated as the Tu-70 when it went through the State acceptance trials which ended on 14 December. It met all the design goals, but was not accepted for production as all the factories were already committed to building aircraft with a higher priority and Aeroflot had no requirement for the type, being fully satisfied with its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 airliners.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Tropical Storm Nicholas can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on October 9. It moved westward, and developed a broad area of low pressure along the wave on October 10. Convection organized around the low early on October 12 while located 800miles (1300km) southwest of the Cape Verde islands. As upper level winds became more favorable, the system became better organized, though the circulation center initially remained located {{to the west of the}} area of heavy showers. The surface circulation of the large circulation envelope moved towards a position near the western edge of the deepest convection, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Nineteen late on October 13 while located 1,030miles (1,660km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Barry can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} wave which moved off the western coast of Africa on August13, 1983. Strong wind shear in the North Atlantic hurricane basin prevented significant {{development of the}} system as it traveled towards the west-northwest. Little convection {{was associated with the}} disturbance {{as a result of the}} shear. While approaching the Bahamas on August22, an upper-level trough moved away from the system, which led to a decrease in the wind shear. The disturbance then entered this environment and spawned an area of low pressure which intensified. On August23, the low had become sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Four. Later that day, the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name Barry by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). About 12hours after becoming a tropical storm, Barry reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h).|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Cindy can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August8, 1993. Over the following days, the wave tracked steadily west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic while retaining a distinct cloud pattern on satellite images. Although initial {{data from a}} reconnaissance aircraft mission on August13 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation, a second mission at 12:00UTC the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at {{the lower levels of}} the atmosphere. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a tropical depressiona tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than 39mph (62km/h)and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the 2001 India cyclone can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} disturbance over the Arabian Sea on May18. The following day, the system {{was determined to be}} relatively stationary near the island of Socotra. Although deep convection was associated with the disturbance, {{there was no evidence of}} a low-level circulation. By May20, the disturbance slowly moved towards the southeast in response to an upper-level trough over India. The overall structure gradually improved as good outflow developed. A mid-level circulation finally developed late on May21, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Several hours later, they began monitoring the system as a tropical depression with the identifier 01A; however, operational advisories were not issued until the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm intensity. By the morning of May22, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) also took notice of the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the system can be <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} depression roughly midway between the Lesser Antilles and {{the west coast of}} Africa at 1800 UTC on September 7. Though initially believed to have developed on September 11, the disturbance was found to have formed earlier in post-season reanalysis, based on data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set. In its early developmental stages, the disturbance remained a tropical depression with little change in intensity. At 0600UTC on September10, it intensified into a tropical storm while still east of the Lesser Antilles. Closer to the islands, ships reported a quickly intensifying tropical cyclone with low barometric pressures, strong winds and heavy thunderstorms, although most of the activity occurred to the east of its center.|$|E
5|$|On {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of November 7, an area of disturbed weather organized to a tropical depression 60miles (100km) east of Atlántico Norte, Nicaragua. Its origins were <b>traced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tropical wave that originated over western Africa on October 26. Atmospheric conditions resembled an early fall pattern, and a large ridge was situated over the Gulf of Mexico and Southwestern United States. The depression moved northward into the Caribbean Sea, and the environment supported further development. On November 9, the depression strengthened to a 40mph (65km/h) tropical storm and was given the name Jeanne. Later, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft reported a strengthening system; maximum sustained winds increased to 50mph (80km/h), and a minimum pressure of 999 mbar was measured. The tropical cyclone moved northward into the southern Gulf of Mexico on November 10. Jeanne's northward movement was blocked by the ridge, and the cyclone slowly turned to the west. On November 11, Jeanne quickly intensified to a minimal hurricane; later, it attained its peak intensity of 100mph (155km/h).|$|E
