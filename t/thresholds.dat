40|$|We use {{the term}} "renal <b>threshold</b> for hemoglobin" to {{indicate}} the smallest amount of hemoglobin which given intravenously will effect the appearance of recognizable hemoglobin in the urine. The initial renal <b>threshold</b> level for dog hemoglobin is established by the methods employed at an average value of 155 mg. hemoglobin per kilo body weight with maximal values of 210 and minimal of 124. Repeated daily injections of hemoglobin will depress this initial renal <b>threshold</b> level on the average 46 per cent with maximal values of 110 and minimal values of 60 mg. hemoglobin per kilo body weight.

40|$|Summary. A <b>thresholding</b> {{approach}} that performs <b>thresholding</b> stage by stage on grey scale images is discussed. The ability to exploit various {{information from the}} image to assist the assignment of a <b>threshold</b> level {{is central to the}} multi-stage approach. Thus it is better suited to images that have consistent characteristics as encountered in specific applications. In the traditional global <b>thresholding</b> approach, one <b>threshold</b> value is produced in a single stage to separate an object from its background in an image. In the multi-stage global <b>thresholding</b> approach, each stage in the <b>thresholding</b> uses various information from the image to narrow the search space until the last stage selects the single <b>threshold</b> value. In the traditional local (adaptive) <b>thresholding</b> approach, <b>thresholding</b> is performed in one pass using local information obtained from the image. In the multi-stage local <b>thresholding</b> approach, <b>thresholding</b> is performed in several passes (stages) using different information from the image at each stage. Two examples taken from the literature, Quadratic Integral Ratio, which was designed by the authors to <b>threshold</b> handwriting images and Chi and Yan’s technique, which was designed to <b>threshold</b> map images, are used to demonstrate how this approach can be used in specific applications, producing better results compared to traditional <b>thresholding</b> techniques. The multi-stage <b>thresholding</b> approach will be useful in promoting the invention of new high performance application-specific <b>thresholding</b> techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Interesting {{signals are}} often {{contaminated}} by heavy-tailed noise {{that has more}} outliers than Gaussian noise. Under the introduction of probability model for heavy-tailed noises, a robust wavelet <b>threshold</b> based on the minimax description length principle is derived in the ε-contaminated normal family for maximizing the entropy. The performance and their measurement criterion for the robust wavelet <b>threshold</b> are studied in this paper. By the proposed performance measurement criterion, several kinds of noisy signals are processed with the wavelet <b>thresholding</b> techniques. Compared with classical <b>threshold</b> based on Gaussian assumption, the robust <b>threshold</b> can eliminate the heavy-tailed noise better, even if the precise value of ε is unknown, which shows its robustness. The further experiment shows that soft <b>threshold</b> is more suitable than hard <b>threshold</b> for robust wavelet <b>threshold</b> technique. Finally, the robust <b>threshold</b> technique is applied to denoise the practically measured gas sensor dynamic signals. Results show its good performances.

30|$|<b>Thresholding</b> {{methods are}} {{alternative}} {{approaches to the}} denoising problem. The <b>thresholding</b> problem is first formulated in [7] where VisuShrink is introduced. This <b>threshold</b> is a nonadaptive universal <b>threshold</b> and depends only {{on the number of}} data points and noise variance. VisuShrink is a wavelet <b>thresholding</b> method which is both simple and effective in comparison with other denoising techniques. When an orthogonal wavelet basis is used, the coefficients with small absolute values tend to be attributed to the additive noise. Taking advantage of this property, finding a proper <b>threshold,</b> and setting all absolute values of coefficients smaller than the <b>threshold</b> to zero can suppress the noise. The main issue in such approaches is to find a proper <b>threshold.</b> In using the <b>thresholding</b> method for image denoising, the visual quality of the image is of great concern. An improper <b>threshold</b> may introduce artifacts and cause blurring of the image. One of the first soft <b>thresholding</b> methods is SureShrink [8] which has a better effect on the image than Visushrink in many cases. This method uses a hybrid of the universal <b>threshold</b> and the SURE (Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator) <b>threshold.</b> The SURE <b>threshold</b> is chosen by minimizing Stein's estimate.|$|R
