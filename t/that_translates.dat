40|$|Convergence and {{simplification}} {{are two of}} {{the so-called}} universals in translation studies.

25|$|A {{compiler}} is {{a computer}} program <b>that</b> <b>translates</b> one computer language into another. To improve the execution time of the resulting code, one of the techniques of compiler optimization is register allocation, where {{the most frequently used}} values of the compiled program are kept in the fast processor registers. Ideally, values are assigned to registers so that they can all reside in the registers when they are used.|$|E
25|$|Only a week later, {{rates were}} doubled and 5,000 each of newly issued stamps were hand-stamped in pairs {{with the new}} values of 6h (blue), 10h (red), and 24h (green). The 6h and 24h values used a red hand-stamp, while the 10h value used a violet hand-stamp. Hand-stamp values using {{incorrect}} colors {{have been identified as}} forgeries. The hand-stamps read 6, 10, or 24 halerzy, which is the genitive declension of the Polish word halerz <b>that</b> <b>translates</b> to heller in English.|$|E
30|$|Before porting can occur, {{a hidden}} module must be modularized {{to have at}} least two submodules: one “interior” and one “exterior.” The “exterior” parts of the ported module’s design must then {{translate}} information from the external system into data usable by the interior sections, and vice versa. The design rules of the surrounding system and of the ported module are both equally visible to these translator modules. As their name suggests, then, translator modules are a special type of hidden module, whose role is to convert one system’s information into a form usable in another system. Examples of translator modules include (1) compilers <b>that</b> <b>translate</b> high-level languages into machine instructions; (2) printer drivers <b>that</b> <b>translate</b> machine commands into printer commands; and (3) read-only-memory instruction sets <b>that</b> <b>translate</b> machine instructions into microcode.

25|$|Wikis {{can also}} make WYSIWYG editing {{available}} to users, usually by means of JavaScript control <b>that</b> <b>translates</b> graphically entered formatting instructions into the corresponding HTML tags or wikitext. In those implementations, the markup of a newly edited, marked-up version of the page is generated and submitted to the server transparently, shielding the user from this technical detail. An {{example of this is}} the VisualEditor on Wikipedia. However, WYSIWYG controls do not always provide all of the features available in wikitext, and some users prefer not to use a WYSIWYG editor. Hence, many of these sites offer some means to edit the wikitext directly.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1950s, {{electronic}} music and electronic visual art have co-existed in the same digital medium (Campen 2007, Collopy 2000, Jewanski & Sidler 2006, Moritz 2003). Since that time, the interaction of these fields of art has increased tremendously. Nowadays, students of art and music have digital software at their disposal that uses both musical and visual imagery. Given the capability of the Internet to publish and share digital productions, {{this has led to}} an enormous avalanche of synesthesia-inspired art on the Internet (Campen 2007) (cf. website RhythmicLight.com on the history of visual music). For instance, Stephen Malinowski and Lisa Turetsky from Berkeley, California wrote a software program, entitled the , <b>that</b> <b>translates</b> and shows music pieces in colored measures.|$|E
25|$|Tactile imaging is {{a medical}} imaging {{modality}} <b>that</b> <b>translates</b> the sense of touch into a digital image. The tactile image {{is a function of}} P(x,y,z), where P is the pressure on soft tissue surface under applied deformation and x,y,z are coordinates where pressure P was measured. Tactile imaging closely mimics manual palpation, since the probe of the device with a pressure sensor array mounted on its face acts similar to human fingers during clinical examination, slightly deforming soft tissue by the probe and detecting resulting changes in the pressure pattern. Figure on the right presents an experiment on a composite tissue phantom examined by a tactile imaging probe illustrating the ability of tactile imaging to visualize in 3D the structure of the object.|$|E

25|$|Some items, such as {{clothes and}} children's toys, often become {{unwanted}} before they wear out due {{to changes in}} their owner's needs or preferences; these can be reused by selling or giving them to new owners. Regiving can take place informally between family, friends, or neighbours, through environmental freecycling organisations or through anti-poverty charities such as the Red Cross, United Way, Salvation Army, and Goodwill which give these items to {{those who could not}} afford them new. Other organizations such as iLoveSchools have websites where both new and used goods can be offered to any of America's school teachers so their life can be extended and help schoolchildren. The average American, for example, throws away 67.9 pounds of used clothing and rags. With the U.S. population at approximately 296 million people, <b>that</b> <b>translates</b> into 20 billion pounds of used clothing and textiles that are tossed into the landfills each year. This has partly motivated movements such as The Compact, whose members promise not to buy anything new for a year, and rely on reusing items that otherwise would be thrown away. Reuse not only reduces landfill inline with the waste minimization program but can help raise money for a good cause.|$|E
