5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. <b>The</b> <b>alien</b> creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> finding the player. For example, if <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract <b>the</b> <b>alien,</b> forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether <b>the</b> <b>alien</b> creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
