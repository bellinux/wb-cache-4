Cynthia White, a prostitute, testified that Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner.

5|$|March {{was more}} {{successful}} in selling large numbers of customer cars in the lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season, rather than buying them outright. Losing money on a deal to supply Jochen Neerpasch, then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula <b>Two</b> <b>car</b> paid off when Neerpasch moved to BMW and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW's Formula Two engine for the 1973 season. March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships. However, BMW also put pressure on Herd {{to concentrate on the}} Formula Two programme. As a result, he spent less time with the Formula One team, where Mosley started to act as a race engineer.|$|E

50|$|In {{the course}} of analogical reasoning, figurative analogies become weak if the disanalogies of the {{entities}} being compared are relevant—in {{the same way that}} literal analogies become weak.
