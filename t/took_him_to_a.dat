The plane caught fire, and Cooper spun the plane to suck the flames out. Cooper survived, {{although}} he suffered burns, injured his hands, and was presumed dead. German soldiers saw his plane's incredible landing and <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prisoner reserve hospital.|$|E

Little is known of Thompson's early life, but {{he grew up in}} an impoverished tenement house neighborhood. He dropped out of school at a young age, and spent his teen years wandering the streets. A local minister noticed Thompson sleeping in a park one evening and <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> homeless shelter, the New York Home for Homeless Boys.

5|$|At {{the age of}} five years, Rambola {{was adopted}} by Narharidas, a Vaishnava ascetic of Ramananda's monastic order who is {{believed}} to be the fourth disciple of Ramananda, or alternately, the disciple of Anantacharya. Rambola was given the Virakta Diksha (Vairagi initiation) with the new name of Tulsidas. Tulsidas narrates the dialogue that took place during the first meeting with his guru in a passage in the Vinayapatrika. When he was seven years old, his Upanayana ("sacred thread ceremony") was performed by Narharidas on the fifth day of the bright half of the month of Magha (January–February) at Ayodhya, a pilgrimage-site related to Rama. Tulsidas started his learning at Ayodhya. After some time, Narharidas <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> particular Varaha Kshetra Soron (a holy place with temple dedicated to Varaha – the boar avatar of Vishnu), where he first narrated the Ramayana to Tulsidas. Tulsidas mentions this in the Ramcharitmanas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and John Wayne. Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April 2012, {{soon after}} Chen escaped house arrest, plainclothes {{security}} agents forced {{entry into the}} home of his eldest brother, Chen Guangfu. Believing that the elder brother had information on Chen's escape, police <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> police station for interrogation, and reportedly chained his feet, slapped him, and struck him with a belt. Police officers then allegedly returned to the family's home and proceeded to beat Guangfu's wife and son. His son, Chen Kegui, pulled a knife and slashed at three of the officers, causing minor injuries. He was taken into custody and faces criminal charges for attempted murder. On 24 May, it was reported that Chen Guangfu had escaped to Beijing from his guarded village to advocate on behalf of his son. In November 2012, Chen Kegui was sentenced to more than three years in prison.|$|E

5|$|After {{an idyllic}} period, which is recounted {{in the first}} section of his Childhood Memories, Ion Creangă was sent to primary school, an {{institution}} then in the care of Orthodox Church authorities, where he became noted for his rebellious attitude and appetite for truancy. Among his colleagues was a female student, Smărăndița popii (known later as Smaranda Posea), for whom he developed an affection which lasted into his adult life, over decades in which the two no longer saw each other. He was taught reading and writing in Cyrillic alphabet through peer tutoring techniques, before the overseeing teacher, , was lassoed off the street and conscripted by the Moldavian military at some point before 1848. After another teacher, whom the Memories portray as a drunk, died from cholera in late 1848, David Creangă withdrew his grandson from the local school and <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> similar establishment in Broșteni, handing him into the care of a middle-aged woman, Irinuca. Ion Creangă spent several months at Irinuca's remote house on the Bistrița River, before the proximity of goats resulted in a scabies infection and his hastened departure for Pipirig, where he cured himself using birch extract, a folk remedy mastered by his maternal grandmother Nastasia.|$|E
