5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Strokes</b> are an American indie rock band. Formed in New York City in 1999, {{the group}} {{consists}} of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. <b>The</b> <b>Strokes</b> discography consists of five studio albums, two extended plays (EP), twelve singles, one video album and fifteen music videos.|$|E
5|$|For the album, <b>the</b> <b>Strokes</b> strived {{to capture}} a simple rock sound that was not {{significantly}} enhanced in the studio. Building {{on the work of}} their 2001 extended play, The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth. Following the completion of Is This It, <b>the</b> <b>Strokes</b> embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually explicit and was replaced for the US market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks.|$|E
30|$|Elongation can be {{measured}} as the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> at 0  N subtracted from <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> at <b>the</b> maximum tensile load to the additional initial chuck distance and <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> at 0  N. The maximum error observed in the uniform elongation calculation was 0.21 %. <b>The</b> <b>stroke</b> at 0  N testing force can be extrapolated using the slope of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> increment and <b>the</b> testing force curve. <b>The</b> <b>stroke</b> increment of a cross-head {{can be related to}} the extension of the wire. The slope can be calculated in the range of 0 to 1  mm stroke.|$|R

5|$|The Pixies {{achieved}} modest {{popularity in}} their home country, but were more successful in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe and Israel. Their jarring pop sound influenced bands such as Nirvana, Radiohead, <b>the</b> <b>Strokes,</b> Bush, Blur and Weezer.

2500|$|Kǎishū style (regular script) — {{still in}} use today — [...] is more regularized, {{allowing}} one to more easily guess <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> order used to write on <b>the</b> steles. <b>The</b> <b>stroke</b> order 1000 years ago {{was similar to that}} toward the end of Imperial China. For example, <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> order of 广 is clear in the Kangxi dictionary of 1716; but in a modern book, <b>the</b> official <b>stroke</b> order (<b>the</b> same) will not appear clearly. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while current stroke order is still the same, according to the old style., 厂 or 广.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stroke</b> {{length is}} {{determined}} by the cranks on <b>the</b> crankshaft. <b>Stroke</b> can also refer to the distance the piston travels. Engine displacement is dependent on both the diameter of the cylinder, known as its bore, and <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> of <b>the</b> Piston.|$|R
5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, <b>the</b> <b>Strokes,</b> Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E
5|$|More or {{less the}} Scottish answer to American bands like Interpol and <b>the</b> <b>Strokes,</b> Franz Ferdinand, with their du-jour cool and deft {{combination}} of insular art flair and dance-floor populism, was hailed by British hype machine New Musical Express as {{the dawn of a}} new rock revolution. The band's blue-blazered appeal, however, started to slip after 2009's overly serious concept album Tonight: Franz Ferdinand. Four years later, the zeitgeist may prefer its rock stars with suspenders and banjos, but Franz Ferdinand's Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is an unapologetically swaggering disco-rock album that refuses to overstay its welcome.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand a guitar revival took place and raised a new {{generation}} of alternative guitar bands often described as post-punk revival or garage rock revival. Prominent US bands of this generation are White Stripes, <b>The</b> <b>Strokes,</b> and The Killers. New Weird America or sometimes called Freak Folk is a new movement emphasizing the artistic individuality of genre crossing artists such as Antony and the Johnsons, Joanna Newsom, The Dodos, Animal Collective and Cat Power.|$|E
40|$|M. A. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compile a psychological information program on stroke, and to provide this psychological information to the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient. <b>The</b> emotional status of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient was evaluated during the intervention. The final goal {{of this research was}} to give a phenomenological description of the experiences of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient. <b>The</b> method for collecting data was 1) to evaluate the emotional status of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient with <b>the</b> POMS (Profile Of Mood State) inventory before he was exposed to the content of the psychological information program on <b>stroke.</b> 2) <b>The</b> spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient was then introduced to the psychological information program, and any questions which arose were answered. 3) A follow up appointment was arranged for ten days later. During this appointment the POMS inventory was administered again to assess the spouse's emotional status after exposure to the psychological informationprogram on stroke. Any further questions were answered. Within a framework of identified themes a phenomenological description of the experiences of the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient was given. The most important experiences were identified as confusion, anxiety, tension, rage, frustration, tiredness, and feelings of not being motivated and depression. The phenomenological themes were "Om-te-wees (Dasein) ", "Die wereld", "In-die-wereld-wees", "Om-ingegooi-tewees- in-die-wereld", "Angs as basiese ingesteldheid tot die wereld" and "Liggaamlikheid". The current research was motivated after a thorough study of <b>the</b> literature on <b>stroke.</b> <b>The</b> literature survey revealed a deficiency in terms of availability of information on <b>stroke</b> to <b>the</b> spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient after <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> has occured. <b>The</b> literature survey disclosed that the focus of research has been on <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient. Research identified the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient as <b>the</b> primary caretaker. Therefore {{it is important that the}} spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient will have access to psychological information on stroke to assist them during their tasks of caretaking. Certain variables influenced theresults of the present research project. These variables were 1) the time when the psychological information was provided to the subjects, 2) the emotional status after <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> had occurred, and 3) the extent of information the subjects received from other resources. During the current research project the subjects confirmed the value of the availability of psychological information on <b>stroke.</b> <b>The</b> psychological information on stroke is important in assisting the spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient during their tasks of caret•king. The psychological information on <b>stroke</b> provides <b>the</b> spouse of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient with 1) a better understanding of <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> patient, 2) knowledge of what to expect after a stroke had occured, and 3) realistic goals for the future...|$|R

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> higher <b>stroke</b> death rates in <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> belt are due to the region's high African American population, because African Americans' stroke death rates are higher than the national average. However, because White people also have higher rates of <b>stroke</b> death in <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> belt than {{in other parts of the}} country, the higher death rates in <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> belt cannot be attributed solely to the region's higher proportion of African Americans.|$|R
5|$|Promoted by {{the music}} press for a melodic pop-influenced sound, <b>the</b> <b>Strokes</b> {{garnered}} critical acclaim and commercial attention. Is This It was praised for its charisma and rhythm, which often referenced the works of 1970s garage rock bands. The record is considered crucial {{in the development of}} other alternative bands and of the post-millennial music industry. It has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 2000s and of all time.|$|E
5|$|The band {{received}} several nominations in their debut year in 2002, including Best New Act from the MTV Europe Music Awards and Best Live Act from the Q Awards. They won several awards {{in the same}} year, including Best International Band from the BRIT Awards, and Band of the Year and Best New Act from the NME Awards. They have also been nominated for Best International Band at the NME Awards in 2003, 2006 (which they won), 2007, and 2016. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>Strokes</b> have received six awards from 20 nominations.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to {{a number}} of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival. Nevertheless, post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of Creed and Matchbox Twenty; Radiohead's critical acclaim, and the success of some post-Britpop groups like Coldplay. Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and 2000s, other alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, <b>The</b> <b>Strokes</b> and Arcade Fire.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "stroke" [...] is the rower {{closest to}} {{the stern of the}} boat and usually the most {{competitive}} rower in the crew. Everyone else follows <b>the</b> <b>stroke's</b> timing - placing their blades {{in and out of the}} water at the same time as <b>stroke.</b> <b>The</b> <b>stroke</b> can communicate with the coxswain (when in a stern coxed boat) to give feedback on how the boat feels. During a race, it is <b>the</b> <b>stroke's</b> responsibility to establish the crew's rate (number of strokes per minute) and rhythm. (In coxed boats, the coxswain will assist <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> in establishing <b>the</b> rate). Because of the great responsibilities, the rower in <b>the</b> <b>stroke</b> seat will usually be one of the most technically sound members of the boat, capable of setting a good rhythm.|$|R
