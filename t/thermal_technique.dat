40|$|Incineration {{has been}} used as a {{disposal}} method for wastewater treatment biosolids for over sixty years. The first multiple hearth furnace for biosolids incineration was built in 1935 in Dearborn, MI. From that time through the late sixties, the multiple hearth was the <b>thermal</b> <b>technique</b> of choice for biosolids disposal. Today there are still some 150 - 175 aging multiple hearths in operation in North America. In the seventies, the fluid bed furnace became the preferred <b>thermal</b> <b>technique</b> for biosolids disposal, primarily due to tighter emission regulation and to increasing cost of auxiliary fuel. The first municipal fluid bed was installed in the USA at the Lynnwood, WA wastewater treatment plant in 1962. There have been over 125 fluid bed incinerators installed since then in North America. Since 1988 there have been 43 new municipal fluid bed systems installed. Among these new fluid bed installations, 11 replaced existing multiple hearths. The dominance of fluid bed over multiple hearth for the last three decades can be explained by the advantages of the fluid bed, which derive from the basic design differences between the tw...|$|E

Five fog dispersion techniques are examined: evaporation suppression, downwash, mixing, seeding with hygroscopic material, <b>thermal</b> <b>techniques,</b> and charged particle <b>techniques.</b> <b>Thermal</b> <b>techniques,</b> although effective, {{were found to}} be too expensive for routine airport operations, and detrimental to the environment.

Recent {{progress in the}} development of infrared cameras is the key {{for a wide variety of}} new applications. In particular, active <b>thermal</b> <b>techniques</b> provide useful information about thermal properties and related quantities as well as geometrical and structural information. "Active" thermography means that, for the purpose of testing, heat is deposited at the surface of the test object or generated within the test object. The surface temperature is monitored as a function of time during or after stimulation. Thermal quantities are determined from the infrared frame sequence. With "Passive" thermography, the temperature of an object is imaged without additional thermal stimulation.

Particular focus is set on the new thermographic NDE method called Mechanically Induced Dissipated Heat Analysis - MIDA. This method is employed for fatigue damage characterization...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNon-destructive {{methods for}} {{measuring}} electric charge and polarization in solid dielectric materials {{have been set}} up in recent years. Their common principle is related to the influence charges which appear at the electrodes of a sample containing space charge. When the material is submitted to an external disturbance, the influence charges vary, giving birth to a transient current or voltage signal, from which charge density and electric field distributions across the sample can be calculated. The use of adapted stimuli, which do not alter the electrical state of the sample, allows monitoring the time evolution of the charge. The most employed methods, based on pressure or thermal stimuli, are briefly reviewed in this paper. A <b>thermal</b> <b>technique,</b> namely the Thermal Step Method, is brought in sharper focus.

Computational simulations of experimental measurements can provide limits of the effectiveness of the technique and easily assume a variety of different defect geometries to determine their detectability without the expense of making many different samples.

40|$|Magnetic fluid {{hyperthermia}} (MFH) {{is considered}} a promising therapeutic technique {{for the treatment of}} cancer cells, in which magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with superparamagnetic behavior generate mild-temperatures under an AC magnetic field to selectively destroy the abnormal cancer cells, in detriment of the healthy ones. However, the poor heating efficiency of most NMPs and the imprecise experimental determination of the temperature field during the treatment, are two of the majors drawbacks for its clinical advance. Thus, in this work, different MNPs were developed and tested under an AC magnetic field (similar to 1. 10 kA/m and 200 kHz), and the heat generated by them was assessed by an infrared camera. The resulting thermal images were processed in MATLAB after the thermographic calibration of the infrared camera.

40|$|Subsurface {{corrosion}} in {{aircraft structure}} {{is a major}} concern in lap joints and other joints. Small open gaps in the joints form regions where moisture can be trapped. The trapped water often produces a chemical environment in the regions which accelerates the corrosion process. Corrosion considerably reduces structural strength and load-bearing capacity of the structure. To ensure flight safety, it is imperative to detect subsurface corrosion as early as possible during aircraft maintenance operations. Since long downtimes of commercial aircraft translate to large operating costs for airline industries, it is desirable to develop techniques that can consistently and reliably detect corrosion by rapidly scanning the aircraft. Towards this goal, the <b>thermal</b> <b>technique,</b> which is a nondestructive, noncontacting technique capable of rapidly inspecting aircraft structures for defects such as disbonds, corrosion, and cracks is currently under development [1].

Optical constants were calculated by analysing the transmission spectrum in the spectral range 400 - 1100 nm. The optical band gap decreases {{with the addition}} of Te to As(2) S(3). The decrease of optical band gap has been explained on the basis of density of states and the increase in disorder in the system. We have irradiated the as-deposited films using a diode pumped solid state laser of 532 nm wavelength to study photo-diffusion of Te into As(2) S(3). The changes were characterised by Fourier Transform Infrared and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The optical band gap is found to be decreased with the light irradiation which is proposed due to homopolar bond formation. The core level peaks in XPS spectra give information about different bond formation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
