The sensor system has an image <b>data</b> <b>generator</b> <b>unit</b> based on a two dimensional photo diode matrix. This has an adaptation region and an at least section wise sequential image data output. The system also has a high rate data processor based on a user specific CMOS logic chip. The processor has a pre-processor and calculating logic {{as well as an}} external, selection free working memory accessible via two parallel ports, and a control unit. In the image processor (6) the conversion of a continual iterative calculation of the x and y components according to the gradient algorithm is realised by a digital hardware architecture of the CMOS chip {{in the form of a}} consequent pipeline structure with a simple data feedback (22). The preprocessor (13) is integrated with a first arithmetic computer unit (16) by connecting a first shift register (15) and the calculation logic (14) is integrated with three further arithmetic computer units by connecting three further shift registers, and with a block for calculating the optical flow, having several pipeline stages. The external operating memory is formed of three identical memory elements each with an associated arithmetic unit. USE - Especially for object navigation to avoid collisions. ADVANTAGE - Provides a compact, reliable, high rate sensor system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Currently, {{there are}} very few {{programs}} with the capability to create synthetic, but realistic data. This kind of data is useful for testing and evaluating data mining and data matching systems without endangering the rights of actual persons. This paper is a report on efforts to expand upon an existing <b>data</b> <b>generator</b> program such that it can then produce temporal or longitudinal data, i. e. data that follows some timebased or time-related pattern. At the Research School of Computer Science (RSCS) at the Australian National University (ANU), a flexible <b>data</b> <b>generator</b> has been developed for the creation of synthetic personal information. It is for this <b>data</b> <b>generator</b> that the module for longitudinal data generation is created. With this prototype, the <b>data</b> <b>generator</b> can then create personal data that reflects time-related trends, such as credit history, address changes, and transaction records. Keeping true to the programming of the <b>data</b> <b>generator,</b> the longitudinal <b>data</b> <b>generator</b> has been developed using the Python programming language...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{scheme for}} design of multi-objective {{nonlinear}} control is proposed in this paper.

Applying the proposed control scheme {{in the design of}} the turbogenerator integrated controller, a multi-objective nonlinear integrated controller for turbine <b>generator</b> <b>units</b> is proposed, in which the problem to coordinate the dynamic and steady-state integrated performances of various state variables is solved. Simulation results of using the proposed controller in a one-machine infinite-bus power system show that both the dynamic performances and the steady-state performance of the synchronous <b>generator</b> <b>units</b> are greatly improved. Both the generator terminal voltage and the generator active power output can still be kept at their setting values after a step disturbance. Also, the stability of the <b>generator</b> <b>unit</b> when subjected to the disturbances is greatly enhanced. The proposed controller is valuable for industrial application...|$|R

40|$|Generating {{data sets}} for the {{performance}} testing of database systems on a particular hardware configuration and application domain is a very time consuming and tedious process. It is time consuming, {{because of the large}} amount of data that needs to be generated and tedious, because new <b>data</b> <b>generators</b> might need to be developed or existing once adjusted.

40|$|Languages {{for music}} audio {{processing}} typically offer a large assortment of <b>unit</b> <b>generators.</b> There is great duplication among different language implementations, as each language must implement {{many of the}} same (or nearly the same) <b>unit</b> <b>generators.</b> Csound has a large library of <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> and could be a useful source of reusable <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> for other languages or for direct use in applications. In this study, we consider how Csound <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> can be exposed to direct access by other audio processing languages. Using Aura as an example, we modified Csound to allow efficient, dynamic allocation of individual <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> without using the Csound compiler or writing Csound instruments. We then extended Aura using automatic code generation so that Csound <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> can be accessed in the normal way from within Aura. In this scheme, Csound details are completely hidden from Aura users. We suggest that these techniques might eliminate most of the effort of building <b>unit</b> <b>generator</b> libraries and could help with the implementation of embedded audio systems where <b>unit</b> <b>generators</b> are needed but a full embedded Csound engine is not required.

40|$|Abstract—Developing, for example, {{a simple}} booking web service with modern tools {{can be a}} matter of a few weeks work. Testing such a system should not need to take more time than that. Automatically {{generating}} tests from specified properties of the system using the tool QuickCheck provides professional developers with the required test efficiency. But how good is the quality of these automatically generated tests? Do they cover the cases that one would have written in manual tests? The quality depends on the specified properties and <b>data</b> <b>generators</b> and so far there has not been an objective way to evaluate the quality of these QuickCheck generators. In this paper we present a method to assess the quality of QuickCheck test <b>data</b> <b>generators</b> by formulating requirements on them.

The method supports developers in improving <b>data</b> <b>generators,</b> which may lead to an increase of the effectiveness in testing while maintaining the same efficiency. I...|$|R
