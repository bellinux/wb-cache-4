5000|$|Jason Morningstar wrote Durance for the Game Chef 2011 competition. This game {{focused on}} the contest's theme of William Shakespeare and its {{ingredients}} of [...] "daughter," [...] "exile," [...] "forsworn," [...] and [...] "nature"; those elements got Morningstar thinking about the colonization of Australia in the 1780s and the 1790s, {{and he ended up}} writing about a penal colony on a distant planet. Morningstar was pleased with the Game Chef iteration of Durance, so in July 2011 he started iterating it for possible publication by <b>Bully</b> <b>Pulpit.</b> About a year later, <b>Bully</b> <b>Pulpit</b> decided {{to take advantage of the}} newest advances on the internet, and pushed Durance out as their first Kickstarter, raising $27,458 from 639 backers.

During this time John Peel became a Lotuspool fan; Zoom and Panel Donor were signed to larger labels; Lotuspool {{became one of the}} first 10 labels on the internet as they joined the Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA); Lotuspool was pursued for acquisition by three major labels; and the Lotuspool ownership struck up an alliance with James Grauerholz and the author William S. Burroughs. The alliance mostly centered on a mutual love of firearms and the loose shooting restrictions associated with the Lotuspool farm zoning, but in addition, Grauerholz was a generous friend to Lotuspool. He produced the initial Panel Donor record with Matt Nalbach and was very generous when it came to Lotuspool borrowing his recording equipment for <b>Bully</b> <b>Pulpit</b> records.|$|R

5000|$|Jason Morningstar came up {{with the}} core ideas for The Shab-al-Hiri Roach in {{thinking}} about his own fear of cockroaches and about Lovecraftian horror.

The Shab-al-Hiri Roach continued to undergo revisions as Morningstar, Steve Segedy, and Patrick M. Murphy founded <b>Bully</b> <b>Pulpit</b> Games, and was in its 45th revision (since they started counting) by Thanksgiving 2005. The Shab-al-Hiri Roach went on sale on March 10, 2006, and the company printed just 100 copies. All hundred copies of The Shab-al-Hiri Roach had sold out by May 12, by which time <b>Bully</b> <b>Pulpit</b> had ordered a second printing.

40|$|How presidents talk us {{into war}} merges {{the study of}} problem {{definition}} in public policy with the study of rhetoric in communications. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, this research analyzes the key words used by two presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and George W. Bush, to persuade us into escalating a war in Vietnam and engaging in a pre-emptive war in Iraq, respectively. The findings indicate that presidents repeat words that are patriotic, emotive, metaphorical, symbolic and religious, tapping into American themes of Manifest Destiny and even predicting dire outcomes {{if we do not}} accept their definitions of the dangers and rewards involved in going to war. The study also finds that presidents develop a sustaining narrative that highlights what problem definition literature calls a 2 ̆ 2 causal story, 2 ̆ 2 which identifies the harm done, describes its cause, assigns moral blame and claims government is responsible for the remedy (Stone 1989). This research indicates that Johnson used far less antithetical, religious and repetitive language than did Bush, in some cases strikingly so. This work relies upon the literature on problem definition, presidential rhetoric and presidential leadership as a backdrop for studying the major speeches of these two presidents prior to their escalation or initiation of war. It employs content analysis using the computerized program, NVivo 7. The study concludes that while {{we may not be able}} to measure the degree to which various audiences are persuaded by presidential rhetoric, we can see that presidents, who wield <b>the</b> powerful <b>bully</b> <b>pulpit,</b> carefully choose their words and repeat them often to afford themselves maximum persuadability with their audiences as they try to talk us into war. Such language also appears designed to quell dissent and to enlarge the authority of the president...|$|R
