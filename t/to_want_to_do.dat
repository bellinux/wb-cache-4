[...] Breyfogle continued, [...] "It has some diehard fans. But, DC doesn't seem <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything with him. Maybe it's because of his anti-authoritarian philosophy, a very touchy subject in today's world." ...|$|E
500|$|Doctors {{were able}} to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of {{baseball}} and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating {{that they were the}} only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, [...] "I take my hat off [...] I want him to know I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level." [...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E
500|$|Laurer {{also had}} {{problems}} with substance abuse. She claimed that her [...] "life was spinning out of control" [...] around the time she made the sex tape. In January 2005, Sean Waltman claimed that she was battling drug and alcohol addiction, as well as mental illness. Days after the domestic dispute between Waltman and Laurer, it {{was reported in the}} New York Post that she had stripped naked and jumped into a fish tank in a New York nightclub. That same month, she made another appearance on The Howard Stern Show, where she was slurring her words and going off on random tangents. On the program, she claimed not <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> drugs anymore, but said that if a line of cocaine was in front of her, she would do it. After her appearance, she entered a facility specializing in helping people with depression, and she decided to stop drinking. In early 2008, Laurer appeared on the VH1 reality TV show Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew, but she claimed on the show that she did not consider herself an addict. On December 27, 2008, she {{was rushed to the hospital}} after her birthday party, where she was found passed out with cuts on her arms.|$|E

500|$|In September 2008, Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I thought I had {{the idea}} broken, but I've hit a wall in the final act that I haven't quite figured out". Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It has sort of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. I continue <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. I talked to the home video people, because a movie like that would be driven by video. The [...] didn't do that well... So they didn't feel there was a need or an audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1924, Darrow took {{on the case of}} Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb, the teenage sons of two wealthy Chicago {{families}} who were accused of kidnapping and killing Bobby Franks, a 14-year-old boy, from their stylish southside Kenwood neighborhood. Leopold was a law student at the University of Chicago about to transfer to Harvard Law School, and Loeb was the youngest graduate ever from the University of Michigan; they were 18 and 17, respectively, when they were arrested. When asked why they committed the crime, Leopold told his captors: [...] "The thing that prompted Dick <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this thing and prompted me <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this thing was a sort of pure love of excitement... the imaginary love of thrills, doing something different... the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over." ...|$|E

In 2004, {{it was the first}} time I crossed paths with him, and his family generously came all the way to Seattle. Above all, it was a chance. I wanted to do that for a grand upperclassman of the {{baseball}} world. I think it's only natural for someone <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, to express my feelings in that way.

2500|$|Prentiss and McCabe {{often find}} {{themselves}} working on behalf of two rival clients, {{one of whom is}} often the shadier side of the Labour Government, often called their [...] "Downing Street Retainer". This is usually something of an inconvenience as Prentiss is met by Archie Hilditch (Tony Gardner, Alex Lowe), a faceless member of the Government, in a deserted location (such as Frank Dobson's campaign headquarters), and told he needs to ruin the popularity of the organisation that he has spent half the programme building up. For example, in one episode they're employed by the government to increase the popularity of the European Union, while also being employed by the Eurosceptic newspaper The Sun to increase sales. It is probably a good thing in the end, as the firm relies on these payments since neither Prentiss nor McCabe seems <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> any real work.|$|E
2500|$|When {{she heard}} that Danes was no longer keen to {{continue}} with the show, Holzman's attitude changed as well. She said, [...] "When I realized that Claire truly did not want to do it any more, {{it was hard for me}} <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. The joy in writing the show was that everyone was behind it and wanted to do it. And I love her. So part of the joy and excitement and happiness would have gone out of me if she had not been on board 100 percent. I wasn't able to say this at the time, but in retrospect it was a blessing for it to end at a time when we all enjoyed doing it. That's not to say that if the network had ordered more shows that I wouldn't have given it my best. But there was a rightness in how short the season was. This was a show about adolescence and sort of ended in its own adolescence. There was an aura about how short the series was like all things that die young. The show ended at a point that it was still all potential." ...|$|E
