Blythe pushed the teen who then hit his head on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>when</b> he fell and later died of the injury. Lamb of God canceled their upcoming tour but resumed touring 38 days later when Blythe was released on bail. Blythe was indicted on the charges in December 2012. According to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage and had moral responsibility for the fan's death {{but he was not}} criminally liable. The decision was appealed, and upheld by the Prague High Court in June 2013.|$|E

After another Styles Clash attempt, Naito countered by throwing Styles over the top rope to <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>When</b> Styles returned to the ring after a 19 count (NJPW employs a 20 count in their matches), Naito attempted a top-rope huracanrana. Styles blocked it, converting it to a Styles Clash from the second rope before pinning Naito for another Bullet Club victory at 14 minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E
5|$|While separated, {{they meet}} the {{inhabitants}} of the mansion—Maurice (Ed Asner) and Lyda (Lily Tomlin). The ghosts soon turn the agents against each other. Scully is told that Mulder will kill her. Scully meets back up with Mulder, only for him to pull out a gun and shoot her. Scully, completely confused, loses consciousness, and the perspective shifts. It is revealed that Lyda is actually the one carrying out these actions and, through her ghostly ability to create apparitions, causes Scully to see Mulder instead. Meanwhile, Mulder comes upon a bleeding Scully lying on <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>When</b> he leans over her to try to help her, she shoots Mulder in the stomach. Again, the audience sees that it is Lyda pretending to be Scully, manipulating Mulder.|$|E

25|$|A {{pit latrine}} {{generally}} {{consists of three}} major parts: {{a hole in the}} ground, a slab or floor with a small hole, and a shelter. The shelter is often known as an outhouse. The pit is typically at least 3meters (10feet) deep and 1m (3.2 feet) across. The World Health Organization recommends they be built a reasonable distance from the house balancing issues of easy access versus that of smell. The distance from groundwater and surface water should be as large as possible to decrease the risk of groundwater pollution. The hole in the slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in. Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies. This may require the use of a lid to cover the hole in <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>when</b> not in use. When the pit fills to within 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. Fecal sludge management involves emptying pits as well as transporting, treating and using the collected fecal sludge. If this is not carried out properly, water pollution and public health risks can occur.|$|E
25|$|Volador Jr. had {{a long-standing}} {{tradition}} of dressing up like various super heroes for significant matches, especially Marvel Comics super heroes such as Spider-Man, Venom and Iron Man, {{and for the}} 81st Anniversary continued the tradition coming to the ring dressed in black with a giant white skull on his chest to resemble the character The Punisher. While he wore a mask during his introductions, Volador Jr. removed it for the match as {{he was no longer}} allowed to wrestle while masked, due to a loss he suffered at the previous anniversary show. Mr. Niebla, along with his Mascota Perico came to the ring dressed in garb resembling members of the Rock band KISS, with Mr. Niebla's mask resembling the face paint that Gene Simmons wears when performing on stage. This was Thunder's first match as a rudo, showcasing a new mask that was primarily black with a few red and yellow highlights. Before the match Thunder attacked Volador Jr. again and threw him outside the ring. To sell the brutality of Thunder's attack Volador Jr. was on the floor {{for the majority of the}} first fall, leaving Máscara Dorada and Valiente to wrestle the first fall by themselves. During the first fall Thunder stayed on the apron, seemingly more focused on Volador Jr. than the other opponents. The first fall was won by Valiente and Dorada when Valiente pinned Euforia while Máscara Dorada pinned Mr. Niebla. Between the falls Volador Jr. returned to the match, ready to fight. During the second fall Thunder finally entered the ring, throwing his opponents around to showcase his greater size and strength compared to his opponents. At one point Dorada, Valiente, Eurforia and Mr. Niebla were all on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>when</b> Thunder grabbed Volador Jr. by the trunks and the throat and tossing him over the top rope onto the other four wrestlers. The brutality of his actions got Thunder's team disqualified, losing the match in two falls, something that did not bother Thunder as he was more interested in showing his physical dominance against the smaller opponents.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event cage match wrestlers could escape the cage and thus unmasking only by {{climbing}} {{over the top of}} the cage and all the way to the floor. The first escapee was Coco Armarillo who climbed over the top within minutes of the opening bell. When Máscara Sagrada Jr. tried to escape the Killer, the real one this time, climbed up the cage from the outside and pushed Máscara Sagrada Jr. off the top of the cage, back inside the ring. A few minutes later Coco Azul was able to leave the cage as well, leaving his two partners at a four-on-two disadvantage in the cage. During the match Máscara Sagrada tried to even the sides as he tried to prevent the Killer from interfering on several occasions. When Tinieblas Jr. climbed the cage the Killer tried to stop him as he had done before, but this time Tinieblas Jr. was able to knock Killer down and become the third man to leave the cage, moments later Máscara Sagrada Jr. also left the cage. At this point Lady Victoria, who was siding with Los Payasos and Karis locked Miss Janeth to the cage with a pair of handcuffs. Blue Demon Jr. managed to kick a chair into the face of Karis La Momia and then use the break in the action to climb {{over the top of the}} cage to <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>When</b> the match came down to Karis La Momia and Halcón Dorado Jr. Máscarita Sagráda Jr. ran to ringside to help his regular-sized friends out, helping unlock the handcuffs used on Miss Janeth. Looking to help out the diminutive Mini-Estrella climbed up the outside of the cage and dove off the top. He intended to hit Karis La Momia, but at the last moment Karis moved and Máscarita Sagráda Jr. landed on Halcón Dorado Jr. instead. Karis use the opening to handcuff Máscarita Sagráda Jr. to Halcón Dorado Jr., then began to climb the cage, when Halcón Dorado Jr. tried to stop him he was slowed down by the fact that he was dragging Máscarita Sagráda Jr. behind him, making him too late to stop Karis from leaving the cage. After the match a frustrated Halcón Dorado Jr. revealed that his real name was Antonio Olmos, then angrily pulled his mask off and attacked Máscarita Sagráda Jr. and Máscara Sagráda Jr. blaming them for his mask loss.|$|E
