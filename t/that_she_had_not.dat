The British nationality of her captain became an issue in the Irish general election of June 1943, there were diplomatic exchanges between the United States and Ireland, and questions raised in the British House of Commons. In Germany, the U-boat's captain received a mild reprimand.|$|E

Friends of Tim's testified that Tim had had a fascination with fire and that he had told friends that he knew how to make bombs. A neighbor testified that he had once caught Tim burning some grass in the neighbor's yard. A former nanny testified that she had heard Tim speak about wanting his father dead and planning to burn down the family's house, and had caught him multiple times setting or with the implements to set fires. On cross-examination, she admitted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen Tim Farrar for years and agreed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> reported Tim's fascination with fire to his parents or the police when he had expressed it to her.|$|E
5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E

5|$|Madonna commented <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{been able}} to focus on the {{development}} of the DVD as she was involved with the development of her directorial venture, titled W.E. Upon its release, Sticky & Sweet Tour received mixed reviews from critics, with one group criticizing it for being lifeless, while others praised the album for the performances. It became Madonna's 19th top-ten album on the Billboard 200, while reached the top of the charts in Greece, Hungary, Mexico and Portugal. The album also reached the top-ten in the charts of Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, but had failed to reach the top-ten in Germany and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Timmy, {{the late}} Jimmy's friend, asks Langly {{to attend a}} Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor. The game, however, is a setup to inject Langly with a drug that {{effectively}} controls the subject's mind, much like Scully and Jimmy. Frohike finds an extremely flirtatious Scully at the bar with a large cluster of men around her. He takes {{her back to the}} suite where Susanne recognizes the effects of the drug, which she identifies as anoetic histamine. She reveals <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> actually made the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal.|$|E

Madonna later acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> grasped the concept of her mother dying.|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman {{spent the night in}} the dungeon. He thought about beating his head against the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew {{as soon as he saw}} Goldman <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E

5|$|Some {{time after}} 7:00pm, a Woodsville, New Hampshire {{resident}} {{heard a loud}} thump outside of her house. Through her window she could see a car up against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. The car pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. She telephoned the Grafton County Sheriff's Department at 7:27pm to report the accident. According to the 911 log, the woman claimed to have seen a man smoking a cigarette inside the car. However, the woman later stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen a man nor a person smoking a cigarette, but rather had seen {{what appeared to be}} a red light glowing from inside the car, potentially from a cell phone. At about the same time another neighbor saw the car as well as someone walking around the vehicle. She witnessed a third neighbor pull up alongside the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its opening {{statement}} to the jury, was that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He knew she would have to cross the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she attempted to elude him, but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with an unconscious woman whom he had treated in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E

6000|$|... "I--I don't know! I am sorry," [...] she faltered. [...] "You {{know what}} mother is. If any one asked her {{questions}} {{she would be}} more than likely to answer them. I do hope <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been making mischief." ...|$|R
5|$|The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide {{written by}} Rebecca Silverman, {{also of the}} Anime News Network, {{expressed}} differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play. She {{also noted that the}} transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s. In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.|$|E
