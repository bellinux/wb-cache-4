5|$|According to Gočeva, {{the album}} {{features}} elements of ethno jazz {{in addition to}} the prominent elements of Macedonian folklore music. Critics also noted elements of pop and jazz in <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> added that they represent an internationalization of the sound of traditional Macedonian music. The lyrics cover various topics which express states of happiness, sadness, love and longing of a mellow female protagonist. Instrumentally, the songs on Makedonsko Devojče 2 contain the following instruments: clarinet, bass guitar, horn, acoustic guitar, violin, qanun, saxophone and percussion.|$|E
5|$|After {{the song}} was composed, Lloyd Webber and Rice were {{struggling}} to find a suitable musical actress for <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> the titular role, since the only one they knew, Yvonne Elliman, {{had moved to the}} United States. One day they were watching the British musical television show, Rock Follies, where they noticed actress and singer Julie Covington, who played an aspiring rock musician. Covington had played in London musicals like Godspell, and her acting abilities in Rock Follies convinced Rice and Lloyd Webber to sign her for Evita.|$|E
5|$|Composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz {{began working}} on writing songs for the film from the {{beginning}} of the film's production. As the story evolved, he continued to write songs that would serve both to entertain and help move the story along. Composer Hans Zimmer arranged and produced <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> then eventually wrote the film's score. The film's score was recorded entirely in London, England.|$|E
25|$|Metal {{movable type}} {{appeared}} in <b>the</b> late <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> Yuan. Bronze movable types {{were used to}} print banknotes and official documents by both <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> Jin.|$|R
5000|$|Adamou {{announced}} {{the release of}} a new song through her Facebook page on 11 July 2016, when she posted part of the single's artwork with the caption [...] "18/07... #newsong". The teaser of both <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> its accompanying music video were leaked the same day.

5000|$|Two {{different}} {{music videos}} were created for [...] "The Hands That Built America". The first uses {{a combination of}} black-and-white footage of the band playing <b>the</b> <b>song,</b> <b>and</b> scenes from Gangs of New York. This video uses the version of <b>the</b> <b>song</b> found on [...] The Best of 1990-2000 CD. The second video is composed solely of black-and-white footage of U2 playing <b>the</b> <b>song,</b> <b>and</b> it was filmed on 9 May 2002.

5|$|Converge {{began writing}} Axe to Fall in November 2008. With Jacob Bannon, Kurt Ballou and Nate Newton all living within {{a half a}} mile {{of each other in}} Boston, and Ben Koller living a couple hours away in Brooklyn, Converge could easily {{practice}} for weeks at a time. Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower than the rest of <b>the</b> <b>songs,</b> <b>and</b> did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Vainio {{was hired}} to write a number of bawdy songs which were later {{released}} on cassette tape. Vainio wrote a part of <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> sang on the record with all musicians using pseudonyms, Vainio's being Junnu Kaihomieli. Many of the songs {{were based on a}} familiar melody whose copyright had already expired; for example, the song Kumi-Roope ("Rubber Roope") was an obscene version of the folk song Rosvo-Roope ("Roope the Robber"). In 1979 Vainio participated in another recording of similar songs. The songs were released on compact disc in 1992 and 1997 as Pahojen poikien lauluja 1–2 ("Bad Boys' Songs 1–2") and Porno-ooppera / Pahojen poikien lauluja 3 ("Porn Opera / Bad Boys' Songs 3"). Both records went gold.|$|E
5|$|On January 30, 2007, Webb {{released}} two EPs, each {{containing the}} same ten songs from {{earlier in his}} solo career, including pieces from each of his three solo studio albums. One Zero (Acoustic), contains acoustic reinterpretations of <b>the</b> <b>songs,</b> <b>and</b> is available in stores only.

Features the album cut of <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> a radio edit version that differs {{from a second}} edit found on the {{commercial}} single releases.|$|R
50|$|According to Country Weekly, {{songwriter}} Tim Johnson {{was encouraged}} to write <b>the</b> <b>song</b> after his friend was with another girl. He got together with friends Dave Pahanish and Joe West to write <b>the</b> <b>song,</b> <b>and</b> it was finished after about a month. They played <b>the</b> <b>song</b> for Wayne, who liked <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> decided to record it.|$|R
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Shiny Festa eschews {{the simulation}} format of previous Idolmaster games, and instead features a rhythmic gameplay {{in which the}} player times the presses of buttons {{to the rhythm of}} <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> a predetermined pattern displayed on the screen. Each game features a different array of characters and songs, and also includes an original video animation episode produced by A-1 Pictures and directed by Atsushi Nishigori. The games' story centers on the 765 Production's participation in a music festival, and is told via the anime episodes and occasional dialogue included in the games.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> {{musical score}} {{used in the}} film were {{composed}} and written by Carlo Savina and Gilbert Kaplan. The songs were sung by Kaplan and Ann Collin. The music resembles Riz Ortolani's score from Africa addio, as most tracks are of a light and upbeat nature, particularly during the opening and closing credits. The arrangement of music to enhance atmosphere and create comic effect also mimics the compositions in Africa addio.|$|E
5000|$|The {{team are}} known as the Bilikiki, or Bilikiki Boys, after a sea bird which {{inspired}} [...] "a popular children's song". The team have adopted both <b>the</b> bird <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>song,</b> <b>and</b> are [...] "known for performing <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> related dance when they win their matches".|$|R
5000|$|In early 2006, {{the writers}} of Lee Hyori's song [...] "Get Ya" [...] were accused of plagiarizing Britney Spears' 2005 song [...] "Do Somethin'." [...] This {{eventually}} led Lee Hyori to stop promoting <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> contributed to <b>the</b> failure of <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> its album, Dark Angel.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{abundant}} archeological evidences, {{this paper}} systematically discusses the weave and motif of twill damask of <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> Liao dynasties. Categorized {{according to the}} weave, twill damask of <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> Liao dynasties can be described as: twill in same direction, twill in different direction, twill with weft floats and brocaded twill; and the motifs adopted by twill damask of <b>the</b> <b>Song</b> <b>and</b> Liao dynasties mainly contain geometrical motif, floral motif, fauna motif (including birds and animals) and figural motif (including boys at play and Taoists) ...|$|R
5|$|Working out of Tony Leech's apartment, Cory Edwards sketched the film's storyboards, Todd Edwards {{wrote the}} script while {{simultaneously}} writing <b>the</b> <b>songs,</b> <b>and</b> Leech edited the story reel on his Mac computer. Producer Sue Bea Montgomery showed test screenings {{of the story}} reel to children in her neighborhood, and gained input from their reactions. The filmmakers had been considering removing Japeth, but chose not to when he proved popular at these screenings. The children also particularly liked Twitchy, {{which led to the}} expansion of the character's role.|$|E
5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part, along with graffiti and breakdancing. The music is composed of two parts, rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals, and DJing, the production of instrumentation either through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism or beatboxing. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc {{is widely regarded as}} the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs. In New York, DJs like Kool Herc played records of popular funk, disco and rock songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion breaks (the rhythmic climax of songs), thus producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, film {{producer}} Panchu Arunachalam commissioned him to compose <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> film score for a Tamil-language film called Annakkili ('The Parrot'). For the soundtrack, Ilaiyaraaja applied {{the techniques of}} modern popular film music orchestration to Tamil folk poetry and folk song melodies, which created a fusion of Western and Tamil idioms. Ilaiyaraaja's use of Tamil music in his film scores injected new influence into the Indian film score milieu. By the mid-1980s Ilaiyaraaja was gaining increasing stature as a film composer and music director in the South Indian film industry. He has worked with Indian poets and lyricists such as Kannadasan, Vaali, Vairamuthu, O. N. V. Kurup, Sreekumaran Thampi, Veturi Sundararama Murthy, Aacharya Aatreya, Sirivennela Sitaramasastri, Chi. Udaya Shankar and Gulzar and {{is well known for}} his association with film makers such as Bharathiraja, S. P. Muthuraman, J. Mahendran, Balu Mahendra, K. Balachander, Mani Ratnam, Sathyan Anthikkad, Priyadarshan, Fazil, Vamsy, K. Vishwanath, Singeetam Srinivasa Rao and R. Balki.|$|E
50|$|Stan Campbell {{left the}} band {{right after the}} {{recording}} of <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> release of the video for <b>the</b> <b>song,</b> <b>and</b> had to be persuaded to rejoin briefly for two live appearances on the BBC TV show Top of the Pops in 1984. Following those appearances, Campbell left for good.|$|R
50|$|A {{music video}} was {{released}} for <b>the</b> <b>song</b> <b>and</b> shows <b>the</b> band performing <b>the</b> <b>song</b> live.|$|R

5|$|In April, Sakanaction {{had already}} started making songs for Shin-shiro, despite having just {{finished}} their tour in March for the band's second album Night Fishing, which had been released in January of the same year. The album's production took {{a different approach to}} how Go to the Future and Night Fishing were produced. In their previous albums Yamaguchi produced the song demos, then took them to the studio and explained his vision for each song; creating them in sessions with all of the band members. For Shin-shiro, Yamaguchi created <b>the</b> <b>songs,</b> <b>and</b> then assigned each member of the band to create a demo based on their two-person vision. This was a conscious move by Yamaguchi to create a new sound for the album, figuring that if all of members were concurrently working on the songs, it was inevitable that one person would take charge of each song.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of <b>the</b> <b>songs,</b> <b>and</b> as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E
5|$|Shiny Festa is {{a series}} of three rhythm games that feature various {{characters}} and songs from The Idolmaster video game franchise. At the beginning of each game, a twenty-three-minute anime episode is played to introduce the games' story: 765 Production (765 Pro), the talent agency where the protagonist works as a producer, is invited to participate in a music festival; however, only a few of its members may attend. The characters who attend the music festival, as well as <b>the</b> <b>songs</b> <b>and</b> episode that correspond to the characters, are dependent on the version of the game.
