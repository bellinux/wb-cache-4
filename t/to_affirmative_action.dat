5|$|Public {{reaction}} to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president {{up to that}} time was supported by young voters, and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party. Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans. This was largely due to his opposition <b>to</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> policies. However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews. He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced. The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, {{played an important role in}} defining the 1980s and his future legacy.|$|E

25|$|Connerly's {{opposition}} <b>to</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> {{has generated}} both opposition and support. Connerly believes {{affirmative action is}} a form of racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the fall}} of apartheid, Smith helped build a multiracial {{congregation}} in Pretoria. [...] Smith {{continued to be a}} critic of the (originally white-only) Dutch Reformed Church for perceived slowness in integrating with the Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa (the successor to the anti-apartheid Dutch Reformed Church in Africa). [...] He wrote Die Afrikaner Broederbond: Belewinge van die Binnekant, a book critical of the Afrikaner Broederbond, in 2009. [...] He still opined on politics as well; in a 2009 article in the Afrikaans newspaper Beeld, he warned Afrikaners that the democratic transition of 1994 had averted a disaster akin to the near-complete exile of white Algerians after the Algerian Independence War. [...] There, France and its white Algerian minority did not give up power peacefully, which led to the violence of the war. [...] In Smith's view, too much nostalgia for the old days of special [...] "cultural rights" [...] risked a similar disaster; white Afrikaners should not complain about the black-dominated government in racial terms or ask for an end <b>to</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> but instead be loyal citizens of South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|As {{defined by}} the Constitution of Malaysia, Malays must be Muslim, {{regardless}} of their ethnic heritage; otherwise, legally, they are not Malay. Consequently, apostate Malays would have to forfeit all their constitutional privileges, including their Bumiputra status, which entitles them <b>to</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in university admissions and discounts on purchases of vehicles or real estate. It is legally possible to become a Malay if a non-Malay citizen with a Malaysian parent converts to Islam and thus claims all the Bumiputra privileges granted by Article 153 of the Constitution and the New Economic Policy (NEP). However, the convert must [...] "habitually speak the Malay language" [...] and adhere to Malay culture. A tertiary textbook for Malaysian studies following the government-approved syllabus states: [...] "This explains {{the fact that when}} a non-Malay embraces Islam, he is said to masuk Melayu ("become a Malay"). That person is automatically assumed to be fluent in the Malay language and to be living like a Malay {{as a result of his}} close association with the Malays".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2001 report: Hate crimes on campus: {{the problem}} and efforts to confront it, by Stephen Wessler and Margaret Moss of the Center for the Prevention of Hate Violence at the University of Southern Maine, the authors note that [...] "although there are fewer hate crimes {{directed}} against Caucasians than against other groups, they do occur and are prosecuted." [...] In fact, the {{case in which the}} Supreme Court upheld hate crimes legislation against First Amendment attack, Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476 (1993), involved a white victim. Hate crime statistics published in 2002, gathered by the FBI {{under the auspices of the}} Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, documented over 7,000 hate crime incidents, in roughly one-fifth of which the victims were white people. [...] However, these statistics have caused dispute. [...] The FBI's hate crimes statistics for 1993, which similarly reported 20% of all hate crimes to be committed against white people, prompted Jill Tregor, executive director of Intergroup Clearinghouse, to decry it as [...] "an abuse of what the hate crime laws were intended to cover", stating that the white victims of these crimes were employing hate crime laws as a means to further penalize minorities. Jill Tregor, executive director of the San Francisco-based Intergroup Clearinghouse, which provides legal and emotional counseling to hate crime victims, stated, [...] "This is an abuse of what the hate crime laws were intended to cover."13 Tregor accused white hate crime victims of using the laws to enhance penalties against minorities, who already experience prejudice within the criminal justice system.14 Whites, generally sympathetic to the aspirations of minorities, may bristle at the suggestion that crimes motivated by blacks' racism against whites should be treated as a less virulent strain of hate crime, or not as hate crime at all. While no enacted hate crime law makes that distinction, a number of writers in prominent publications, likening hate crime laws <b>to</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> for [...] "protected groups," [...] advocate the exclusion of racist crimes against whites from their coverage.15 This issue alone seems fraught with potential for social conflict and constitutional concerns. | author2=Potter, Kimberly}} ...|$|E
