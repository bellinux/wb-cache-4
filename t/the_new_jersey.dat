5|$|Casinos {{and race}} tracks were closed because {{official}} monitors from <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Casino Control Commission and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Racing Commission, respectively, {{were categorized as}} non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. The casinos attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the state but by the casinos themselves, but the appeal was rejected at <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Jersey</b> Supreme Court; therefore {{they were forced to}} close.|$|E
