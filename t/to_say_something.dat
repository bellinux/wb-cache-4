5|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to {{everyone}} in the bar, Diane returns to the office and accidentally hits Sam's nose when she opens the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to her. They argue, admit their feelings for each other, and come into the terms that their relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each other and, at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
50|$|Some writers, e.g. Williams and Musgrave, make no {{distinction}} between the deceiving God and evil demon arguments and regard anything said about the deceiving God as being equivalent <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> about the evil demon.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{liberating}} element <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> {{that nobody}} else would say in a civilized environment. Being disgusting or politically wrong {{in front of an}} audience can surprise and shock an audience. e.g. jokes about paedophiles.|$|R
60|$|She hesitated; {{what she}} was going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> had <b>something</b> of the anti-climax in it.|$|R
25|$|PH. But now I'm going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> which you'll want to hear. DO. Speak, I'm listening.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} articulatory suppression:Memory for verbal {{material}} is impaired {{when people are}} asked <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> irrelevant aloud. This is assumed to block the articulatory rehearsal process, leading memory traces in the phonological loop to decay.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{exception}} to the above may be the Grelling–Nelson paradox, in which words and meaning are {{the elements of the}} scenario rather than people and hair-cutting. Though it is easy to refute the barber's paradox by saying that such a barber does not (and cannot) exist, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> similar about a meaningfully defined word.|$|E

6000|$|... "But, unhappily, {{our social}} wisdom {{does not permit}} such a reversal," [...] he added, more with a desire <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>something.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The various suits {{into which}} we have entered on behalf of your lordship, and the costs {{which we have}} had to pay," [...] the latter hastened to announce, [...] "amount, I regret <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> <b>something</b> over {{eighteen}} thousand pounds." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{value of}} the object can be {{increased}} by {{the way in which}} it is given and several authors have pointed to the fact that organs given in altruistic manner acquire greater social worth. Organs given in altruistic manner are thought <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about the moral character of the people who give them. Furthermore, the giving of organs without any form of compensation erases the possibility that the giver will have any form of vested interest in the transaction.|$|E
25|$|The ED {{period is}} the first {{for which it is}} {{possible}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about the ethnic composition of the population of Southern Mesopotamia. This {{is due to the fact}} that texts from this period contain sufficient phonetic signs to distinguish separate languages. They also contain personal names, which can potentially be linked to an ethnic identity. The textual evidence suggests that Southern Mesopotamia during the ED period was primarily occupied by Sumerians, who spoke Sumerian (a language isolate). It is still debated whether the Sumerian language was already in use during the Uruk period.|$|E
25|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin kills off main characters because he finds it very irritating to know early in the story who as the hero will come through unscathed. Martin dislikes this lack of realism, comparing the situation to a soldier scared the night before a battle. Martin wants his readers to feel {{that no one is}} safe as they turn the page. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> profound about human nature, and points readers not wanting to get upset or disturbed to the plenty of books for comfort reading.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Price {{gathered}} up her things slowly. Philip waited behind after the others <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her <b>something</b> consolatory. He {{could think of}} nothing but: ...|$|R

25|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, {{he married}} a cousin the {{daughter}} of Mordechai Frances and, being amply provided for financially, {{he was able to}} continue his studies. Though he initially may have pursued a career in business, he soon turned to asceticism and mysticism. Around the age of twenty-two he became engrossed {{in the study of the}} Zohar (a major work of the Kabbalah that had recently been printed for the first time) and adopted the life of a recluse. Retreating to the banks of the Nile for seven years, he secluded himself in an isolated cottage, giving himself up entirely to meditation. He visited his family only on Shabbat. But even at home, he would not utter a word, even to his wife. When it was absolutely necessary for him <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> he would say it in the fewest number of words possible, and then, only in Hebrew.|$|E
25|$|By November 2006, Kip and B.G. {{began to}} show displeasure in TNA and {{threatened}} to go find work elsewhere {{if they did not}} receive gold soon. They began performing the crotch chop, a reference to the WWE's DX. On the November 2 edition of Impact!, Kip and B.G. threatened to quit. Kip grabbed the mic and tried <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to the TNA administration and Spike TV, but each time his mic was cut off. Kip then tried to use the announcer's headset, but it was cut off as well. Frustrated, he started yelling loudly to the crowd, but he was cut off again as the show went to a commercial break. When the show returned, the announcers speculated that they may have been frustrated due to the influx of new talent entering TNA. It was reported that the segment was a worked shoot that Vince Russo had written in order to renew interest upon their eventual return. Kip and BG appeared in an internet video on TNA's website where they addressed the owner of WWE Vince McMahon.|$|E
500|$|Before The Fiery Trial, {{several of}} Foner's works had {{discussed}} Lincoln, {{but this was}} the first of his books to study the president directly. Foner began the book because he believed [...] "that it was still possible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> new, despite the voluminous literature that's out there." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Dutch avoid superlatives. Compliments {{are offered}} sparingly, and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>something</b> is [...] "not bad" [...] is to praise it.|$|R
60|$|The boy smiled, {{and held}} out his hands for Rollo to roll the ball <b>to</b> him, <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> at the same time which to Rollo seemed totally unmeaning.|$|R
50|$|<b>To</b> <b>say</b> that <b>something</b> is an ibis redibis, {{usually in}} the context of legal documents, is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that its wording is (either {{deliberately}} or accidentally) confusing or ambiguous.|$|R
500|$|Dunst {{was treated}} for {{depression}} in early 2008 at the Cirque Lodge treatment center in Utah. She explained {{that she had been}} feeling low in the six months before her admission. In late March 2008, she checked out of the treatment center and began filming the mystery drama All Good Things. In May 2008, she went public with this information in order to dispel rumors of drug and alcohol abuse, stating that [...] "Now that I’m feeling stronger, I was prepared <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> … Depression is pretty serious and should not be gossiped about".|$|E
500|$|The prize {{has been}} criticized: British {{biologist}} Richard Dawkins {{said in his}} book The God Delusion that the prize was given [...] "usually to a scientist who is prepared <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> nice about religion". [...] Sean M. Carroll, a research associate in the Department of Physics at the California Institute of Technology, criticized his colleagues for taking Templeton research grants when they did not support Templeton's beliefs. [...] Martinus J. G. Veltman, the 1999 Nobel laureate in physics, suggested the prize [...] "bridg the gap between sense and nonsense".|$|E
500|$|Goffman {{explains}} that the way a conversation is keyed is critical to understanding the intent behind many utterances in everyday speech. Key is probably best understood as {{the tone of the}} dialogue which can change numerous times during an interaction. Signaling a change in key is one way that framing often takes place, “special brackets will have to be introduced should he want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> in a relatively serious way: [...] "Kidding aside," [...] "Now, I'm really serious about this," [...] and other such tags become necessary as a means of momentarily down keying the flow of words.” ...|$|E
25|$|The {{formula is}} simple: When {{you have an}} {{exhibition}} <b>to</b> promote, <b>say</b> <b>something</b> mildly inflammatory <b>to</b> the press, and watch the column inches (particularly in August) and ticket sales soar.|$|R
6000|$|... "And why not now?" [...] {{the voice}} persisted. [...] "You are alone in Paris, are you not? I have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you, <b>something</b> which is best said quickly." ...|$|R

500|$|The song [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] {{contains}} {{an allusion to}} the 1989 film, Batman, with the line, [...] "You're my number one guy". In an interview with The Fader magazine, Taylor said the reference {{was a result of}} thinking about the Batman film, which has many things that Taylor is fond of, such as the Prince soundtrack. He commented that sometimes those items [...] "seep into what we're writing about" [...] and said that he likes to reference [...] "in an oblique way". He conjectured that he had included the line <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to [...] "everyone in the band, particularly to Joe , 'You're my number one guy, why is there any problems between any of us?' [...] " ...|$|E
500|$|Lo co-wrote [...] "Love Me Like You Do", {{recorded}} by English singer Ellie Goulding, which was released {{as the second}} single from the [...] to the film Fifty Shades of Grey (2015). The track topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, Lo received nominations, alongside the others co-writers of the song, for the Golden Globes, Grammys and Critics' Choice Awards. [...] Discussing {{the process of writing}} for other artists, the singer told Paste that she avoids drawing from her own experiences so that the songs do not become personal. She also stated: [...] "My main goal is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> how they would say it, even if I might say it in a different way that makes more sense to me".|$|E
500|$|During {{and after}} {{each of the}} {{role-playing}} scenes, Harris and the children discuss the situation and what the child should do. Harris tells the children not to be afraid to tell someone {{if they have been}} improperly touched, saying, [...] "Some people don't act right with kids, and they need help. You can't protect them from trouble that they themselves have caused, and it's better <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> so that you and the family can get the help you need. You know nothing gets better by keeping quiet about it." [...] Harris says that, if it is difficult to explain where they have been touched, they can draw a picture or point to the place on a doll. The film ends with [...] "My Body" [...] sung by a group of people including Harris, two police officers, and some children.|$|E
60|$|What was Eleanor <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him? She {{could not}} say much because she was crying, and yet she must <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> She was most anxious <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>something</b> graciously, kindly, and yet not {{in such a manner}} as to betray herself. She had never felt herself so much at a loss for words.|$|R
3000|$|T: Correct. In your writing, {{you were}} trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>something</b> was not {{acceptable}} for your friend right. Something did not suit, right? [...]...|$|R
