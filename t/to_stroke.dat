5|$|The next morning, Naomi wakes up, with Emily asleep next to her. She {{is tempted}} <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> her hair, but instead gets dressed {{and goes to}} college, leaving Emily in her bed. At college, she sees the massive presidential {{campaign}} staged by Cook and JJ (Ollie Barbieri). She launches her own campaign to rival Cook, but finds that most of her classmates' support is for Cook's anarchist ideas. She is doubly humiliated {{in front of the}} form when Cook ridicules her and Emily subsequently stands up for her. She flees to Kieran for comfort but leaves him, shocked and disgusted, when he kisses her. She goes home and, after finding a note from Emily in her bed, cries herself to sleep.|$|E
5|$|The {{power balance}} {{began to change}} after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} assert the King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It was no secret that Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} leads <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> due to locally increased venous pressure, which {{exceeds the}} pressure {{generated by the}} arteries.

25|$|Sickle-cell anemia, {{which can}} cause blood cells to clump up and block blood vessels, can also lead <b>to</b> <b>stroke.</b> A stroke is the second {{leading cause of death}} in people under 20 with sickle-cell anemia. Air {{pollution}} may also increase stroke risk.|$|E
25|$|People {{who have}} had a {{transient}} ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke can present with symptoms similar to MD, and in people at risk for stroke magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be conducted to exclude TIA or stroke, and as TIA is often a precursor <b>to</b> <b>stroke,</b> that risk should be managed.|$|E
25|$|Athetosis is {{a symptom}} {{primarily}} caused by the marbling, or degeneration of the basal ganglia. This degeneration is most commonly caused by complications at birth or by Huntington's disease, in addition to rare {{cases in which the}} damage may also arise later in life due <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> or trauma. The two complications of particular interest are intranatal asphyxia and neonatal jaundice.|$|E
40|$|The Effectiveness of Learning Sequences in Swimming Skills. This study aims to {{investigate}} the appropriateness and effectiveness of learning sequences in swimming skills after the students mastered the crawl stroke. The sequences were that from the crawl <b>stroke</b> <b>to</b> the breast <b>stroke</b> and that from the crawl <b>stroke</b> <b>to</b> the back <b>stroke.</b> This study was a quasi-experimental study using the pretest-posttest group design. The population comprised students of the Faculty of Sports Sciences, Yogyakarta State University. The sample was selected using the purposive sampling technique. The {{results showed that the}} sequence from the crawl <b>stroke</b> <b>to</b> the back <b>stroke</b> was more efficient than that from the crawl <b>stroke</b> <b>to</b> the breast <b>stroke</b> in terms of the mastery of swimming skills...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the link between ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> and air temperature by using daily data of ambu-lance transports in Okayama prefecture, Japan. Daily observations for ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> from July <b>to</b> September in 2010 in Okayama prefecture, Japan were obtained from Fire and Disaster Management Agency in Japan. Data of meteorological parameters in Okayama prefecture, Japan were also obtained from Japan Meteorological Agency. Effect of meteorological parameters on ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> was analyzed. A total of 1133 ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> were observed in from July to September of 2010 in Okayama pre-fecture, Japan. Ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> was significantly correlated with air tem-perature. In addition, number of subjects with am-bulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> over 34 ˚C in the highest air temperature was 21. 2 ± 9. 8 per day. Higher air temperature was closely associ-ated with higher ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> by using daily data in Okayama, pre-fecture, Japan...|$|R

25|$|Apraxia is {{most often}} due to a lesion located in the {{dominant}} (usually left) hemisphere of the brain, typically in the frontal and parietal lobes. Lesions may be due <b>to</b> <b>stroke,</b> acquired brain injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease. It is also possible for apraxia {{to be caused by}} lesions {{in other areas of the}} brain including the non-dominant (usually right) hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Family {{members may}} have a genetic {{tendency}} for stroke or share a lifestyle that contributes <b>to</b> <b>stroke.</b> Higher levels of Von Willebrand factor are more common amongst {{people who have had}} ischemic stroke for the first time. The results of this study found that the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood type. Having had a stroke in the past greatly increases one's risk of future strokes.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} serious risks {{associated}} with manipulation of the cervical spine is uncertain, with little evidence of risk of harm but also little evidence of safety either. There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of vertebral artery dissection, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> and death, from cervical manipulation. Several deaths {{have been associated with}} this technique and {{it has been suggested that}} the relationship is causative, but this is disputed by many chiropractors who believe it is unproven.|$|E

25|$|In 1925 Samuel T. Orton, a {{neurologist}} who worked primarily with stroke victims, met {{a girl who}} could not read and who exhibited symptoms similar <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> victims who had {{lost the ability to}} read. Orton began studying reading difficulties and determined that there was a syndrome unrelated to brain damage that made learning to read difficult. Orton called his theory strephosymbolia (meaning 'twisted signs') to describe individuals with dyslexia had difficulty associating the visual forms of words with their spoken forms.|$|E
25|$|Carotid arteries supply {{blood to}} the brain and neck. Marked {{narrowing}} of the carotid arteries can present with symptoms such as a feeling of weakness, {{not being able to}} think straight, difficulty speaking, becoming dizzy and difficulty in walking or standing up straight, blurred vision, numbness of the face, arms, and legs, severe headache and losing consciousness. These symptoms are also related <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> (death of brain cells). Stroke is caused by marked narrowing or closure of arteries going to the brain; lack of adequate blood supply leads to the death of the cells of the affected tissue.|$|E
25|$|Hydrodynamics is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> technique for swimming faster, and swimmers {{who want to}} swim faster or tire less try to reduce the drag of the body's motion through the water. To be more hydrodynamic, swimmers can either increase {{the power of their}} strokes or reduce water resistance, though power must increase by a factor of three to achieve the same effect as reducing resistance. Efficient swimming by reducing water resistance involves a horizontal water position, rolling the body to reduce the breadth of the body in the water, and extending the arms as far as possible to reduce wave resistance.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Changes in air {{temperature}} {{and its relation}} to ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> in all 47 prefectures, in Japan were evaluated. Methods: Data on {{air temperature}} were obtained from the Japanese Meteorological Agency. Data on ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> was directly obtained from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, Japan. We also used the number of deaths due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan, and population data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Com-munications. Chronological changes in parameters of air temperature were analyzed. In addition, the relation between air tempera-ture and ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> in August 2010 was also evaluated by using an ecological study. Results: Positive and significant changes in the parameters of air temperature that is, the mean air temperature, mean of the highest air temperature, and mean of the lowest air temperature were noted in all 47 prefectures. In addition, changes in air temperature were accelerated when adjusted for observation years. Ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> was significantly correlated with air tem-perature in the ecological study. The highest air temperature was significantly linked to ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke,</b> es-pecially in elderly subjects. Conclusions: Global warming was demonstrated in all 47 prefectures in Japan. In addition, the higher air temperature was closely as-sociated with higher ambulance transports due <b>to</b> heat <b>stroke</b> in Japan...|$|R
25|$|Female {{masturbation}} {{involves the}} stroking or rubbing of a woman's vulva, especially her clitoris, with an index or middle fingers, or both. Sometimes {{one or more}} fingers may be inserted into the vagina <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> its frontal wall where the G-spot may be located. Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls {{can also be used}} to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women caress their breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand and anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some. Personal lubricant is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is not universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{spasticity}} related <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> {{often involves}} early mobilizations, commonly {{performed by a}} physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through various positionings. Gaining initial improvement in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb. After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb {{with the use of}} splints or other tools to stabilize the joint. Cold in the form of ice wraps or ice packs have been proven to briefly reduce spasticity by temporarily dampening neural firing rates. Electrical stimulation to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success.|$|E
25|$|If left untreated, {{more serious}} {{complications}} could result, including birth defects in pregnancy, {{increased risk of}} a miscarriage, bone mineral loss, and in extreme cases, death. Graves' disease is often accompanied {{by an increase in}} heart rate, which may lead to further heart complications, including loss of the normal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), which may lead <b>to</b> <b>stroke.</b> If the eyes are proptotic (bulging) enough that the lids do not close completely at night, dryness will occur with a risk of a secondary corneal infection which could lead to blindness.

25|$|Shotgun starts {{are mainly}} used for amateur tournament play. In this variant, {{each of the}} groups playing starts their game on a {{different}} hole, allowing for all players to start and end their round {{at roughly the same}} time. All 18 holes are still played, but a player or foursome may, for instance, start on hole 5, play through to the 18th hole, then continue with hole 1 and end on hole 4. This speeds the completion of the entire event as players are not kept waiting for progressive tee times at the first hole. This form of play, as a minor variation <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> or match play, is neither defined nor disallowed by strict rules and so is used according to local rules for an event.|$|E
25|$|A lost ball or a ball hit out {{of bounds}} result in a penalty of one stroke and {{distance}} (Rule 27–1). A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's equipment causes the ball to move or the removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move (Rule 18–2). A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's ball results into a red or yellow staked hazard (Rule 26). If a golfer makes a stroke at the wrong ball (Rule 19–2) or hits a fellow golfer's ball with a putt (Rule 19–5), the player incurs a two-stroke penalty. Most rule infractions lead <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> penalties but also can lead to disqualification. Disqualification could be from cheating, signing for a lower score, or from rule infractions that lead to improper play.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{controlled}} {{clinical studies}} of treatments used by chiropractors have been conducted, with conflicting results. Systematic reviews {{of this research}} have not found evidence that chiropractic manipulation is effective, {{with the possible exception}} of treatment for back pain. A critical evaluation found that collectively, spinal manipulation was ineffective at treating any condition. Spinal manipulation may be cost-effective for sub-acute or chronic low back pain but the results for acute low back pain were insufficient. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care are unknown. There is not sufficient data to establish the safety of chiropractic manipulations. It is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects, with serious or fatal complications in rare cases. There is controversy regarding the degree of risk of vertebral artery dissection, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>stroke</b> and death, from cervical manipulation. Several deaths have been associated with this technique and it has been suggested that the relationship is causative, a claim which is disputed by many chiropractors.|$|E
