500|$|In early 2005, Keyes {{sought to}} {{intervene}} in the Terri Schiavo case, arguing that Schiavo's life was protected by the Florida constitution, and <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Jeb <b>Bush</b> had final authority to determine the outcome of the case under state provisions. He attempted to meet with Bush to discuss the provisions of Florida law <b>that</b> authorized the <b>governor</b> to order Schiavo's feeding tubes reinserted—something Bush claimed he wished to do, but for which he said he lacked authority—but the governor declined to meet with Keyes. Keyes subsequently wrote an essay directed openly at <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush</b> titled [...] "Judicial review and executive responsibility", days after Schiavo's feeding tube had been removed.|$|R
2500|$|Glover was {{an outspoken}} critic of George W. Bush, calling him a known racist. [...] "Yes, he's racist.

50|$|In 2003, a {{committee}} predominantly composed {{of real estate}} developers was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush to solve Florida’s water disparity. Members were selected from the lobby group Council of 100 and in a 2003 report proposed “a system that enables water distribution from water-rich areas to water-poor areas,” or the transfer of water through pipelines from the state's northern regions to its more developed and drier southern cities. The Suwannee river region was declared by committee member Lee Arnold to be “sitting in the Saudi Arabia of water.” Representatives, citizens, and groups, such as the Florida Wildlife Federation, across the state argued <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush</b> curb development in the south as opposed to further contributing to the water imbalance and restricting municipal water use even more. Half the state's fresh water is consumed by South Florida, which includes Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and Palm Beach County {{as well as the}} majority of the state's agricultural land, golf courses, and swimming pools. Legally, water in Florida is owned by the state, with five water management districts overseeing its regional use and distribution. State law allows the transfer of water from one region to another, but it stipulates this action as a region’s last resort.|$|E

In the past few years the state of Texas, under the direction of Governor George W. Bush, has seriously considered the idea of cutting property taxes. Since schools are financed mainly through property taxes in Texas, this is an extremely important and volatile issue. I chose to conduct my research on this particular topic. In my project, I looked at the history and fairness of the property tax in Texas, and alternative solutions to this state's impending school finance crisis. To accomplish these tasks, I sent out questionnaires to 500 Texas residents, researched other states, and came up with two possible solutions. This thesis will show <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush</b> was right to pursue property tax relief, however, his methods for achieving an equitable and beneficial solution for Texas residents were flawed. Instead, the state of Texas should either implement a state income tax or use educational vouchers in place of the current property tax system...|$|E

5000|$|While the IG Act of 1978 {{requires}} that IGs be selected {{based upon their}} qualifications and not political affiliation, Presidentially appointed IGs are considered political appointees and are often selected, if only in part {{and in addition to}} their qualifications, because of their political relationships and party affiliation. CBS News obtained documents showing <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> Jeb <b>Bush's</b> chief of staff, Kathleen Shanahan, had left Janet Rehnquist an urgent message and asked her to put off an audit into an alleged $571 million overpayment to the State of Florida, which was discovered in 2002. Rehnquist quickly ordered a two-week delay of the audit. Two weeks stretched into five months, after which Rehnquist ordered her audit team to [...] "proceed with (an) audit in North Carolina first, then do Florida." [...] This put the audit well after Jeb Bush's election. It is alleged that Rehnquist then tried to halt an investigation by congress.|$|R
50|$|In 2000 Dockery {{authored}} a Florida Constitutional Amendment {{which required}} {{the construction of}} a high-speed rail network throughout Florida starting with a link between Tampa and Orlando. To implement the constitutional amendment the Florida High Speed Rail Authority was created by the Florida Legislature. He served as a member of <b>that</b> authority. <b>Governor</b> Jeb <b>Bush</b> got the constitutional amendment rescinded by the voters in 2004. Dockery has remained an enthusiastic supporter of high-speed rail, which surfaced again when President Barack Obama was elected in 2008 and pledged more than $2 billion for the construction and operation of the Tampa/Orlando link. Governor Charlie Crist supported the effort but it was again derailed with the election of Governor Rick Scott in 2010 at the urging of the Florida Tea Party, which was vehemently opposed to President Obama’s stimulus plans and the construction of the rail link.|$|R

500|$|On October 15, 2003, Schiavo's {{feeding tube}} was removed. Within a week, when the Schindlers' final appeal was exhausted, State Rep.

She was taken to Morton Plant Rehabilitation Hospital in Clearwater, where her feeding tube was surgically reinserted. She was then returned to the hospice. Part of the legislation required the appointment of a guardian ad litem (GAL), Dr. Jay Wolfson, to [...] "deduce and represent the best wishes and best interests" [...] of Schiavo, and report them to <b>Governor</b> <b>Bush.</b> Wolfson's report did not change Michael's role as her legal guardian and did not otherwise obstruct him legally.|$|R

5000|$|Margaret Ross Sammons {{describes}} the 1984 presidential election as the [...] "pinnacle {{of the abortion}} debate" [...] but asserts {{that the issue of}} abortion continued to be prominent in subsequent presidential elections. For example, in 1996, Cardinals Bernard Law and James Hickey urged Catholics not to re-elect President Bill Clinton after he vetoed a law banning intact dilation and extraction. In 2000, Catholic leaders reacted negatively to speculation <b>that</b> <b>Governor</b> George W. <b>Bush</b> was considering the pro-choice Catholic governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, as a possible running mate. In 2004, a number of bishops publicly declared that they would deny communion to Senator John Kerry because of his willingness to support laws protecting abortion rights despite a personal opposition to abortion. Although Kerry continued to receive communion throughout the election campaign, Sammons asserts that Kerry's campaign was sufficiently damaged by the threat to withhold communion that it may have cost him the election. Sammons argues that President George W. Bush was able to win 53% of the Catholic vote because he appealed to [...] "traditional" [...] Catholics.|$|R
