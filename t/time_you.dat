5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over <b>time</b> <b>you</b> figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

25|$|The movie {{takes place}} everywhere, {{and it takes}} place nowhere. It's a city built of pieces of cities. A corner from one place, another from some place else.

And men come to measure the grave and find it {{sometimes}} six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second <b>time</b> <b>you</b> will not find it to have the same length – and I myself have put this to the test.|$|E

I remembered thinking just a little further west they are making the films I want to see. I'm going to do this. Sink or swim... I wanted to be a writer on my way to being a director. Directors were already my heroes. Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland... One wanted a chance to tell stories in an open, loose, not constricted Hollywood kind of way. At the same <b>time</b> <b>you</b> wanted to work in Hollywood... I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.|$|E
