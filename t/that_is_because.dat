5|$|Such vast cargoes {{would be}} carried by boat {{as far as}} possible, by sea and/or river, and only the {{shortest}} possible distance overland. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> transport on water was far more economical than on land (as it remains today, although the differential is smaller).|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} accumulates around sets {{of points}} rather than single points themselves. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> each {{element of the}} sequence is itself a set, there exist accumulation sets that are somehow nearby to infinitely many elements of the sequence.|$|E
25|$|Al- is a {{particle}} (ḥarf) in the Arabic language. Like most (but not all) particles, {{it is not}} prefixed to other particles. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> particles are never in need {{of any of the}} lexical meanings or grammatical inflections provided by al-.|$|E

25|$|Surface Area: In {{reactions}} on surfaces, {{which take}} place for example during heterogeneous catalysis, {{the rate of}} reaction increases as the surface area does. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> more particles of the solid are exposed and can be hit by reactant molecules.|$|E
25|$|We have {{frameworks}} {{built into}} our system {{to integrate the}} findings of science into our religious and theological beliefs. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> {{we believe that the}} natural world, and the way it works, was created by God and therefore its workings must be consistent with our religious beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The set {{up of the}} house, {{especially}} when shown in television, makes the illusion {{that it is a}} one-storey house. But anyone who passes by the house can easily notice that its facade is that of a two-storey house. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the second storey houses parts of the control room. The actual front doors to the house area are actually further inside.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{provision}} for review or appeal of a grant of a warrant application, only of a denial. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> in both the FISC and the FISCA, the government - the party who seeks a warrant to conduct surveillance - is the only party before the court, and it is unusual for anyone else {{to become aware of}} the warrant application in the first place.|$|E
25|$|But {{although}} it benefited landless Roman commoners, land redistribution turned unintentionally into an economic {{disaster for the}} Italian allies, both rich and poor. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> only Roman citizens, and the holders of Latin rights (i.e. the Latin colonists), were legally able to hold Roman land. This meant that public land repossessed from big Italian landowners could not be redistributed to Italian commoners, and public land illegally occupied by Italian smallholders was also repossessed.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said (by the present-day {{explorer}} Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.|$|E

25|$|The study The Evolution of the Human Breast (2001) {{proposed}} that the rounded shape of a woman's breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> of the human infant's small jaw, which did not project from the face to reach the nipple, {{he or she might}} block the nostrils against the mother's breast if it were of a flatter form (cf. chimpanzee). Theoretically, as the human jaw receded into the face, the woman's body compensated with round breasts.|$|E
25|$|Surviving dust-jackets on {{the first}} edition are {{exceedingly}} rare. It is not known whether <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> of attrition or because some printings were not jacketed or because lots directed to some markets did not come with jackets. What is known is that jackets have been reported {{on more than one}} of the printings and most commonly {{on the first}} printing. The jacket is a medium blue field all around. The front announces the title in white, beneath which appears, in color and framed in red, Tolkien's illustration of Hobbiton. The reverse displays Tolkien's illustration of Smaug on his trove, also in color.|$|E
25|$|With {{their loss}} to Texas A, Texas looked {{north to the}} Oklahoma vs. Oklahoma State Bedlam Series rivalry. If the Oklahoma State Cowboys had {{defeated}} the Oklahoma Sooners, then Texas would still have played in the Big 12 Championship Game {{with a chance to}} play in the Fiesta Bowl. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> both the Longhorns and the Sooners would have had a 6–2 conference record, but the Longhorns would have won the tie-breaker by virtue of winning the head-to-head game against Oklahoma. Oklahoma won the game, however, so the next game for Texas would be their bowl bid, with speculation originally centering on the Cotton Bowl Classic or Gator Bowl on New Year's Day. The Holiday Bowl and the Alamo Bowl were also mentioned as possibilities.|$|E

25|$|Molecular {{distillation}} is {{vacuum distillation}} below {{the pressure of}} 0.01 torr. 0.01 torr is one order of magnitude above high vacuum, where fluids are in the free molecular flow regime, i.e. the mean free path of molecules {{is comparable to the}} size of the equipment. The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils.|$|E
25|$|For any set {{of numbers}} (or, more generally, values from some total order), one may form a {{binary search tree}} in which each number is {{inserted}} in sequence as a leaf of the tree, without changing {{the structure of the}} previously inserted numbers. The position into which each number should be inserted is uniquely determined by a binary search in the tree formed by the previous numbers. For instance, if the three numbers (1,3,2) are inserted into a tree in that sequence, the number 1 will sit {{at the root of the}} tree, the number 3 will be placed as its right child, and the number 2 as the left child of the number 3. There are six different permutations of the numbers (1,2,3), but only five trees may be constructed from them. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the permutations (2,1,3) and (2,3,1) form the same tree.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E

30|$|Neville, 2011 {{stated that}} the {{increasing}} in compressive strength with age <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of continuation of hydration of anhydrate cement with time which composes a new output of hydration within the mortar mass [15].|$|R
25|$|Attachment theory, an {{influential}} theoretical {{framework for the}} study of intimate relationships and personality development, argues that all humans are born with the capacity and motivation to engage in caregiving behaviours aimed at providing protection and support to close others. These behaviours are organized by an innate behavioural system, called the caregiving system, which is believed to have emerged over the course of primate evolution to ensure the survival of vulnerable offspring. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> infants in many primate species, including humans, are highly altricial (i.e., developmentally immature and helpless at birth), they cannot survive without caregiver support and protection. Attachment theory proposes that this evolutionary pressure favoured the emergence of the caregiving behavioural system, which functions to safeguard the vulnerable dependent from harm by providing him or her with protection, comfort, and help during times of threat or need. Although this system was first conceptualized in child–parent bonds, its operation has since been established in adult intimate relationships, where both partners may occasionally take on the role of caregiver.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{due to the}} {{presence}} of the ground, there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV ghosting) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses horizontal polarization. At low frequencies especially, horizontal polarization is avoided. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the horizontal direction will receive both the direct and reflected wave, which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of radar pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, back scattering of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as specular reflection of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.|$|E
500|$|The sportswriter Bruce Copeland {{compiled}} the 1920 All-Pro list, but no {{players from}} the All-Americans were on it. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Copeland wrote for the Rock Island Argus and did not see any {{players from the}} easternmost teams in the league. [...] As of 2012, no player from the 1920 All-Americans has been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
