Humans {{have the ability to}} reflect on their behaviours to determine if their actions are moral. In situations of trauma, humans can choose to self-forgive by allowing themselves to change and live a moral life. Self-forgiveness may be required in situations where the individual hurt themselves or in situations where <b>they</b> <b>hurt</b> others.|$|E

25|$|Failure {{to secure}} the {{population}} meant that the VC were able to tighten their grip- drawing a continual supply of recruits, food, intelligence, shelter and other resources to maintain their insurgency. The American concept of leaving the relatively ineffective ARVN {{to cope with this}} key other war, a task they had often failed at in several years prior to US intervention, played into the NLF's hands. In many cases where the population was separated from the insurgents via forced relocations, destruction of villages or generation of refugees, conditions still remained insecure, undermining GVN/US attempts at both pacification and attrition. Impressive as they seemed, big American or GVN sweeps inevitably moved on, failing to 'hold' an area and its population. Once their opponents had gone, the VC and NVA were able to return and resume business. This pattern is reflected even {{in the aftermath of the}} Tet attacks. <b>They</b> <b>hurt</b> the Viet Cong badly in military terms, and northern-born personnel were to increasingly dominate the Main-Force VC formations. However the critical population control and infrastructure effort continued, and the VC were still able to muster about 85,000 fresh recruits annually.|$|E

500|$|The show's writers {{presented}} Todd's personality as {{a combination}} of dark humor, uncouth behavior, and {{the essence of a}} tortured soul; he often delivers one-liners that range from humorous to sadistic. Soap opera columnist Jenn Bishop stated that Todd's personality is [...] "violent, gentle, caring, apathetic, smart, obsessive, crazy, irrational, devilish, heroic, angst-filled, comical, etc." [...] and that [...] " [...] loves, but he feels he's unworthy of true love because of the things he's done. He doesn't love himself and projects a facade of a confident, arrogant playboy, but underneath it all, he's someone who seeks an unattainable love". Columnist Jill Berry, who saw Todd as self-centered in the extreme, said that although Todd desperately wants to be loved, he is unable to give or receive it, and when he is loved, he will destroy it. She did acknowledge Todd's capability of loving his children, which he expressed by doing [...] "crazy and illegal things to prove it", but felt that much of the difficulty he experiences is brought on by himself and that he is incapable of learning from his mistakes even when <b>they</b> <b>hurt</b> the people he loves. She said Todd is in need of [...] "intensive therapy", which will never work because he refuses to change. [...] For example, as portrayed by St. John in 2006, he fights for the custody of his son, Sam, but he is motivated by anger that he has been lied to and revenge more than by a desire to recover his child.|$|E
500|$|In January 2001, a United States {{federal appeals}} court upheld the {{dismissal}} of the Church of Scientology International's case against Time Warner. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published [...] "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power" [...] with an actual intent of malice, a standard that must be met for libel cases involving individuals and public groups. On October 1, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church's libel case Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner Inc., 00-1683. Time Warner said it refused to be [...] "intimidated by the church's apparently limitless legal resources." [...] In arguments presented to the Supreme Court, the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had [...] "committed improper acts" [...] in the past, but also claimed that: [...] "allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted, {{the result of the}} misunderstanding, suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion". Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they [...] "provide a safe harbor for biased journalism". Behar commented on the Church of Scientology's legal defeat, and said that the lawsuit had a chilling effect: [...] "It's a tremendous defeat for Scientology... But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass, not to win, so from that perspective <b>they</b> <b>hurt</b> us all. They've had a real chilling effect on journalism, both before and after my piece".|$|E

[...] "I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, and so I think at some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that, but maybe that's wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing if <b>they</b> <b>hurt</b> anyone ...

2500|$|Jimmy Jacobs, who co-managed Mike Tyson, used a {{synchronizer}} {{to measure}} young Ali's punching speed versus Sugar Ray Robinson, a welter/middleweight who was considered pound-for-pound the best fighter in history. Ali was 25% faster than Robinson, even though Ali was 45–50pounds heavier. Ali's punches produced approximately 1,000pounds of force. [...] "No matter what his opponents heard about him, they didn't realize how fast he was {{until they got}} in the ring with him", Jacobs said. The effect of Ali's punches was cumulative. Charlie Powell, who fought Ali early in Ali's career and was knocked out in the third round, said: [...] "When he first hit me I said to myself, 'I can take two of these to get one in myself.' But {{in a little while}} I found myself getting dizzier and dizzier every time he hit me.

2500|$|In 2008, Israel accused Al Jazeera of bias.

[...] Israeli officials backed their claim by saying Al Jazeera had covered the Gaza incursion but not the Palestinian rocket attacks against the Israeli city of Ashkelon. Wahabi said that the Israeli Foreign Ministry would send letters of complaint to the government of Qatar and Al Jazeera. Officials of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party also accuse Al Jazeera of being biased in favour of Hamas, with which it is at political loggerheads, and prominent Fatah official and former Gaza strongman Mohammed Dahlan has organized a lawsuit against the broadcaster.|$|E

2500|$|Reading {{the words}} of [...] "And the Lord was with Joseph, {{and he was a}} prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian," [...] the Zohar taught that {{wherever}} the righteous walk, God protects them and never abandons them.
