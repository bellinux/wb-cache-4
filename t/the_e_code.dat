40|$|Abstract. Giotto is a platform-independent {{language}} for specifying software for high-performance control applications. In this paper {{we present a}} new approach to the compilation of Giotto. Following this approach, the Giotto compiler generates code for a virtual machine, called the E machine, which can be ported to different platforms. The Giotto compiler also checks if the generated E code is time safe for a given platform, that is, if the platform offers sufficient performance to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>E</b> <b>code</b> is executed in a timely fashion that conforms with the Giotto semantics. Time-safety checking requires a schedulability analysis. We show that while for arbitrary E code, the analysis is exponential, for E code generated from typical Giotto programs, the analysis is polynomial. This supports our claim that Giotto identifies a useful fragment of embedded programs. ...|$|E
40|$|The Embedded Machine is {{a virtual}} machine that mediates in real time the {{interaction}} between software processes and physical processes. It separates the compilation of embedded programs into two phases. The first phase, the platform-independent compiler phase, generates E code (code executed by the Embedded Machine), which supervises the timing, not the scheduling of, application tasks relative to external events such as clock ticks and sensor interrupts. E code is portable and, given an input behavior, exhibits predictable (i. e., deterministic) timing and output behavior. The second phase, the platform-dependent compiler phase, checks the time safety of <b>the</b> <b>E</b> <b>code,</b> that is, whether platform performance (determined by the hardware) and platform utilization (determined by the scheduler of the operating system) enable its timely execution. We have used the Embedded Machine to compile and execute high-performance control applications written in Giotto, such as the flight control system of an autonomous model helicopter...|$|E

Study Design: Retrospective hospital-based analytical study. Place and Duration of Study: This study was based on the 2010 data of 13 Belgian hospitals. Methodology: Based on 16406 cases of patients with a least an <b>E</b> <b>code</b> (ICD- 9 -CM); Pearson’s chi-squaretests, simple logistic regressions and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to assess the variations between distributions of the investigated factors according to the injury’s groups. Results: Among all <b>the</b> <b>E</b> <b>codes,</b> prevalence of suicide and self-inflicted injury was equal to 10. 6 %. The poisoning was the major reported diagnosis. There were significantly more discharges without consent in the suicide group than in the others. The length of stay was lowest in the suicide group compared to <b>the</b> others <b>E</b> <b>codes</b> group. <b>The</b> several median costs were always highest among the men, but, regarding the median percentage of the pharmaceutical products, the value was highest among the women.

Aims: To analyze {{the sensitivity of the}} ICD E codes for drowning. To describe the pattern and trend of drowning deaths that are classified with E codes other than for drowning. Setting: Finland, 1969 – 2000. Methods: Mortality files of Statistics Finland were searched electronically using the injury codes (I codes) and E codes for drowning. Cross analysis of I and E coded drownings was performed to determine the rate and pattern of drowning cases classified with E codes other than for drowning. Time trends were calculated using the Poisson regression model. Results: Of 13 705 drowning deaths, 644 (4. 7 %) were not identified with the E codes for drowning. The great majority (n= 547, 84. 9 %) of these cases were traffic accidents resulting in drowning. No sig-nificant time trends were found even after the introduction, in 1996, of the ICD 10 th revision. Conclusions: In Finland, underestimation of overall drowning rates using <b>the</b> <b>E</b> <b>code</b> alone is less pro-nounced than in countries where similar studies have been performed.

Minnesota was ranked 6 th in the United States for total sales of agricultural product, with just over $ 13 {{billion in sales}} in the year 2011. Only 1. 1 % of Minnesota's workforce was employed in agriculture for the year 2011. However, this small portion of Minnesota's workforce {{has one of the}} highest fatality rates, with 28 (40 %) of the 70 work-related deaths that occurred in the year 2010. While the number of agricultural fatalities that have occurred in Minnesota is well documented, non-fatal injuries are not. To address this issue the Minnesota hospital discharge data set was used to create counts, rates, and trends of agricultural injury for 2000 - 2011. The Cost of Illness model was then used to create estimates of the economic burden of agricultural injuries in Minnesota for 2004 - 2010. Using a set of seven E codes, more than 2, 000 injuries annually with a relationship to agriculture were identified. The identified cases were categorized into probable or possible depending upon <b>the</b> <b>E</b> <b>code</b> present in the record. These designations were created as two of the E codes, E 849. 1 (occurred on a farm) and E 919. 0 (a relationship to agricultural machinery), have a greater specificity for a relationship to agriculture than the remaining E codes. Over 500 cases were identified annually with a probable case designation. Trend analysis of all identified cases found a non-significant average increase of 1. 5 % annually for the time period, 2000 - 2011. Estimated annual costs (2010 dollars) for agricultural injury ranged between $ 21 and $ 31 million annually for 2004 - 2010. The majority of the costs are attributed to the indirect costs and the costs associated with fatal injuries. These estimated costs were found to be of similar magnitude to costs for motor vehicle and bicycle accidents, diabetes, and heart disease in Minnesota. This research demonstrates that hospital discharge data provides a readily available source of information for tracking agricultural injury, allowing for limited surveillance and evaluation of future intervention endeavors and policy implementation. The magnitude of the associated costs argue for better surveillance of these injuries, as well as evaluation of future interventions and policy to prevent agricultural injury...|$|E

40|$|Mini-F is {{a segment}} of the conjugative plasmid F {{consisting}} of two origins of replication flanked by regulatory regions, which ensure a normal control of replication and partitioning. Adjacent to the ori- 2 origin is a complex coding region that consists of <b>the</b> <b>E</b> gene overlapped by three open reading frames with the coding potential for 9000 Mr polypeptides here designated 9 kd- 1, 9 kd- 2 and 9 kd- 3. In this paper, we show that open reading frame 9 kd- 3 is preceded by active promoter and Shine-Dalgarno sequences. <b>The</b> <b>E</b> <b>coding</b> region specifies: (1) an initiator of replication, which acts at the ori- 2 site; (2) a function that negatively regulates the expression of <b>the</b> <b>E</b> gene; and (3) a function involved in mini-F copy number control. To assign one of these functions to one of the overlapping coding sequences, we have isolated, characterized and sequenced mutations mapping in <b>the</b> <b>E</b> <b>coding</b> region. In this paper, we analyse two mutations (cop 5 and pla 25) that abolish the repression of <b>the</b> <b>E</b> gene. As these mutations affect the primary structure of protein E itself but not the 9 kd polypeptides, we conclude that protein E takes part in the negative regulation of its own synthesis. In addition, the localization of the cop 5 and pla 25 mutations indicates that the carboxy-terminal end of <b>the</b> <b>E</b> protein is involved in the autorepression function. The cop 5 mutation causes an eightfold increase of the mini-F copy number. The pla 25 mutation leads to the inability of the derived mini-F plasmid to give rise to plasmid-harbouring bacteria. The ways in which the cop 5 and pla 25 mutations may lead to such phenotypes are discussed in relation to the different functions mapping in <b>the</b> <b>E</b> <b>coding</b> sequence. © 1986.

40|$|Abstract Swine are an {{important}} host of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The two membrane glycoproteins of JEV, prM and E, each contain a potential N-linked glycosylation site, at positions N 15 and N 154, respectively. We constructed plasmids that contain the genes encoding wild-type prME (contain the signal of the prM, the prM, and <b>the</b> <b>E</b> <b>coding</b> regions) and three mutant prME proteins, in which the putative N-linked glycosylation sites are mutated individually or in combination, by site-directed mutagenesis. The recombinant plasmids were used as DNA vaccines in mice. Our results indicate that immunizing mice with DNA vaccines that contain the N 154 A mutation results in elevated levels of interleukin- 4 secretion, induces the IgG 1 antibody isotype, generates greater titers of anti-JEV antibodies, and shows complete protection against JEV challenge. We conclude that mutation of the putative N-glycosylation site N 154 in <b>the</b> <b>E</b> protein of JEV significantly enhances the induced humoral immune response and suggest that this mutant should be further investigated as a potential DNA vaccine against JEV. </p...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of our research}} is to design practical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes which provide {{a wide range of}} code rates in a rate-compatible fashion. To this end, we first propose a rate-compatible puncturing algorithm for LDPC codes at short block lengths (up to several thousand symbols). The proposed algorithm is based on the claim that a punctured LDPC code with a smaller level of recoverability has better performance. The proposed algorithm is verified by comparing performance of intentionally punctured LDPC codes (using the proposed algorithm) with randomly punctured LDPC codes. The intentionally punctured LDPC codes show better bit error rate (BER) performances at practically short block lengths. Even though the proposed puncturing algorithm shows excellent performance, several problems are still remained for our research objective. First, how to design an LDPC code of which structure is well suited for the puncturing algorithm. Second, how to provide a wide range of rates since there is a puncturing limitation with the proposed puncturing algorithm. To attack these problems, we propose a new class of LDPC codes, called efficiently-encodable rate-compatible (<b>E</b> 2 RC) <b>codes,</b> in which the proposed puncturing algorithm concept is imbedded. <b>The</b> <b>E</b> 2 RC <b>codes</b> have several strong points. First, the codes can be efficiently encoded. We present low-complexity encoder implementation with shift-register circuits. In addition, we show that a simple erasure decoder can also be used for the linear-time encoding of these codes. Thus, we can share a message-passing decoder for both encoding and decoding in transceiver systems that require an encoder/decoder pair. Second, we show that the non-systematic parts of the parity-check matrix are cycle-free, which ensures good <b>code</b> characteristics. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>E</b> 2 RC <b>codes</b> having a systematic rate-compatible puncturing structure show better puncturing performance than any other LDPC codes in all ranges of code rates. The throughput performance of incremental redundancy (IR) hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) systems highly depends on the performance of high-rate <b>codes.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>E</b> 2 RC <b>codes</b> show excellent puncturing performance in all ranges of code rates, especially at high puncturing rate, we verify that <b>E</b> 2 RC <b>codes</b> outperform in throughput than other LDPC codes in IR-HARQ systems.

25|$|Analysis of {{potential}} molecules that could form the first hypercycles in nature prompted {{the idea of}} coupling an information carrier function with enzymatic properties. At {{the time of the}} hypercycle theory formulation, enzymatic properties were attributed only to proteins, while nucleic acids were recognized only as carriers of information. This led to the formulation of a more complex model of a hypercycle with translation. The proposed model consists of a number of nucleotide sequences I (I stands for intermediate) and the same number of polypeptide chains E (E stands for enzyme). Sequences I have a limited chain length and carry the information necessary to build catalytic chains <b>E.</b> <b>The</b> sequence I'i provides the matrix to reproduce itself and a matrix to build the protein E'i. The protein E'i gives the catalytic support to build the next sequence in the cycle, I'i+1. The self-replicating sequences I form a cycle consisting of positive and negative strands that periodically reproduce themselves. Therefore, many cycles of the +/− nucleotide collectives are linked together by the second-order cycle of enzymatic properties of E, forming a catalytic hypercycle. Without the secondary loop provided by catalysis, I chains would compete and select against each other instead of cooperating. The reproduction is possible thanks to translation and polymerization functions encoded in I chains. In his principal work, Manfred Eigen stated that <b>the</b> <b>E</b> <b>coded</b> by <b>the</b> I chain can be a specific polymerase or an enhancer (or a silencer) of a more general polymerase acting in favour of formation of the successor of nucleotide chain I. Later, he indicated that a general polymerase leads to the death of the system. Moreover, the whole cycle must be closed, so that E'n must catalyse I1 formation for some integer n > 1.|$|R
