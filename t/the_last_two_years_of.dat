5|$|The {{primary reason}} {{construction}} halted {{on the four}} ships was the shifting of construction materials and manpower from capital ships to U-boats in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war.

5|$|Howe's health {{declined}} in 1934, {{and he was}} hospitalized for heart problems and breathing difficulties. He spent <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his life {{in and out of}} Bethesda Naval Hospital. Though he experienced increasing periods of confusion, he continued to give orders to his staff by telephone; Roosevelt had instructed them to treat Howe's calls with courtesy, but to double-check his instructions with himself and other staff. Howe died on April 18, 1936. Roosevelt gave him a state funeral three days later in the White House East Room.|$|E

5|$|Woodall is the {{youngest}} of six children, including three half-siblings from her father's first marriage. Her father was a banker, while her maternal grandfather was Sir John Duncanson, controller of the British steel industry in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war, {{who went on to}} become managing director of the British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF) in August 1945 and then managing director of Lithgows in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1896 in Timaru, New Zealand, {{he joined}} the New Zealand Military Forces in 1914 as a cadet and served with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force from 1916 in the Middle East for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the First World War. After the war he held a number of staff {{positions}} in New Zealand and abroad. He saw active service during the Second World War {{as part of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division. He was made a prisoner of war in August 1944 and spent most of the final months of the war in captivity in Germany. After the war he commanded J Force while it was engaged in occupation duties in Japan. While Chief of General Staff, he oversaw the deployment of New Zealand's military personnel to Korea to assist the United Nations during the Korean War. He retired from the military in 1954 and died in Kawakawa, in 1972.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{rock and roll}} was faltering as its major stars dropped from public view. Elvis Presley was drafted, Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran died in 1959 and 1960 respectively, Chuck Berry was in jail, and Jerry Lee Lewis had been disgraced by press reports that he married his 13-year-old cousin. Music and culture critic Nelson George disagrees with music historians who attest <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 1950s were barren of talent, {{pointing}} to Charles and this song in particular. George writes that the themes in Charles' work were {{very similar to the}} young rebels who popularized rock and roll, writing By breaking down the division between pulpit and bandstand, recharging blues concerns with transcendental fervor, unashamedly linking the spiritual and the sexual, Charles made pleasure (physical satisfaction) and joy (divine enlightenment) seem the same thing. By doing so he brought the realities of the Saturday-night sinner and Sunday-morning worshipper—so often one and the same—into raucous harmony.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Bowers {{returned}} to Nevada. Her hearing had diminished significantly, {{and she was}} forced to give up the scrying business as she was unable to hear the requests of her clients. She launched a claim against the government asking for financial assistance in return for the $14,000 she and Sandy Bowers had donated to support the Union cause in the Civil War and to finance the 1860 Paiute War, but was ignored. Destitute, she was placed in the Washoe County poorhouse, and became the subject of a protracted legal dispute between the governments of Nevada and California over who was to pay for her care. In August 1901 it was agreed that California would take responsibility for her welfare, and she was summarily put on a San Francisco-bound train by Reno officials with $30 cash. For <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> her life she lived at the King's Daughters Home in Oakland, dying on October 27, 1903. Her ashes were returned to Nevada and buried alongside Sandy and Margaret at the Bowers Mansion.|$|E
5|$|McCabe married Edna May Linton on 5 February 1935 at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and {{the couple}} had two {{children}}, {{a son and a}} daughter, born in 1939 and 1950 respectively. The devout McCabe sent both of his children to Catholic boarding schools even though the family home was nearby. Plagued by ill-health in his middle age, McCabe’s fitness was further hindered by his feet, which prevented him from exercising. He thus gained a lot of weight, and heavy smoking wore down his body, as did the large amount of people who wanted to meet him. McCabe weakened significantly in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his life and was hospitalised for a period for liver problems. He was released from hospital soon before his death, but still aged 58, was a very frail man who moved very tentatively.|$|E

5|$|The {{work done}} on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 {{when one of the}} animators, while {{routinely}} clearing some files, accidentally started a deletion of the root folder of the Toy Story 2 assets on Pixar's internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacobs {{was one of the first}} to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. They shut down the file servers but had lost 90% of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> work, and the backups were found to have failed some time previously. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had backups of the assets on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.|$|E
