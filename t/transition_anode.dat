40|$|In {{order to}} develop high {{performance}} intermediate temperature (< 800 °C) solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with a lower fabrication cost, a pressurized spray process of ceramic suspensions has been established to prepare both dense yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte membranes and <b>transition</b> <b>anode</b> layers on NiO + YSZ anode supports. A single cell with 10 μm thick YSZ electrolyte on a porous anode support and ∼ 20 μm thick cathode layer showed peak power densities of only 212 mW cm- 2 at 700 °C and 407 mW cm- 2 for 800 °C. While a cell with 10 μm thick YSZ electrolyte and a transition layer on the porous anode support using a ultra-fine NiO + YSZ powder showed peak power densities of 346 and 837 mW cm- 2 at 700 and 800 °C, respectively. The dramatic improvement of cell performance was attributed to the much improved anode microstructure that was confirmed by both scanning electron microscopes (SEM) observation and impedance spectroscopy. The results have demonstrated that a pressurized spray coating is a suitable technique to fabricate high performance SOFCs and at lower cost. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The initial {{reversible}} capacity, {{a critical}} impediment in <b>transition</b> metal oxide-based <b>anodes,</b> is augmented in conversion-reaction-involved CoO anodes for lithium-ion batteries, by incorporating a chemically synthesized Ag nanophase. With {{an increase in}} the added amount of Ag nanophase from 5 to 15 wt %, the initial capacity loss decreases linearly up to 31. 7 %. The Ag nanophase maintains its pristine metallic nature without undergoing phase transformations, even during repeated vigorous electrochemical reactions of the active CoO phase. Complementary ex situ chemical/physical analyses suggest that the Ag nanophase promotes the catalytic generation of reversible gel-like/polymeric films wherein lithium ions are stored capacitively in the low-voltage region below 0. 7 V during discharging. These scientific findings would provide a heretofore unrecognized pathway to resolving a major issue associated with the critical irreversibility in conversion-type <b>transition</b> metal oxide <b>anodes...</b>|$|R

30|$|When {{testing the}} {{electrochemical}} performance of metal oxide anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), binder played important {{role on the}} electrochemical performance. Which binder was more suitable for preparing <b>transition</b> metal oxides <b>anodes</b> of LIBs has not been systematically researched. Herein, five different binders such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) HSV 900, PVDF 301 F, PVDF Solvay 5130, the mixture of styrene butadiene rubber and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SBR+CMC), and polyacrylonitrile (LA 133) were studied to make anode electrodes (compared to the full battery). The electrochemical tests show that using SBR+CMC and LA 133 binder which use water as solution were significantly better than PVDF. The SBR+CMC binder remarkably improve the bonding capacity, cycle stability, and rate performance of battery anode, and the capacity retention was about 87 % after 50 th cycle relative to the second cycle. SBR+CMC binder was more suitable for making <b>transition</b> metal oxides <b>anodes</b> of LIBs.|$|R

The electrochemical tests, including constant current charge discharge, cyclic voltammetry, rate performance, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were done by statistics.

A facile and efficient vapor-phase polymerization method has been developed to coat the ZnFe 2 O 4 hollow spheres with polypyrrole (PPY). The thin PPY coating improves not only the electronic conductivity but also the structural integrity, and thus the cycling stability of the ZnFe 2 O 4 hollow spheres.

The problem of the <b>transition</b> from one <b>anode</b> to the next has been solved with a novel linear encoding scheme, which exhibits essentially distortionless behavior at boundaries parallel to the conducting elements and only slight distortion at the orthogonal boundaries.

30|$|Due to {{the severe}} volume {{expansion}} and poor cycle stability, <b>transition</b> metal oxide <b>anode</b> {{is still not}} meeting the commercial utilization. We herein demonstrate the synthetic method of core-shell pomegranate-shaped Fe 2 O 3 /C nano-composite via one-step hydrothermal process for the first time. The electrochemical performances were measured as anode material for Li-ion batteries. It exhibits excellent cycling performance, which sustains 705  mAh g− 1 reversible capacities after 100  cycles at 100  mA g− 1. The anodes also showed good rate stability with discharge capacities of 480  mAh g− 1 when cycling {{at a rate of}} 2000  mA g− 1. The excellent Li storage properties {{can be attributed to the}} unique core-shell pomegranate structure, which can not only ensure good electrical conductivity for active Fe 2 O 3, but also accommodate huge volume change during cycles as well as facilitate the fast diffusion of Li ion.|$|R
40|$|Direct current (DC) {{plasma arc}} furnace {{technology}} {{has been used in}} industrial pyrometallurgical processes for many years, for applications including scrap steel remelting as well as the smelting of various metallurgical products such as ferrochrome, ferronickel, cobalt, ilmenite, magnesium, and platinum group metals. Central to the operation of the DC arc furnace is the direct current plasma arc: a high-temperature, high-velocity jet of ionised gas sustained and driven by interactions between the electric, magnetic, and temperature fields within the furnace. At industrial scale, the arc jet can operate at temperatures in excess of 20 000 K and reach supersonic velocities. In this work, the qualitative nature of the dynamic behaviour of DC plasma arcs at typical pilot-plant-scale current levels (500 – 2 000 A) was studied using both theoretical and experimental approaches. Previous work in this area has made use of consumer-class photographic equipment, and, due to the extremely short time scales characteristic of plasma arc motion (< 1 ms), much of the detail in the dynamics of the arc motion remained unobserved. In this case, however, an Olympus iSpeed 3 high-speed digital video camera was used to capture images of the arc column at between 5 000 and 30 000 frames per second in order to resolve the dynamic behaviour sufficiently. The results of these tests were then compared with the output from an advanced computational model of the plasma arc, with a number of novel phenomena and transition effects being observed in both sets of results. Helical motion and arc length <b>transition</b> effects, <b>anode</b> arcs, <b>transitions</b> between chaotic and pseudo-steady arc behaviour, and arc extinguishment were studied...|$|R
40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} with {{small particle size}} and large surface area exhibit excellent rate capability, however, their cyclic performances are normally limited by the intemperate side reaction with electrolyte, which is resulted from the large contact surface area of nanosized active particles with electrolyte. To avoid this issue, a relatively denser NiCoO 2 (NCO) hierarchical microspheres built by mesoporous thorn array are developed by pyrolyzing the agave-stricta-like NiCo(OH) 2 CO 3 thorn microspheres under nitrogen gas in this work. The analysed experimental {{results suggest that the}} hierarchical mesoporous nanostructure constructed by interconnected nanoparticles with a proper size (neither too small nor to large) shows a favorable BET specific surface area to well balance the rate and cyclic performance of <b>transition</b> metal oxide <b>anodes.</b> Compared to reported similar works, the as-prepared hierarchical NCO mesoporous microspheres deliver superior rate capability and greatly promoted cyclic stability, i. e. 844. 6, 627. 9 and 396. 6 mA h g- 1 at 80, 1600 and 4000 mA g- 1, respectively.

40|$|Nanometric mixed iron-titanium oxides were {{prepared}} by mechanical milling {{with a view}} to determining their ability to act as anodic materials in lithium cells. At a TiO 2 /Fe 2 O 3 mole ratio of 0. 4, a solid-state reaction occurs that leads to the formation of Fe 5 TiO 8, which possesses a spinel-like structure; at lower ratios, however, the structure retains the hematite framework. Li/g-Fe 2 O 3 cells exhibit poor electrochemical reversibility; by contrast, Ti-containing electrodes possess improved cycling properties. Changes in the electrodes upon cycling were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS data confirm the participation of electrolyte in the electrochemical reaction and the different type of electrochemical reversibility exhibited by samples. Both processes were influenced by the presence of titanium. Titanium dioxide, in the presence of iron oxides, seems to be inactive to the electrochemical process. Based on the step potential electrochemical spectroscopy (SPES) curves and photoelectron spectra obtained, the presence of Ti increases the reversibility of the redox reactions undergone by the electrolyte during discharge/charge processes. The increased active-material/electrolyte/inactive-material interaction which is reported here offers new perspectives for the use of well-known <b>transition</b> oxides as <b>anode</b> materials in Li-ion batteries...|$|R
40|$|Phase {{transitions}} in nanomaterials {{are the basis}} for their broad applications. However, due to the short length and fast kinetics at the nanoscale, gaining a mechanistic understanding of such transient processes is extremely challenging. In this dissertation, in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies have been performed to reveal the atomic-scale processes during vitrification of metallic liquids and to uncover the reaction and degradation mechanisms in lithium-ion battery electrodes. It has been a long-standing goal for scientists to vitrify single-element metallic liquids. Here, we report an experimental approach that successfully vitrifies melts of pure refractory body-centered cubic metals by achieving an unprecedented high liquid quenching rate of 10 ^ 14 Ks^− 1. The availability of monatomic metallic glasses being the simplest glass formers offers unique possibilities to study the structure-property relationships of glasses. Distinctive tendencies towards shear localization have been observed in sub- 100 -nm metallic glasses, which may {{shed light on the}} relationship between atomic structure and mechanical property of metallic glasses. Phase <b>transitions</b> in <b>anode</b> materials during battery operation often induce large volume change and pulverization. By building a nanobattery inside the TEM, the plasticity and strain accommodation in one-dimensional anode materials during lithiation/delithiation were, for the first time, visualized under atomic-scale resolution. Lithiation of SnO 2 nanowires was initiated by preferred lithium insertion along the (020) plane, which developed into multiple reaction fronts where stress-driven dislocation plasticity was found to be a precursor towards solid-state amorphization. Revealing the thermodynamics and kinetics in intercalation compounds has been technically challenging, due to the subtle structural changes associated with lithium intercalation/extraction. By tracking the evolution in the electron diffraction pattern of a multi-particle system consisting of 200 - 300 nanoparticles, we found that the lithiation of anatase TiO 2, previously believed to be biphasic, switches to a single-phase reaction with a high lithiation rate up to 60 C when the crystal size decreases to 20 nm. This dissertation provides a novel non-equilibrium processing methodology for investigating the fast kinetics and structures of supercooled liquids under deep quench, and advances the fundamental understanding of the mechanical degradation and the size-dependent kinetics and thermodynamics in nanostructured electrode materials. ...|$|R
30|$|Rechargeable {{lithium-ion}} batteries (LIBs) have received an interesting attention for their high energy density, high voltage, stable cycling, and environment-friendly properties. After the first announcement of commercialization of tin dioxide (SnO 2) {{as a negative}} electrode of {{lithium-ion batteries}}, this <b>transition</b> metal oxide <b>anode</b> has received much concern. There are still two main factors that hinder the development of SnO 2 for lithium secondary batteries: First, the de-/lithiation mechanism of SnO 2 could be described by a two-step reaction, the conversion reaction (SnO 2 + 4 Li+ + 4 e− → Sn + 2 Li 2 O) with the theoretical capacity of 712  mAh g− 1 and the alloying reaction (Sn + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixSn, 0 [*]≤[*]x[*]≤[*] 4.4) with the theoretical capacity of 782  mAh g− 1 [1, 2]. Accordingly, SnO 2 as an electrode material shows large initial irreversible capacity and low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE), about 52.4 % of the theoretical ICE value if conversion reaction is fully irreversible; {{that is more than}} twice of commercial graphite (372  mAh g− 1) [3]. Second, SnO 2 anode has still not been achieved mainly due to its capacity to rapidly fade during cycling, huge volume changes of up to 300 %, and the severe interparticle aggregation of SnO 2, which usually results in the loss of electrical contact with current collector caused by large volume changes and pulverization occurring during lithium insertion/extraction [4]. Various methods have been developed to overcome the abovementioned problems such as morphology and size control of SnO 2 nanoparticles [5 – 12] and SnO 2 -based composite materials [4, 13 – 21]. The multi-component materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene, have been employed to improve the conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as to buffer volume changes though with a complex preparation process and higher cost of C-based materials.|$|R
30|$|Figure  3 b {{shows the}} discharging/charging voltage {{profiles}} {{taken from the}} second cycle at various rates in the voltage range of 0.0 – 3.0  V vs. Li+/Li. The lithiation voltage shows a sloping profile below 1.25  V vs. Li+/Li, being consistent with the CV results. In addition, the CoO anode exhibits high discharging/charging capacities at different rates, such as 1205 / 1186, 1158 / 1156, 1141 / 1130, 1033 / 1021, and 423 / 410  mA h g− 1 at rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0  C. It is noticed that the specific capacities of the CoO anode at various rates are significantly higher than its theoretical capacity of 716  mA h g− 1. Large additional capacities were always observed in <b>transition</b> metal oxide <b>anode</b> materials, which are probably contributed by pseudocapacitance of nano-sized materials [2] or the formation of oxygen-rich transition metal oxide materials [17]. Furthermore, this electrode also shows good capacity retention, as its discharging/charging capacities can be recovered to ~ 1202 / 1196  mA h g− 1 when the rate returns to 5.0 from 0.1  C rate (Fig.  3 c). It is worth {{to note that the}} initial coulombic efficiency is ~ 81 %, much higher than those in other reports [2, 18]. In addition, the coloumb efficiency remarkably decreases when the charging/discharging current density increased from 1 to 5  C rate. This may result from the instability of the electrode during the drastic change of current, e.g., new SEI layer formed on the electrode surface. After four charging/discharging cycles, the coloumbic efficiency increases to 99 %, indicating the stabilization of the electrode. The cycling performance of the electrode is shown in Fig.  3 d. A capacity of ~ 981  mA h g− 1 is obtained at 1.0  C rate, and a slow decay to ~ 764  mA h g− 1 is found after 130  cycles. This is to say, only 0.17 % of the initial capacity is lost in each cycle. Moreover, the coulombic efficiency remains above 99 % during the cycling test.|$|R
30|$|Lithium ion {{batteries}} {{have become}} an ideal energy storage equipment and been applied in many portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, audio players, and laptop computers and in aerospace, energy, transportation, and other fields due to the advantages of high specific energy, high working voltage, light quality, long cycle life, small size, and less self-discharge [1 – 5]. Conventional LIBs use graphite as the anode material which was cheap, abundant, and stable for cycling. However, the further development of graphite LIBs has been hindered due to the low specific capacities (theoretically 372  mAh g− 1). As a consequence, searching for alternative anode materials was strongly required {{for the development of}} advanced LIBs [6, 7]. Recently, 3 d transition metal oxides (MO, where M was Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) were proposed to serve as high theoretic capacity <b>anodes.</b> However, <b>transition</b> metal oxide materials suffered from rapid capacity fade and high initial discharge specific capacity due to the enormous mechanical stress and pulverize during the charge-discharge cycles [8 – 10]. But during our experiment, we found electrode processing techniques {{played an important role in}} improving the cycle stability. In our previous research (2014) [11], octahedral CuO crystals were prepared and used as anode of LIBs, which show high discharge specific capacity and good cycling stability from the 2 nd to 50 th cycle with the binder of PVDF 301 F. But 2  years later, when using PVDF 301 F as binder, the same CuO anode showed significantly poor cycle performance that less than 100  mAh g− 1 after 50  cycles. The detailed reason was not clear, but it was certain that binder played an important role in preparing <b>transition</b> metal oxides <b>anodes</b> and researching the electrochemical performance. In order to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries, researchers were not only trying to create new electrode materials but also searching for new electrode processing techniques.|$|R
