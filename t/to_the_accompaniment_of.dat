5|$|Writing Kannada {{literature}} in native metres was first popularised {{by the court}} poets. These metres were the sangatya, compositions sung <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> a musical instrument; shatpadi, six-line verses; ragale, lyrical compositions in blank verse; and tripadi, three-line verses. However, Jain writers continued to use the traditional champu, composed of prose and verse. Important literary contributions in Kannada were made not only by court poets but also by noblemen, commanders, ministers, ascetics and saints associated with monasteries.|$|E

5|$|Kannada {{literature}} {{during this}} period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava faiths, {{and to a lesser}} extent to that of Jainism. Writing on secular topics was popular throughout this period. Authorship of these writings was not limited to poets and scholars alone. Significant literary contributions were made by members of the royal family, their ministers, army commanders of rank, nobility and the various subordinate rulers. In addition, a vast body of devotional folk literature was written by musical bards, mystics and saint-poets, influencing society in the empire. Writers of this period popularised use of the native metres: shatpadi (six-line verse), sangatya (compositions meant to be sung <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> a musical instrument), and tripadi (three-line verse).|$|E
5|$|The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife dance, {{is also a}} kind {{of weapon}} dance. The kailao is a {{standing}} male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance in a fierce manner to emulate combat, all <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> a slit drum or a tin box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere.|$|E

The single white egg is incubated by both adults, one sitting {{during the day}} while the other feeds on fish and squid at sea. Eggs, chicks and adults {{have been subject to}} predation by introduced cats and rats, and in the past have been taken for food by local shepherds. Predator control, and other measures such as the removal of grazing animals which trample the burrows, has enabled the population to recover to 6580 breeding pairs; it remains endangered on the IUCN Red List. However, conservation efforts had a major setback in August 2010 when fires killed three adults and 65% of the chicks.|$|E

5|$|Govinda Vaidya, {{a native}} of Srirangapatna, wrote Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya, a eulogy of his patron King Narasaraja I. Written in sangatya metre (a {{composition}} meant to be rendered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> a musical instrument), the book describes the king's court, popular music {{and the types of}} musical compositions of the age in twenty-six chapters. King Chikka Devaraja was the earliest composer of the dynasty. To him is ascribed the famous treatise on music called Geetha Gopala. Though inspired by Jayadeva's Sanskrit writing Geetha Govinda, it had an originality of its own and was written in saptapadi metre. Contemporary poets who left their mark on the entire Kannada-speaking region include the brahmin poet Lakshmisa and the itinerant Veerashaiva poet Sarvajna. Female poets also played a role in literary developments, with Cheluvambe (the queen of Krishnaraja Wodeyar I), Helavanakatte Giriyamma, Sri Rangamma (1685) and Sanchi Honnamma (Hadibadeya Dharma, late 17th century) writing notable works.|$|E
5|$|Superman Returns {{was shot}} using Panavision's Genesis digital camera. Production {{designer}} Guy Hendrix Dyas {{was influenced by}} Frank Lloyd Wright's Johnson Wax Headquarters {{for the design of}} the Daily Planet. ESC Entertainment was originally set to design the visual effects sequences, but Warner Bros. replaced them with the hiring of Mark Stetson from Sony Pictures Imageworks as the visual effects supervisor. A total of 1,400 visual effects shots were created. The script required a scene of Superman safely delivering a Boeing 777 in a baseball park where computer-generated imagery was used as it would have been impossible to assemble the number of extras for the shots. A second unit crew traveled to Dodger Stadium to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. The scenes of Metropolis was actually {{a modified version of the}} skyline of Manhattan. Using footage from the original Superman (1978) film as a reference point, Marlon Brando was re-created by Rhythm & Hues using CGI. The opening credits for Superman Returns are presented in an intended recreation of the style used for Superman, again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> John Williams's theme music.|$|E

25|$|The {{technique}} of guitar-playing gradually improved; the early trovadors, being self-taught, had rather limited techniques. Later, some tapped into classical guitar techniques <b>to</b> revive <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trova. Guyún (Vincente Gonzalez Rubiera, Stgo de C. 27 October 1908Havana, 1987) studied under Severino Lopez, {{and developed a}} modern concept of harmony, {{and a way to}} apply classical technique to popular Cuban music. He became more adventurous, yet still in Cuban vein, and in 1938 stopped performing to devote himself <b>to</b> teaching <b>the</b> guitar. This bore fruit, and two generations of Cuban guitarists bear witness to his influence.|$|R

25|$|First a new lyrical form called imayō (今様, modern style, {{a form of}} ryūkōka) emerged. Imayō {{consists}} of four lines in 8-5 (or 7-5) syllables.

25|$|The {{transition}} from the late-1970s disco styles to the early-1980s dance styles was marked primarily by the change from complex arrangements performed by large ensembles of studio session musicians (including a horn section and an orchestral string section), to a leaner sound, in which one or two singers would perform <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> synthesizer keyboards and drum machines.|$|E
50|$|Carissimi is {{also noted}} {{as one of}} the first composers of oratorios, with Jephte as {{probably}} his best known work, along with Jonas. These works and others are important for establishing the form of oratorio unaccompanied by dramatic action, which maintained its hold for 200 years. The name comes from their presentation at the Oratory of Santissimo Crocifisso in Rome. He may also be credited for having given greater variety and interest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> instrumental <b>accompaniments</b> <b>of</b> vocal compositions. Charles Burney and John Hawkins both published specimens of his compositions in their works on the history of music, while Henry Aldrich collected an almost complete set of his compositions, which are currently housed at the library of Christ Church, Oxford. The British Museum also possesses numerous works by Carissimi. Most of his oratorios are in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris.|$|R
40|$|Background: Ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} anomaly characterized by partial or complete adhesion of upper and lower eyelids. This condition is usually observed as an isolated finding; however, it {{is often associated with}} other anomalies or a well-defined syndrome. The etiology of this defect has not been identified yet. Case Presentation: Herein, we reported the case of a four-day-old male neonate who was unable to open his right eye at birth, which was due to adherent upper and lower eyelids as revealed in the physical examination. Family history of the patient was unremarkable. At sterile condition and under anesthesia, the adhesion of the eyelid was cut using a westcott scissor after holding the band of skin with forceps. Systemic and ocular examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Conclusion: Ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum is a {{congenital anomaly}} that can lead <b>to</b> amblyopia. <b>The</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> this defect with other congenital abnormalities may account for mortality. The early treatment of this anomaly through a simple surgery prevents amblyopia...|$|R

40|$|People {{with certain}} blood groups and Rh {{positive}} {{are more prone}} to infections transmitted by blood transfusion. The aim of this research was <b>to</b> survey <b>the</b> <b>of</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> ABO Blood Group System and Rh type with infection to hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus in Hamadan Blood Transfusion Organization, Iran. This was a retrospective study in patients during years 2006 - 2013 in Hamadan blood transfusion Organization. The population of blood donors were tested for blood borne infections, including HBsAg and HCV. Logistic regression was used and collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 16. The number of 1036 cases of referred population had a background of infected hepatitis B and C. Different blood groups had not a significant effect on the incidence of hepatitis B and C viruses. But the Rh difference had a significant effect so that people with Rh-negative, had the risk of incidences to hepatitis B as 0. 53 folds than positives while people with Rh-positive, had the risk of incidences to hepatitis C as 1. 87 folds than Rh-negatives. This study emphasizes that there is a more possibility for transmission of HBV and HCV infections for people with negative and positive Rh more than others do but it cannot be referred to a specific blood group. It is recommended that in planning of disease prevention in the country, broad spectrum of research will perform about the role of ABO system and Rh in afflicting to viral infections as the priority for sanitation authorities...|$|R
50|$|Eckard's sonatas follow no set {{pattern with}} regard to formal organization: half are in three movements, two consist of only two movements, and two others are cast in a rather {{extended}} single movement (op.1 nos.4-5). Unlike the sonatas of Eckard's émigré compatriots in Paris, none calls for accompanying instruments <b>to</b> heighten expression. <b>The</b> texture is enlivened at times by the contrapuntal involvement of the left hand; and in an effort <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> greater musical significance, Eckard did not restrict himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Alberti bass pattern, but used it rather as one of several devices. Although his thematic material is not particularly distinguishable from that of his contemporaries, Eckard's ability to develop it anticipates the mature works of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (e.g. op.1 no.2, first movement). His style shows the influence of C.P.E. Bach (op.1 no.3, first movement) and {{is similar to that}} of his fellow expatriate Johann Schobert (cf the first movements of Eckard's op.1 no.3 and Schobert's op.14 no.3). He also exerted a considerable influence on the young Mozart, who admired his works and adopted some of their traits in his keyboard music of 1762-4 (Mozart's accompanied sonata K6 is derivative of the first and third movements of Eckard's op.1 no.1). Furthermore, in 1767 Mozart transcribed one of Eckard's one-movement sonatas (op.1 no.4) as the slow movement of his Piano Concerto K40.|$|R

50|$|A old, {{bearded man}} in a tall stack of hats sleepily drives an {{unsteady}} horse-drawn carriage full of junk to a dump, where he unloads his cargo. Bottles descend from the precipice, shattering {{one on top of}} another, followed by pans, boots, and bric-à-brac. The well-dressed dummy that once sat prominently atop the eclectic pile tumbles down onto a discarded mattress and bounces from thence, landing on the hard ground and then being struck on the head by a flying cuckoo clock, coming to apparent consciousness as the clock's namesake bird struts forth to issue his mocking, namesake call. Having teased the doll, the bird chassés back to his wooden home, once more taunting his victim before entering. The doll, no longer dazed, happy to have found life, skips and slides merrily over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ruin of a piano, its keyboard and hammers intact, its soundboard and strings quite absent. The dummy places a nearby discarded box-spring such that its springs may stand in for the strings of an upright piano; he plays, singing the title song, scatting here and there, even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> percussive <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> his seat's slapping rhythmically against his backside.

40|$|Objective: Our aim was <b>to</b> {{determine}} <b>the</b> clinical <b>accompaniments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amphiphysin autoimmunity in the Turkish population. Patients and Methods: Sera of 6 {{patients with}} a subacute neurological presentation were selected because of their immunoreactivity pattern suggestive of amphiphysin-antibodies. Amphiphysin-antibody positivity was confirmed by immunoblots containing recombinant amphiphysin protein. Results: Two patients had limbic encephalitis, 1 myelopathy and 3 neuropathy. Breast, lung and endometrium cancers were detected in one patient each. Two patients had metastasis (of a bladder cancer and an unknown tumor) and no tumors {{could be found in}} one patient. Most or all patients exhibited normal imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings and poor response to immunosuppression. None of the patients' sera contained antibodies to other intracellular paraneoplastic antigens. Conclusions: Our cohort differs from the previously reported ones by reduced frequency of abnormal CSF findings, absence of other coexisting paraneoplastic antibodies and presence of tumor types that have not been previously associated with amphiphysin autoimmunity...|$|R
