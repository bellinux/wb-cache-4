5|$|The Hoare–Laval Pact of December 1935 was {{an attempt}} by the British Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval to end the {{conflict}} in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian sector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and Laval were forced to resign, and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> governments dissociated themselves from the two men. In June 1936, although there was no precedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations in person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in protecting his country.|$|E
5|$|The {{territorial}} dispute {{would not be}} fully resolved until the British conquest of New France in 1760, and the informal boundary between <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> in the dispute (the Missaguash River) now forms {{the border between the}} Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.|$|E

5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause of ongoing friction between <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French,</b> especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, and Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} writing, Notosusanto {{was active in}} student and {{political}} organisations, the student press, and academic conferences. With other students he picketed <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> embassies in Jakarta, supporting independence for Egypt and Algiers. He also travelled extensively, visiting Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, and the US on academic sorties. He completed his bachelour's degree in history from UI in 1958, becoming a lecturer at UI after graduation. On 12 December 1960 he married Irma Sawitri Ramelan (better known as Lilik). Together they had three children: Indrya Smita, Inggita Sukma, and Narottama.|$|E
5|$|Canopus was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean in early 1915 for the Dardanelles Campaign. She participated in major attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in March 1915, but <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> fleets proved incapable of forcing the straits. After the Gallipoli Campaign ended with the withdrawal of Allied forces in January 1916, Canopus patrolled the eastern Mediterranean, but saw no further action. She was removed from service in April 1916 and was converted into a barracks ship in early 1918. After the war, the ship was broken up in 1920.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community, the precursor to the European Union. In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.|$|E
5|$|In June 1939, Pontecorvo {{applied for}} a visa to visit Sweden, but his {{application}} was rejected. On 23 August came {{the news of the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. He joined the French Communist Party the next day as an affirmation of his personal faith in the Soviet Union. Marianne rejoined him in Paris on 6 September 1939, three days after <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> declaration of war on Germany in response to the German invasion of Poland that started the Second World War in Europe. They were married on 9 January 1940.|$|E
5|$|To {{attack the}} forts, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> {{assembled}} a fleet centered on four French and six British ships of the line, led by British Rear Admiral Edmund Lyons and the French Vice Admiral Armand Joseph Bruat. The British contributed a further seventeen frigates and sloops, ten gunboats, and six bomb vessels, along with ten transport vessels. The French squadron included three corvettes, four avisos, twelve gunboats, and five bomb vessels. The transports carried {{a force of}} 8,000 men from French and British army regiments {{that would be used}} to besiege the forts.|$|E

5|$|After the {{surrender}} of the Ottoman Empire to the Allies in October 1918, the city of Marash had come under the joint-occupation of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> armies (the latter largely composed of Armenians from the French Armenian Legion). In February 1919, Field Marshal Edmund Allenby appointed a number of French officers to oversee {{the administration of the}} region of Cilicia and the repatriation {{of tens of thousands of}} Armenians who had been deported during the war in the course of the Genocide. Within a few months, approximately 150,000 Armenians had been repatriated, including 20,000 natives from Marash.|$|E
5|$|After the war, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> {{intervened in}} the Russian Civil War; this {{included}} a major naval deployment to the Baltic Sea, which included Waldeck-Rousseau. Shortly after arriving, her crew mutinied due to poor living conditions {{and a desire}} to return to France. The unrest was quickly suppressed, and Waldeck-Rousseau joined the effort to support the Whites against the Red Bolsheviks. In May 1929, the ship was sent to French Indochina to serve as the flagship of the Far East squadron. She remained there until May 1932, when she returned to France, where she was decommissioned and hulked. Waldeck-Rousseau was ultimately scrapped in 194144.|$|E
5|$|Both sides had {{suffered}} severe damage and casualties, but both were also {{aware that the}} battle would inevitably be rejoined and so {{the aftermath of the}} British defeat was one of frenzied activity at Gibraltar, Algeciras and Cadiz. While <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> squadrons conducted hasty repairs, the French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz was prepared for a rescue mission, a heavy squadron arriving at Algeciras on 12 July. As the squadron departed with Linois's squadron, it was attacked again by Saumarez's squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras and caught at night by faster and more manoeuvrable ships, which resulted in the British inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish rearguard but failing to destroy the French squadron for a second time.|$|E

5|$|By 1800, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> {{had been}} at war for seven years and the British {{dominated}} the sea, following {{a number of significant}} victories over the French, Dutch and Spanish fleets. Off every French port, large squadrons of British ships of the line and frigates awaited French movements and whenever possible intercepted and destroyed French merchant vessels and warships. While British trading ships travelled in large, well-armed convoys, French ships were forced to slip between harbours to avoid the British blockade. To counter British control of the seas, the French periodically despatched squadrons of ships to raid British trade lanes, particularly off West Africa and in the South Atlantic, where the stretched Royal Navy maintained only minimal forces.|$|E
5|$|For {{two weeks}} <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> squadrons watched one another, the British unable to attack and the French unable to escape. In {{an effort to}} break the deadlock, Cochrane sent to Martinique for a body of 3,000 men under Major-General Frederick Maitland. With this force he {{launched}} a surprise invasion of the islands on 14 April, the amphibious operation commanded by Captain Philip Beaver in HMS Acasta and executed successfully with only minor casualties. Parties of seamen went ashore {{in the wake of}} the soldiers, working rapidly to establish a battery of two 8-inch howitzers on Morne-Russell. These guns began firing during the afternoon and by 20:00 Troude had given orders for his squadron to sail through the western channel during the night.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, as World War I was ending, the Royal Air Force {{built an}} {{airfield}} for two planes, and in November the Ottomans retreated from Zor Sanjak without a fight. The Syrian Emirate's army entered Deir ez-Zor on 4 December, and Zor Sanjak {{became part of}} Syria. In 1919, as <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> argued over {{the borders of the}} planned mandates, the British permanent military representative to the Supreme War Council Henry Wilson suggested adding Palmyra to the British mandate. However, the British general Edmund Allenby persuaded his government to abandon this plan. Syria (including Palmyra) became part of the French Mandate after Syria's defeat in the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920.|$|E

5|$|In {{the other}} naval theatres {{there were no}} decisive pitched battles. In the Black Sea, {{engagement}} between Russian and Turkish battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the Baltic Sea, action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the Battle of Moon Sound at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The Adriatic was {{in a sense the}} mirror of the North Sea: the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> blockade. And in the Mediterranean, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on Gallipoli.|$|E

5|$|Of the British rear ships, {{only two}} made a {{determined}} effort {{to break the}} French line.

The rest of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> <b>and</b> <b>French</b> rearguard {{did not participate in}} this close combat; HMS Montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with Neptune which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain James Montagu was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly. Next in line, HMS Ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking Brunswick, his brother's ship, in the confused action around Queen Charlotte.|$|E
