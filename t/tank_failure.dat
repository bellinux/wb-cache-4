40|$|Wind {{pressure}} {{is one of}} the major external influences that affect the reliability and durability of buildings and structures. Calculation of the wind load is very important in the design of tanks for storage of environmentally hazardous substances. In the case of a minor defect is not always possible to replace damaged element, so it is advisable to provide the safe operation of tanks, potentially containing some initial defects. One of the least studied problems is the combination of two or more defects in the area of destruction origin. Analysis of causes of <b>tanks</b> <b>failure</b> showed that in most cases it happens due to the stress concentration in the area of the defect or crack at low ambient temperature. That is why the way to reduce the wind load on the tank was proposed. Seventy five geometric models were built to test their effectiveness.

40|$|Metallic {{pressure}} tanks used {{in space}} missions are inherently vulnerable to hypervelocity impacts from micrometeoroids and orbital debris; thereby knowledge of impact damage {{and its effect}} on the tank integrity is crucial to a spacecraft risk assessment. This paper describes tests that have been performed to assess the effects of hypervelocity impact (HVI) damage on Titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) pressure vessels burst pressure and characteristics. The tests consisted of a pair of HVI impact tests on water-filled Ti- 6 Al- 4 V tanks (water being used as a surrogate to the actual propellant) and subsequent burst tests as well as a burst test on an undamaged control tank. The tanks were placed behind Aluminum (Al) shields and then each was impacted with a 7 km/s projectile. The resulting impact debris plumes partially penetrated the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V tank surfaces resulting in a distribution of craters. During the burst tests, the tank that failed at a lower burst pressure did appear to have the failure initiating at a crater site with observed spall cracks. A fracture mechanics analysis showed that the <b>tanks</b> <b>failure</b> at the impact location may have been due to a spall crack that formed upon impact of a fragmentation on the Titanium surface.

This study {{has been carried out}} according to Spain regulations, in particular, Royal Decree 183 / 2015 of environmental responsibility. The environmental risk assessment was performed using the Spain Natural Gas methodology unified with ERA procedure established by AENOR in UNE- 150. 008 - 2008 standard. Applying the methodology, different hazardous agents were identified in the LNG plant such as diesel, THT, hydraulic oil, sodium bisulfite, natural gas and others. They were also considered different initiating events (including <b>tanks</b> <b>failure,</b> pipeline ruptures and cisterns leakage) reaching different accidental scenarios where marine water and seabirds were the resources affected.
