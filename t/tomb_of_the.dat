5|$|The <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cisterns: this tomb is {{the most}} damaged in the necropolis. It {{consists}} of a double room burial; the earliest, (Q79A), was built at {{the same period of}} the <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> princess, and was badly damaged when the tomb was reused, and a dromos was built in the place of Q79A {{toward the end of the}} 17th century BC (leading to the founding of burial Q79B). This was probably the resting place of a king; a club (a symbol of royal power) was discovered in Q79A.|$|E
5|$|In the Pyramid Age, the <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{king was}} {{associated}} with a mortuary temple located close to the pyramid. As the <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king was hidden, this mortuary temple was located away from the burial, closer to the cultivation facing toward Thebes. These mortuary temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Giant, the {{earthworks}} {{belong to}} Lord Digby, {{rather than the}} National Trust. Its purpose is unknown, though it {{is thought to be}} the site of maypole dancing. It has been considered to be Roman, or perhaps an Iron-Age burial mound containing the <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> person represented by the Giant.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Minister of National Defense {{established}} a jack of the President of the Republic of Poland {{with the purpose}} of flying it on Polish Navy ships while the commander-in-chief is on board. The jack is identical in its design to the former Banner of the Republic of Poland. In 2005, the use of the presidential jack was extended to all branches of the Polish Armed Forces. It was first flown on land during a Constitution Day ceremony at the <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unknown Soldier in Warsaw on May 3, 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 a {{national}} Victoria Cross and George Cross memorial {{was installed in}} Westminster Abbey close to the <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unknown Warrior. Westminster Abbey is a living monument to British history in that it contains monuments and memorials to central figures in British History including Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and James VI & I. As such it was a significant honour for the VC to be commemorated in Westminster Abbey.|$|E

50|$|During Year 16 and Year 17 of Ramesses IX's reign famous tomb robbery trials took place, as attested by the Abbott Papyrus. A careful {{examination}} by a vizierial commission was undertaken <b>of</b> ten royal <b>tombs,</b> four <b>tombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chantresses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Estate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Divine Adoratrix, and finally <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> citizens <b>of</b> Thebes.

5|$|In 2013, Lundgren starred {{alongside}} Steve Austin in The Package. Directed by Jesse Johnson, principal photography {{wrapped in}} March 2012, {{and the film}} was released on February 9, 2013. For a direct-to-DVD film, The Package was not a financial success. In its first week of release, the film debuted at no. 81; grossing $1,469 at the domestic box office. He starred {{in a number of}} other films later that year, including Legendary: <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dragon, Battle of the Damned, Ambushed, Blood of Redemption, and the uncompleted comedy-western A Man Will Rise.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the empty cenotaph, another new form of memorial, the <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unknown Soldier, used the idea of burying one of the unidentified bodies from the war as a symbolic memorial {{to all of the}} lost soldiers. This idea had begun to emerge {{towards the end of the}} war, and was actively promoted by some British veterans' groups in 1919. Initially, however, it failed to gain traction with the government because of the success of the Whitehall Cenotaph, and a second memorial was felt to be unnecessary. Finally, in 1920, following lobbying by British cleric David Railton, Britain and France both decided to create a <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unknown Soldier, choosing an unknown body and creating a special memorial around it; the tombs were inaugurated on Armistice Day. The choice of location for the French tomb proved controversial, however, and it was not finalised until the following year, when the body was laid to rest under the Arc de Triumph. The concept proved popular, and encouraged similar memorials in other countries.|$|E

This included vegetable and meat stews cooked in pots, which had combinations such as beef and rice stew, dog meat and celery stew, and even deer, fish, and bamboo shoot stew. Seasonings mentioned in the recipes include sugar, honey, soy sauce, and salt. Recipes in the Han usually called for meat stuffed in cereals, cakes, and other wrappings.|$|E
5|$|The Nineteenth Dynasty saw {{a further}} {{standardisation}} of tomb layout and decoration. The <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first {{king of the}} dynasty, Ramesses I, was hurriedly finished due {{to the death of}} the king and {{is little more than a}} truncated descending corridor and a burial chamber. However, KV16 has vibrant decoration and still contains the sarcophagus of the king. Its central location makes it one of the more frequently visited tombs. It shows the development of the tomb entrance and passage and of decoration.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ruler of}} the dynasty, Setnakhte, {{actually}} had two tombs constructed for himself. He started excavating the eventual tomb of his son, Ramesses III, but broke into another tomb and abandoned {{it in order to}} usurp and complete the <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nineteenth Dynasty female pharaoh, Twosret. Therefore, this tomb has two burial chambers, the later extensions making the tomb one of the largest of the Royal tombs, at over 150 metres.|$|E

Tomb of Horrors was considered the third greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by the staff of Dragon in 2004. The module has influenced later Dungeons & Dragons products, and was followed by three other (unrelated) modules in the S-series: S2 White Plume Mountain, S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, and S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{lord of the}} goats: it is {{the largest}} in the necropolis; it {{includes}} two depositional chambers and is reached through a vertical shaft. The occupier of the tomb is not known with certainty, he is called the lord of the goats by archaeologists due to the existence of a throne decorated with bronze goat heads in the tomb. A silver cup that has the name of king Immeya inscribed was found in the tomb making that king the most likely owner of the burial.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> princess: {{dating to}} c. 1800 BC, {{it is the}} oldest and {{smallest}} of the third kingdom tombs found. Excavated in 1978, it contained {{the remains of a}} young woman, hence the naming. The dormos has steps, partially cut in the bedrock and partially paved with stones, leading to the chamber, which was achieved through the enlargement of a natural cave. The tomb is the only one not pillaged; it contained precious jewels and funerary objects.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with other}} BBC series {{broadcast}} in the 1960s, Doctor Who is well-represented in surviving episodes. Of the 253 episodes broadcast during the 1960s, 156 still exist – mainly due to copies produced for overseas sales. For example, Seasons 1 and 2, {{the most widely}} sold abroad of the 1960s era, are missing only 9 and 2 episodes, respectively. By contrast, the less well-sold Seasons 4 and 5 respectively have none and two complete serials between them, The <b>Tomb</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cybermen and The Enemy of the World from season five. Doctor Whos popularity and high-profile have also helped to ensure the return of episodes which, for other less well-remembered programmes, might never have occurred.|$|E
