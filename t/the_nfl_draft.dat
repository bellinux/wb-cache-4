5|$|The New Orleans Saints {{joined the}} National Football League (NFL) as an {{expansion}} team in 1967 and first {{participated in the}} 1967 NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting, more commonly known as <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft,</b> each NFL franchise annually seeks to add new players to its roster. Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second-worst picking second and so on. The team which wins the Super Bowl receives the last pick in the subsequent Draft, with the penultimate pick going to the losing team. Teams {{have the option of}} trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof. Thus, {{it is not uncommon for}} a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades.|$|E

5|$|The Atlanta Falcons, a {{professional}} American football team based in Atlanta, {{are part of}} the National Football Conference South Division. They joined the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team for the 1966 season and became the first NFL franchise in the Southeastern United States. They first participated in the 1966 NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting, more commonly known as <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft,</b> each NFL franchise annually seeks to add new players to its roster. Teams are ranked in reverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, the second-worst picking second and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous Super Bowl; the Super Bowl champion always picks 32nd, and the Super Bowl loser always picks 31st. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof. Thus, {{it is not uncommon for}} a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{possessed the}} first overall pick in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft,</b> {{and used it}} to select University of Miami quarterback Vinny Testaverde. The Buccaneers {{appeared}} changed and won four games early in the season, but they notably lost large leads in later games and fell from playoff contention after midseason. The season was marked by a 1987 players' strike in which regular play was interrupted for a month, while the NFL owners fielded teams of replacement players.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, a {{constant}} question {{hanging over the}} Virginia Tech Hokies football team was whether or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires that players be {{at least three years}} out of high school before they are eligible for <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft.</b> Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at the school, would be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{running back}} Kevin Jones drew media {{attention}} {{one day after}} Virginia Tech's selection for the Insight Bowl by announcing {{that he would be}} foregoing his final year of school in favor of entering <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft.</b> Jones was an All-America selection and broke a Virginia Tech single-season record by rushing for 1,494yards during the regular season. Speculation immediately turned to the fact that Jones could be the top running back taken in that year's draft.|$|E
5|$|After {{his high}} school career, Munnerlyn was {{recruited}} by South Carolina, West Virginia, and Kansas State. He chose South Carolina on January 13, 2006.

5|$|Some {{players who}} participated in the 2000 Sugar Bowl elected to delay their entry into <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft,</b> either because they hoped to finish their {{education}} or because they were not three years removed from their high school graduations and thus were not eligible to enter the draft. Examples of these players included Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to Florida State to complete his senior year, and Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick, who was not eligible to enter the draft in 2000, but who was taken with the first overall selection in the 2001 NFL Draft.|$|E

50|$|Curry {{was drafted}} fourth overall by the Seattle Seahawks in <b>the</b> 2009 <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft.</b> He was <b>the</b> highest drafted linebacker since LaVar Arrington went second overall in <b>the</b> 2000 <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft</b> to <b>the</b> Washington Redskins, {{and the highest}} Wake Forest Demon Deacon since Norm Snead went second overall to the Washington Redskins in <b>the</b> 1961 <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tigers {{had nine}} players <b>drafted</b> in <b>the</b> 2016 <b>NFL</b> <b>draft.</b> Shaq Lawson was picked first at 19th overall.

5|$|Tech cornerback Jimmy F. Williams, {{considered}} {{a cornerstone of}} the Hokie defense, was {{a finalist for the}} Nagurski Trophy that season, but lost to Louisville's Elvis Dumervil. Williams was Tech's sole first-team Associated Press All-American and also was named to the American Football Coaches Association, Football Writers Association of American and Walter Camp All-America teams. He recorded 44tackles and an interception for the Hokies in the regular season. Williams had foregone entering <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>draft</b> after the 2004 college football season in order to return to Virginia Tech for his senior season, and he was expected to be a high draft pick upon graduation.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 2008 season having won the 2007 ACC Championship Game, {{finishing}} with an 11–3 overall record {{that included a}} postseason loss to the Kansas Jayhawks in the 2008 Orange Bowl. Despite winning the ACC {{for the second time}} in less than four years, Virginia Tech was anticipated to spend 2008 rebuilding a team that saw 12 starters graduate or enter <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft.</b> Though picked in a preseason poll to win the Coastal Division, the Hokies were defeated in their season opener by underdog East Carolina.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the season, the Alabama defense led the nation in every major statistical category, and was the first to do so since the 1986 season. Additionally, several players were recognized for the individual accomplishments on the field. Barrett Jones won both the Wuerffel Trophy and the Outland Trophy; and Trent Richardson won the Doak Walker Award, was a finalist for the Heisman Trophy and was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Year. Also, seven players were named to various All-America Teams with Dont'a Hightower being a consensus selection and Mark Barron, Jones and Richardson each being unanimous selections. In April 2012, eight members of the 2011 squad were selected in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>Draft,</b> with an additional six signed as undrafted free agents to various teams.|$|E
