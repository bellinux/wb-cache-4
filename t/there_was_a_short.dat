5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> boom in 1923, {{after which}} GWR made heavy {{investments}} in adapting the hoists and tips in its docks and sidings {{to handle the}} 20-ton wagon, but the collieries were often unwilling to adopt the new size despite offers of rebates.|$|E
5|$|Other {{inquiries}} obtained similar {{testimony from}} witnesses, including {{the taxi driver}} who now stated that the activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> exchange of gunfire, {{and when he was}} removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR Justice Department to forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview.|$|E

5|$|The system {{initially}} {{had four}} standard gauge, single tracked lines, which had passing loops to allow trams to pass. Three originated at Stortorvet: the Gamlebyen Line, running east to Gamlebyen (now Old Oslo, but then called just Oslo); the Vestbanen Line, which ran west to Vestbanen station (Oslo West station); and the Ullevål Hageby Line, which ran west to Homansbyen, where the depot was located. In addition, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> connecting {{line between the}} Ullevål Hageby Line and the Vestbanen Line, but it was closed on 19 October 1875. The two lines that connected to the station only ran services that corresponded with train arrivals and departures; the other two lines had fixed fifteen-minute headway—decreasing to ten minutes from 22 June 1876. During the winter of 1875 and 1876, the company attempted to use sleds instead of wagons. They took delivery of seventeen units, but these were not as suitable as the wagons and the company instead chose to salt the rail tracks.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-hour}} delay, {{the race was}} restarted. Rahal {{suffered}} clutch problems on the restart, which placed him two laps down, while the other drivers ran behind the safety car, during which the marshalls showed {{the areas in which}} repair work had been conducted. Just prior to the restart, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> rain shower which made the track slightly slippy. Power lost one position on the restart, dropping to third. Franchitti, who was the closest driver to the front to have the softer compound red tires fitted gained two positions on the restart, moving up to fourth. The restart only lasted for six corners, before Castroneves spun in the wet conditions, and was then struck by Ed Carpenter. On the next corner, Josef Newgarden had slid into the wall and stalled, and a full-track caution was again called. The race was restarted with nine laps remaining, and Franchitti once more gained a position, passing Pagenaud to gain second. However, the race was almost immediately under a yellow flag again as E.J. Viso was spun by Marco Andretti, and stalled in the middle of turn four. From the ensuing restart, Dixon managed to maintain the lead from Franchitti, and the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers completed a second successive one-two finish.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the United States, Georgia geology has been included in maps produced for the entire country. The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. The results of his unaided endeavor were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, together with the nation's first geological map, which were published in the Society's journal Transactions, This precedes William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although Smith's map was constructed using a different classification of rocks. Several reports used Maclure’s geological map to accompany their description of the geology of the U.S. (Beaujour, 1814 and Marcou, 1858). In 1816, within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology, Parker Cleaveland produced a geological map of the U.S. In 1843, Charles Moxon produced a small-scale geologic map of the U.S., where Ami Boué produced a geological structure map of the globe. In 1853, Marcou produced a geological map of the U.S. and the British provinces of North America. In 1856, Henry Darwin Rogers created a similar map of the geology of the U.S. and British North America. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> description of the geologic map of the U.S. by Charles Henry Hitchcock in 1872, which had small-scale geological maps included. Hitchcock and William P. Blake published a general geologic map of the U.S. in R.W. Raymond’s Statistics of mines and mining. In 1874, they published a geological map of the U.S. and territories in the U.S. Census 9th Statistical Atlas. Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this map in the Geological Magazine in 1873. Gray’s geological map of the U.S. was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers. A geological map of the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1inch to 105.5 miles by Frank H. Bradley. In the 1880s several geological maps of the U.S. were produced. William John McGee offered a detailed description for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884. In 1887, Hitchcock produced a geological map of the U.S. and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of the U.S. that accompanied the geological map of the U.S. In 1895, McGee and J.B. Tolbert produced a 1:15,000,000 scale map of the geology of the U.S.|$|E

25|$|France finally {{reclaimed}} {{the islands}} after Napoleon's second abdication in 1815, and there followed 70 years of prosperity for the French fishing industry and residents. However, {{political and economic}} changes led to a slow decline of the fishing industry after the late 19th century. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> 13-year economic boom on the island associated with the period of Prohibition in the United States, when Saint Pierre and Miquelon were prominent bases for alcohol smuggling.

25|$|Aside {{from these}} various attacks and murders {{there were a}} number of other small attacks and skirmishes {{throughout}} the duration of the Black Hawk War. In the one-week period following Stillman's Run and before the Indian Creek massacre, militia men were ambushed at Buffalo Grove, where one militia member was killed, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>short,</b> bloodless battle at present-day Savanna along the Plum River. In June 1832 there were two attacks at Fort Blue Mounds in Michigan Territory that killed three militia men. A midJune attack at Spafford Farm killed five people total. At the end of June, following the attack on Ament's Cabin and important battles at Waddams Grove and Horseshoe Bend, two militia members were killed at Sinsinawa Mound in present-day southern Wisconsin.|$|E
