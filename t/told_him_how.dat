5|$|After the {{retirement}} of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, the Davis Cup team was now dependent on Murray having to win three matches, though Henman had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> wearing and time consuming that can be. While the LTA was funding Brad Gilbert, Murray was obligated to play for his country, but in November, Murray finished with Brad Gilbert as his coach.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{and former}} Arsenal player Mikel Arteta were {{neighbours}} {{on the same}} street {{while growing up in}} San Sebastián and also lived near each other in Liverpool. Alonso convinced Arteta to transfer to Everton after he <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> happy he was living in Liverpool. Alonso also helped persuade former Real Sociedad teammate Juan Ugarte to make a move to Wales by joining Wrexham in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In {{another story}} further {{upstream}} the Yangtze, the baiji {{was the daughter}} of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin, and the general a porpoise.|$|E

5|$|On {{one of her}} adventures, Riefenstahl met Luis Trenker, who was {{an actor}} from Der Berg des Schicksals. At a meeting {{arranged}} by her friend Gunther Rahn, she met Arnold Fanck, the director of Der Berg des Schicksals and a pioneer of the mountain film genre. Fanck {{was working on a}} film in Berlin. After Riefenstahl <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> much she admired his work, she also convinced him of her acting skill. She persuaded him to feature her in one of his movies. Riefenstahl later received a package from Fanck containing the script of the 1926 film Der Heilige Berg ("The Holy Mountain"). She made a series of films for Fanck, where she learned from him acting and film editing techniques. One of Fanck's films that brought Riefenstahl into the limelight was Die Weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü ("The White Hell of Piz Palü") of 1929, co-directed by G. W. Pabst. Her fame spread to countries outside Germany.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{investigators}} believed, if Donati {{had planned}} the Gardner theft {{it was to}} settle a gambling debt owed by a former security guard at the museum, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> lax the security was. Kurkjian offered another explanation for why Donati robbed the museum: he felt unsafe on the streets as long as Ferrara remained in custody, and hoped to use the art to bargain for his freedom, as Connor had done to reduce his sentence by arranging {{for the return of}} the BMFA's Rembrandt 15 years earlier.|$|E
50|$|By 1809, {{her husband}} had died. When Archbishop Joseph-Octave Plessis visited Chéticamp in 1812, Dugas <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of <b>how</b> she {{had been forced to}} {{relocate}} fifteen times over her life. She was buried at Chéticamp on October 16, 1817 at the age of 86.|$|R

25|$|Janković {{was then}} {{taken to the}} Staff Headquarters of the VRS 22nd Brigade in Kneževo, where he spoke to two survivors, Medo Sivac and Midhat Mujkanović, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> they had managed to survive by jumping down when the {{shooting}} started. He drove them personally to Banja Luka and later on they were transferred to the Islamic Humanitarian Association Merhamet. Jankovic said {{that because of the}} large number of victims he referred the case to the Public Safety Station in Banja Luka for further investigation and claimed {{that he did not know}} any further details concerning the perpetrators or victims.|$|E
25|$|The prince {{next came}} across a railway {{switchman}} who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> passengers constantly rushed {{from one place to}} another aboard trains, never satisfied with where they were and not knowing what they were after; only the children among them ever bothered to look out the windows. A merchant then talked to the prince about his product, a pill that eliminated thirst, which was very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. The prince replied that he would instead gladly use that extra time to go around finding fresh water, again underscoring the materialism and lack of spirituality of a world that knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

500|$|On 4 October 2006, it was {{announced}} that actress Nadine Lewington had been cast in the role of Maddy. Lewington had made a previous appearance in series 20, episode 22 of Holby City sister show Casualty. Lewington recalls of her role: [...] "I was a young married mum of one with another on the way. I loved my little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up. I threatened to leave him, Charlie Fairhead gave him what for and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> lucky he was to have me and he promised to be model father after all. Happily ever after. It was a really sweet little story actually. Very touching".|$|E
500|$|Director Mark Romanek {{has said}} that, {{as in the}} novel, {{everyone}} has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or {{try to figure out}} a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E

500|$|Morrissey's {{next major}} leading role was as Member of Parliament (MP) Stephen Collins in Paul Abbott's BBC serial State of Play (2003). Morrissey {{received}} the scripts {{for the first}} three episodes and was keen to read the last three. They had not been completed when he originally requested them but Abbott <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> Collins' story concludes. Unsure how to approach the role, Morrissey was advised by his friend, director Paul Greengrass, to get Collins' job as politician right. Morrissey contacted State of Play producer Hilary Bevan Jones, who set up meetings between Morrissey and select committee members Kevin Barron and Fabian Hamilton. Both politicians educated Morrissey on {{how difficult it is to}} commute to London from a constituency outside the capital. Morrissey was also able to shadow Peter Mandelson around the House of Commons for a fortnight. He questioned Mandelson about his job as a cabinet minister but did not ask about his personal life. Mandelson told him about how politics can quickly [...] "seduce" [...] MPs who have worked hard to get into Parliament.|$|E

At his father's deathbed, Bogart finally <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> much he loved him. [...] His second marriage was on the rocks, and he was less than happy with his acting career. He became depressed, irritable, and drank heavily.|$|E
60|$|This {{appeared}} to me an easy task, and certainly one I was enthusiastic over.

Then, carefully studying the map, I marked off the three miles Herky and I had fired.|$|R
50|$|It is home {{to several}} monasteries, the best-known being Narga Selassie. Dek is {{accessible}} by the ferry that runs from Bahir Dar to Gorgora.

This, just like how Shi Hu burdened his people, burdened the people of Cheng Han, greatly weakening their loyalty toward the state.|$|R
2500|$|Though {{the public}} {{response}} to Scott was generally favorable during the Paramount years, the film critics were less so, repeatedly making unfavorable comparisons to Lauren Bacall and Tallulah Bankhead, beginning with Bob Thomas' March 1945 comment about her screen test: [...] "Her throaty voice may well make Lauren Bacall {{sound like a}} mezzo soprano." [...] When the most prominent critic of the era, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, gave a bad review of You Came Along (1945), Scott's film debut, she recalled, [...] "Being very young and naïve at the time, I didn't know you weren't supposed to do such things, so I called him up and complained. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> hard everyone worked {{to make such a}} beautiful movie, and I couldn't understand how he could be so cruel. I must say he took it awfully well, and was very kind to me." [...] Nonetheless, in his review of I Walk Alone (1948), he stated, [...] "As the torch singer ... Lizabeth Scott has no more personality than a model in the window of a department store." [...] He also wrote of [...] "a frighteningly grotesque Lizabeth Scott, who is supposed to represent a cabaret singer" [...] in Dark City (1950).|$|E

Young told Saldívar not to believe the radio announcement, {{and that he did}} not know about Selena's current condition. The conversation then switched to Saldívar blaming Quintanilla, Jr. for the murder claiming that he threatened to kill her. She explained to Young that she bought the gun for protection after finding her car tires deliberately slashed. She also <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> Quintanilla, Jr. sexually abused her by [...] "sticking a knife" [...] in her vagina, threatening to murder her if she went to the police. When asked about what happened in her motel room, Saldívar exclaimed: [...] "I bought this gun to kill myself, not her, and she told me, 'Yolanda, I don't want you to kill yourself.' And we were talking about that when I took it out and pointed it to my head, and when I pointed it to my head, she opened the door.
