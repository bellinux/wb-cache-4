Steel molds having a trapezoidal section, and the end restrained at square shape with(2. 7 meter) at length are used to study restrained drying shrinkage of cement mortar. Specimens of (compressive. flextural. splitting strength) were cast. The admixture (marble dust) was used to replacie weight of cement with three levels of (4 %, 8 % and 16 %) and the fiber hemp and sisal fiber were added for all mixes with proportion by volum of cement.

40|$|Background and Aims: Indirect {{composites}} {{are designed}} to overcome the shortcomings of direct composites such as polymerization shrinkage and low degree of conversion. But, good adhesion of resin cements to indirect composites is still difficult. This research was designed to assess the effect of different powers of Er;YAG laser compared with sandblasting. On the micro <b>tensil</b> bond <b>strength</b> of resin cement to indirect composites.   Materials and Methods: Specimens were prepred using dental resin composite (Gradia GC) and metallic mold (15 × 5 × 5 mm) and were cured according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 24 blocks were prepared and randomly divided into 12 groups. G 1 :no treatment (as control), G 2 - 6 : Er; YAG laser irradiation (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Watt), G 7 : sandblast. Two composite blocks were bonded to each other with Panavia F. 2. resin cement. The cylindrical sections with dimensions of 1 mm were tested in a microtensile bond strength tester device using 0. 5 mm/min speed until fracture points. Data were analyzed using 2 -way ANOVA and T-test.   Results: Interaction between lasers irradiation and sandblast treatments were significant (P 0. 05) whether samples were sandblasted or not. Samples which received 300 mJ of laser showed lower bond strength compared with no laser treatment. Other groups showed no significant difference (P> 0. 05).   Conclusion: It seems that application of sandblast with proper variables, {{is a good way}} to improve bond strength.

40|$|In {{connection}} with the proposed enlargement of the special waste disposal site Hoheneggelsen, Lower Saxony, the durability of concrete elements in contact with seepage water was studied in the laboratory scale. Samples were placed into corrosive solutions containing up to 6036 mg/l ammonium, 12700 mg/l sulfate and 22319 mg/l chloride, and they were treated at various temperatures (3. 5 C; 35 C), pressures (normal pressure, 10 bar) and duration (6 months; 12 months). For sample characterization, the phase composition (xrd, dta/tg), the axial <b>tensil</b> <b>strength,</b> the oxygen permeability, the pore distribution and the chloride content were determined. A slight erosion of the concrete connected with a decreased <b>tensil</b> <b>strength</b> and an increased oxygen permeability was found only under extreme conditions (35 C, 12 months, high ammonium concentration). The reinforced steel of all samples treated with corrosive solutions showed no higher corrosion level than {{in the case of}} samples treated with drinking water.

MÉTODOS: Foram usados 20 ratos Wistar separados aleatoriamente em 2 grupos iguais. Os animais foram anestesiados com {{pentobarbital}} sódico na dose de 20 mg/Kg por via intraperitoneal e submetidos a laparotomia mediana de 4 cm, cuja camada aponeurótica foi suturada com mononylon 5 - 0. No grupo I foi aplicada a dose de 5 mg de FCFb sobre a sutura da aponeurose. No grupo II (controle) foi aplicada solução salina 0, 9 % sobre a linha se sutura. Após observação por 7 dias os animais foram mortos com superdose de anestésico. A camada aponeurótica com 1, 5 cm de largura foi submetida a teste de resistência à tensão empregando a Máquina de Ensaios EMIC MF 500. Biópsias das zonas de sutura foram processadas e coradas com HE e o tricômico de Masson. Os achados histopatológicos foram quantificados através de sistema digital (Image pro-plus) de captura e processamento de imagens. Os dados obtidos foram analisados pelo teste T com significância 0, 05. RESULTADOS: Nos animais do grupo I (experimental) a zona de sutura da camada aponeurótica suportou a carga de 1. 103 ± 103, 39 gf. A quantificação dos dados histopatológicos desse grupo atingiu a densidade média 226 ± 29, 32. No grupo II (controle) a carga suportada pela zona de sutura foi de 791, 1 ± 92, 77 gf. Quando foram comparadas as médias das resistências à tensão dos dois grupos, observou-se uma diferença significante (p OBJECTIVE: As {{little is}} known about the use of basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (FCFb) in the healing of abdominal aponeurosis, an experimental work was done to study it. METHODS: Twenty Wistar rats randomly separated in two groups were used. They were anesthetised with pentobarbital 20 mg/Kg intraperitonealy, submited to a 4 cm median laparotomy and the aponeurosis was sutured with nylon 5 - 0. In group I 5 mg of FCFb was applied over the sutured aponeurosis end the group II received saline 0, 9 % over it. After seven days the rats were killed by an overdose of anesthetic. A transversal 1, 5 cm wideness sample of aponeurosis was submited to tensil strenght test, using the assay device EMIC MF 500. Biopsies from the sutured tissue were processed and colored by HE and Masson trichromic. The histopatologic data were quantitated and transformed into mean density by the digital equipment Image Pro-plus. The Student t test was used and the differences were significant when p< 0, 05.
