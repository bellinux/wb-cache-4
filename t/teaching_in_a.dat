The years 1897 to about 1904 mark the high point of his literary and philosophical creativity, during which time 18 of his 22 pseudonymous works were published, including a book of poetry, a play, an epistemological book and a volume of aphorisms.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain a}} Professional certificate, the {{applicant}} must have completed a NYS-approved {{teacher education program}} at a college/university and hold a master's degree or above. Each state has different requirements to become a permanently certified teacher, and the requirements keep increasing. For example, professional certification in NYS requires three years of classroom teaching experience. It also requires being mentored by a certified teacher within the first year teaching. However NYS no longer offers permanent certification to those who haven't already been certified by February 2004.The Professional certificate replaces it. To maintain a professional certificate, a teacher must complete 100 hours of professional development every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-public school. One {{does not have to}} teach in New York State to maintain their certificate as many New York teachers teach in Connecticut and New Jersey.|$|E

25|$|The third {{argument}} {{is given the}} most examination by the Court. In order to determine if decisions subsequent to Aguilar have actually undermined it or the basis for its findings, the Court examines the cases and the changes in views since that decision was made. The Court notes that it has {{moved away from the}} idea that a public employee <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parochial school will necessarily inculcate some of the religious messages inherent in their pervasively sectarian environment. It notes, for example, that in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist. the Court ruled that it was permissible for a deaf student to have a state-sponsored interpreter attend his Catholic high school in the performance of her duties. In this vein, the Court concludes that to consider a public employee's presence in a religious school inappropriate in and of itself would put far too much emphasis on form over substance.|$|E

25|$|Other changes {{brought in}} by the Harris {{government}} include standardized student tests.

2500|$|The idea of {{a public}} {{employee}} <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> religious school, the Court went on to say, was no longer commonly considered to foster a [...] "symbolic union" [...] between Church and State. Noting that the Dissent believed that, in fact, this did foster such a symbolic union, the Court countered by stating that it cannot be shown that such a symbolic union would vanish once the students and teachers were moved off campus. Taking that reasoning to its logical conclusion, it would forbid Title I entirely, as the union would be unavoidable. Further, the Court rejected the idea that Title I would be financing religious indoctrination if instruction could be conducted on religious campuses; Title I specifically notes that {{it is designed to}} [...] "supplement, not supplant" [...] the school's curriculum.|$|E

2500|$|When I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden, both Fellows of Magdalene, {{first met}} Ramsey, he {{expressed}} {{his interest in}} learning German. According to Richards, he mastered the language [...] "in almost hardly over a week", although other sources show he had taken one year of German in school. Ramsey was then able, {{at the age of}} 19, to make the first draft of the translation of the German text of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico Philosophicus. Ramsey was impressed by Wittgenstein's work and after graduating as Senior Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos of 1923 he made a journey to Austria to visit Wittgenstein, at that time <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> primary school in the small community of Puchberg am Schneeberg. For two weeks Ramsey discussed the difficulties he was facing in understanding the Tractatus. Wittgenstein made some corrections to the English translation in Ramsey's copy and some annotations and changes to the German text that subsequently appeared in the second edition in 1933.|$|E
60|$|A statute was {{fabricated}} in {{the year}} 1699, by which the saying mass (a church service in the Latin tongue, {{not exactly the same}} as our liturgy, but very near it, and containing no offence whatsoever against the laws, or against good morals) was forged into a crime, punishable with perpetual imprisonment. The teaching school, an useful and virtuous occupation, even the <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private family, was in every Catholic subjected to the same unproportioned punishment. Your industry, and the bread of your children, was taxed for a pecuniary reward to stimulate avarice to do what Nature refused, to inform and prosecute on this law. Every Roman Catholic was, under the same act, to forfeit his estate to his nearest Protestant relation, until, through a profession of what he did not believe, he redeemed by his hypocrisy what the law had transferred to the kinsman as the recompense of his profligacy. When thus turned out of doors from his paternal estate, he was disabled from acquiring any other by any industry, donation, or charity; but was rendered a foreigner in his native land, only because he retained the religion, along with the property, handed down to him from those who had been the old inhabitants of that land before him.|$|E
60|$|The {{object of}} {{language}} <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> civilized state is twofold: {{to give a}} thorough, intimate, usable knowledge of the mother tongue and of certain key languages. But if teaching were systematic and no time were wasted, if schooling joined on and were continuous instead of being catastrophically disconnected, there is another side of language teaching altogether--now entirely disregarded--and that is the acquisition in skeleton of {{quite a number of}} languages clustering round the key languages. If {{at the end of his}} schooling a boy knows English, French and German very well and nothing more, he is still a helpless foreigner in relation to large parts of the world. But if, in addition, he has an outline knowledge of Russian and Arabic or Turkish or Hindustani--it need only be a quite bare outline--and if he has had a term or so of Spanish in relation to his French, or Swedish in relation to his German, then he has the key in his hands for almost any language he may want. If he has not the language in his head, he has it very conveniently on call--he needs but a sensible conversation dictionary and in a little while he can possess himself of it.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and test a model which could be used to {{interpret}} and assist <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environmentally directed way. Its principal aim was to establish the extent to which elements from a variety of paradigms and teaching methods could be used simultaneously when <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environmentally directed way, depending on the topic and the context within which is taught. An in-depth literature review on theoretical perspectives on environmental education, paradigms relating to environmental education and teaching methods appropriate for environmental education indicated that these partially addressed the problem of the study, namely to determine how elements from a variety of paradigms and teaching methods could be used simultaneously to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environmentally directed way. The theory developed from the literature review facilitated the development of the model mentioned above. An amoeba was used as a metaphor to develop a model which can help facilitate the process of <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environmentally directed way. In developing the model, some examples of influential paradigms and teaching methods were used. None of the examples used for the study converged. Each contributed to the research in its own way. Some teaching methods showed common features of conversion and also addressed the problem of the study in their own ways. The amoeba model was developed from this theory. Qualitative research was further conducted to test the amoeba model. People who are knowledgeable in environmental education were selected to participate in the research. It emerged, from the findings of the research, that the amoeba model concurs positively with the hypothesis that no specific paradigm and teaching method(s) could be regarded as exclusively ideal for <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environmentally directed way. Elements from a variety of paradigms and teaching methods could be used simultaneously for <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environmentally directed way, depending on the topic and the context within which a topic is taught. The amoeba model thus serves as a solution to the problem of the study. Respondents further suggested that the amoeba model should be adopted for use in the South African education system. That is, the thesis should be put in the form of a workbook and teachers should be trained to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environmentally directed way by using this model. Educational StudiesD.
