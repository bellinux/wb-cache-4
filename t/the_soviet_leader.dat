5|$|After {{the success}} of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader,</b> wanted a {{spacecraft}} launched on 7 November 1957, the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Construction had already started on a more sophisticated satellite, {{but it would not}} be ready until December; this satellite would later become Sputnik 3.|$|E
5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> vague hints about the {{existence}} of a powerful new weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware that Soviet intelligence had penetrated the Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already knew of the existence of the atomic bomb but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> {{following}} the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared {{that the only way}} to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> said he was pleased by the news and {{expressed}} the hope that the weapon would be used against Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev's U.S. visit {{resulted}} in an informal agreement with U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower {{that there would be}} no firm deadline over Berlin, but that there would be a four-power summit to try to resolve the issue, and the premier left the U.S. to general good feelings. Khrushchev returned from the U.S. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader)</b> and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. He pushed for an immediate summit, but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.|$|E

[...] This {{was followed by the}} maiden visit to India of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders,</b> Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev in 1955. Jawaharlal Nehru, frankly put forward to <b>the</b> visiting <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> that <b>the</b> Communist Party of India was claiming to receive direction from the CPSU.|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{believe that}} recent events do not {{indicate}} that the USSR has ceased to desire a conference at the summit or lower level negotiations on matters in which <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> have an interest. At the same time, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> may have concluded prior to undertaking their recent moves that, since the chances of an early summit conference on their terms were waning, they could more easily accept the political losses they would suffer in international affairs by pursuing a harder policy in Eastern Europe." ...|$|R
5|$|Jaruzelski's Poland {{depended}} on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union and meaningful Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during {{the rule of}} the last three conservative Soviet general secretaries. The perestroika and glasnost policies of the Soviet Union's new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland. Gorbachev essentially repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European satellite states to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force. The developments in the Soviet Union altered the international situation and provided a historical opportunity for independent reforms in Poland. The hardline stance of US President Ronald Reagan was also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence of Gorbachev. With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and for the East European pluralistic evolution in general, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> effectively pushed East Europe toward the West.|$|E
5|$|Kidnappers violently {{take the}} Secret Service chief M {{from his house}} and almost capture James Bond, who is visiting. Intent on rescuing M, Bond follows the clues to Vrakonisi, one of the Aegean Islands. In the process, Bond discovers the complex military-political plans of Colonel Sun of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Sun {{had been sent to}} {{sabotage}} a Middle East détente conference which the Soviet Union is hosting. He intends to attack the conference venue and use M and Bond's bodies to blame Great Britain for the disaster, leading to a world war. Bond meets Soviet agents in Athens and they realise that not only is a third country behind the kidnap, but that there is a traitor in the organisation. An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek Communist. As he is dying, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Jack Matlock, United States {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union, told Gorbachev {{of the possibility of}} a coup attempt against him, and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> became worried when Anatoly Chernyaev informed him of mysterious troop movements outside Moscow. On 21 June, four days after Pavlov's speech, Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Soviet and told delegates that there were no differences in opinion between him and Pavlov. Even when {{he had been able to}} secure his position, Gorbachev's power within the system was already faltering, although he succeeded in getting the enhanced powers previously given to the Cabinet of Ministers reversed. The power struggle between Gorbachev and Pavlov was not over, with Gorbachev promising Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev that Pavlov, along with Dmitry Yazov, Minister of Defence, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, the Chairman of the KGB, would be removed from their posts following the signing and ratification of the New Union Treaty.|$|E

5000|$|The 8th Plenum {{conducted}} some introductory {{business and}} suspended deliberations {{to allow the}} leadership to attend the separate talks with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders.</b> <b>The</b> negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were very difficult and lasted until 1 AM. Khrushchev objected to the planned Politburo changes {{and the lack of}} [...] "fraternal consultations", including the removal of Marshal Rokossovsky, noticed the increased activity of anti-Soviet elements in Poland and threatened an active military intervention. Ochab replied that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> themselves would not consult changes in their leadership with the Poles. He, Gomułka, Cyrankiewicz and Zambrowski tried to reassure <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> that their interests were not under threat. During a break <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> delegation went to its embassy for internal talks and took Minister Rokossovsky with them.|$|R
5|$|Realizing {{the need}} for new leadership, in {{what became known as the}} Polish October, the Politburo chose Gomułka, who had been {{released}} from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was soon reinforced by the pressure from communist China, which expressed its great power aspirations and demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous social democratic-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing revisionists and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists replaced and claimed to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. The main goals in pursuit of which they engaged were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises. However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of NATO.|$|E
25|$|After the summit, Bush {{would seek}} {{cooperative}} relations with Gorbachev throughout {{the remainder of}} his term, believing that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> was the key to peacefully ending the Soviet domination Eastern Europe. When Lithuania declared independence from the USSR in 1990, Bush avoided criticizing Gorbachev out of the fear of undermining or alienating <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader.</b> He did, however, pressure Gorbachev to begin negotiations with the Lithuanian government.|$|E
25|$|Adding to the {{situation}} that day {{was the fact that}} Leonid Brezhnev was embarking on a trip to Crimea. Authorities wanted to give <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> a clear flight path and this caused considerable disruption of the airline flight operations in the area.|$|E

50|$|To {{get even}} {{approximately}} accurate intelligence on the mood {{and attitudes of}} <b>the</b> population, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> {{would have had to}} resort to sources which tapped private communications, by perlustrating personal letters and building networks of informers.|$|R
50|$|The first {{event was}} timed to {{coincide}} with Mikhail Gorbachev's first visit to Paris in October 1985. As {{an alternative to the}} official events of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader's</b> visit a large gathering was held at the Grand Palais.|$|R
25|$|Portraying {{the history}} of the Second World War with a focus on a highly {{positive}} depiction of the role <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> played in the events, it {{is considered one of the}} most important representations of Stalin's cult of personality.|$|E
25|$|When Khrushchev {{was ousted}} as <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> in October 1964, Shepilov {{began working on}} his memoirs, a project which he {{continued}} intermittently until circa 1970.

25|$|The Soviet Union denied {{shooting}} down the DC-3, {{but a few}} days later a life raft with Soviet shell shrapnel was found. In 1956, while meeting the Swedish Prime Minister Tage Erlander, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> Nikita Khrushchev admitted that the Soviet Union had shot down the DC-3. This information was not released to the public at the time.|$|E
25|$|When former US President Harry Truman called President Kennedy {{the day of}} Khrushchev's offer, the President {{informed}} him that his Administration had rejected <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader's</b> offer to withdraw missiles from Turkey and was planning on using <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> setback in Cuba to escalate tensions in Berlin.|$|R

In the program, Manfred von Ardenne was also featured; he was a German physicist who directed Institute A, in Sinop, a suburb of Sukhumi. In the documentary, Wirths told {{a story about the}} purity of Plant No. 12’s production of uranium. Through espionage, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> has procured a specimen of American uranium and compared it to that at Plant No. 12. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> praised <b>the</b> purity of Plant No. 12’s uranium production.

25|$|Leopold Trepper, a Polish-Jewish communist, {{worked as}} a master spy and was {{the chief of the}} Red Orchestra network in Western Europe.

25|$|Soviet Ukraine {{soon became}} a European leader in {{industrial}} production, and an important centre of the Soviet arms industry and high-tech research. Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite. Many members of the Soviet leadership came from Ukraine, most notably Leonid Brezhnev. He later ousted Khrushchev and became <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> from 1964 to 1982. Many prominent Soviet sports players, scientists, and artists came from Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|According to Albanian Communist leader Enver Hoxha's {{account of}} his conversations with the Romanian Communist leaders on the monarch's abdication, it was Gheorghiu-Dej, not Groza, who forced Michael's abdication at gunpoint. He was allowed {{to leave the country}} {{accompanied}} by some of his entourage and, as confirmed also by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>leader</b> Nikita Khrushchev recounting Gheorghiu-Dej's confessions, with whatever properties he desired, including gold and rubies. Hoxha also wrote that pro-Communist troops surrounded the palace, to counter army units who were still loyal to the king.|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{his policy}} was to {{withdraw}} all the U.S. forces from Europe.
