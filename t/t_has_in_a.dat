Eight years after liming, in the 0 – 20 cm and 20 – 40 cm mineral soil layers, soil pH values, exchangeable calcium (Ca) contents, and Ca/Al molar ratios increased, but exchangeable aluminum (Al) levels decreased, and as a result, length densities of living fine roots of Masson pine increased, with increasing dose. Mean crown defoliation of Masson pines (dominant, codominant and subdominant pines, according to Kraft classes 1 – 3) decreased with increasing dose, and it linearly decreased with length densities of living fine roots.

The proliferation after CD 3 /CD 28 stimulation was measured by 3 [H]thymidine incorporation. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and IL- 10 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TGF-β messenger RNA was also measured by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. The expression of latency associated peptide (LAP), a TGF-β complex component, intracellular cytokine content and T helper cell proliferation were measured by flow cytometry. Human γδ T cells showed poor proliferation upon CD 3 /CD 28 stimulation and suppressed T helper cell growth stronger than CD 4 + CD 25 + T cells, although γδ T cells were FOXP 3 negative.

40|$|Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{is highly}} polymorphic, and its {{variations}} in humans {{may contribute to}} individual differences in function. Zhang and colleagues found a strikingly higher frequency of a C 150 T transition in the D-loop of mtDNA from centenarians and twins of an Italian population, and also demonstrated that this base substitution causes a remodeling of the mtDNA 151 replication origin in human leukocytes and fibroblasts [1]. The C 150 T transition is a polymorphism associated with several haplogroups. To determine whether haplogroups that carry the C 150 T transition display any phenotype that may be advantageous for longevity, we analyzed cybrids carrying or not the C 150 T transition. These cybrids were obtained by fusing cytoplasts derived from human fibroblasts with human mtDNA-less cells (r 0 cells). We chose for cybrid construction and analysis haplogroup-matched pairs of fibroblast strains containing or not the C 150 T transition. In particular, we used, as one pair of mtDNA donors, a fibroblast strain of the U 3 a haplogroup, carrying the C 150 T transition and a strain of the U-K 2 haplogroup, without the C 150 T transition, and as another pair, fibroblasts of the J 2 b haplogroup, carrying the C 150 T transition and of the J 1 c haplogroup, without the C 150 <b>T</b> transition.

The epidemiological and biological diversity of <b>T.</b> gondii <b>has</b> resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high genetic variation and unusual population structure in this parasite. This study examined sequence diversity in dense granule 5 (GRA 5) gene among T. gondii isolates from different hosts and geographical regions. Methods The entire genome region of the GRA 5 gene was amplified and sequenced from 14 T. gondii isolates, and phylogenetic relationship among these T. gondii isolates was reconstructed using Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum parsimony (MP) based on the GRA 5 sequences. Results The complete sequence of the GRA 5 gene was 1614 bp in length for strains TgCatBr 5 and MAS, but 1617 bp for the other 12 strains. Sequence analysis identified 41 (0 – 1. 7 %) variable nucleotide positions among all isolates, with 18 variations of these being in the coding region. Variable positions in the coding region resulted in 11 amino acid substitutions, and a deletion of 3 bp in the strains TgCatBr 5 and MAS leading to the deletion of one amino acid. Sequence variations resulted in the existence of polymorphic restriction sites for endonucleases Aat II and Mlu I, allowing the differentiation of the three major clonal lineage types I, II and III by PCR-RFLP. Phylogenetic analyses using BI and MP supported the clear differentiation of the examined T. gondii strains into their respective genotypes. Conclusions This study demonstrated the existence of sequence variability in the GRA 5 gene sequence among T. gondii isolates from different hosts and geographical regions, which allowed the differentiation of the examined T. gondii strains into their respective genotypes, suggesting that this highly polymorphic GRA 5 locus may provide a new genetic marker for population genetic studies of T. gondii isolates. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aeolian {{processes}} play <b>an</b> integral role <b>in</b> {{the evolution}} of our landscape through the entrainment, transportation, and deposition of fine grained sediments by the wind.

Human-induced forcings are many and varied, and include any activity that results in the exposure of surface sediments to the wind. Two dramatic examples of such activities have been the widespread cultivation of the prairie grasslands in the American and Canadian Midwest {{that lead to the}} Dust Bowl period of the 1930 s (Figure 18. 1), and the abstraction of water from the Amudar'ya and Syrdar'ya Rivers, which flow into the Aral Sea. <b>T</b> his <b>has</b> resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 50 % decrease in size of what was once the world's fourth-largest lake, thereby exposing more than a million hectares of lake bed to aerial processes.

Sacroiliac dysfunction is considered to be {{the most common cause of}} sacroiliac joint pain and subsequent lower back pain (3). However, the anatomical location of these joints and the lack of a satisfactory criterion standard (the “gold standard”) make the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction difficult (4). Nevertheless, many different sacroiliac joint tests have been described to detect the sacroiliac dysfunction however none have been validated against any independent criterion standard (5). Furthermore, numerous invalidated tests attempt to diagnose the type of sacroiliac joint dysfunction although they also lack that satisfactory criterion standard (4, 5). The Sacral Base Pressure <b>Test</b> <b>has</b> been shown <b>in</b> <b>a</b> previous study to have good validity as an indicator of sacroiliac dysfunction (6). This study aimed to reconfirm the validity of the Sacral Base Pressure Test in diagnosing sacroiliac joint dysfunction. It also determined the predictive powers of the test in determining which type of sacroiliac joint dysfunction was present. Sixty-two participants underwent a double-blind experimental study where the results from the Sacral Base Pressure Test were compared against a cluster of previously validated tests of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The cluster of tests gave the diagnosis against which the Sacral Base Pressure Test’s validity and predictive powers were determined. The cluster of tests included Standing Flexion Test, the Iliac Springing Test, Spine Test and Supine Long-Sitting Test. The former two tests only determined the presence of the sacroiliac joint dysfunction, whilst the latter tests also determined the type of dysfunction present. The results occurring in the Sacral Base Pressure Test, namely the external rotation of the feet, were measured using a digital inclinometer. There was no statistically significant difference in the results of the Sacral Base Pressure Test between the types of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Only when the Sacral Base Pressure Test was performed on the right of the patient and when it analysed right-sided dysfunction types, was there a slight statistically significant difference (P = 0. 0529) evident in the results. In terms of the results of validity, the Sacral Base Pressure Test was useful in identifying positive values of sacroiliac joint dysfunction but was not useful in identifying the negative values. The Sacral Base Pressure Test did not accurately diagnose patients with positive test results, however it was fairly helpful in correctly diagnosing patients with negative test results. The Sacral Base Pressure <b>Test</b> <b>had</b> only a “slight” agreement with the diagnosis according to the Landis and Koch Guidelines for Kappa interpretation. At this stage of research into the Sacral Base Pressure Test, the results are varied. In this study, the test was not a clinically useful test for determining the presence of sacroiliac joint dysfunction or the type of dysfunction present. Further research comparing the agreement of the Sacral Base Pressure Test or other sacroiliac joint dysfunction tests with a gold standard of diagnosis is necessary. Dr. E. K. Urli Dr. J.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted with}} a view to observe the efficiency of Urea Super Granule (USG) on tomato. The variety, Ratan was tested in the farmer`s field at FSRD site, Syedpur, Rangpur under Tista Meander Floodplain highland soils (AEZ No. 3) for two consecutive years during Rabi, 2001 - 02 and 2002 - 03. The {{experiment was}} laid out in RCB design with six dispersed replications. Two forms of urea i. e. prilled urea (PU) and USG with different rates were used. The two years` results revealed that urea super granule had significant positive effect on the yield of tomato as compare to normal urea. The recommended dose of N (150 kg ha - 1) from USG gave the significantly highest marketable fruit yield of 79. 13 <b>t</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 <b>in</b> 1 st and 73. 60 <b>t</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 <b>in</b> 2 nd year. It was also possible to harvest marketable fruit of 73. 69 <b>t</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 <b>in</b> 1 st and 68. 29 <b>t</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 <b>in</b> 2 nd year and 68. 13 <b>t</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 <b>in</b> 1 st and 62. 45 <b>t</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 <b>in</b> 2 nd year using 90 % (135 kg ha - 1) and 80 % (120 kg ha - 1) recommended dose of N from USG and these yields were statistically identical to the yield (67. 22 <b>t</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 <b>in</b> 1 st and 60. 23 <b>t</b> <b>ha</b> - 1 <b>in</b> 2 nd year) obtained from 150 kg ha - 1 N from prilled urea. The 150 and 135 kg ha - 1 of N from USG gave 11 and 2 % higher yield of tomato than that of using 150 kg ha - 1 N from prilled urea, respectively. These results implied that efficiency of USG was found to be positive on the yield of tomato and 20 % N might be saved using USG compare to PU. The economic analysis also showed that the use of urea super granule was economically viable to cultivate the tomato. Farmers show their willingness to use USG...|$|R
