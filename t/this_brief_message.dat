40|$|When, in 1619, John Donne urged Sir Robert Ker {{to remind}} readers of Biathanatos {{that it was}} "a Book written by jack Donne, and not by D. Donne," he {{probably}} did not expect <b>this</b> <b>brief,</b> personal <b>message</b> to become a fundamental part of his posthumous reputation. 1 At the time, Donne was rising rapidly {{through the ranks of}} the Church of England clergy and wanted to ensure that no one mistook it for recent work. There is no evidence that Donne made use of this binary elsewhere; indeed, Donne 2 ̆ 7 s sermons reflect a desire to reject extreme dichotomies in favor of a measured, if imperfect, religious and personal via media. 2 Although Ben Jonson discussed Donne with William Drummond, neither is recorded as calling him "Jack," nor does lzaak Walton recount the episode, perhaps because he did not know about it...|$|R

40|$|AIMS:To {{assess the}} impact of {{interventions}} promoting the monitoring of medication use and <b>brief</b> <b>messaging</b> to support medication adherence in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to investigate the extent of theory use to guide intervention development. METHODS: We systematically searched for controlled trials, published from 1990 onwards in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane library, that evaluated interventions based on monitoring and <b>brief</b> <b>messaging</b> to support medication adherence in patients with Type 2 diabetes, to examine the effectiveness of such interventions. RESULTS: A total of 11 trials, comparing 15 interventions, were identified. Only a small minority presented a low risk of bias. Three interventions were based on delivering <b>brief</b> <b>messages,</b> six were based on monitoring medication adherence, and six used both strategies. Messaging interventions included the use of short message service text messages, web-based feedback, and messages delivered through monitoring devices. Monitoring interventions included remote self-reporting of medication and telephone calls with healthcare staff. Improvements in medication adherence were observed in six interventions, although effect sizes were generally moderate. Only two interventions improved both adherence and clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis of five trials (eight interventions) combining monitoring and messaging strategies showed that the pooled difference in medication adherence between intervention and control was moderate and not statistically significant [standardized mean difference = 0. 22 (95 % CI - 0. 05; 0. 49) ]. Only four trials were based on explicit theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Although interventions based on messaging and monitoring have the potential to improve medication adherence in patients with Type 2 diabetes, evidence of their efficacy is limited and additional high-quality, theory-based research is needed.
