40|$|Investigations {{are carried}} out and {{obtained}} experimental and theoretical data for <b>tantalum</b> <b>scrap</b> recycling by electron beam melting (EBM) is presented in this paper. Different thermal treatment process conditions are realized and results are discussed. A chemical analysis is performed and refining mechanisms for electron beam (EB) refining of Ta are discussed. For the performed experiments the best purification of Ta (99. 96) is obtained at 21. 6 kW beam power for a melting time of 3 min. A statistical approach is applied for estimation of the material losses and the liquid pool characteristics based on experimentally-obtained data. The aim {{is to improve the}} EBM and choosing optimal process conditions, depending on the concrete characteristic requirements. Model-based quality optimization of electron beam melting and refining (EBMR) processes of Ta is considered related to the optimization of the molten pool parameters, connected to the occurring refining processes, and to minimal material losses. Optimization of the process of EBM of Ta is based on overall criteria, giving compromised solutions, depending on the requirements concerning the quality of the performed products. The accumulated data, the obtained results, and the optimization statistical approach allow us to formulate requirements on the process parameters...|$|E
40|$|A {{recycling}} process for <b>tantalum</b> from capacitor <b>scraps</b> using an oxidation process followed by mechanical separation and chemical treatment was investigated. This study demonstrates that sintered tantalum electrodes inside the capacitor scraps can be mechanically {{collected after the}} oxidation of the scraps in air, and high-purity tantalum oxide powder (Ta 2 O 5) was efficiently recovered after chemical treatment. By reducing the Ta 2 O 5 obtained through magnesiothermic reduction, tantalum powder with 99 mass % purity was obtained. Using the chlorination for tantalum recovery was also investigated, and the tantalum or tantalum compounds were reacted with chloride wastes such as FeClx. It was found that tantalum was effectively separated and purified when tantalum powder is reacted with FeClx at 1100 K under an argon atmosphere. This {{recycling process}} utilizing chloride scrap has now been extended to other reactive metals such as titanium...|$|R
