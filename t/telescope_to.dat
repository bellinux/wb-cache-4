5|$|During the 1660s, Giovanni Cassini used a new <b>telescope</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} {{spots and}} colorful bands on Jupiter and {{observed that the}} planet appeared oblate; that is, flattened at the poles. He was also able to estimate the rotation period of the planet. In 1690 Cassini noticed that the atmosphere undergoes differential rotation.|$|E

5|$|It {{has always}} been {{important}} for the Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>to</b> capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs. After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{managers}} and engineers declared the mission a complete success. The completion {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the Hubble <b>telescope</b> <b>to</b> its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years before and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will help Hubble to see deeper into the universe and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's rings require {{at least}} a 15-mm-diameter <b>telescope</b> <b>to</b> resolve and thus were not known to exist until Galileo first saw them in 1610. He thought of them as two moons on Saturn's sides. It was not until Christiaan Huygens used greater {{telescopic}} magnification that this notion was refuted. Huygens discovered Saturn's moon Titan; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap {{now known as the}} Cassini Division.|$|E

5|$|The {{discoveries of}} HAT-P-33b and HAT-P-32b were {{reported}} {{together in the}} Astrophysical Journal. The paper was submitted on June 6, 2011. The authors of the discovery paper of the planets suggested the usage of the Spitzer Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>to</b> observe the occultation of HAT-P-33b behind its star to better define its characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Using the Very Large <b>Telescope</b> <b>to</b> {{study the}} motions of about 300 {{planetary}} nebulae, {{it has been shown}} that M87 has absorbed a medium-sized galaxy over the last billion years. The distinctive spectral properties of the planetary nebulae allowed astronomers to discover a chevron-like structure in M87's halo which was produced by the incomplete phase-space mixing of a disrupted galaxy.|$|E
5|$|A {{degree to}} the {{northwest}} of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula (M1), a supernova remnant. This expanding nebula was created by a Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a <b>telescope</b> <b>to</b> observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E

5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic <b>telescope</b> <b>to</b> help count the stars in the Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the <b>telescope</b> <b>to</b> bring it closer to the dome and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{physicists}} Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi {{proposed that}} extraterrestrial civilisations might be using radio signals for communication. Project Ozma, led by astronomer Frank Drake, used the Tatel <b>Telescope</b> <b>to</b> search for such {{signals from the}} nearby Sun-like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, 1,420MHz (21cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{next few}} space <b>telescopes</b> <b>to</b> study exoplanets are {{expected}} to be Gaia launched in December 2013, CHEOPS in 2017, TESS in 2017, and the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018.|$|R
50|$|When summed {{over the}} entire splay {{operation}}, this <b>telescopes</b> <b>to</b> 3(rank(root)−rank(x)) which is O(log n). The Zig operation adds an amortized cost of 1, but there's at most one such operation.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{instruments}} {{have also}} been made. These include attaching spectrophotometers <b>to</b> <b>telescopes</b> <b>to</b> measure the spectra of astronomical features. UV-visible microspectrophotometers consist of a UV-visible microscope integrated with a UV-visible spectrophotometer.|$|R
5|$|None of {{the three}} telescopes was constructed, {{although}} several design {{studies were carried out}} and some scale models were made. This was partly due to the changing political climate over the time (the period was from a Labour Party government under Harold Wilson to a Conservative Party one under Margaret Thatcher), and partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell <b>Telescope</b> <b>to</b> the Mark IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.|$|E
5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the <b>telescope</b> <b>to</b> make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The OSO and OAO {{missions}} {{demonstrated the}} important role space-based observations could play in astronomy, and in 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based reflecting telescope with a mirror 3m in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for manned maintenance missions to the <b>telescope</b> <b>to</b> ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable space shuttle indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.|$|E
5000|$|The cluster appears visibly {{small and}} {{requires}} larger +12" [...] aperture <b>telescopes</b> <b>to</b> view the core. Appearing around 1.5 arcmins having a radius of [...]75 arcmins, despite its rather bright magnitude.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>telescopes</b> {{designed}} <b>to</b> measure star transits are zenith <b>telescopes</b> designed <b>to</b> point {{straight up}} {{at or near}} the zenith for extreme precision measurement of star positions. They use an altazimuth mount, instead of a meridian circle, fitted with leveling screws. Extremely sensitive levels are attached <b>to</b> the <b>telescope</b> mount <b>to</b> make angle measurements and the telescope has an eyepiece fitted with a micrometer.|$|R
5000|$|More recently, Burchat {{has been}} {{interested}} in using <b>telescopes</b> <b>to</b> investigate the cosmological evolution of the Universe. She has joined an international community developing the Large Synoptic Survey <b>Telescope,</b> preparing <b>to</b> study gravitational bending of light by dark matter {{and the evolution of}} dark energy. Her 2008 TED talk, [...] "Shedding light on dark matter", explores these two ingredients making up about 96 percent of the universe.|$|R
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This lower limit is around 1.93 times the mass of Jupiter. The true mass depends on the inclination of the orbit, which in general is unknown. However, because Gliese 876 is only 15 light years from Earth Benedict et al. (2002) {{were able to use}} one of the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>to</b> detect the astrometric wobble created by Gliese 876 b. This constituted the first unambiguous astrometric detection of an extrasolar planet. Their analysis suggested that the orbital inclination is 84°±6° (close to edge-on). In the case of Gliese 876 b, modelling the planet-planet interactions from the Laplace resonance shows that the actual inclination of the orbit is 59°, resulting in a true mass of 2.2756 times the mass of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a <b>telescope</b> <b>to</b> make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{was then}} given a {{significant}} opportunity {{that became the}} focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to help establish one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding Spring. In the early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among the experts involved. Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end. In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to collaborate on the construction of a large <b>telescope,</b> <b>to</b> be known as the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Given the existing infrastructure of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT. Gascoigne was one of the four members of the Technical Committee established to guide the telescope's development. He provided leadership on the design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.|$|E
