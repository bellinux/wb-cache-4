Seaborg was called to the White House {{in the first week of}} <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>Administration</b> in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the Soviets and nuclear testing. He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser John Ehrlichman over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, Zalman Shapiro, whom <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel.|$|E

5|$|With Maryland voters, Mathias {{benefited from}} his {{frequent}} disagreements with <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> and his liberal voting record. On November 5, 1974, he was re-elected by a 57% to 43% margin, though he lost badly in Baltimore City and Baltimore County, where Mikulski was popular.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{the family}} moved to Washington, D.C., where the elder Baker was named deputy undersecretary of the Department of Transportation in <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration,</b> and the next year became the department's {{assistant}} secretary for policy and international affairs. His father also served as undersecretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services in the Reagan administration.|$|E

5|$|In Capitalism and Freedom, {{he argued}} that {{conscription}} is inequitable and arbitrary, preventing young men from shaping their lives as they see fit. During <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force. He would later state that his role in eliminating the conscription in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{revealed}} a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, {{he moved from}} London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> to deport him. Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{used the}} {{improving}} international environment {{to address the}} topic of nuclear peace. Following the announcement of his visit to China, <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union. The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972 and met with Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party; Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and Nikolai Podgorny, the head of state, among other leading Soviet officials.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> {{skirted the}} Ineligibility Clause {{during its first}} year, when Nixon named Representative Donald Rumsfeld as Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969. Although the salary for that office had been {{increased}} to $42,500 during Rumsfeld's term in Congress, Rumsfeld was not paid a salary for the position. Rather, Rumsfeld was dually employed as Assistant to the President at the same $42,500 salary, a position presumably {{outside the scope of}} the Clause.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{continued}} the détente policy {{with both the}} Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>Administration</b> was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union, creating {{the framework of the}} Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as the Republican candidate in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Jones {{registered}} as a Democrat, citing his disenchantment with <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> and {{his desire to}} participate in Kentucky primary elections. At the time, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in Kentucky by a 2-to-1 margin. Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. named him {{to the board of}} directors for the University of Kentucky and the Chandler Medical Center. In the mid-1980s, Jones created the Kentucky Health Care Access Foundation to provide free health care to individuals who fell below the poverty line but did not qualify for Medicaid. Governor Martha Layne Collins chose Jones to chair her Medicaid Program Review Team and serve on her Council on Education Reform.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} term, Nixon ordered an airlift to {{resupply}} Israeli {{losses in the}} Yom Kippur War, resulting in the restart of the Middle East peace process and an oil crisis at home. <b>The</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> supported a coup in Chile that ousted the government of Salvador Allende and propelled Augusto Pinochet to power. By late 1973, the Watergate scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support. On August 9, 1974, he resigned {{in the face of}} almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In 20 years of retirement, Nixon wrote nine books and undertook many foreign trips, helping to rehabilitate his image into that of elder statesman. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994 and died four days later at the age of 81.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of several {{high-profile}} reports about hunger and malnutrition in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chair. Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Protracted {{negotiations}} {{took place}} over House conference negotiations on the bill, revolving in large part around Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield's eventually unsuccessful amendment to tie renewal to a troop withdrawal timetable from Vietnam; during this time the draft law expired and no more were conscripted. On August 5, <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> pleaded for a renewal before the Senate went on recess, but Gravel blocked Stennis's attempt to limit debate, and no vote was held. Finally on September 21, 1971, the Senate invoked cloture over Gravel's second filibuster attempt by one vote, and then passed the two-year draft extension. Gravel's attempts to stop the draft had failed (notwithstanding Gravel's later claims that he had stopped or shortened the draft, taken at face value in some media reports, during his 2008 presidential campaign).|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} draft law {{was scheduled}} to conclude {{at the end of}} June 1971, and the Senate faced a contentious debate about whether to extend it as the Vietnam War continued. <b>The</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>administration</b> announced in February 1971 that it wanted a two-year extension to June 1973, after which the draft would end; Army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a two-year extension, after which an all-volunteer force would be in place. Skeptics such as Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John Stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a four-year extension, but the two-year proposal is what went forward in Congress. By early May 1971, Gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation, halting conscription and thereby bringing U.S. involvement in the war to a rapid end.|$|E
