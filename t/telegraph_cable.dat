5|$|Samuel Morse {{independently}} {{developed a}} version of the electrical telegraph that he unsuccessfully demonstrated on 2 September 1837. His code was an important advance over Wheatstone's signaling method. The first transatlantic <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable</b> was successfully completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telecommunication for the first time.|$|E

Hurst used flags to pass on telegraphic messages to and from shipping entering the Solent.|$|E

50|$|Underground <b>telegraph</b> <b>cables</b> {{into large}} {{buildings}} or between stations often needed to carry multiple independent <b>telegraph</b> lines. These <b>cables</b> {{took the form}} of multiple insulated conductors enclosed by a metal screen and overall protective jacket. In such cables the screen can be used as the return conductor. Undersea <b>telegraph</b> <b>cables</b> were usually a single conductor protected by steel-wire armour, effectively a coaxial cable. The first transatlantic cable of this kind was completed in 1866.|$|R
5|$|As well as railway engineering, Brassey {{was active}} in the {{development}} of steamships, mines, locomotive factories, marine telegraphy, and water supply and sewage systems. He built part of the London sewerage system, still in operation today, and was a major shareholder in Brunel's The Great Eastern, the only ship large enough at the time to lay the first transatlantic <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable</b> across the North Atlantic, in 1864.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before 10:50, Berk-i Satvet sent a {{shore party}} {{to warn the}} defenceless {{population}} of Novorossiysk, before opening up with her guns. She was soon thereafter joined by Midilli, which had been busy laying mines in the Kerch Strait. Midilli fired a total of 308 shells, sinking several Russian grain cargo ships and destroying about 50 oil tanks. On {{their way back to}} Ottoman territory, Midillis crew attempted to cut Sebastopol's undersea <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable</b> with Varna, Bulgaria, but failed.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} Thompson took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press. In {{the early years of}} the Thompson administration, he had a dedicated correspondent in Seattle whose job was to read the early editions of the Seattle newspapers, then hurry to the telegraph office and summarize what he had read to Thompson on the other end of the <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable.</b> This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E

5|$|When World War I broke out, the British cut {{the transatlantic}} <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable</b> linking the US to Germany {{in order to}} control the flow of {{information}} between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicist Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.|$|E
5|$|The troops {{selected}} for the operation were among the best soldiers in Kitchener's army: the 3rd Egyptian, 9th Sudanese, 10th Sudanese, and 11th Sudanese Battalions, composing Lieutenant Hector Archibald MacDonald's brigade. Additionally, Hunter's column included an artillery battery, containing six Krupp twelve-pounders, two Maxim guns, {{and a pair of}} older British machine guns, a Gardner and Nordenfelt. Finally, a single troop of cavalry was attached to the column along with a substantial supply of camels for transport and supply. The column had rations for eighteen days, and <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable</b> was supplied in the hope that constant communication could be ensured as the column made the 146 mile journey through the desert. Overall, the force numbered around 3600 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Winnebago {{intermittently}} bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines {{until they}} surrendered, on 24 and 6 August, respectively. On {{the night of}} 8 August, Commander Stevens sent a boat crew {{under the command of}} Acting Ensign Michael Murphy on a successful mission to cut the <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable</b> between Fort Morgan and the city of Mobile. The fort surrendered on 24 August and the ship remained at Mobile Bay into 1865 supporting Union forces. On 27 March, Union forces advanced on Spanish Fort as the first step in capturing Mobile. The Navy's role was to bombard the defenses and to interdict their communications with Mobile, but the defenders had sown mines in great numbers in the waterways. The Navy successfully swept many of these, but could not completely clear the rivers.|$|E

He helped make the world a global village by connecting empires and continents via submarine <b>telegraph</b> <b>cables</b> - in effect constructing the Victorian age communication network.|$|R

Shortwave also ended the need for multimillion-dollar investments in new transoceanic <b>telegraph</b> <b>cables</b> and massive long wave wireless stations, although some existing transoceanic <b>telegraph</b> <b>cables</b> and commercial long wave communications stations remained in use until the 1960s.|$|R
25|$|Australia {{was first}} {{linked to the}} rest of the world in October 1872 by a {{submarine}} <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable</b> at Darwin. This brought news reportage from the rest of the world. The telegraph across the Pacific was completed in 1902, finally encircling the world.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic Telegraph Company {{was formed}} in London in 1856 to {{undertake}} to construct a commercial <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable</b> across the Atlantic Ocean. It was successfully completed on 27 July 1866, by the ship SS Great Eastern, captained by Sir James Anderson after many mishaps along the way. Earlier transatlantic submarine cables installations were attempted in 1857, 1858, and 1865. The 1858 cable only operated intermittently {{for a few days}} or weeks before it failed. The study of underwater telegraph cables accelerated interest in mathematical analysis of very long transmission lines. An overland telegraph from Britain to India was first connected in 1866 but was unreliable so a submarine <b>telegraph</b> <b>cable</b> was connected in 1870. Several telegraph companies were combined to form the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1872.|$|E
