50|$|In 1744 Walker went to Dublin, {{taking with}} him the Fate of Villainy, which was acted there under the title of Love and Loyalty. The second night {{was to have been}} for his benefit. Not being able <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> <b>security</b> for the {{expenses}} of the house, he could not induce the managers to reproduce it. He died three days later, 5 June 1744.|$|E
50|$|A {{defendant}} {{who chooses}} {{to proceed to}} trial may call upon the plaintiff, once the judgment amount has been paid, <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> <b>security</b> {{to the satisfaction of}} the registrar or the clerk. In practice, the parties usually agree that the capital amount due in terms of the judgment will be paid directly to the registrar or clerk by the defendant, to be held as security.|$|E
50|$|The Assemblies of the Clergy {{conducted}} their temporal administration carefully. They appointed for {{ten years}} a receiver-general (Receveur-général), in reality a minister of finance. The office carried with it a generous salary, and for election to it a two-thirds majority was required. He was bound <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> <b>security</b> at his residence in Paris and render {{a detailed account of}} his management to the assembled Clergy. In each diocese there was a board of elected delegates presided over by the bishop, whose duty it was to apportion the assessments among the beneficed ecclesiastics. This Bureau diocésain de décimes (Diocesan Board of Tithes) was authorized to settle ordinary disputes. Over it were superior boards located at Paris, Lyon, Rouen, Tours, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Aix, and Bourges, courts of appeal, whose decisions were final in all disputes concerning the contributions of the dioceses within their jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|Citigroup— Issued {{the bonds}} to Terra, who {{sold on the}} {{securities}} to the Norwegian municipalities. While [...] "the risks were clearly conveyed by Citigroup to Terra" [...] (according representatives from Citigroup), the risks of the prospects were allegedly not communicated to the final buyers. The scope of commissions and other remunerations from the purportedly illegal transactions is not known. The letter dated November 27, 2007 from The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway to Terra Securities ASA, states that [...] "The Supervisory Authority contends that Terra Securities ASA's presentation appears inadequate and misleading, as central elements such as the possibility of potential extra payments and losses, together {{with the size of}} these, has been omitted. (...) The material from Citigroup is significantly more detailed than the material from Terra Securities ASA. However, this document also lacks information about crucial risk issues for the municipalities, namely the risk of having <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> additional <b>security</b> in the form of cash. (...) The Supervisory Authority contends that Citigroup's presentation, as well as the presentation from Terra Securities ASA, appears inadequate and misleading because central elements such as information about potential extra payments and the scope of these are omitted."

50|$|On 24 May 2006, SDP member Chee Siok Chin filed {{a summons}} on the High Court asking {{to declare the}} {{election}} results void. In her affidavit, Chee claimed that the PAP had used the HDB upgrading scheme and gave out shares and cash to induce voters {{to vote for the}} party and hence secure electoral victory. Chee also wanted the High Court to declare the ban on podcasting during election period as unconstitutional. Chee did not pay the $5000 security costs on time, and the Elections Department did not accept her payment as a result. Senior State Counsel Jeffrey Chan said her petition would be deemed to have lapsed the moment she failed to meet the deadline <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> the <b>security</b> amount for costs and asked the election judge to dismiss the matter. On 22 June, Election Judge Andrew Phang dismissed her application and awarded costs to the Attorney General whom Chee had named as defendant. Her attempt to extend her security deposit payment time was denied by the High Court. As a result, a hearing scheduled on 27 June did not take place. Chee had not followed the rules of the Parliamentary Elections Act which requires them to pay the security deposit within three days after filing the petition.|$|R

50|$|The {{ex parte}} and {{restrictive}} {{nature of the}} saisie-contrefaçon, which makes it so efficient, can also {{be perceived as a}} possible source of abuse. It is possible that an economic operator might be tempted, under the pretext of the alleged infringement of its intellectual property right, to misuse the saisie-contrefaçon procedure in order to enter the premises of a competitor and try to obtain some of its industrial and trade secrets. However, first of all, in order to avoid such a risk, the judge has the option of preserving the confidentiality of the information gathered during the saisie-contrefaçon. Moreover, it is an established principle that the saisie-contrefaçon investigations are the responsibility of the requesting party and that the judge, when rendering the order for a saisie-contrefaçon, can order the requesting party <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> <b>security</b> to compensate the seized party for any loss it may suffer, in case it later appears that the saisie-contrefaçon was abusive. Practitioners are aware of these rules which the courts apply with great care, and abuses are the exception.|$|E
60|$|For {{seven years}} {{afterwards}} he remained, at the strong intercession of his friends, comparatively quiet; saving that he, {{every now and}} then, took occasion to display his zeal for the Protestant faith in some extravagant proceeding which was the delight of its enemies; and saving, besides, that he was formally excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, for refusing to appear as a witness in the Ecclesiastical Court when cited for that purpose. In the year 1788 he was stimulated by some new insanity to write and publish an injurious pamphlet, reflecting on the Queen of France, in very violent terms. Being indicted for the libel, and (after various strange demonstrations in court) found guilty, he fled into Holland in place of appearing to receive sentence: from whence, as the quiet burgomasters of Amsterdam had no relish for his company, he was sent home again with all speed. Arriving {{in the month of}} July at Harwich, and going thence to Birmingham, he made in the latter place, in August, a public profession of the Jewish religion; and figured there as a Jew until he was arrested, and brought back to London to receive the sentence he had evaded. By virtue of this sentence he was, in the month of December, cast into Newgate for five years and ten months, and required besides to pay a large fine, and <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> heavy <b>securities</b> for his future good behaviour.|$|R
50|$|Gor Mahia {{were awarded}} a walkover an 2 goals for their match after A.F.C. Leopards failed to turn up. The latter were {{consequently}} fined KSh 500,000, {{even though they}} had previously stated that they would not honour the fixture, citing no consultation of an appropriate date with the KPL and financial problems. However, KPL CEO Jack Oguda had stated that Leopards were to be fined KSh 1.5 million, and may have to pay another KSh 3.5 million fine, linked to the incurred expenses that broadcasters SuperSport could forward to the KPL. The Football Kenya Federation, however, suspended the result after, having demanded <b>to</b> be <b>furnished</b> with <b>security</b> measures <b>to</b> be taken for and the rules and regulations governing the tournament, the KPL failed to reply with furnishings. The suspension was lifted on 1 August 2012 after a consultative meeting held between FKF and KPL officials. The FKF also nullified the fine that was imposed on A.F.C. Leopards, after the club released an official press statement explaining the reason why they failed to appear for their match against Gor Mahia.|$|R

40|$|The {{material}} {{presented in}} this thesis {{may be viewed as}} comprising two key parts, the first part concerns batch cryptography specifically, whilst the second deals with how this form of cryptography may be applied to security related applications such as electronic cash for improving efficiency of the protocols. The objective of batch cryptography is to devise more efficient primitive cryptographic protocols. In general, these primitives make use of some property such as homomorphism to perform a computationally expensive operation on a collective input set. The idea is to amortise an expensive operation, such as modular exponentiation, over the input. Most of the esearch work in this field has concentrated on its employment as a batch verifier of digital signatures. It is shown that several new attacks may be launched against these published schemes as some weaknesses are exposed. Another common use of batch cryptography is the simultaneous generation of digital signatures. There is significantly less previous work on this area, and the present schemes have some limited use in practical applications. Several new batch signatures schemes are introduced that improve upon the existing techniques and some practical uses are illustrated. Electronic cash is a technology that demands complex protocols in order <b>to</b> <b>furnish</b> several <b>security</b> properties. These typically include anonymity, traceability of a double spender, and off-line payment features. Presently, the most efficient schemes make use of coin divisibility to withdraw one large financial amount that may be progressively spent with one or more merchants. Several new cash schemes are introduced here that make use of batch cryptography for improving the withdrawal, payment, and deposit of electronic coins. The devised schemes apply both to the batch signature and verification techniques introduced, demonstrating improved performance over the contemporary divisible based structures. The solutions also provide an alternative paradigm for the construction of electronic cash systems. Whilst electronic cash is used as the vehicle for demonstrating the relevance of batch cryptography to security related applications, the applicability of the techniques introduced extends well beyond this...|$|R
