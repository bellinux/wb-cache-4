Lastly, it supplies … a better article, one which gives to the public the fullest food value <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> out of the corn [...] from which the food is made, and which enables the manufacture of all kinds of flour or meal, white meal, mixed meal, whole meal, to be most completely and most easily produced.|$|E

5000|$|Conscious {{thought is}} not always {{necessary}} for knowledge of results to have its effect.

It seems likely that unconscious learning by results evolved first in early metazoa, and conscious thought very much later.

60|$|This is, {{first and}} foremost, what I mean by the narrowness {{of the new}} ideas, the {{limiting}} effect of the future. Our modern prophetic idealism is narrow because it has undergone a persistent process of elimination. We must ask for new things {{because we are not}} allowed to ask for old things. The whole position is based on this idea that we have got all the good <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> out of the ideas of the past. But we have not got all the good out of them, perhaps at this moment not any of the good out of them. And the need here is a need of complete freedom for restoration as well as revolution.|$|E

I reckon that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it ought to be enough for an {{innocent}} young girl like Jane. By the time she's got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat, with a well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on deck, why--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915. How's that for the bare outline?" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{movie was}} satirized in a 1977 SCTV skit as 'Broads Behind Bars' with the {{character}} of Marie (called 'Cheryl' and played by Catherine O'Hara) now a teenager in the mid-to-late '50's who after having smoked pot, ends up in prison framed for armed robbery and also pregnant months later. Andrea Martin played Kitty, while John Candy (in drag) {{played the role of}} matron Harper (here called 'Schultzy'.) The knife fight between Kitty and Harper also happens in this sketch, but with both 'Kitty' and 'Harper' ('Schultzy') dead (Kitty from being stabbed by Schultzy, and Schultzy later killed by Cheryl.) Cheryl/Marie <b>is</b> told <b>that</b> she <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> off for this, but smiles, laughs and decides to stay, echoing 'Kitty's' remark 'No dice!' The skit manages to also be an antimarijuana film, as well, similar to the ones that were made at this time, as well as a satire of 'women in prison' movies like Caged.|$|R
6000|$|... "But even {{were they}} {{to think that}} it was mining, and not science or sport that took you out there, they would {{scarcely}} interfere with you. It is admitted by all the factions that Peru needs capital for her development, and at present <b>that</b> <b>can</b> best <b>be</b> <b>got</b> from this country. The discovery of a fresh mine means employment to a large number of people, and the increase of the revenues by a royalty or taxation. English explorers who have gone out have never had any reason to complain of interference {{on the part of the}} authorities. You will find the average better class of Peruvians a charming people, and extremely hospitable. The ladies are pretty enough to turn the head of anyone whose affections are not already engaged. The men are kindly and courteous in the extreme. However, you would have little to do with these.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{getting into the}} Cairngorms. Specifically, it is about getting up a {{mountain}} on a highland estate {{for the purposes of}} hunting deer. The study asks the question “how is wilderness made accessible on the Highland Estate?” Drawing on the methodology of Actor-Network Theory, I examine the bulldozed estate tracks which, since the early 1960 s, served as the primary technical means of entering the landscape for deer stalking. I argue that the estate track – a combination of people, animals, things, management strategies and the capabilities of the sporting enthusiast’s body – ‘aligned’ (Latour, 2005 b) unruly hillside agencies to enable vehicular access to the high tops. I follow the story of a track on Beinn A’Bhuird from the earliest stalking on foot, through the use of Land Rovers, to the eventual restoration and wider changes that affected it. I demonstrate that access; the rendering of places such <b>that</b> they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> to by particular means of travel, is a contingent and embodied characteristic of space, formed in the assembling of actors...|$|R

I should be glad if you will send out a dozen {{foraging}} parties in different directions; there must be little villages scattered among the hills that have so far escaped French and English plunderers. Let each party take four or five dollars with them. I want anything <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got,</b> but my idea {{is a couple of}} young kids, three or four ducks, or a couple of geese, as many chickens, and of course any vegetables that you can get hold of. My man Sancho is a capital cook, and he will get fires ready and two or three assistants. They will be here by one o'clock, so the foraging parties had better return by ten." ...|$|E
60|$|Reviewing {{this long}} history {{of the way in}} which the {{literary}} world had treated Lady Byron, we cannot wonder that her friends should have doubted whether there was left on earth any justice, or sense that anything is due to woman as a human being with human rights. Evidently this lesson had taken from them all faith in the moral sense of the world. Rather than re-awaken the discussion, so unsparing, so painful, and so indelicate, which had been carried on so many years around that loved form, now sanctified by death, they sacrificed the dear pleasure of the memorials, and the interests of mankind, who have an indefeasible right to all the help <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> from the truth of history as to the living power of virtue, and the reality of that great victory that overcometh the world.|$|E
6000|$|So I {{took it all}} good-natured, {{and said}} to him, [...] "Well, Americans {{like to have the}} very best things <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> out of every country.

From the lily of France we sip their coffee, from the national flower of India, whatever it is, we take their chutney sauce, and as to those big apple tarts, baked in a deep dish, with a cup in the middle to hold up the upper crust, and so full of apples, and so delicious with Devonshire clotted cream on them that if there was any one place in the world they could be had I believe my husband would want to go and live there forever, they are what we extract from the rose of England." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought that}} in your {{struggle}} for the Union, to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you. Do you think differently? I thought <b>that</b> whatever negroes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do in saving the Union. Does it appear otherwise to you? But negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the strongest motive, even the promise of freedom. And the promise being made, must be kept.|$|R
6000|$|Hermann {{sat down}} and smoked violently. Five minutes passed in that furious meditation, and then, taking the long pipe out of his mouth, he burst into a hot {{diatribe}} against Falk--against his cupidity, his stupidity (a fellow <b>that</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>be</b> <b>got</b> to say [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] to the simplest question)--against his outrageous treatment of the shipping in port (because he saw they were at his mercy)--and against his manner of walking, which to his (Hermann's) mind showed a conceit positively unbearable. The damage to the old Diana was not forgotten, of course, {{and there was nothing}} of any nature said or done by Falk (even to the last offer of refreshment in the hotel) that did not seem to have been a cause of offence. [...] "Had the cheek" [...] to drag him (Hermann) into that coffee-room; as though a drink from him could make up for forty-seven dollars and fifty cents of damage in the cost of wood alone--not counting two days' work for the carpenter. Of course he would not stand in the girl's way. He was going home to Germany. There were plenty of poor girls walking about in Germany.|$|R
60|$|In any {{matter of}} which the public has {{imperfect}} knowledge, public opinion is {{as likely to be}} erroneous as is the opinion of an individual equally uninformed. To hold otherwise is to hold <b>that</b> wisdom <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> by combining many ignorances. A man who knows nothing of algebra <b>can</b> not <b>be</b> assisted in the solution of an algebraic problem by calling in a neighbor who knows no more than himself, and the solution approved by the unanimous vote of ten million such men would count for nothing against that of a competent mathematician. To be entirely consistent, gentlemen enamored of public opinion should insist that the text books of our common schools should be the creation of a mass meeting, and all disagreements arising {{in the course of the}} work settled by a majority vote. That is how all difficulties incident to the popular translation of the Hebrew Scriptures were composed. It should be admitted, however that most of those voting knew a little Hebrew, though not much. A problem in mathematics is a very simple thing compared with many of those upon which the people are called to pronounce by resolution and ballot--for example, a question of finance.|$|R

They did not inspect our water-skins, arms, and accoutrements for nothing to-day. We are to start on the 30th across the desert. There is no secret about it, or of course Clinton wouldn't have told me. There are to be our regiment, a squadron of Hussars, the Mounted Infantry, and Engineers. We are to take with us baggage-camels and the camels of the heavy and light regiments. We are going to Gakdul, about a hundred miles off. There all the stores are to be left, and the camels and Mounted Infantry to come back here. We are to remain to guard the stores.

60|$|There {{is still}} in truth upon these great level plains a people, a {{community}} bound together by imaginative possessions, by stories and poems which have grown out of its own life, and by a past of great passions which can still waken the heart to imaginative action. One could still, if one had the genius, and had been born to Irish, write for these people plays and poems like those of Greece. Does not the greatest poetry always require a people to listen to it? England or any other country which takes its tune from the great cities and gets its taste from schools and not from old custom, may have a mob, but it cannot have a people. In England {{there are a few}} groups {{of men and women who}} have good taste, whether in cookery or in books; and the great multitudes but copy them or their copiers. The poet must always prefer the community where the perfected minds express the people, to a community that is vainly seeking to copy the perfected minds. To have even perfectly the thoughts that can be weighed, the knowledge <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> from books, the precision that can be learned at school, to belong to any aristocracy, is to be a little pool that will soon dry up. A people alone are a great river; and that is why I am persuaded that where a people has died, a nation is about to die.|$|E
6000|$|The changed atmosphere, the new conditions, do, however, make {{an immense}} {{superficial}} {{difference between the}} humour even of Mr. Bret Harte and that of English writers. His fun {{is derived from the}} vagaries of huge, rough people, with the comic cruelty of the old Danes, and with the unexpected tenderness of a sentimental time. The characters of the great Texan and Californian drama are like our hackneyed friends, the Vikings, with a touch, if we may use the term, of spooniness. Their humour is often nothing more than a disdainful trifling with death; they seize the comic side of manslaughter very promptly, and enjoy all the mirth <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>got</b> out of revolvers and grizzly bears. In Mr. Bret Harte's poems of [...] "The Spelling Bee" [...] and of [...] "The Break-up of the Society upon the Stanislaw," [...] the fun is of this practical sort. The innate mirthfulness of a chunk of old red sandstone is illustrated, and you are introduced to people who not only take delight of battle with their peers, but think the said battle the most killing joke in the world. The incongruities of these revels of wild men in a new world; their confusion when civilization meets them {{in the shape of a}} respectable woman or of a baby; their grotesque way of clinging to religion, as they understand it, make up the transatlantic element in this American humour. The rest of it is [...] "European quite," [...] though none the worse for that. It is more humane, on the whole, than the laughable and amazing paradoxes of Mark Twain, or the naivetes of Artemus Ward.|$|E

Therefore, if I don't pay my own passage in the ship you go in, sir, I'll pay my own passage in another.

60|$|Had the Ashantis adopted {{these tactics}} {{they could have}} crushed with ease the little bands with which the English {{attacked}} them.

A half dozen white men {{have been known to}} keep a whole tribe of Red Indians at a distance on the prairie.
