5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> coastal region of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> coastal region of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E
5|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat destruction. Since <b>the</b> <b>arid,</b> spiny forests in which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Comprising a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{located in}} <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> and sparsely {{populated}} Four Corners region, the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile – concerns of erosion caused by tourists {{have led to}} the closure of Fajada Butte to the public. The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by the Hopi and Pueblo people, who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land. Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2008, Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers (ITS and ETS), and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pdh) region, in the first molecular analysis of the section Malvanthera. They found F. obliqua to be most closely related to three species of <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> Northern Territory (F. platypoda, F. subpuberula and F. lilliputiana) and classified it in a new series Obliquae in the subsection Platypodeae. The species had remained a transitional rainforest species while its relatives radiated into dryer regions.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, a {{plant species}} {{may only be}} {{effectively}} pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered {{at least in part}} because their pollinator is also threatened.

It occurs primarily in <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> regions of the Southwestern United States in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada. It is often conspicuous because of its shrubby or even tree-like size, its silhouette, and its long-lasting yellowish fruits.|$|E
5|$|The convoy {{arrived at}} Addu Atoll {{on the evening}} of 9 February, and {{anchored}} there to refuel and take on supplies. This atoll served as a secret supply base for Allied vessels in the Indian Ocean, and the Australian soldiers were not told where they were while the refuelling took place. The troops were also not permitted to go ashore, but regarded the sight of the tropical atoll as a welcome change from <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> Middle East. After the ships were refuelled, the convoy sailed on the afternoon of 10 February.|$|E
5|$|The creek flows {{generally}} south-southwest {{through a}} narrow coastal watershed at the southern extreme end of <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> Los Angeles Basin in a fairly straight course. Owing to the submersion of Southern California in the Pacific Ocean as recently as 10million years ago, the creek flows over marine sedimentary rock that dates from the late Eocene to the Pliocene. The present-day form of the watershed, with its broad sediment-filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons, was shaped by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon, the creek's final gorge.|$|E

5|$|The splendid fairywren {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> and semi-arid zones of Australia. Habitat is typically dry and shrubby; mulga and mallee in drier {{parts of the}} country and forested areas in the southwest. The western subspecies splendens and eastern black-backed fairywren (subspecies melanotus) are largely sedentary, although the turquoise fairywren (subspecies musgravei) is thought to be partially nomadic. Unlike the eastern superb fairywren, the splendid fairywren has not adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and has disappeared from some urbanised areas. Forestry plantations of pine (Pinus spp.) and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.|$|E
5|$|A {{semi-arid}} desert or a steppe is {{a version}} of <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located {{at the edge of}} deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot steppe) or BSk (temperate steppe) in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities.

Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{saprobic}} fungus, Cyathus olla obtains {{nutrients from}} {{the breakdown of}} dead organic matter, and as such is usually found growing on woody debris; specimens found growing on soil are usually attached to bits of wood or stems present in the soil. Brodie notes that this species usually grows in moist and shaded locations, although its discovery in <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> regions of Lima, Peru, {{suggest that it is}} tolerant of low-moisture conditions. It is the most abundant species of Cyathus found in Europe, and is also common in North America. Its range extends north to Sweden and far south in South America; it has also been reported in Australia, South Africa, Iran, and India.|$|E
5|$|Grey currawongs {{are found}} {{right across the}} {{southern}} part of Australia from the Central Coast region of New South Wales, occurring south of latitude 32°S southwards and westwards, from the vicinity of Mudgee in the north and southwest to Temora and Albury onto the Riverina and across most of Victoria and southern South Australia to the fertile south-west corner of Western Australia and the semi-arid country surrounding it. The clinking subspecies is endemic to Tasmania, where it is more common in the eastern parts, but is absent from King and Flinders Islands in Bass Strait. There is an outlying population in <b>the</b> <b>arid</b> area where the Northern Territory meets South Australia and Western Australia. In general, the grey currawong is sedentary throughout its range, although it appears to be resident in the cooler months only in south Gippsland in eastern Victoria and the far south coast of New South Wales.|$|E
