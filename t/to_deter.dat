5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about the}} role private litigation should play in the enforcement of antitrust law. This article focuses {{on one of the}} most controversial private enforcement mechanisms – damages actions – and assesses whether and how much such actions have contributed <b>to</b> <b>deterring</b> antitrust violations in Japan. It does so by answering two questions: (1) how much have damages actions contributed to the detection of antitrust violations?, and (2) how much have damages actions contributed to an increase in the sanctions for antitrust violations? Based on original data concerning damages actions between 1990 and 2010, the article argues that damages actions have somewhat contributed <b>to</b> <b>deterring</b> certain antitrust violations, bid-rigging in particular, but that an almost equivalent measure of deterrence could have been generated more efficiently by imposing higher penalties through public enforcement. ...|$|R

5|$|Numerous insects utilize {{defensive}} regurgitation. The eastern {{tent caterpillar}} regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants. Similarly, larvae of the noctuid moth regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and irritant properties that help <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> predator attacks.|$|E

5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and {{it is suggested that}} they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
