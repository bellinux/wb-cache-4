5|$|Nereid is {{the third-largest}} moon of Neptune. It has a {{prograde}} but very eccentric orbit and {{is believed to}} be a former regular satellite that was scattered to its current orbit through gravitational interactions during Triton's capture. Water ice has been spectroscopically detected on its surface. Early measurements of Nereid showed large, irregular variations in its visible magnitude, which were speculated to be caused by forced precession or chaotic rotation combined with an elongated shape and bright or dark spots on the surface. This was disproved in 2016, when observations from the Kepler space telescope showed only minor variations. Thermal modeling based on infrared observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes suggest that Nereid is only moderately elongated which disfavours forced precession of the rotation. The <b>thermal</b> <b>model</b> also indicates that the surface roughness of Nereid is very high, likely similar to the Saturnian moon Hyperion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>model</b> postulates {{that the}} high {{temperature}} facilitates the proton transfer between matrix and analyte in melted matrix liquid. Ion-to-neutral ratio is an important parameter to justify the theoretical model, and the mistaken citation of ion-to-neutral ratio could result in an erroneous determination of the ionization mechanism. The model quantitatively predicts the increase in total ion intensity {{as a function of}} the concentration and proton affinity of the analytes, and the ion-to-neutral ratio {{as a function of the}} laser fluences. This model also suggests that metal ion adducts (e.g., + or +) are mainly generated from the thermally induced dissolution of salt.|$|E
2500|$|... 5751 Zao {{has been}} {{observed}} by several groups to determine its rotational period. [...] Its light curve was observed by Pravec, et al. between 1992 and 1995 {{with the intention of}} determining its rotational period. [...] From its nearly constant brightness it was determined that the asteroid is roughly spherical and has a rotational period of ≥21.7hr. Another group led by Wisniewski conducted an approximately 5 hour observation and were unable to conclude a rotational period. [...] 5751 Zao was again observed in 2001 by Delbó, et al. using the Keck telescope. [...] They were able to determine the asteroid's albedo of 0.36 and re-classify the asteroid from X-type to E-type. [...] Using the asteroid's albedo and the Near Earth Asteroid <b>Thermal</b> <b>Model</b> (NEATM) the asteroid's diameter was estimated to be 2.3km. [...] Further study of the asteroid by the Ondrejov Asteroid Photometry Project concludes that a rotational period of 76hours is consistent with earlier measurements.|$|E

In the present research, two novel dynamic <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> have been introduced for the cast-resin dry-type transformer. These models are based on two artificial neural networks: the Elman recurrent networks (ELRN) and the nonlinear autoregressive model process with exogenous input (NARX).

40|$|Abstract—The most {{important}} parameter in transformers {{life expectancy is}} the hot-spot temperature level which accelerates the rate of aging of the insulation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> for transformers loaded at prefabricated MV/LV transformer substations and outdoor situations. The hot-spot temperature of transformers is studied using their top-oil temperature rise <b>models.</b> The <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> proposed for hot-spot and top-oil temperatures of different operating situations are compared. Since the thermal transfer is different for indoor and outdoor transformers considering their operating conditions, their hot-spot <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> differ from each other. The proposed <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> are verified by the results obtained from the experiments carried out on a typical 1600 kVA, 30 / 0. 4 kV, ONAN transformer for both indoor and outdoor situations...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>modeling</b> of space payloads is expensive and cumbersome.

The extended Kalman fillter (EKF) is the most widely used parameter estimation algorithm for nonlinear models.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} <b>thermal</b> <b>modeling</b> of asteroids {{with a new}} derivation of the Near Earth Asteroid <b>Thermal</b> (NEATM) <b>model</b> which correctly {{accounts for}} the presence of reflected sunlight in short wave IR bands. Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation applies to this case and has important implications. New insight is provided into the eta parameter in the NEATM model and it is extended to <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> besides NEATM. The role of surface material properties on eta is examined using laboratory spectra of meteorites and other asteroid compositional proxies; the common assumption that emissivity e = 0. 9 in asteroid <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> may not be justified and can lead to misestimating physical parameters. In addition, indeterminacy in <b>thermal</b> <b>modeling</b> can limit its ability to uniquely determine temperature and other physical properties. A new curve fitting approach allows <b>thermal</b> <b>modeling</b> to be done independent of visible band observational parameters such as the absolute magnitude H. These new <b>thermal</b> <b>modeling</b> techniques are applied to observational data for selected asteroids from the WISE/NEOWISE mission. The previous NEOWISE analysis assumes Kirchhoff's law does not apply. It also deviates strongly from established statistical practice and systematically underestimates the sampling error inherent in observing potentially irregular asteroids from a finite sample of observations. As a result, the new analysis finds asteroid diameter and other physical properties that have large differences from published NEOWISE results, with greatly increased error estimates. NEOWISE results have a claimed +/- 10 % accuracy for diameter estimates, but this is unsupported. ABSTRACT CONTINUED IN PDF [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Design and {{verification}} of today's nanometer very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) system remain a very challenging problem. For instance, the sub- 90 -nm technology has caused extremely large parasitic global interconnects and complicated models such as clock networks, power delivery networks and <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> for packaged systems, which {{are difficult to}} be analyzed directly due to the limited computing resources. In addition, the high performance VLSI systems such as multi-core and emerging 3 D stacked integrated systems, also lead to excessive high temperature on chip due to the elevated power densities. As a result, temperature should be explicitly managed both at design time through thermal-aware optimization and design techniques and at runtime through on-chip dynamic thermal management (DTM). Hence, accurate yet compact <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> are required for thermal-aware design and optimization. In this dissertation, we focus on those challenging issues and have proposed three novel techniques to facilitate the {{verification of}} the electronic and thermal effects of the nanometer integrated systems. Specifically, first, we have introduced a wideband model order reduction algorithm (WBMOR) to provide a general solution for the large system analysis problems. With the novel imaginary axis sampling technique and adaptive sample point placement, WBMOR is able to generate a reduced system accurate within the specified frequency band. Second, we have proposed a com- posable <b>thermal</b> <b>modeling</b> technique (ThermComp) for compact <b>thermal</b> <b>modeling.</b> ThermComp builds compact <b>thermal</b> <b>models</b> for each basic module, and uses these models to assemble different multi-core architecture <b>thermal</b> <b>models,</b> which improves the <b>thermal</b> <b>modeling</b> and analysis efficiency at design time. Last but not least, a runtime thermal estimation and prediction method (FRETEP) framework has been proposed to enable fine-grained DTM. With a thermal sensor based error compen- sation method utilizing only limited number of thermal sensors, FRETEP is able to estimate and predict the full-chip thermal behavior accurately with even inaccurate power estimation. Furthermore, a power-driven thermal sensor placement algorithm has been developed for FRETEP to further enhance the thermal estimation accuracy...|$|R
