5|$|For instance, {{when one}} cell of a {{spreadsheet}} changes, {{it is necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>recalculate</b> the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the recalculations {{of the values of}} individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be recalculated earlier than the expression that uses it. Topologically ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in makefiles for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low-level computer program optimization.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Panzer Army's {{offensive}} forced Stavka <b>to</b> <b>recalculate</b> its intentions for Operation Saturn, and on 13 December Stalin and Stavka {{authorized the}} redeployment of the 2nd Guards Army from the Don Front to the Stalingrad Front, {{where it would}} be ready to be used against German forces on 15 December. This army had a strength of roughly 90,000 soldiers, organized into three guards rifle corps (the 1st, 13th and 2nd). Operation Saturn was redesigned into Operation Little Saturn, which limited the scope of the attack to breaking through the Italian 8th Army and then engaging Army Group Don in the rear. The offensive was also changed from a southward push to a drive in a southeastern direction, and the start date was pushed back to 16 December. In the meantime, the 4th Mechanized and 13th Tank Corps continued to counterattack against German forces {{in the vicinity of the}} Alksay River, trying to delay their advance in anticipation of the arrival of the 2nd Guards Army.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing <b>to</b> <b>recalculate</b> portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E

25|$|Babbage's {{motivation}} to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation {{has been a}} commonplace since Dionysius Lardner wrote about it in 1834 in the Edinburgh Review (under Babbage's guidance). The context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account {{of the origin of}} the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve The Nautical Almanac. Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, <b>to</b> <b>recalculate</b> some part of those tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation. The issue of the Nautical Almanac is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to Sir Joseph Banks, who had died in 1820.|$|E
500|$|Forecasters at the SPC {{initially}} {{underestimated the}} atmospheric conditions that would support tornadic development that afternoon and evening; around 4:00a.m. CDT, Doppler radar and wind profile data indicated a [...] jet streak {{along the border}} of California and Nevada, with weather balloon soundings sent up the previous evening by National Weather Service offices in the western United States and numerical computer model data failing to detect the fast-moving air current as it moved ashore from the Pacific Ocean. In addition, the dry line was diffused, with surface winds behind and ahead of the boundary moving into the region from a southerly direction. SPC meteorologists began <b>to</b> <b>recalculate</b> model data during the morning {{to account for the}} stronger wind profiles caused by the jet streak; the data acknowledged that thunderstorms would occur within the Central Plains, but disagreed on the exact area of greatest severe weather risk.|$|E

2500|$|Just as a {{two-dimensional}} slice of a diamond provides incomplete {{information about the}} three-dimensional nature of light behavior inside a diamond, this two-dimensional slice also provides incomplete information about light behavior outside the diamond.

2500|$|If {{the match}} {{has only a}} single innings per side, then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings. Such a match is called a [...] "limited overs" [...] or [...] "one-day" [...] match, and the side scoring more runs wins {{regardless}} {{of the number of}} wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth-Lewis method after its developers, is often used <b>to</b> <b>recalculate</b> a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a [...] "no-result" [...] if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.|$|E

50|$|Multitexturing {{is the use}} of {{more than}} one texture at a time on a polygon. For instance, a light map texture may be used to light a surface as an {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>recalculating</b> that lighting every time the surface is rendered. Microtextures or detail textures are used to add higher frequency details, and dirt maps may add weathering and variation; this can greatly reduce the apparent periodicity of repeating textures. Modern graphics may use in excess of 10 layers for greater fidelity which are combined using shaders. Another multitexture technique is bump mapping, which allows a texture to directly control the facing direction of a surface for the purposes of its lighting calculations; it can give a very good appearance of a complex surface (such as tree bark or rough concrete) that takes on lighting detail in addition to the usual detailed coloring. Bump mapping has become popular in recent video games, as graphics hardware has become powerful enough to accommodate it in real-time.|$|R
