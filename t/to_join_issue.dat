Using the theorization of rebirth among the Esan people of southern Nigeria as a pilot, it asserts that the idea of rebirth plays a psycho-social, therapeutic function of comfort and healing for those traumatized by the death of a loved one. This, it shall be seen, is similar to, even more reliable than, the role of photography in preserving cherished memories.

5|$|During their travels {{across the}} Wastelands, the player can be {{accompanied}} by a single non-player character (NPC) companion, who can assist in combat. Which companion can accompany the player depends on who they have encountered that can join them; it is possible to not encounter all depending on how the game is played.

30|$|In {{spite of}} these efforts, dense {{networks}} still pose significant challenges to network configuration mechanisms. This {{is due to the}} fact that at one time there might be several nodes trying <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the network. Furthermore, several nodes may simultaneously reply <b>to</b> <b>join</b> requests <b>issued</b> by a newly arriving node. As previously mentioned, arising conflicts during the setup phase can be resolved by means of the widely known CSMA/CA protocol. In fact, this mechanism has been included in the specifications of IEEE 802.15. 4. However, WSNs require protocols that are fast, easy to implement, and flexible enough to be used without modifications across different scenarios. CSMA/CA, on the other hand, does not meet these requirements mainly due to the fact that its performance has a strong dependence on its configuration parameters. For instance, it can be tuned to save energy by limiting its backoff period, but this policy will also lead to a large number of collisions in dense networks. If the backoff window is allowed to grow, this policy will lead to long idle times and energy waste. Besides, channel access is not guaranteed.|$|R

After much had been said on the topic, Mr. Gladstone asked {{for a day or two}} to consider the question. 'I have to consider with God's help by Monday whether to enter the cabinet or to retire altogether: at least such is probably the second alternative.' He wished to consult Hope and Manning, and they, upon discussion, urged that the point was too narrow on which <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>issue</b> with the government. This brought him round. 'I well remember,' he says of this early case of compromise, 'that I pleaded against them that I should be viewed as a traitor, and they observed to me in reply that I must be prepared for that if necessary, that (and indeed I now feel) in these times the very wisest and most effective servants of any cause must necessarily fall so far short of the popular sentiment of its friends, as to be liable constantly to incur mistrust and even abuse. But patience and the power of character overcome all these difficulties. I am certain that Hope and Manning in 1843 were not my tempters but rather my good angels.'[159] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{argument}} {{was a strong}} one; but had it been ten times as strong, the result {{would have been the}} same. The Mixed Tribunals, an international institution, delivered its judgment on strictly political grounds, the judges taking their orders from the different countries they represented. It was solemnly pronounced that war expenses were not 'extraordinary expenses.' The proximate destruction of the Khalifa's power was treated quite as a matter of everyday occurrence. A state of war was apparently regarded as usual in Egypt. On this wise and sensible ground the Egyptian Government were condemned to pay back £E500,000, together with interest and costs. After a momentary hesitation as to whether the hour had not come <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>issue</b> on the whole subject of the financial restrictions of Egypt, it was decided to bow to this iniquitous decision. The money had now to be refunded. It had already been spent. More than that, other sums were needed for the carrying on of the war. The army was by then occupying Dongola, and was in actual expectation of a Dervish counter-attack, and it was evident that the military operations could not be suspended or arrested. It was impossible to stop; yet without money it seemed impossible to go on; and, besides, it appeared that Egypt would be unable to repay the £E500,000 which she had been granted, and of which she was now deprived.|$|E

40|$|The issue of-whether, {{and to what}} extent, {{immigrants}} {{should be}} assisted in the integration process by government-initiated programs has been a long-standing policy concern in countries exposed to waves of immigration. In Israel, where the raison d'tre {{of the state is}} to be a homeland for any person of the Jewish tradition who wishes <b>to</b> <b>join</b> Israeli society, <b>issues</b> of assistance to immigrants are ascribed particular importance. This study evaluated the re-training policy of the Israeli government for Soviet immigrant scientists as an immediately available employment and integration solution. The policy was initiated following the mass immigration from the former USSR during 1989 - 1991. The scientists were re-trained to teach science in high-schools. The investigation focuses on the impact of this policy as an immediate absorption solution, the impact of retraining offered by universities on employment and professional performance, and the benefit to the host educational system. Technical feasibility and its role in decision making will be discussed. Copyright 1998 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R
6000|$|From {{these two}} sources mainly {{the work of}} {{contemporary}} sociologists derives. But there persists about it a curious discursiveness that reflects upon the power and value of the initial impetus. Mr. V.V. Branford, the able secretary of the Sociological Society, recently attempted a useful work in a classification of the methods {{of what he calls}} [...] "approach," [...] a word that seems to me eminently judicious and expressive. A review of the first volume the Sociological Society has produced brings home the aptness of this image of exploratory operations, of experiments in [...] "taking a line." [...] The names of Dr. Beattie Crozier and Mr. Benjamin Kidd recall works that impress one as large-scale sketches of a proposed science rather than concrete beginnings and achievements. The search for an arrangement, a [...] "method," [...] continues as though they were not. The desperate resort to the analogical method of Commenius is confessed by Dr. Steinmetz, who talks of social morphology, physiology, pathology, and so forth. There is also a less initiative disposition in the Vicomte Combes de Lestrade and in the work of Professor Giddings. In other directions sociological work is apt to lose its general reference altogether, to lapse towards some department of activity not primarily sociological at all. Examples of this are the works of Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb, M. Ostrogorski and M. Gustave le Bon. From a contemplation of all this diversity Professor Durkheim emerges, demanding a [...] "synthetic science," [...] "certain synthetic conceptions"--and Professor Karl Pearson endorses the demand--to fuse all these various activities into something that will live and grow.
