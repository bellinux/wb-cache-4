The old alignment of State Route 237 passes a pond, as the highway pulls away from the river and <b>train</b> <b>tracks.</b> The highway intersects with Township Road 413, which serves access to Hirsh Pond, located to the north. The route begins to head through larger clearings as it continues southeast. At an intersection with German Hill Road, the highway makes a shot to the east, passing through some woods. After the woods, the old alignment of State Route 237 ends at an intersection with State Route 434. This was once an intersection with State Route 137.|$|E
50|$|A <b>train</b> <b>track</b> with weights, or {{weighted}} <b>train</b> <b>track</b> or measured <b>train</b> <b>track,</b> {{consists of}} a <b>train</b> <b>track</b> with a non-negative real number, called a weight, assigned to each branch. The weights {{can be used to}} model which of the curves in a parallel family of curves from a lamination are split to which sides of the switch. Weights must satisfy the following switch condition: The weight assigned to the ingoing branch at a switch should equal the sum of the weights assigned to the branches outgoing from that switch.Weights are closely related to the notion of carrying. A <b>train</b> <b>track</b> is said to carry a lamination if there is a <b>train</b> <b>track</b> neighborhood such that every leaf of the lamination is contained in the neighborhood and intersects each vertical fiber transversely. If each vertical fiber has nontrivial intersection with some leaf, then the lamination is fully carried by the <b>train</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R

40|$|Enthusiasm for {{alternate}} training sites {{has been}} strong among practicing family physicians and students seeking family practice residency posi-tions in Wisconsin. The number of rural <b>training</b> <b>tracks</b> {{in the state}} is increasing rapidly. The Uni-versity of Wisconsin currently has 4 residents in two rural <b>training</b> <b>tracks.</b> If 1998 recruitment is successful, there will be 12 residents in seven rural <b>training</b> <b>tracks</b> operated by two sponsoring insti-tutions in the state. The WIsconsin rural <b>training</b> <b>tracks</b> are 1 - 2 programs,! in which the family practice resident spends the first year in the urban medical center of the home program completing appropriate rotations, such as internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, emergency medicine, surgery, and critical care, and the last 2 years in a rural community and rural hospital as an apprentice with a family practice group.

Known as Main Street, it bows out to the east slightly, and subsequently takes on a due north path as it heads through the town of Cherry Creek. A couple miles later, it reaches the hamlet of Balcom Corners (located in the town of Villenova), a community situated at the junction of NY83 and the western terminus of NY322. Here, NY83 turns westward toward the community of Hamlet, where it intersects with CR72.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19thcentury, the European American {{newcomers}} had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.|$|E
5|$|CenturyLink Field is {{bordered by}} the {{junction}} of Interstates 5 and 90 {{to the east and}} State Route 99 to its west. The State Route 519 corridor connects I-90 to the neighborhood.

The <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port {{to the rest of the}} city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.|$|E

5|$|Travelling to East Germany, Bond infiltrates {{the circus}} and {{finds out that}} Orlov {{replaced}} the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead, primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament {{in the belief that}} the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident, leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion. Bond takes Orlov's car, drives it along the <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> and boards the moving circus train. Orlov gives chase, but is killed at the border by East German guards, after they mistake Orlov for a defector. Bond kills the twin knife-throwing assassins Mischka and Grischka to avenge the murder of 009, and, after falling from the train, commandeers a car to get to the airbase. Bond penetrates the base, and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police. He attempts to convince Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her by showing her one of the treasures found in Orlov's car, which she was to smuggle for him.

5|$|Moe and Renee seem to form {{a strong}} relationship, but Moe is {{insecure}} about his hold on her and he feels he must spend {{large amounts of money}} so she will stay with him. Upon maxing out his credit card, Moe comes up with a scheme to commit insurance fraud by having Homer steal his car and park it on <b>train</b> <b>tracks</b> so it would be destroyed. The night the scheme is supposed to take place, Moe and Renee attend a police charity event aboard a yacht; the event's attendance by all the officers in town ensures Homer will not get caught perpetrating the scheme, and gives Moe an alibi so that no one will suspect he was behind the act. Homer botches the plan by stopping to watch a drive-in movie, while the train they were counting on to destroy Moe's car passes by. Deciding all is not lost, Homer drives the car over a cliff — but his attempt to exit the car before it sinks into the water below fails. The car ends up sinking just near the yacht where the police charity event is taking place, and when Homer swims to the surface, he is arrested.|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{was launched}} {{on the hot}} summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), {{when a group of}} Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near the <b>train</b> <b>tracks,</b> with a key that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian Trawnikis resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran 30 kilometres (19 miles) and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived {{until the end of the}} war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.|$|E
