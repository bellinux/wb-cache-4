5000|$|In China, many {{traditional}} people hold to a collectivistic cultural tradition (or Confucianism). They learn to conform as an interdependent whole {{rather than as}} unique independent beings. This dependency starts in the family, where a parent to child hierarchy is enforced and children are taught to be submissive and obedient. This can cause feelings of rebellion in the child which is why {{some of them may}} turn to eating disorders. The child wants to have some control, but they also do not want to disrespect their parents by pursuing autonomy, and so restricting food or binging and purging is, in a way, their way of making decisions. [...] Several studies confirmed that cultural factors resulting in rebelliousness caused eating disorder symptoms. Ulrike Schmidt, a professor in eating disorders, studied three patients with Chinese heritage who participated in binging and purging behaviours. Her first patient, patient A, grew up in England. As a teenager, patient As parents expected her to help them with their business since they did not speak fluent English. On top of this she gave them most of her earnings from her job, and she was expected to participate in family life. Dr. Schmidt found that her bulimia symptoms came about because she was seeking independence, and yet she wanted to remain obedient to her parents. This conclusion supports the idea that loyalty versus independence played a conflicting role that lead to eating disorder symptoms. [...] Moreover, Dr. Schmidt also concluded that patient As mother nurtured her when she started losing weight. As a result, patient A exploited this in order to make up the deprivations from her childhood. This correlation between conflicting feelings of growing up or remaining young is the other studied cause of why eating disorders arise in young Chinese women. Joyce L. C. did a study in Shenzhen and she reported that some Chinese woman struggle with growing up and so they turn to eating disorders as a control. One such girl relates her feelings when she said, [...] “I like to be a little girl. In being an adult, you need to care about peoples feelings and interact with others. They <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> me. I met two senior students in college and they seemed to treat me well at first. However, suddenly they had become unfriendly and hostile to me. I felt being betrayed. I hid myself in my dormitory, the only place where I felt safe and secure. I indulged in binge eating and vomiting. I dont wish to be hurt by them again.” She turns to bulimia as a way of hiding from reality and indulging herself. Because of societal norms in China, it is seen that some women are turning to eating disorders as a way out from their stress and worry.|$|E

The interior decor at Johnny Cupcakes boutiques features antique refrigerators, baking racks, a 1930s dough mixer, (Boston location) a cast-iron wood-burning oven from the 1890s, (also at the Boston location) and even hidden vanilla-scented air fresheners; items are usually displayed on baking trays and inside glass pastry cases. [...] The stores' prominent baking theme often confuses unfamiliar patrons who walk in thinking that they sell baked goods, not clothing.

40|$|Subject headings: {{embedded}} systems / program compilers / instruction sets. ii STATIC RESOURCE MODELS FOR CODE-SIZE EFFICIENT EMBEDDED PROCESSORS 1 Abstract: Due to an increasing need for flexibility, {{embedded systems}} embody {{more and more}} programmable processors as their core components. Because of silicon area and power considerations, the corresponding instruction sets are often highly encoded to minimize code size for given performance requirements. This has hampered the development of robust optimizing compilers because the resulting irregular instruction set architectures are far from convenient compiler targets. Among others, they introduce an interdependence between the tasks of instruction selection and scheduling. This so-called phase coupling is so strong that, in practice, instruction selection rather than scheduling {{is responsible for the}} quality of the schedule, which <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappoint.</b> This lack of efficient compilation tools has also severely hampered the design space exploration of code-size efficient instruction sets, and correspondingly, their tuning to the application domain. In this paper, we present an approach that reduces the need for explicit instruction selection by transferring constraints implied by the instruction set to static resource constraints. All resulting schedules are then guaranteed to correspond to a valid implementation wit...|$|R

In this paper, we present an approach that reduces the need for explicit instruction selection by transferring constraints implied by the instruction set to static resource constraints. All resulting schedules are then guaranteed to correspond to a valid implementation with given instructions. We also demonstrate the suitability of this model to enable instruction set design (-space exploration) with a simple, well-understood and proven method long used in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) of ASICs. Experimental results show the efficacy of our approach...|$|R
40|$|Fourteen {{cases of}} hemiarthroplasty for four-part {{fractures}} of the proximal humerus were reviewed. Pain relief was satisfactory, but function was limited, mainly due to loss of glenohumeral abduction despite elecfromyographic proof of actively confracting abductors in all cases. Analysis of special radiographs of nine cases showed {{a direct relationship}} between the clinical results and the “humeral offset”, or distance between the geomefric cenfre of the humeral head and the lateral aspect of the greater tuberosity. This offset affects the lever arms of the glenohumeral abductor muscles. The implications for surgical technique and {{for the design of}} shoulder prostheses are discussed. After hemiarthroplasty for displaced four-part fractures of the proximal humerus the range of movement <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be <b>disappointing.</b> Abduction is usually limited although the shoulders become relatively painless (Marotte, Lord and Bancel 1978; Lim et a!. 1983; de Anquin and de Anquin 1984; DesMarchais and Morais 1984; Willems and Lim 1985).

40|$|We aim {{to improve}} the {{performance}} of a syntactic parser that uses a part-of-speech (POS) tagger as a preprocessor. Pipelined parsers consisting of POS taggers and syntactic parsers have several advantages, such as the capability of domain adaptation. However the performance of such systems on raw texts <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> be <b>disappointing</b> as they are affected by the errors of automatic POS tagging. We attempt to compensate for the decrease in accuracy caused by automatic taggers by allowing the taggers to output multiple answers when the tags cannot be determined reliably enough. We empirically verify the effectiveness of the method using an HPSG parser trained on the Penn Treebank. Our results show that ambiguous POS tagging improves parsing if outputs of taggers are weighted by probability values, and the results support previous studies with similar intentions. We also examine the effectiveness of our method for adapting the parser to the GENIA corpus and show that the use of ambiguous POS taggers can help development of portable parsers while keeping accuracy high. ...|$|R
40|$|My STEM {{students}} {{have a way of}} making sense of the world that is based in the primacy of rational analytic thinking, and is in often dominated by a hidden model of the world that is based in static equilibrium models – a Newtonian physics understanding of the world if you will. However, the social world <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> behave more like over-determined, context-dependent, dynamical (non-linear, 2 ̆ 6 adaptive) systems. When the very rational analytic thinker applies their tacit assumptions about how systems work, they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be very <b>disappointed</b> because their models are wrong and over-determined, context-dependent, dynamical (OCD) systems don 2 ̆ 7 t behave like they expect it to behave. This makes them both not very good at successfully acting within those systems, and very frustrated. To leverage all of their analytic talent and become more successful in the social world, they need to shift their underlying (and generally completely implicit) model of what sort of system it is...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of the changes taking place within the field of credit unions (CU) in Glasgow. It examines the ways in which competing hierarchical and social accountabilities are implicated in and affected by these changes. In recent decades policy makers in the UK have looked to credit unions to help tackle issues of poverty and social inclusion. However, credit unions in the UK have <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>disappoint</b> in terms of their growth and stability, and there have been notable failures. Some influential parties – including local councils, HM Treasury, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the Association of British Credit Unions Limited (ABCUL) – have argued that the way to avoid future failures, achieve a high growth rate, and ultimately meet aspirations in terms of poverty alleviation and social inclusion, is to transform credit unions to implement a more commercialised model. Such a model potentially clashes with the traditions and ethos of some sectors of the credit union community, and thus it faces resistance. The value- rational approach of this research is inspired by the work of Bent Flyvbjerg who provided a modern interpretation of the traditional Greek concept of phronesis and applied it to research with the aim of making social science really matter. Four value-laden questions permeate this research: (1) Where are we going? (2) Who gains and who loses? And by which mechanisms of power? (3) Is this desirable? (4) What should we do? The research analyses developments in the Glasgow credit union (CU) field; it also studies the accountability practices of CUs with a particular focus on a community-based Glasgow CU that has traditions and values which are not easily reconciled with the commercialisation agenda and the demands of modern financial regulatory authorities. The research uses interviews, observations and secondary data sources to answer its research questions. The analysis is classified into both macro and micro levels. On the macro level analysis, the research found that power defines a new reality where accountability has been shifted from people and values to rules and authorities. On the micro level, the analysis shows that neither trust nor accountability work effectively alone; instead, an intelligent integration of trust and accountability is needed to sustain the viability and ethos of the community-based CU...|$|R
