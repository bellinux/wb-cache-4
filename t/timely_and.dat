5|$|In 1903, Hutton, now General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces, sent Chauvel to South Australia to organise {{the light}} horse regiments there. On {{returning}} to Queensland in 1904, he became acting Chief Staff Officer Queensland, based in Brisbane. He {{was promoted to}} the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1909, but his ambition to become the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff in London was blocked by Hutton's successor Major General Charles Hoad. Based on his experiences in South Africa, Chauvel propounded ideas {{on the nature of}} mounted infantry. He recommended that Australian troops improve their discipline in the field, called for stronger leadership from officers, and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for <b>timely</b> <b>and</b> efficient medical evacuation.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while <b>timely</b> <b>and</b> effective evacuations minimized {{loss of life}} along the coast. The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near Yangon on April28 that spawned a possible tornado in an industrial zone. A total of 586homes were damaged there. Just outside {{the city in the}} Hinthada District, a flash flood killed at least 18people. Overall, the storm claimed 37lives in the country and left US$6.7million in damage. In the wake of Mala, the Red Cross distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house those left homeless. Government and social organizations donated 5.4million kyat (US$4,320) in cash to survivors in the Ayeyarwady Region.|$|E

5|$|The hurricane's {{unpredictable}} {{shifts in}} direction created what {{was considered the}} largest peacetime evacuation in the nation's history. Evacuations occurred in sequence to follow the storm's forecast positions, and many residents and tourists along portions of the Gulf Coast were forced to leave twice {{in a matter of}} days. Preparations were generally <b>timely</b> <b>and</b> efficient, though accommodations and resources at storm shelters were stretched thin, and many refugees tried to return home against officials' orders. About 1.25 million people fled the storm in Florida alone, contributing to a region-wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were continuously issued and adjusted, and forecasters stressed the storm's destructive potential for days.|$|E
5|$|Twin Books {{appealed the}} decision, and in March 1996 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit {{reversed}} the original decision, {{stating that the}} novel was a foreign work in 1923 that was not in its home country's public domain when published, therefore the original publication date {{could not be used}} in arguing American copyright law. Instead, the 1926 publication date, the first in which it specifically declared itself to be copyrighted in the United States, is considered the year when the novel was copyrighted in America. As such, Anna Wyler's renewal was <b>timely</b> <b>and</b> valid, thereby upholding Twin Books' ownership of the copyright.|$|E
5|$|Following the defeat, the Chief of the German General Staff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, {{ordered the}} Supreme Army Command {{to conduct a}} court of enquiry into the {{defensive}} collapse of the Arras sector. The court concluded that the Sixth Army headquarters had disregarded frontline commander reports, noting a possible imminent attack and as a result, reserve units were kept too far back to execute a <b>timely</b> <b>and</b> effective counterattack. The court concluded that Sixth Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen failed to apply an elastic defence properly as espoused by German defensive doctrine of the time. Instead, the defensive system {{was a series of}} unmoving strong points and static lines of resistance, which the Allied artillery ultimately isolated and destroyed. As a result of the inquiry, Hindenburg removed Falkenhausen from his command and transferred him to Belgium where he served the remainder of the war as that country's Governor General.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} of financial reporting {{is to provide}} information that is useful to management and stakeholders for resource allocation decisions. For financial information to be useful, it should be <b>timely</b> <b>and</b> free from material errors, omissions, and fraud. In the real time economy, <b>timely</b> <b>and</b> reliable financial information is critical for day-to-day business decisions regarding strategic planning, capital acquisition, credit decisions, supplier partnerships, and so forth. Advances in accounting information systems such as the advent of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have enabled the generation of real time information. However, the practice of traditional auditing has not kept pace with the real time economy. Traditional manual audit procedures are labor and time intensive, which limits audit frequency to a periodic basis, such as annually.|$|E
