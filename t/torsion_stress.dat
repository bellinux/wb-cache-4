The word [...] "torsion" [...] refers to any variable that describes rotation. Thus, torsion fields (i.e., fields of any physical value reasonably described as [...] "torsion") do exist in established physics aside from in this pseudoscientific case, where the terms have been misappropriated. For example, an electromagnetic wave with circular polarization or the stress tensor of a solid body under <b>torsion</b> <b>stress</b> {{can be described as}} torsion fields, although such usage is rare.

40|$|Bearing Stiffeners are {{preventing}} web-local-buckling {{and reinforcing}} this section for point-loads and shear-forces. This paper discusses bearing stiffeners’ contribution in enhancing double-symmetric I-sections’ torsion capacity. Based on the Saint Venant’s formula <b>torsion</b> <b>stresses</b> are carried solemnly by the section, neglecting the stiffeners’ contribution. However, these stiffeners exhibit significant rotational deformation with the I-section in warping, indicating development of internal forces, restraining the warping. Therefore, the negligence of stiffeners’ contribution in Saint Venant’s torsion formula {{has to be}} revised. Torsions within the stiffeners are the Saint Venant’s and torsion-shear-stresses induced by bending. Assuming out-of-plane stresses neglected, normal and bending-shear <b>torsion</b> <b>stresses</b> are zero, leaving only the Saint Venant’s. From equilibrium at the stiffener –to-flange’s-joint, the stiffeners’ natural boundary conditions equation can be obtained. Their presence leads to a rotational-torsion function differentiation along the beam, between stiffeners. But since all points have identical internal torsion forces, the disturbed differential torsion warping equations are identical. Using the geometrical and natural boundary conditions equation the mathematical-rotational-torsion-solution for each field along the beam is obtained. It can be concluded that the member’s torsion stiffness increases approaching to linear while the increment will approach a hyperbola {{as a function of}} stiffeners’ number and thickness, respectively...|$|R

TEM images of steel deformation demonstrate bend extinction contours the parameters of which allow detecting the stress tensor components (bending and torsional stresses of a crystal lattice). The diagrams are constructed for the contribution of stress tensor components to internal stresses in grains having different types of bending. The regularities are obtained for the stress distribution due to bending-torsion of a crystal latticein the deformed face centered cubic crystal system. The experiment shows that the contribution of bending and <b>torsion</b> <b>stress</b> components to the internal stresses is different during the increase of deformation.

40|$|In this paper, the {{theoretical}} {{background and the}} numerical analyses of an advanced beam finite element that relaxes the hypothesis of the cross-section non-deformability are presented. The corresponding new modes, called distortional modes, {{are added to the}} modes describing the behavior of a classical thin-walled beam: tension/compression, bending and torsion. For instance, a load acting in a cross-sectional plane of a beam is considered to induce not only bending and torsion but also distortion. The distortion produces non-uniform shear and axial stresses together with a non-uniform warping of the cross-section. These resulting effects, significant for very thin-walled open profiles (and thin-walled closed profiles with high distortional loadings), are shown in this paper to be important when compared to bending and <b>torsion</b> <b>stresses</b> even in simple loading cases. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, maximum bending {{stresses}} occurring on the rectangular aluminum beam under various small loads were measured with strain gauge, data acquisition cards and computer. Special software {{was developed to}} measure maximum strain and stress on the aluminum beam. Stress values occurring on the aluminum beam under various small loads were measured with strain gauge and those strain values were transmitted to computer directly with data cards. Using the strain, the load and other constant values of the material (Young’s modulus, dimensions, cross section area, load, Poisson’s rate, etc.), the stress values occurring on the beam are calculated and the stress-strain graph is drawn on the screen automatically. In this experimental study, the theoretical knowledge given in the books and experiment results obtained under laboratory conditions were compared with each other.

Assessment of the remaining pipe integrity must account for all loads and can benefit from resolving the multiaxial loads into an equivalent load.

In the first model; the DC (Di rect Clutch) connects two gears together. This gives no change in the set torque (the set output torque equal to the set input torque).
