5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> {{eastern channel}} and {{improvements}} in maritime technology, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar. In February 1997, two fishermen who were not wearing lifejackets drowned after their boat capsized. Two anglers {{had been killed in}} a similar incident in 1994. On 25 June 2007, the Padstow lifeboat and a rescue helicopter rescued the crews of two yachts in separate incidents from the area.|$|E
5|$|Peyton Manning and Leaf {{were widely}} {{considered}} {{the two best}} players available in the 1998 draft, and scouts and analysts debated who should be selected first. Many favored Leaf's stronger arm and greater potential, while others deemed Manning the more mature player and <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> pick. Most observers, however, believed {{that it would not}} greatly matter whether Manning or Leaf was drafted first because either would greatly benefit his team.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the boys}} must pass seven final exams to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each fail two subjects, and are given the option to retake the exams. Anmar passes the retakes and aspires to study English {{literature}} in college, and his family decide to move to <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> region of Arbul now that he has graduated. Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family {{can no longer afford to}} pay for the university fees. Ali chooses not to retake the exams, and his family leave Iraq. Mohammad fails four subjects and must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop. As the documentary closes, it notes that during the year of filming, two of the boys' classmates were killed, six were kidnapped, and seventy-five left Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Described as a {{large and}} {{physically}} imposing character {{with a reputation for}} womanising, Le Gris was a liege man (feudal retainer) of Count Pierre d'Alençon and a favourite at his court, governing a large swathe of his liege lord's territory in addition to his own ancestral holdings. Le Gris' insistence on defending his case by chivalric trial by combat rather than opting for <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> church trial (to which as a cleric in minor orders he was entitled) attracted widespread support for his cause amongst the French nobility, and controversy continues to this day as to where the real guilt lies in the case.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the rebel}} {{victory at the}} Battle of Rijmenam in July 1578, much of the Southern Netherlands were lost to the Spanish Army during the autumn; Brussels was menaced, and the States General were moved to <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> Antwerp. Taking {{advantage}} of the Dutch rebel army's indiscipline, Farnese decided {{at the beginning of}} 1579 to besiege Maastricht. As a feint to distract the Dutch rebels from his goal, but also aiming to scare Antwerp's inhabitants, Farnese moved with his troops to surprise the village of Borgerhout, very close to Antwerp, where a part of the Dutch States Army had its quarters, namely 3,000 or 4,000 infantry which were the backbone of the rebel army and consisted of French Calvinists under François de la Noue, and English and Scottish troops under John Norrey's orders.|$|E
5|$|Expanding {{and moving}} out of their {{homeland}} in Scandinavia and northern Germany, the Germanic peoples had lived in today's Poland for several centuries, during which period many of their tribes also migrated out in the southern and eastern directions (see Wielbark culture). With {{the expansion of the}} Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes came under the Roman cultural influence. Some written remarks by Roman authors that are relevant to the developments on Polish lands have been preserved; they provide additional insight when compared with the archeological record. In the end, as the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic people left eastern and central Europe for <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> and wealthier southern and western parts of the European continent.|$|E

5|$|Goodrich Castle {{appears to}} have been in {{existence}} by 1101, when it was known as Godric’s Castle, named probably after Godric of Mappestone, a local Anglo-Saxon thane and landowner mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Victorian historians, however, believed the castle to date back further to the pre-Norman conquest days of King Canute, and the site may have been among a small number of Saxon fortifications along the Welsh border. By Norman times, Goodrich formed part of the Welsh Marches, a sequence of territories granted to Norman nobles in, and alongside, Wales. Although Goodrich lay on <b>the</b> <b>safer,</b> English side of the border, the threat of raids and attacks continued throughout most of the period.|$|E
5|$|In July 1994 {{one of his}} sons, Norodom Chakrapong, led {{a failed}} coup attempt to topple the {{government}}. Following the coup attempt, Chakrapong took refuge in a hotel in Phnom Penh, but government troops soon discovered his hideout and surrounded the hotel. Chakrapong called Sihanouk, who negotiated with government representatives {{to allow him to}} go into exile in Malaysia. The following November, Sirivudh was accused of plotting to assassinate Hun Sen and imprisoned. Sihanouk intervened to have Sirivudh detained at the interior ministry's headquarters, convinced that there was a secret plan to kill the latter if he were to remain in prison. After Sirivudh was relocated to <b>the</b> <b>safer</b> location, Sihanouk appealed to Hun Sen that Sirivudh be allowed to go into exile in France together with his family. Subsequently, Hun Sen accepted his offer.|$|E

In March 1996, El Fatih Erwa, then minister of state for defense, was authorized by President Omar al-Bashir to make several secret trips to the United States to hold talks with U.S. officials, including Carney and senior C.I.A.

5|$|Julian was now {{faced with}} a finely-balanced {{judgement}} call. <b>The</b> <b>safer</b> option was to ignore Chnodomar's challenge and to keep his forces in their fortified bases and request and await reinforcements, if necessary until the following year's campaign season. But the performance of Barbatio and the imperial comitatus in the recent campaign cast doubt on whether such reinforcements would be supplied and on their value if they were. Such a course would also expose Gaul to a massive Germanic invasion just when the harvest was due. Alternatively, he could fight Chnodomar alone. This offered {{the prospect of a}} decisive victory, since the Alamanni forces were now, unusually, concentrated and not divided into many disparate bands. This argument was strongly made by Florentius, the praefectus praetorio Galliarum (governor-general of Gaul), who had the crucial job of ensuring the army's recruits, pay and supplies. The Romans almost always won pitched battles with barbarians, because of their superior equipment, organisation and training. But in this case it was clearly a high-risk option because of the Germans' massive superiority in numbers.|$|E

40|$|The flight {{envelope}} {{can be viewed}} as a set within the state space of an aircraft. For various safety considerations an aircraft is required to remain within its prescribed {{flight envelope}}. <b>The</b> <b>safe</b> set is <b>the</b> largest controlled invariant set within the flight envelope. Thus, if an aircraft is to remain within its envelope it must stay within <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set. When an aircraft is impaired, e. g., a jammed elevator or an engine loss, <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set shrinks as would be expected. In this paper we consider strategies to prevent the aircraft from departing <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set- <b>the</b> envelope protection problem- and strategies to restore the aircraft to a desired trim point within <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set should it find itself outside <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set- <b>the</b> envelope restoration problem. Note that an aircraft may be driven outside of <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set by a disturbance, a loss-of-control incident, or by a component failure in which <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set shrinks. <b>The</b> problems of envelope protection and restoration are substantially different. Envelope protection requires avoiding close proximity to certain critical boundary segments of <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set. Restoration is more straightforward involving steering the aircraft to a target trim condition along trajectories that minimize the excursion from the flight envelope. Precise formulations of both problems will be given and alternative solutions will be compared. Examples are given using a model derived from the the longitudina...|$|R
