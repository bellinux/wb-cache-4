In the transfer tests, they were tested in a novel absolute <b>timing</b> <b>criterion.</b> RESULTS The results of experiment 1 and 2 showed that the relative timing structure was maintained only when the transfer required parameter scaling close to the parameter value practiced in acquisition. The transfer parameter that is far to the parameter practiced did not affect the movement parameterization. The result of experiment 3 showed that relative timing structure is disrupted in the transfer test when constant practice has high and low amount of practice.

50|$|The {{network is}} used {{when it is}} {{required}} that two or more signals are matched {{to each other on}} some form of <b>timing</b> <b>criterion.</b> Delay is added to all other signals so that the total delay is matched to the signal which already has the longest delay. In television broadcasting, for instance, it is desirable that the timing of the television waveform synchronisation pulses from different sources are aligned as they reach studio control rooms or network switching centres. This ensures that cuts between sources do not result in disruption at the receivers. Another application occurs when stereophonic sound is connected by landline, for instance from an outside broadcast to the studio centre. It is important that delay is equalised between the two stereo channels as a difference will destroy the stereo image. When the landlines are long and the two channels arrive by substantially different routes it can require many filter sections to fully equalise the delay.|$|R

40|$|Deciding {{precisely}} when we {{have acted}} is challenging, as actions involve a train of neural events spread across both space and time. Repeated delays between actions and consequent events {{can result in a}} shift, such that immediate feedback can seem to precede the causative act. Here we examined which neurocognitive representations are affected during such sensorimotor temporal recalibration, by testing if the effect generalizes across limbs and whether it might reflect altered decision criteria for temporal judgments. Hand or foot adaptation phases were interspersed with simultaneity judgments about actions involving the same or opposite limb. Shifts in the distribution of participants 2 ̆ 7 simultaneity responses were quantified using a detection-theoretic model, where a shift of both boundaries together gives a stronger indication that the effect is not simply a result of decision bias. By demonstrating that temporal recalibration occurs in the foot as well as the hand, we confirmed that it is a robust motor phenomenon: Both low and high boundaries shifted reliably in the same-limb conditions. However, in cross-limb conditions only the high boundary shifted reliably. These two patterns are interpreted to reflect a genuine change in how the time of action is represented, and a <b>timing</b> <b>criterion</b> shift, respectively...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple but {{efficient}} timing-driven placement algorithm for FPGAs. The algorithm computes forces acting on a logic block in the FPGA to determine its relative location with respect to other blocks. The forces depend on the criticality of nets shared between the two blocks. Unlike other net-based approaches, timing constraints are incorporated directly into the force equations to guide the placement. Slot assignment is then used to move the blocks into valid slot locations on the FPGA chip. The assignment algorithm also makes use of the delay information of nets so that the final placement is {{able to meet the}} <b>timing</b> <b>criteria</b> specified for the circuit. The novelty of the approach lies in the formulation of the force equations {{and the manner in which}} weights of the nets are dynamically altered to influence the placement.

The WISC-III embodies a structure of analysis and interpretation that fails to incorporate advances in modern psychological theory and imposes strict <b>timing</b> <b>criteria.</b> This emphasis on time and speed of performance has had a negative differential effect on children with ASD. In order to assess whether the newest edition, the WISC-IV, has rectified the previous editions’ failings by incorporating current theory and emphasizing fluid intelligence while de-emphasizing speed, the PRI and PSI from the WISC-IV were compared with the Nonverbal index of the KABC-II. 15 high functioning school aged children with ASD were assessed on both tests and their results were compared to 15 neurotypically developing age matched controls. Although there were no significant group differences on tasks of perceptual reasoning, a significant effect of test between PRI and KABC-II scores were found for children with ASD only.

40|$|Cardiac arrhythmias {{occur when}} the normal pattern of {{electrical}} signals in the heart breaks down. A premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common type of arrhythmia that occurs when a heartbeat originates from an ectopic focus within the ventricles {{rather than from the}} sinus node in the right atrium. This and other arrhythmias are often diagnosed {{with the help of an}} electrocardiogram, or ECG, which records the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes placed on the skin. In an ECG signal, a PVC is characterized by both timing and morphological differences from a normal sinus beat. An implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) is a device used to help physicians diagnose and monitor infrequent cardiac arrhythmias that may not be observed during an ECG recording performed during a normal clinic visit. These devices are implanted under the skin of the chest and simply monitor and record the electrical activity of the heart. The recorded signal is referred to as a subcutaneous electrocardiogram, or SECG. This thesis proposes and tests a novel algorithm that uses an SECG signal to perform PVC detection and is suitable for implementation within an implantable cardiac monitoring device. The proposed algorithm uses a combination of morphological and <b>timing</b> <b>criteria</b> to identify PVCs in near real time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine effects of driver, vehicle, and {{environment}} characteristics on Collision Warning System (CWS) design. One hypothesis was made that the capability of collision avoidance would not be same among a driver, vehicle, and environment group with different characteristics. Accident analysis and quantitative analysis was used to examine this hypothesis in terms of ‘risk’ and ‘safety margin’ respectively. Rear-end collision had a stronger focus in the present study. As a result of accident analysis, heavy truck showed a higher susceptibility of the fatal rear-end accidents than car and light truck. Also, dry road surface compared to wet or snow, dark condition compared to daylight condition, straight road compared to curved road, level road compared to grade, crest or sag, roadway having more than 5 travel lanes compared to roadway having 2, 3 or 4 travel lanes showed a higher susceptibility of the fatal rear-end accidents. Relative rear-end accidents involvement proportion compared to the other types of collision was used as a measure of susceptibility. As a result of quantitative analysis, a significant difference in terms of Required Minimum Warning Distance (RMWD) was made among a different vehicle type and braking system group. However, relatively small difference was made among a different age, gender group in terms of RMWD.

Cerebral arteriograms were performed in 58 patients (110 vessels), and OPG <b>timing</b> <b>criteria</b> for detecting hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis (60 % or greater diameter reduction) were ascertained. Optimal criteria were a delay of one ocular pulse, relative to the other, of greater than 12 msec; and a delay of an ocular pulse, relative to the earlier ear (external carotid) pulse, of greater than 36 msec. These criteria correctly identified 73 % of vessels with 0 to 59 % stenosis and 76 % of vessels with 60 to 100 % stenosis. However, in 26 % of the vessels, OPG was either inconclusive or inaccurate. Correct diagnosis of bilateral hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenoses was made by OPG in 6 of 9 affected patients. SO Doppler was normal in 70 % of vessels with 0 - 59 % stenosis, and abnormal in 75 % of vessels with 60 - 100 % stenosis. Corresponding percentages for ST Doppler were 95 % and 44 %. Abnormal Doppler responses to compression of contralateral facial branches were predic-tive of intracranial cross-collateralization in only 25 % of patients.

40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) has {{potential}} {{to improve the}} efficiency of Spark Ignition (SI) or Compression Ignition (CI) engines particularly at part load near the partial burn/misfire limit. Two challenges of HCCI combustion are: maintaining constant ignition timing despite no direct mechanism to start combustion, and to expand the part load region of HCCI near the misfire limit. To accomplish these goals {{it is critical to}} have accurate online and offline estimates of ignition timing. For offline operating condition ignition timing calculation, a new method is proposed which combines the Coefficient of Variation of Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (COVImep) and percentage of cycles with less than 90 percent heat release of previous cycle. Particularly near the partial burn/misfire limit, this method is more reliable than just COVImep. For online ignition timing estimates, a new method in which the ratio of the peak of main stage and cool flame stage of heat release curve (HTR to HTRLTR Peak Ratio) is used for each cycle. Using this method, normal and partial burn engine cycles can be determined in realtime for fuels exhibiting a cool flame. The two methods are tested on 115 HCCI experimental operating points, in which 300 cycles of cylinder pressure data are collected, and are found to be more reliable than existing methods in the literature. With a more reliable partial burn ignition <b>timing</b> <b>criteria,</b> this information could be used in future studies in a feedback control to stabilize ignition timing in these regions and thus extend the useful operating range of HCCI. 2...|$|E
40|$|Compression {{garments}} on {{the lower}} limbs {{have been used for}} the treatment of venous deficiencies for centuries. More recently, healthy athletes have used similar garments for an edge in performance and improved recovery times. The basis for their use is the increase of blood circulation that helps oxygenate muscles. Active compression devices that apply intermittent compression are less prevalent but have the potential to generate a greater impact on blood circulation. A new study into the effects of active compression required the development of an active compression system that would apply intermittent compression in a reliable manner. In the present thesis, a control system to facilitate active compression and generate a positive impact on blood circulation is pursued. This development involved setting up the timing of the compression and implementing a controller that regulates the compression pressure. A new capacitive sensor for pressure feedback to the controller is also evaluated. In the resulting active compression system that was built, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and heel switch are used to determine the timing of the compression. The ECG synchronizes the compression with the heartbeat, while the heel switch prevents compression from being applied when the calf muscles are contracted because the compression would not have an effect in that scenario. When the <b>timing</b> <b>criteria</b> is met, sequential compression up the calf is applied with five inflatable cuffs to push the blood up the leg and towards the heart. The pressure is sensed during each compression and used in an iterative learning controller that regulates the amount of compression applied...|$|E

In a pediatric animal model, IABP efficacy was investigated {{to determine whether}} IABP timing with a high-fidelity blood pressure signal may improve counterpulsation therapy versus a low-fidelity signal. MethodsIn Yorkshire piglets (n =  19; weight, 13. 0 ± 0. 5 kg) with coronary ligation-induced acute ischemic left ventricular failure, pediatric IABPs (5 or 7 mL) {{were placed in the}} descending thoracic aorta. Inflation and deflation were timed with traditional criteria from low-fidelity (fluid-filled) and high-fidelity (micromanometer) blood pressure signals during 1 : 1 support. Aortic, carotid, and coronary hemodynamics were measured with pressure and flow transducers. Myocardial oxygen consumption was calculated from coronary sinus and arterial blood samples. Left ventricular myocardial blood flow and end-organ blood flow were measured with microspheres. ResultsDespite significant suprasystolic diastolic augmentation and afterload reduction at heart rates of 105 ± 3 beats per minute, left ventricular myocardial blood flow, myocardial oxygen consumption, the myocardial oxygen supply/demand relationship, cardiac output, and end-organ blood flow did not change. Statistically significant end-diastolic coronary, carotid, and aortic flow reversal occurred with IABP deflation. Inflation and deflation timed with a high-fidelity versus low-fidelity signal did not attenuate systemic flow reversal or improve the myocardial oxygen supply/demand relationship. ConclusionsSystemic end-diastolic flow reversal limited counterpulsation efficacy in a pediatric model of acute left ventricular failure. Adjustment of IABP inflation and deflation timing with traditional criteria and a high-fidelity blood pressure waveform did not improve IABP efficacy or attenuate flow reversal.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Recent {{advances}} {{in computer technology}} have made possible the development of expert systems. Expert systems are computer programs that perform {{at the level of}} a human expert. Expert systems can help integrate and apply diverse sources of information and expertise to problems of integrated crop management. A prototype Crop Management eXpert (CMX) system has been developed. The primary goal of CMX is to provide recommendations on optimal irrigation and fertilization scheduling for wheat production in the Pacific Northwest. This system can be used by farmers and/or extension agents. OUS II Shell {{has been used as a}} implementation tool. To build this rule - based expert system, a development strategy, commonly used in the construction of expert systems, consisting of 1) identification; 2) conceptualization; 3) formalization; 4) implementation; and 5) testing was applied. CMX is composed of modules for irrigation and fertilization management. For irrigation management, CMX is mainly involved in the irrigation scheduling which is the major part of irrigation management. Irrigation strategies have been applied in irrigation decision making. For each strategy, <b>timing</b> <b>criteria</b> which generally consist of management allowed depletion, soil water potential, leaf water potential, and water stress indices have been used. The system provides farmers with irrigation scenarios which determine when and how much water to apply. CMX represents an integration of conventional computing and expert systems technology designed to provide expert recommendations enabling farmers to obtain the best return on their water and fertilizer investment. For fertilization management, a variety of variables have been taken into considered. Crop growth stages, soil moisture, nutrient analysis, protein requirement, and application methods are important factors for the fertilizer decision making. Several constraints have been used in optimal fertilizer advice. CMX can focus only on relevant information, thus reducing the problem space to a manageable size and significantly, improving the efficiency of the system. The facility of the expert system to explain the decision-making process enables users to better understand the underlying assumptions, facts, and reasoning used to generate recommendations. The CMX prototype demonstrates the feasibility of employing expert systems technology in agricultural applications. CMX has been validated and evaluated.

40|$|Examination of the {{microstructural}} and textural {{development of}} the lead-zinc mineralisation at Mount Isa reveals that it formed cogenetically with the large-scale Cu orebodies by late syndeformational replacement. The constraints on mineralisation provided by the sedimentological framework (Neudert, 1984) and <b>timing</b> <b>criteria</b> place the lead-zinc and its associated pyrrhotite and layer-parallel pyrite as forming late in the last major phase of deformation affecting the mine area. This is the same event as that which formed the copper ore (Perkins, 1984; Swager, 1985 a) and indicates copper-lead-zinc to be a zoned late-stage epigenetic system. A succession of stratigraphically-constrained samples traced into the orebody reveals the progressive development of an alteration system that formed from well-laminated carbonaceous siltstones and mudstones. At the periphery, alteration consists of bleaching by destruction of carbonaceous seams and enhanced growth of dolomite. Progressively further inwards, it changes to mica and albite-bearing 'buff alteration', commonly into siderite, magnetite and stilpnomelane, through a chloritic zone, to ultimately massive 'silica-dolomite' alteration. Paralleling this alteration was the formation of abrupt pyrite-pyrrhotite transitions, and a zonation from sphalerite to galena to chalcopyrite. The characteristic folded and breccia ores were {{not the result of}} ductile or fluid-assisted deformation of preexisting sulphide-siltstone interlayers, but instead formed by shear-controlled carbonate alteration that was ultimately replaced by sulphides. Layer-parallel mineralisation commonly terminates abruptly on or near extensional dolomite veins that formed progressively through the last major deformation event in the mine. Layer-parallel mineralisation formed {{at the same time as}} one in folded and brecciated zones. Evidence cited in previous studies for large-scale remobilisation and recrystallisation during deformation, which is a logical consequence if mineralisation had been an integral part of the sedimentary succession, can be more consistently interpreted as resulting from a single episode of sulphide deposition. Both bedding-parallel and cross-cutting structures that control the localisation of mineralisation existed prior to the precipitation of sulphides. Dissolution of sulphides only occurs where there is a paragenetic sequence of sulphides, with fine-grained pyrite locally overprinted by all other economic sulphides (Grondijis and Schouten, 1937). Sphalerite is overprinted by galena, and both are overprinted by chalcopyrite, which everywhere is paragenetically the youngest sulphide. Copper-lead-zinc concentrations formed from hydrothermal solutions entering the region of the ramp of the Paroo Fault and then migrating outwards to form an evolving alteration system during the formation of both the layer-parallel and cross-cutting steep cleavages. This was overprinted by a relatively short-lived mineralisation event to form the zoned copper-lead-zinc system. Implications of this interpretation for other similar deposits around the world are profound. It indicates a necessity to reexamine many other deposits using techniques that relate ore textures to associated structures at all scales. A completely different ore genesis paradigm may result and exploration concepts may need to be substantially modified...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{review of}} 33 studies {{identifies}} the factors of prior stroke, older age, urinary and bowel incontinence, and visuo-spatial deficits as adverse prognostic indicators of function. No relationship is shown between sex, hemisphere of stroke, and functional outcome. Functional admission score {{is a strong}} predictor of discharge functional status, but its relationship with improvement in function is unclear. Findings regarding the prognostic value of severity of paralysis and onset-admission delay are ambiguous. Comparison among studies is hindered by differences In patient samples, <b>timing</b> of assessments, <b>criteria</b> by which outcome is measured and measuring instrument used. Future studies should measure function at set tunes post-stroke, use functional scales whose reliability and validity is well established, and be conduct-ed in several treatment centres {{to ensure that the}} sample is representative of the population to which the predictor measure is to be applied. Stroke Vol 17, No 4, 1986 STROKE as a leading cause of disability necessitates the expenditure of considerable resources for the reha-bilitation of its victims. As a result, identifying factors that predict functional recovery after stroke has bee...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveEarly enteral {{nutrition}} is beneficial for acute pancreatitis (AP), but the optimal <b>timing</b> and <b>criteria</b> remain unclear. The {{aim of this}} study was to explore the feasibility and safety of early oral refeeding (EORF) based on hunger in patients with moderate or severe AP. MethodsIn a prospective, single-center, controlled, randomized clinical trial (ChiCTR-TRC- 12002994), eligible patients with moderate or severe AP were randomized to either EORF or conventional oral refeeding (CORF). Patients in the EORF group restarted an oral diet when they felt hungry, regardless of laboratory parameters. Those in the CORF group restarted an oral diet only when clinical and laboratory symptoms had resolved. Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. ResultsIn all, 146 eligible patients with moderate or severe AP were included and randomized to the EORF (n = 70) or CORF (n = 76) group. There were eight dropouts after randomization (three in EORF group; five in CORF group). The groups had similar baseline characteristics. The total length of hospitalization (13. 7 ± 5. 4 d versus 15. 7 ± 6. 2 d; P = 0. 0398) and duration of fasting (8. 3 ± 3. 9 d versus 10. 5 ± 5. 1 d; P = 0. 0047) were shorter in the EORF group than in the CORF group. There was no difference in the number of adverse events or complications between the two groups. The mean blood glucose level after oral refeeding was higher in the EORF group than in the CORF group (P = 0. 0030). ConclusionsThis controlled, randomized clinical trial confirmed the effectiveness and feasibility of EORF based on hunger in patients with moderate or severe AP. EORF could shorten the length of hospitalization in patients with moderate or severe AP...|$|R
50|$|The IPO {{selection}} procedure in Hungary {{is closely related}} to and based on the National Students Competition in philosophy, which is embedded {{in a wide range of}} National high-school competitions organized under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. All the competitions (mathematics, etc.) are organized in 3 levels, over January - April. The competitions in philosophy involve 11th and mainly 12th grade students, altogether approx. 300 students nationwide.The first, school-level round is based on testing knowledge in history of philosophy (thus emphasizing the relevance of the curricula and maturity criteria).Students with sufficient score are eligible to enter the 2nd round. The second round is about writing an essay, students are free to select one topic out of four. The best papers are selected by a jury of Academics, which consists of Faculty staff members invited by the ME, who will invite the students to the finals, i.e. an oral examination. Hungarian is the only official language all through the national competition levels.The IPO Selection invites the best 30 students after the 2nd round. Under the supervision of the Hungarian Philosophical Society, a new Jury are being invited who will propose the 4 quotations, and they should evaluate all the papers. Students will take part at the IPO selection where all the IPO rules and regulations are respected: essay-writing, bi-lingual dictionary, <b>timing,</b> evaluation <b>criteria,</b> languages, etc. Usually approx. 15 students take part at the IPO selection and the authors of best 2 papers are proposed to participate at the IPO.Students receive assistance from their teachers to participate at the competitions, however the Philosophical Youth Camps and the „Philosophical tea-house” movement (inspired by IPO colleagues in Turkey) may also help students to gain and deepen their interest in philosophy.|$|R
