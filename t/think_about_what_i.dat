He {{was one of the}} most {{significant}} architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents. Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. He said: [...] "It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was later to call structuralism", (cited in Plan 2/1982, Amsterdam), a reference to the architectural movement known as Dutch Structuralism.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hill collaboratively {{wrote an}} autobiography, , with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, {{published}} by W.W. Norton & Company. As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E

At least, my heart won't break if I don't get her. Win her if you can, and I wish you joy of her. Good-bye! Don't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said to you.

60|$|Then I {{decided that}} I would not shoot at him unless he started down. My {{excitement}} {{was difficult to}} control. I {{found it impossible to}} attend to my sensations, to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was feeling. But the moment was full of suspense. The bear went into a small clump of spruces and stayed there a little while. Tantalizing moments! The hounds were hot upon his trail, still working to and fro in the oak thicket. I judged scarcely a mile separated them from the bear. Again he disappeared behind a little bush. Remembering that five pairs of sharp eyes could see me from the points above I stood up and waved my red cap. I waved it wildly as a man waves a red flag in moments of danger. Afterward R.C. said he saw me plainly and understood my action. Again the bear had showed, this time on an open slide, where he had halted. He was looking across the canyon while I waved my cap.|$|E

He told reporters that his health problems had made him reorder his priorities, [...] "It made me <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> things <b>I</b> wanted to do, like go backpacking off in the Boundary Waters."

5000|$|Springsteen has {{expressed}} some {{mixed feelings about}} the album, believing that Nebraska contains some of his strongest writing, while Born in the U.S.A. did not necessarily follow suit. The title track [...] "more or less stood by itself", he declared. [...] "The rest of the album contains a group of songs about which I've always had some ambivalence." [...] Even so, and despite expressing the [...] "grab-bag nature" [...] of the album, he acknowledged its powerful effect on his career, claiming: [...] "Born in the U.S.A. changed my life and gave me my largest audience. It forced me to question the way I presented my music and made me <b>think</b> harder <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Peace Now, Tali Griffel described her memories of the attack: [...] "For many years, <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened. <b>I</b> just blocked out everything and then slowly, slowly I sort of regained feeling. I remember as the shooting started, my mother grabbed me and lay down, putting me under her. She whispered to me, keeping me calm. I can still recall {{the feeling of the}} jolt as she got shot. Yet, she continued to hold me and talk to me as she bled to death. When I crawled out, I sat there alone for a very long time. The Egyptian police came and took me away to a dark room where they interrogated me for hours." ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 22). Twofold is {{an exhibition}} of work inspired by a need for space-saving furniture, manufacturing processes, daily routine, and origami. The pieces are designed as folding furniture objects to expand usability and aesthetics of a space by utilizing folding processes, thin profiles, and camouflage. Graphic themes of origami are used as pattern and an instructional guide for folding processes. The pieces are cut using a laser cutter and CNC router. Having access to these industrial tools has changed my entire perspective on making. It makes me <b>think</b> less <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> need the tools to do and more <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can make the tools do for me. This project challenges preconceived notions of hand-machine relationships by traditional craft theorists.
