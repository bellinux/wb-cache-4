40|$|The rate {{of calcium}} <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> {{isolated}} sarcoplasmic reticulum from rat skeletal muscle increases markedly {{during the first}} 4 wk of life and thereafter remains relatively constant. When animals are made hypothyroid during the first 3 wk of life, there is a marked inhibition {{of the increase in}} calcium <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Production of hypothyroidism after 4 wk of age, at which time the calcium <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> sarcoplasmic reticulum has reached maximum levels, results in a depression in the rate of calcium transport. There is no clear alteration in ATPase activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to account for the low calcium transport in hypothyroidism. It is proposed that the decrease in calcium <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> sarcoplasmic reticulum may account for observed alterations in the intrinsic contractile properties of muscle in the hypothyroid animal...|$|R
40|$|Expression of the {{recombinant}} human excitatory amino aid transporters, EAAT 1 and EAAT 2, in Xenopus laevis oocytes allows electrogenic transport {{to be studied}} under voltage clamp conditions. We have investigated the transport of the pharmacological substrate, L-serine-O-sulphate <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> EAAT 1 and EAAT 2. The EC 50 values for L-serine-O-sulphate <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> EAAT 2 showed a steep voltage-dependence, increasing from 152 ± 11 [*]μM at − 100 [*]mV to 1930 ± 160 [*]μM at 0 [*]mV. In contrast to EAAT 2, EC 50 values for L-serine-O-sulphate <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> EAAT 1 were relatively constant over the membrane potential range of − 100 [*]mV to 0 [*]mV. The EC 50 values for L-glutamate and D-aspartate <b>transport,</b> <b>by</b> EAAT 2, were also relatively constant over this membrane potential range. Chloride ions modulated the voltage-dependent changes in EC 50 values for <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> EAAT 2. This effect was most apparent for L-serine-O-sulphate transport, {{and to a lesser}} extent for L-glutamate and not at all for D-aspartate <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> EAAT 2. Extracellular sodium and proton concentrations also modulated the voltage-dependence of L-serine-O-sulphate EC 50 values for EAAT 2. We speculate that these different properties of L-serine-O-sulphate <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> EAAT 2 compared to other substrates may be due to the much stronger acidity of the sulphate group of L-serine-O-sulphate compared to carboxyl groups of L-glutamate or D-aspartate. These results highlight some of the differences in the way different glutamate transporter subtypes transport substrates. This may be used to understand further the transport process and develop subtype selective inhibitors of glutamate transport...|$|R

5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between the core and the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is <b>transported</b> <b>by</b> bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E

In this study, we {{used the}} phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) inhibitor wortmannin to examine whether (i) PI 3 -kinase activity is necessary for stimulation of glucose <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> insulin in muscle, and (ii) PI 3 -kinase mediates {{a step in the}} pathway by which contractions/hypoxia stimulate glucose transport. Wortmannin completely blocked insulin- and insulin-like growth factor- 1 -stimulated glucose transport in muscle.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} the sediment <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> infragravity waves and their relative importance to sea-swell wave induced sediment transport. Sometimes, suspended sediment <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> infragravity-waves can dominate the net sediment transport while, at other times, suspended sediment <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> infragravity waves is insignificant. Furthermore, {{there is no}} general consensus on the direction of sediment <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> infragravity waves at a particular location in the surf zone. This study aims to explain the direction of sediment <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> infragravity waves along a cross-shore transect. Four frames were deployed at a relatively steep-sloping (1 : 30) beach along a transect during a six week field campaign at the Sandmotor in The Netherlands. Each frame was equipped with Optical Backscatter Sensors (OBS) to measure suspended sediment concentration, a Pressure Transducer (PT) to estimate the sea-surface elevation from pressure below the waves and an ElectroMagnetic Flow meter (EMF) to measure the flow velocity in both cross-shore and alongshore direction. Fifteen-minute averaged suspended sediment transport calculations are {{used to determine the}} direction and relative importance of suspended sediment <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> infragravity, sea-swell and mean transport components. Co-spectra between suspended sediment concentrations and cross-shore velocity are used to examine the frequency dependence of the cross-shore suspended sediment transport rate. In this study, suspended sediment <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> infragravity waves has the same order of magnitude as sea-swell waves while the mean offshore directed transport is dominant. We observe that the r 0 parameter, which describes correlation between sea-swell waves crest/trough and the infragravity-wave crest/trough, is a useful tool to estimate the direction of <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> infragravity waves. In addition it pinpoints and where peaks in suspended sediment concentrations can be expected relative to the infragravity-wave along the transect. When r 0 has a negative (positive) value which is predominantly in the outer (inner) part of the surf zone, the largest sea-swell waves predominantly occur in the trough (crest) of the infragravity wave and suspended sediment <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> infragravity waves is directed offshore (onshore). When r 0 is negative, intense suspension events predominantly occur during negative infragravity-wave velocities (trough phase). When r 0 becomes increasingly positive towards the shoreline, intense sediment suspension events occur during positive infragravity-wave velocities...|$|R
