5|$|Around 17 hours later, {{the plane}} loses {{auxiliary}} power, {{and the lights}} go out inside. Despite Neerja and the other attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire. The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The trams were {{unidirectional}} and had {{a single}} door at the front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single door at the rear. The trams were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and the driver was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{moved the}} {{regiment}} from Retiro to Rosario, nearing {{the river at}} San Pedro and San Nicolás. He was following the Spanish ships and moved at night to avoid detection. San Martín had one hundred and twenty men for this action, reinforced at Rosario by a militia of seventy men {{under the command of}} Celedonio Escalada. Those reinforcements included twenty two rifleman, thirty cavalry, a small cannon and men armed with knives. Escalada had made other actions against the royalists before this battle. San Martín discovered that the royalists intended to pillage the San Carlos Convent and pressed the march to arrive there first. A hundred royalists landed on San Lorenzo, but the only food available to them was some chickens and watermelons. Aware of the risk of pillage, the population had removed the cattle from the area before the royalists arrived. Escalada arrived in San Lorenzo before the bulk of the patriot army, but the dust trail from the path to Rosario revealed their presence. Escalada attacked them but their ship had a longer range than his cannon, keeping him at bay. He was forced to retire when he found a Paraguayan prisoner who had escaped from the ship. The Paraguayan disclosed the size of the royalist army and their plan of attacking the convent with a larger force, suspecting that the local money was kept in it. They did not attack the convent right away, requiring time to prepare the two field cannons. Escalada returned with San Martin and relayed the news. The march from Retiro to the convent took only five days, thanks to the cadet Ángel Pacheco. Pacheco moved ahead of the regiment and prepared horses in advance at the relay positions. The whole army arrived on scene during the night of 2 February and hid inside the convent. They entered through <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> and were not allowed to light fires or speak during the night. San Martín studied the enemy and the battlefield from the convent's tower, using a monocular.|$|E
50|$|The {{body had}} no pillar between <b>the</b> front and <b>rear</b> <b>doors.</b> <b>The</b> front doors were hinged at the {{windscreen}} end and closed against <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors.</b> To give <b>the</b> impression {{of being a}} two-door coupé <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors</b> had no external handles. The absence of the central pillar affected {{the structure of the}} body and often caused problems. A sunshine roof was fitted.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors</b> are rear-hinged, a style {{commonly}} referred to as suicide doors, but called 'coach doors' by Rolls-Royce. Because of the rear-seating position in relation to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> inner-door handles, buttons are mounted on both C-pillars which operate hydraulic motors in order to close <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors.</b> An electronic lock prevents the doors from being accidentally opened when moving.|$|R

25|$|Rear-hinged doors make {{entering}} and exiting {{a vehicle}} easier, allowing a passenger to enter by turning {{to sit and}} exit by stepping forward and out. In combination with traditional front doors, they allow chauffeurs easier access to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door.</b> In Austin FX4 taxis, drivers were able to reach <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> handle through the driver's window without {{getting out of the}} vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The A1 was a fully enclosed, 4-door sedan, {{with normal}} front doors and forward-opening suicide-style rear doors. It was heavily {{based on the}} Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow; Toyoda bought an Airflow and {{disassembled}} it the year before producing the A1. The front window was {{a single piece of}} flat glass with a top-mounted wiper on the driver's side. There were 3 windows per side, one for the front door (without a quarter light window), one for <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> and one behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door.</b> A spare tyre was mounted on the nearly vertical boot lid.|$|E

50|$|Unusual in Europe at the time, but {{appreciated}} by customers, {{was the way}} that <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors</b> opened wide - to a full 90 degrees. Also unusual were the windows in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors</b> that opened fully into the door frame {{to the point where}} they disappeared, despite the intrusion into the door frame of a wheel arch which must have made the fit of the window when opened very marginal.|$|R
25|$|The FV106 Samson is an {{armoured}} recovery vehicle. The {{hull of the}} Spartan {{was adapted}} to contain a winch, which was operated {{to the rear of}} the vehicle. A hinged spade anchor was designed in two halves to preserve access to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
25|$|The early Edinburgh type buses {{required}} a driver and conductor to operate, but on lesser used routes, one-man-operation was also employed - for a 10 {{percent increase in}} wages <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> would be closed and the driver would collect fares on boarding via the front.|$|E
25|$|The T200 {{sedan and}} five-door {{hatchback}} featured a swage line {{running along the}} lower body to <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door,</b> which kinks downward prominently on the five-door.

50|$|To {{meet the}} {{challenge}} of those new cars head-on, for 1961 Studebaker created a new four-door sedan, the Cruiser, using the Econ-O-Miler taxicab body with an upgraded, more luxurious interior. The resulting car harked back to the long-wheelbase Studebaker Land Cruiser sedans of the late Forties and early Fifties. These cars can be distinguished from their lesser four-door counterparts by the 1959-60-style roofline and operational vent windows in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors,</b> while other sedans used one-piece glass in <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

25|$|All {{other local}} bus {{services}} are now operated by modern low-floor buses, {{which may be}} single-deck or double-deck. Most buses operating in London have two sets of doors, and passengers board the bus using {{the front door and}} alight using <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door,</b> whilst some buses on less busy routes have only one door. All these buses conform to the Disability discrimination act, and can accept passengers in wheelchairs and other mobility impaired passengers.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} after 2:00p.m. CST (20:00 UTC), Kennedy's remains were taken from Parkland Hospital to Love Field. His casket was then loaded onto Air Force One through <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door,</b> where it {{remained}} {{at the rear of}} the passenger compartment in place of a removed row of seats. Johnson had accompanied Kennedy to Dallas and was riding two cars behind the President in the motorcade. The new President refused to leave for Washington without the remains of Kennedy and his widow Jacqueline.|$|E
25|$|A further final {{development}} {{based on}} the Minivan was the Bond Family Safety Saloon. Additional side windows were fitted to the rear compartment of the van and two small hammock type seats were added either side of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> facing inwards. With the bench seat of the tourer replacing the single {{front seat of the}} van and pickup, this gave enough room for two children and two adults. The number of Safety Saloons produced is unknown, as factory records do not distinguish between the Saloon and the Minivan.|$|E
50|$|In Azores, taxis {{were black}} and green {{like in the}} {{continental}} Portugal. Nowadays, since the 1990s, taxis are beige with two diagonal blue lines on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|More {{significant}} changes {{came with the}} October 1964 Series IV. The roof was made flatter, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> window smaller and an extra side window fitted behind <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors.</b> Synchromesh was fitted to bottom gear. An anti-roll bar was fitted at <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other M-ATV {{features}} include a HVAC system and power outlets for charging portable electronic devices. The M-ATV is also unique among MRAP-type designs in that <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors</b> are of <b>the</b> so-called suicide-type.|$|R
25|$|The first combat actions {{showed that}} the fuel {{reservoirs}} were prone to explode when the vehicle was hit by an artillery round. To remedy this the reservoirs were replaced by fuel tanks with a double wall, using a felt filler layer to absorb gasoline leakages. Furthermore, these fuel tanks, each containing , were moved to a safer position under armour though still outside the hull, in vertical rectangular steel boxes {{to the left and}} right of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door.</b> This necessitated the construction of an additional safer exit, at {{the left side of the}} vehicle. On 8 September 1917 only twelve tanks had been changed to this new configuration. As of 21 March 1918 about 245 vehicles featured all three of these major improvements.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{numerous}} airframe modifications available: a cargo conversion for the 90 model, the CargoLiner, which replaces <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> {{with a large}} pallet accessible cargo door, a heavy duty floor structure and cabin cargo liner, also a crew hatch for cockpit access for the crew in the 90, 100, and 200; a Wing Front Spar Reinforcement Kit for both 90 and 100 Series aircraft,; a modification for the entire King Air line that entails reworking and extending the nose to house a baggage compartment {{as well as the}} avionics normally found in the noses of King Air aircraft. Modifications available for the King Air 100 include a belly cargo pod similar to those fitted to the Beech 99 and the Model 1300 version of the King Air 200 series.|$|E
25|$|It is {{constructed}} with interior partitions of brick with stone window sills and lintels at the cells. It is built with a standing seam gable roof. There is a wooden platform on brick piers at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>door</b> and the metal frame walls are mortared. The gable roof was replaced in 1978. The chimney tops were repaired in 1982. The exterior walls are of local brick with half-brick vent holes into the crawl space below {{the first floor}} level. The second and third floor has outer east and west windows. The cell windows have lintels and sills cut from local sandstone. The center hall and first floor windows have wood sills and lintels. The first floor and center windows of {{the second and third}} floor north sides have 6/6 double hanging windows. The center north side entrance is a four-raised panel door surrounded by a four-light transom. The gable ends are void of any window openings as is the south facade.|$|E
25|$|The Chrysler Panel Cruiser was {{a design}} study that {{appeared}} at the 2000 Detroit Auto Show. Based on the PT Cruiser, it featured panels in place of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>doors</b> and a wooden floor in place of <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> seats.|$|R
