50|$|The {{immersion}} method {{is used for}} the processing of manganese phosphate coatings. The steps of immersion include degreasing/cleaning, water rinses, pickling in mineral acid, activation, manganese phosphating, an optional final drying, and lubrication using oils or emulsion. The first step of this method is <b>to</b> <b>degrease</b> and clean, typically with strong alkaline cleaners. Pickling in mineral acid is a useful process described by the removal of oxide, resulting in a clean surface. The water pre-rinse activation allows the cleaning and pickling to take place while avoiding the formation of coarse-crystalline phosphate. Manganese phosphating is performed, typically in a bath of dilute phosphoric acid that is at approximately 95˚C for about 5-20 minutes (the time varies with the state of the surface being coated). The elements that were coated are then allowed to dry, possibly in an oven. The final step of manganese phosphate coating is to lubricate the materials with oil by immersing them in the oil bath and then letting them drain. This results in different thicknesses of oil when different concentrations and types of oil are used.|$|E
40|$|This report {{highlights}} the opportunities inherent in smart regulatory measures to effectively reduce risks related to hazardous substance emissions and exposure, and underscores {{the danger of}} simplistic and ineffective policy. The example of different regulatory approaches used in Germany and Sweden to regulate the use of trichloroethylene was taken {{as the basis for}} the study. During the 1990 s, due to environmental, health and safety considerations, the use of trichloroethylene in Europe was a subject of broad concern. As a consequence, the use of trichloroethylene became regulated through multiple approaches, such as labelling, handling regulations and performance standards. Since that time the absolute emissions of trichloroethylene in Europe have been decreasing consistently in all member states. These results were achieved by various regulatory measures governing the use of trichloroethylene in industrial applications that have been introduced by individual Member States. However, given the implementation responsibility at Member State level not all member States have implemented the same set of regulatory measures. In Germany, for example, the use of trichloroethylene is regulated through strict technical standards for equipment and emissions that has required companies to replace existing old machines with the state-of-the-art equipment. In Sweden a general ban on trichloroethylene use was introduced in 1996, which however eventually evolved into an exemption permit system for companies that found no alternative <b>to</b> <b>degreasing</b> with trichloroethylene.

40|$|Publications on roman {{textiles}} {{have described}} the processing of wool in the following operational sequence: shearing, scouring, combing and spinning. As one can exclude large scale spinning of ‘crude’ wool and degreasing makes fibers too dry and tangled to be worked with, {{it seems likely that}} even in the classical world it was common practice to oil wool before combing and spinning. This procedure has been regularly attested from the late Medieval period up to the present day but was first described in detail in a fifteenth century manuscript from Florence. There are however a few clues that might suggest that the oiling of wool was already known and indeed widespread in classical times and that olive oil was in common use for this purpose. Archaeological evidence for a connection between oil and wool would seem to be limited to a site in Cyprus where it is believed that scented oils were produced, amongst other things, to perfume wool. A reference to this technique could be inferred by Homer’s description of the looms in Alcinoo’s palace “dripping with oil”; and on several attic vases there are scenes of women engaged in processing or perhaps more specifically in the oiling of wool. The possibility that the Romans used oil for softening wool seems convincing above all for the number of classical references <b>to</b> the initial <b>degreasing</b> of untreated wool to remove lanolin, as well as <b>to</b> the <b>degreasing</b> of finished textiles with fuller’s earth, perhaps to remove oil added in the process. Further information may be gleaned from inscribed lead tags that refer to initial washing and degreasing (indicating lana purgata as opposed to lana sucida), perhaps followed by softening (lana mulsa). Confirmation of the antiquity of this missing link in wool to textile processing has clear implications for future archaeological research in the fields both of textiles and the production/distribution of olive oil for industrial use...|$|R

The minimum preparation which is usually carried out might include a simple <b>degrease</b> <b>to</b> remove processing aids, such as oils and waxes, and contaminants. However, it is recognised that the current state-of-the-art processes for structural or semi-structural metal bonding are highly complex, multi-stage treatments including conversion coating and anodic oxidation. Alternatives <b>to</b> the commonly-used <b>degreasing</b> processes are sought for many reasons, for example: established processes may not be adequate for difficult-to-remove materials; the processes may use VOCs; they can be carcinogenic or ozone depleting. Regarding the higher treatments, the anodising processes, in particular, are difficult, time consuming and costly to carry out. There are also legislative drivers which make utilisation of the more complex processes, especially those which utilise hexavalent chromium, highly undesirable. Other factors such as energy and chemical disposal costs also deserve consideration when considering the need for environmental or operator “friendly” processes. This paper will consider a number of alternative friendly surface treatments which might be considered as drop-in replacements for the current industrial standards. The friendlier surface treatments include two simple cleaning methods, namely: seaweed-based cleaners and CO 2 laser ablation.
