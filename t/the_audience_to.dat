5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>To</b> the actor, he wanted <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how {{unpredictable}} Lex can be.|$|E
5|$|The 3D {{conversion}} of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.|$|E

5000|$|Be objective. When I {{came in to}} ATWT, {{the first}} thing I said was, what is {{pleasing}} <b>the</b> <b>audience?</b> You have <b>to</b> put your own personal likes and dislikes aside and develop the characters that <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> wants <b>to</b> see.|$|R

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a futuristic {{character}} named Cuber (voiced by Emo Philips) announcing to the audience {{that they will be}} watching five short vignettes that are all unified by one theme. Cuber challenges <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> then guess the theme.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also note}} the {{entertaining}} {{methods used to}} drive the plot. When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} {{small portion}} of the audience, but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>To</b> save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E

50|$|Risk {{communication}} {{is a complex}} cross-disciplinary academic field related to core values of <b>the</b> targeted <b>audiences.</b> Problems for risk communicators involve how <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> intended <b>audience,</b> how <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> risk comprehensible and relatable to other risks, how to pay appropriate respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> values related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> risk, how <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> communication, etc. A main goal of risk {{communication is}} to improve collective and individual decision making. Risk communication is somewhat related to crisis communication.|$|R
50|$|Henze curated {{the first}} four festivals, from 1988 to 1994, and {{established}} the general format {{of most of the}} festivals that followed. Short runs of the premiered operas are preceded by talks and additional concerts from the featured composers, <b>to</b> introduce <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> their ideas and music.|$|R
5|$|In the {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston {{came close to}} having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent. After she left, Waterston become depressed, and his family began to suspect the affair. The emotional turmoil {{was too much for}} Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, as shown in the finished episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard for <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> understand why Maggie was so angry at Scully.|$|E
5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} {{behind the curtain}} {{at the end of}} the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem... A few moments for <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{style is}} {{characteristic}} of Hindustani classical music, but his choice of solo instrument and his background of learning from teachers outside his community are not common for the genre. He has stated that he aims to please the audience and create a feeling of harmony, and expects <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> reciprocate by reacting to his playing.|$|E

5|$|On March 11, 2012, on {{the episode}} hosted by Jonah Hill, Palin was {{impersonated}} by Andy Samberg in the Weekend Update segment. The dialogue leads <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> {{think that it}} was supposed to be another appearance by Fey and that Seth Meyers wasn't aware of the change, but Samberg convinces Meyers to finish his part.|$|E
5|$|On stage, {{the band}} adopted a focused {{approach}} directly intended {{to increase the}} audience's concert experience. Johnny's instructions to C.J. when preparing for his first live performances with the group were to play facing <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> <b>to</b> stand with the bass slung low between spread legs, and to walk forward {{to the front of}} stage {{at the same time as}} he did. Johnny was not a fan of guitarists who performed facing their drummer, amplifier, or other band members.|$|E
5|$|Owen Hart's victory {{intensified}} his {{feud with}} his brother Bret. Having defeated him at WrestleMania X and replicated Bret's victory in the 1993 King of the Ring tournament, Owen {{set his sights on}} Bret's WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The two met at SummerSlam 1994 in a Steel Cage match for the title. Jim Neidhart was in <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> support Owen. Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers, got involved with the feud by siding with Bret after Neidhart attacked Smith after the cage match.|$|E
30|$|The {{probable}} relations can {{be specific}} {{to a network}} and its audiences. As an explorative research {{it would be better}} <b>to</b> limit <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> <b>to</b> smaller geographical and cultural areas. Performing several studies on different societies and networks would enable future studies to draw out possible local and universal relations.|$|R

5|$|The Turk {{made its}} debut in 1770 at Schönbrunn Palace, about six months after Pelletier's act. Kempelen {{addressed}} the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet, allowing members of <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> inspect the machine. Following this display, Kempelen would announce that the machine {{was ready for a}} challenger.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open in order for <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> debate {{whether or not she}} survived the hotel explosion {{at the end of the}} episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E
5|$|Tsamere {{comes out}} of character, thanks the audience, writers and {{producers}} of the show, and explains that the preceding story is a fiction. He talks about his stage fright and goes off on a tangent about the bulbs around mirrors in dressing rooms; he asks a row of <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> stand repeatedly to check whether pillars in the theatre are load-bearing. He ends by saying {{that he does not}} need the mirror, as he does not wear make-up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because it {{is easier}} to bring 'The Heartless Father' to the sophistication of <b>the</b> Guichen <b>audience,</b> than <b>the</b> Guichen <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unsophistication of 'The Heartless Father.'" ...|$|R

5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>to</b> move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an immersive rave experience with the lights. They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E
