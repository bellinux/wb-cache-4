Finally, 3.2 % of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did not <b>receive</b> workplace accommodations have had their disability since birth compared to 5.2 % of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did <b>receive</b> accommodations. This is also reflected in the fewer number of years since onset for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did not <b>receive</b> accommodations compared to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> do. We also examine whether individual characteristics vary based on the type of workplace accommodation received (Appendix Table  7). There is some slight variation; for example, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have a flexible schedule {{are more likely to have}} a bachelor’s degree or higher than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>receive</b> help with transportation, have a personal care attendant or personal assistant, or receive help with child or family care.

Moreover, the imperfections in input markets also generally contributed to the poor performance of the bargadars.

The debate culminated when MP Chng Hee Kok (庄熙国) questioned Yeo's decision. Yeo responded by calling for Chng to resign his seat in Parliament because of his view. This led to even more unhappiness at the audacity of a civil servant talking down to an elected Member of Parliament. Then Deputy Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong had to intervene in what was seen as a face-saving rebuke for both– that Philip Yeo was wrong to tell Chng Hee Kok to resign, but Chng had also been wrong in arguing that it was acceptable for scholars to break their bonds because they were merely legal contracts.|$|E
