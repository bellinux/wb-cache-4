Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, <b>the</b> <b>Ohio</b> Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that <b>the</b> <b>Ohio</b> Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. <b>The</b> <b>Ohio</b> Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that after the}} collapse of the Hopewell, Indiana had a low population until the rise of the Fort Ancient and Mississippian culture around 900 AD. <b>The</b> <b>Ohio</b> River Valley was densely populated by the Mississippians from about 1100 to 1450 AD.

The Mississippian mounds were constructed on a grander scale than the mounds built by the Hopewell. The agrarian Mississippian culture was the first to grow maize in the region.
