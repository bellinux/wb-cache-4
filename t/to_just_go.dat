It’s so honest, {{and you have a}} baby that is screaming and crying when she is supposed to be smiling and happy in the scene, and we have <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>go,</b> go, go, [...] and it becomes real and natural.

The shots of Jack in a cage were done in Oahu's Paradise Park. The Other's tank and operating room are located in a film studio on the island. Bai Ling, who played Achara, recalled that when shooting the sex scene between her character and Jack, she was [...] "kind of nervous" [...] because she did not know Fox very well. Ling recalls that [...] "we (she and Fox) both had a mutual understanding <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> for it. Sometimes I'm on top of him, sometimes he's on top of me." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe.

[...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on set you have so many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> with it very quickly." ...|$|E

500|$|At age 30 (the {{minimum age}} {{required}} {{to hold the}} office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history, and one of only 18 senators who took office before reaching the age of 31. But the accident left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: [...] "I liked to [...] at night when I {{thought there was a}} better chance of finding a fight ... I had not known I was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me." [...] To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 1½ hours each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career. [...] In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work, and appeared <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> through the motions of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last. [...] A single father for five years, he left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called. [...] In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident.|$|E
500|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste {{magazine}} {{gave the}} episode a complimentary review. He started {{by claiming that}} Awake was [...] "the best drama to come out the 2011–12 season on television, {{and one of the}} finest NBC dramas in years". He also wondered [...] "what Awake would be like in a Michael Britten-like alternate reality where the show lasted five seasons, or 10, or even just one more year", Could Awake maintain this story for long and still be compelling?" [...] Bonaime wrote that it was [...] "better to have one great season and be remembered fondly". Bonaime claimed that the [...] "ending is quite smart, given that it never truly clarifies if Michael was dreaming the whole time, or if Dr. Lee was right and that he {{was on the verge of}} completely snapping, which makes much more sense". He was also grateful that [...] "Awake decided <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> completely nuts with the last half of this episode". He claimed that the episode and series was [...] "different, a rare move, especially on network television". He claimed that [...] "Once Awake arrives on Netflix and DVD, people will rush through in a matter of days and will say they enjoyed their experience with this short yet sweet treasure". He claimed that works with Awake should be [...] "rewarded" [...] and [...] "praised". Bonaime concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9.0 out of 10".|$|E

Both Jam and Lewis were asked by Usher's mother, and then manager, to contribute to 8701s production, during the 2000 MTV Music Awards. According to Jam, his mother had said [...] "Oh my God, Usher's got this track and we thought you guys would be perfect to produce it". Several months later, Jam and Lewis produced the song [...] "Separated", along with multi-platinum producers Ric Atari & Daron Jones (who also wrote the record) to which the producers then turned in to L.A.

Following this, Usher asked both producers to create a song similar to their 1985 [...] "Tender Love", performed by R vocal group Force MDs.

2500|$|Guitarist Michael Einziger {{noted that}} his {{contributions}} to the album were influenced by his musical studies during the band's hiatus: [...] "Maybe my desire to return to simplicity, or even <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> to simplicity - because I've never really written music that simple before — {{is sort of a}} response to maybe having a better or larger perspective of the overall musical landscape that I’ve never had before." [...] Einziger elaborated further, [...] "Over the years, we've become less and less aggressive as far as our music goes. There's always moments of that aggression, but this album is pretty free of that. It's definitely not a hard rock record. I think we're asking a lot of our fans. We're asking them to listen for things that they normally wouldn't listen for. We're not leaning on the strengths of our last records either. It's that much different than our previous work. I think we took a risk by making this type of album. But it's not some crazy, experimental album." [...] Vocalist Brandon Boyd cited Einziger as a key reason for the band's new direction, noting [...] "Michael really buckled down and studied musical composition that inspired him to reach out and dig into different places that he never has before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pickard {{explained}} Tony's {{reason for}} marrying Cindy saying: [...] "he’s {{looking forward to}} someone {{not so much to}} fall in love with, but for more practical reasons – so he lets himself be swept off his feet by Cindy". Shortly before the wedding Tony becomes intoxicated and has sex with a woman who Darren has paid. Tony admits this to Cindy who in turn admits she and Darren had been planning to scam Tony. Waring said Tony has [...] "been a good man telling the truth and Cindy takes that as her opportunity to tell him the truth. All the cards are on the table". Pickard said he was [...] "surprised that Tony would go through with it because of their volatile relationship and the fact that Tony knows Cindy's into Darren. I think he wanted <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> for it with her, and hopefully it'll work out for him". Pickard later stated that he didn't think Cindy was right for Tony stating: [...] "I don't think she's the one for him, to be honest". Tony meets Gabby Sharpe (Phina Oruche) which allows him to realise [...] "his marriage is over and he intends to tell Cindy that as soon as he gets home".|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>go</b> with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fletch {{became a}} cult film. In an {{interview}} for the New York Post, Bergman tried to explain its appeal: [...] "It's so bizarre, but Fletch strikes a chord. There's a group of movies {{like that in the}} '80s, like Caddyshack, too, that captured a certain wise-ass thing." [...] In particular, the film appeals to college students who have asked Chase to talk about it at film classes. The actor has said that the appeal of the character is [...] "the cheekiness of the guy[...] [...] everybody at that age would like to be as quick-witted as Fletch, and as uncaring about what others think." [...] Chase has said that this film is his favorite to date because [...] "it allowed me to be myself. Fletch was the first one with me really winging it. Even though there was a script, the director allowed me <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>go,</b> and in many ways, I was directing the comedy." [...] Perhaps the most meaningful praise comes from Mcdonald himself: [...] "I watched it recently, and I think Chevy and Michael Ritchie did a good job with it." [...] The film was voted as the 23rd best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: [...] "The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list." [...] The 2005 animated feature Hoodwinked depicted the Big Bad Wolf (from Little Red Riding Hood) as a sarcastic investigative reporter in a direct parody of Fletch, right up to the Lakers shirt, disguises, and a version of Fletch's theme playing during his scenes.|$|E
