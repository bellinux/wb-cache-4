25|$|Your phrase 'my copy is not mine' {{is not a}} bull. It is {{perfectly}} good English {{to use the same}} word in two different senses in one sentence, particularly when there is usage.

25|$|In early 1962, Mangeshkar {{was given}} slow poison. A doctor was called. He came with an x-ray machine to examine her, {{and gave her}} an {{injection}} to render her unconscious, because she was in pain. For three days, she had a close brush with death. After ten days, she began to recover. The doctor told her <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>had</b> given her slow poison. The slow poison incident rendered her very weak. She was bedridden for nearly 3 months. The most surprising thing was that soon after the incident, the cook {{who used to work}} at Lataji's home, suddenly vanished without taking his wages. The cook had earlier worked with some Bollywood people. Bollywood lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri used to regularly visit Lataji at her home daily at 6 pm. Majrooh used to first taste the food and then allow Lata to eat. He used to recite poems and stories to keep Lata in good humour.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{commenced}} on 20 August 1968 after {{a summer}} of pre-production. Director Ken Turner, who headed the location unit, recalled that The Secret Service became a complex series to shoot because it incorporated three design elements (studio puppet filming, studio special effects filming and live-action location filming). In a reversal to the practice used on earlier Supermarionation productions, location filming needed to be completed first before work could start at the Century 21 Studios. In Turner's words, [...] "We felt <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>had</b> to take the location stuff by the balls, get it shot and then hand {{it over to the}} director to fit his puppet stuff in. I suppose that seemed a bit back to front but with that programme it was what worked out best." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>had</b> put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E
