5|$|Most spiders that hunt actively, {{rather than}} relying on webs, have dense tufts of fine hairs between the paired claws at the tips of their legs. These tufts, known as scopulae, consist of {{bristles}} whose ends are split into as many as 1,000 branches, and enable spiders with scopulae <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> vertical glass and upside down on ceilings. It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces. Spiders, like most other arachnids, keep at least four legs on the surface while walking or running.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the office workers are forced <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> the stairs while the elevator is being serviced. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) kidnaps Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) to assist in an important sales call. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) talk with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) about marital troubles. Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) supports her husband during a press conference.|$|E

25|$|Congestion in schools, {{dilapidated}} and underresourced facilities, {{and a lack}} {{of trained}} teachers. Some pupils have <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> to 10 kilometres to school (and the same way back). In 2003 Kakuma Distance Learning Centre offered 29 students the possibility to take academic courses with the University of South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Northbound trips {{were to be}} {{modified}} to operate via the southbound route of North Point Road and Wise Avenue. No bus service was provided in the Merritt Boulevard area, and riders wishing to reach this area were directed <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> to a mile to Eastpoint Mall or Wise Avenue.|$|E
25|$|While, as {{with any}} sort of folklore, the details may vary, this {{particular}} tale (Bloody Mary) encouraged young women <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> {{a flight of stairs}} backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, {{they were supposed to be}} able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant that they were destined to die before they married.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{promising}} approach utilizes passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency. It {{has been shown that}} totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only gravity to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> a hill. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.|$|E
25|$|Under his leadership, the Rough Riders {{became famous}} for the charge up Kettle Hill on July 1, 1898, while {{supporting}} the regulars. Roosevelt had the only horse, and rode {{back and forth between}} rifle pits {{at the forefront of the}} advance up Kettle Hill, an advance that he urged despite the absence of any orders from superiors. He was forced <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> the last part of Kettle Hill, because his horse had been entangled in barbed wire. The victories came at a cost of 200 killed and 1,000 wounded.|$|E
25|$|At {{the sight}} of the Spaniards, the French {{displayed}} their banners, sounded their fifes and drums, and offered them battle, but Menéndez took no notice of the demonstration. Commanding his own men, whom he had again disposed to produce an impression of numbers, to sit down and take breakfast, he turned <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> and down the shore with two of his captains in full sight of the French. Then Ribault called a halt, sounded a trumpet-call, and displayed a white flag, to which Menéndez replied in the same fashion. The Spaniards having refused to cross at the invitation of Ribault, a French sailor swam over to them, and came back immediately in an Indian canoe, bringing the request that Ribault send over someone authorized to state what he wanted.|$|E

25|$|On December 20, 2010 Yon {{was found}} to be curled up and unmoving near a dried stream. He was brought into the center's {{rehabilitation}} room, where it was discovered that he had pulmonary edema, which had nearly killed him; however, he was able to eat by the next day and gradually got better. He was unable to walk for the remainder of December, though by the end of January he had regained this ability and, during February and March, he improved enough to be able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> and down stairs. However, his condition then took a turn for the worse, and he died on the night of April 9 at an estimated fifteen years and one month old. He weighed 3.5 kilograms and was 78.5 centimeters long. He is the oldest Iriomote cat on record.|$|E
25|$|In the Dunjonmaster program, {{the screen}} is divided into a {{birds-eye}} view representation of the surroundings and a status summary for the character. Traps, treasures and secret doors are hidden inside the dungeons. Temple of Apshai uses a hybrid between a turn-based and a real time combat system. A player's turn can be used <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> to 9 steps in the direction the character is facing, turning towards either direction, trying to talk the monster out of the fight, or executing {{a number of different}} attacks. A bow and arrows can be used to attack enemies from afar. If the player doesn't make any input for a while, the enemies continue to move and attack in set intervalls regardless. All actions decrease the player character's fatigue rating, depending on stats and carrying weight. When this value sinks below zero, the character cannot act anymore before resting. The player gains experience points while adventuring, which raise a number of hidden statistics.|$|E
25|$|Blue Panther Jr. was {{scheduled}} {{to compete in the}} third match of the night, an En Busca de un Ídolo match, but was replaced by Hechicero with the only explanation was that Blue Panther Jr. was not able to be at the show due to Force majeure. Delta won the match with less than a minute left on the clock, pinning Hechicero after a missed dive off the top rope. After the match on Delta stood before the judging panel for their feedback. Guest judge Diamante Azul gave Delta a 6 for his efforts, Hijo del Gladiador gave him a 6, Shocker 5 and finally El Titantes gave Delta a 6 for a total of 23 points. After winning his match Esfinge was the first competitor <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> the ramp to face the judges. For his effort Diamante Azul gave him 8 points, Hijo del Gladiador 8, Shocker 8 and El Tirantes 10 points for a total of 34. The judges were less positive for Canelo Casas' assessment with Casas receiving 7, 7, 7 and 8 points for a total of 29.|$|E

The writer [...] Can Themba's house, called the House of Truth, was on Good Street, as well as Fatty Phyllis Peterson's 39 Steps. To get to the 39 Steps, one had <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> a flight of steps, which looked by all accounts very dingy. One was then met by Fatty who sold about every type of drink: whisky, brandy, gin, beer, wine, etc. [...] Sometimes she even supplied cigars. [...] Good Street was also renowned for its Indian, Chinese and Jewish shops, and for being a street of criminals and gangsters.|$|E

500|$|At {{the request}} of Alexander, the arena was built [...] below street level, so fans would not have <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> stairs to reach their seats. To sink the arena, $12 million was spent to {{excavate}} 31,500 cubic yards of dirt over four months, which was the largest excavation in Houston history. Concrete was poured for the foundation throughout the summer of 2002, and structural work began in October. The roof was set on in December, as work continued inside, with a peak workforce of 650. In September 2003, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held to mark the official opening of the arena. The total cost of construction was $235 million, with the city paying $182 million, and the Rockets adding $43 million for additions and enhancements.|$|E
500|$|Breen stands transfixed and is {{eventually}} {{consumed by the}} energies from the craft as it slowly melts away and {{an image of a}} Martian [...] "devil" [...] floats in the sky above London. Fires and riots erupt, and after Quatermass succumbs to the mass psychosis he attempts to kill Roney, who does not have the alien gene and is therefore immune to the alien influence. Roney manages to shake Quatermass out of his trance, and remembering the legends of demons and their aversion to iron and water, he proposes that a sufficient mass of iron connected to wet earth may be sufficient to short-circuit the apparition. Quatermass acquires a length of iron chain and tries to reach the [...] "devil" [...] but succumbs to its psychic pressure. Roney manages <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> to the apparition and hurls the chain at it, resulting in him and the spacecraft being reduced to ashes.|$|E
500|$|Julia visited Mimi's house {{nearly every}} day, {{where they would}} chat over tea and cakes in the morning room or stand in the garden when it was warm.

Walley {{accompanied}} Julia to the bus stop further north along Menlove Avenue, with her telling jokes along the way. At about 9:30, Walley left her <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> Vale Road and she crossed Menlove Avenue to the central reservation between two traffic lanes, which was lined with hedges that covered disused tram tracks. Five seconds later, Walley heard [...] "a loud thud", and turned to see her body [...] "flying through the air"—which landed about [...] from where she had been hit. He ran back to get Mimi and they waited for the ambulance, with Mimi crying hysterically.|$|E
