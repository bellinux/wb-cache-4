5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for what he}} hoped would be the final attack on <b>The</b> <b>Gully,</b> Vokes shifted the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the 1st Brigade. Vokes planned for an attack by The Carleton and York Regiment {{to be the last}} of the frontal assaults against <b>The</b> <b>Gully.</b> Should this attack fail, the 1st Brigade's Seaforth Highlanders and the Royal Canadian Regiment would move through Casa Berardi and outflank German defences, forcing a withdrawal from <b>The</b> <b>Gully.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 12 December 1943, General Vokes {{sent the}} three battalions of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade against German defences in <b>The</b> <b>Gully.</b> The assault started poorly, when Canadian {{artillery}} plans were captured by {{soldiers of the}} 90th Panzergrenadier Division's 200th Regiment. When The West Nova Scotia Regiment attacked <b>The</b> <b>Gully,</b> they were subject to counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment approximately 10:30. By 14:00, the regiment had called off its attacks and had taken heavy casualties. To the west, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry fared little better, with C Company taking heavy casualties in their assault. Attempts were again made on 13 December, by two battalions of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade, and the attacks were driven back by tenacious German resistance. On the evening of 13 December, the heavily depleted 90th Panzergrenadier Division were relieved from their positions in <b>The</b> <b>Gully</b> by units of the 1st Parachute Division.|$|E

40|$|Received: 2013 / 10 / 10 - Accepted: 2013 / 12 / 13) This article {{presents}} {{the process of}} development of seven <b>gullies.</b> <b>The</b> area of study {{is located in the}} province of Pichincha. These gullies show extensive sedimentary deposits. The characteristic of the deposits, th stratification and analysis of the organic matter at different depths, demonstrate that the deposits were formed by the accumulation in <b>the</b> <b>gullies.</b> At a depth of 225 - 230 cm the deposits have higher organic matter content than the layers located more than a meter above. The influences of the deposits, the transformation of the forms of <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> and <b>the</b> characteristics of erosive-accumulative process have been investigated. Also the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> at multiple levels have been studied. <b>The</b> <b>gullies</b> that are {{at the top of the}} hillside belong to periods prior to the activation of the erosion, if compared to <b>gullies</b> in <b>the</b> lower parts of mountainside. Cyclical progress was considered in the self-development of <b>the</b> <b>gullies.</b> </p...|$|R
5000|$|Caused {{by surface}} runoff, the erosion occurs, notably, in gullies, which grow wider and deeper with each rainfall. Many of <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> have become ravines, {{which can be}} dozens or {{hundreds}} of feet deep. Homes and structures routinely collapse, as <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> expand with each rainy season. [...] Unchecked, the phenomenon will eventually transform the region into a badland.|$|R
40|$|The Submontane of Punjab in India is {{more prone}} to <b>gully</b> erosion. <b>The</b> present study was carried out to study <b>the</b> {{proliferation}} of <b>gully</b> erosion in <b>the</b> Submontane Punjab India district Hoshiarpur and falling in the agro-climatic zone locally known as kandi area. The main objectives were to study the characteristics and patterns of gullies in submontane Punjab India, three micro catchments designated as catchment I, II and III with different shape, size and topography were selected. They were surveyed for proliferation of gully erosion in respect to its extent and distribution. Spot studies in the region show severity of gully erosion in all the catchments with dominant U-shaped <b>gullies.</b> <b>The</b> distribution of different ordered <b>gullies</b> indicates that <b>the</b> first order <b>gullies</b> dominated in all the catchments as compared to other orders in each catchment. <b>The</b> number of <b>gullies</b> decreased with increased order. The mean length of <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> in general increased with increasing order of <b>the</b> <b>gullies.</b> Directly draining <b>gullies</b> were <b>the</b> initiative <b>gullies</b> and showed a great variation of severity of erosion. Based on gully length large gullies having size greater than 10 m long dominated in all the catchments but maximum in catchment III followed by catchment I and catchment II. Based on depth of medium (1 - 5 m deep) gullies were dominating in all the catchments except in catchment III. Very high correlation exists between mean length and order of <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> besides continuous increment in texture and density of <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> indicate that there is severity of gully erosion. So concept of gully initiation and its development {{should be kept in}} mind to find the appropriate solutions to check proliferation of gully erosion...|$|R

5|$|An {{ironstone}} {{mine was}} opened {{to work on}} a rock outcrop in 1853. The mine was to supply flux for the Port Adelaide copper smelting works, but it apparently closed within a year. It was reopened in 1861 and operated until 1862. The Tea Tree Gully Silver Mining Company began work in the area in 1888, constructing a tramway, blacksmith shop and a new road. With no economic finds, the company closed in July 1889. The quarry, in Water Gully adjacent to the nursery's ruins, has been mined for blue dolomite, some of which was used for the nursery's buildings. Quarries elsewhere in Water Gully were opened in the 1880s and intermittently supplied quartzite road metal for the District Council of Tea Tree Gully. A crushing plant was erected {{on the north side of}} <b>the</b> <b>gully</b> in 1912 to create this road material.|$|E
5|$|At 12:15, {{with the}} 47th Battalion having {{given way to}} the German onslaught and {{withdrawing}} past them up towards the high ground, the two forward companies of the 48th on the embankment began to withdraw, leaving the northern-most company in its posts around <b>the</b> <b>gully</b> near the Albert–Amiens road. Soon after, the northern company was forced to withdraw its posts on the southern side of <b>the</b> <b>gully.</b> When he heard of the withdrawal, Leane sent forward his second-in-command to establish the line that the battalion would now attempt to hold. By 13:30, the 48th was still holding its left flanking posts near the Albert–Amiens road, {{but the rest of}} the battalion had withdrawn to Pioneer Trench on the high ground. The left flank posts were not withdrawn until about 15:30. At this point, a counterattack was ordered, involving the 49th Battalion of the 13th Brigade, which had been in reserve, with all but the far left flank of the 12th Brigade conforming with its advance. Sinclair-Maclagan wanted to use four available tanks to support the attack, but this was refused by the brigade commanders. Deayton surmises that this rejection of the tanks was at the urging of Leane, who had taken such a negative view of them at Bullecourt. Sinclair-Maclagan then argued that the objective of both brigades must be to retake the railway line, but this was opposed by Gellibrand, supported up by Leane, whose opinion he still valued highly. They argued that the 12th Brigade should only aim to retake the former support line partway down the hill. Sinclair-Maclagan's view prevailed, possibly as he was acting in accordance with direction from higher headquarters. Despite this, Leane, as the commander of the forward troops of the 12th Brigade, once again displayed his strong independent streak, disobeying those orders and directing the troops' main effort towards recapturing the support trenches.|$|E
40|$|As {{an attempt}} to improve the {{performances}} of multi-entry gullies with applications to drainage system of a building, the hydrodynamic characteristics of air-water flows through <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> with and without swirl generation vanes (SGV) are experimentally and numerically examined.

The numerical simulations adopt Flow- 3 D commercial code to attack the unsteady two-phase bubbly flows for resolving the transient fields of fluid velocity, vorticity and pressure in <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> with and without SGV. In <b>the</b> twin-entry <b>gully</b> without SGV, air bubbles entrained by the entry vortex interact chaotically in the agitating bubbly flow region. With SGV to trip near-wall flows that stratify the drifting trajectories of the air bubbles, the air-bubble interactions are stabilized with the discharge rate increasing more than 7 %. The reduction of the self-depuration period by increasing discharge rate is observed for <b>the</b> test <b>gullies</b> without and with SGV. Based on the experimental and numerical results, the characteristic hydrodynamic properties of the air-water flows through <b>the</b> test <b>gullies</b> with and without SGV are disclosed to assist the design applications of a modern drainage system in a building...|$|R

40|$|Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera reveal {{landslides}} and <b>gully</b> formation on <b>the</b> {{interior wall}} of a 7 km-diameter simple crater emplaced in Schrödinger basin on the farside of the Moon. These features occur on the steep upper crater wall, where the slope is ~ 35. <b>The</b> <b>gullies</b> show a typical alcove-channel-fan morphology. Some gullies incise bedrock, where impact-related faults are present. Slope failure along the concentric faults also led to formation of landslides. Dark slope streaks are abundant at <b>the</b> bright <b>gully</b> regions, especially near the fan and channel deposits. Spectral characteristics inferred from data obtained by Hyperspectral Imager and Moon Mineralogy Mapper on board Chandrayaan- 1 show that <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> and landslides are characterized by high optical immaturity and devoid of prominent spectral absorption features related to water or hydroxyl molecules, suggesting youthful dry-granular flows. Mass movements on the crater wall {{led to the formation}} of arcuate ridges and ponding of fine-grained sediments on the crater floor. Runout flows from small impact craters on the slopes indicate that impact-induced seismic shaking was responsible for the downslope mass movements. Crater size-frequency distributions suggest a minimum age of 18 – 2 Ma for <b>the</b> <b>gullies</b> and 2 Ma for the landslides, while age of the host crater ejecta was inferred to be about 175 Ma. <b>The</b> <b>gullies</b> and landslides also occur on the interior wall of other impact craters elsewhere on the Moon and probably formed by similar processes...|$|R

A fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller did not offer a shot, expecting the ball to curve away and miss the stumps. Instead, he was hit {{in front of the}} wickets and given out lbw for four. O'Reilly said Miller's display was more akin to that of a tail-end batsman with minimal skill, and blamed his poor form with the bat on an excessive workload imposed on him by Bradman. With two quick wickets, England had put the match back in the balance. Batting out of position in the middle-order, Brown came in at 173/4 and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings. Both scored slowly, averaging more than three and a half minutes for each run. They realised Australia could not afford to lose any more wickets quickly and batted with extreme caution, reluctant even to attack long hops. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley, who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate, broke through his defences with a yorker. The English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia at 225/6. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace.|$|E

Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley bowled him and then trapped Brown lbw in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225/6.

5|$|By the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller was {{shouldering}} most of {{the bowling}} load. He sent down 52 overs in a rain-affected match, taking match figures of 6/127. He struggled with the bat, making a duck and four. The teams headed to Lord's where Miller had to carry the pace attack without the injured Davidson and Lindwall. Crawford and Ken Mackay were called in to make their debut and support Miller with the pace duties. Australia batted first and Miller managed 28. Australia managed only 285 and Crawford injured himself, exacerbating the burden on Miller. Miller had Peter Richardson and then bowled Tom Graveney with an outswinger. England were 2/32 and their captain Peter May received an inswinger from Miller first ball, which he inside edged onto his stumps, but the bail was not dislodged. The next day, Miller beat May four times and then had Watson caught in <b>the</b> <b>gully</b> in his third over. He then removed Bailey and Trueman. Miller's 5/72 was largely responsible for England falling for 171. Australia was in difficulty at 3/69 when Miller came to bat, hitting a counterattacking 30. Australia set England 371 to win. Miller removed Graveney {{at the start of}} the run chase. Resuming the next morning, he bowled Watson, and had May and Evans both caught behind. He bowled Johnny Wardle and took his only ten-wicket match haul in Tests. Australia won by 185runs and Miller had bowled 70.1overs for the match. His knee had taken a heavy toll and Miller was given an extended break had to play purely as a batsman in the Third Test at Headingley. Australia were caught on a wet wicket in response to England's 325, and Miller top-scored with 41 and Australia were forced to follow on. He had attempted to keep Laker and Lock at bay with his pads.
