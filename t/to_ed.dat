40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES:To {{determine}} {{the rate of}} inappropriate admissions <b>to</b> emergency departments (<b>EDs)</b> and <b>to</b> identify determinants of these admissions. DESIGN:Prospective multicenter study. SETTING:Burgundy (France), EDs and medical nursing homes (MNHs). PARTICIPANTS: 1000 Burgundy MNH residents admitted <b>to</b> <b>EDs,</b> from April 17 to June 20, 2013. MEASUREMENTS:For each subject, a questionnaire was completed. Data included age, gender, type of health professional who referred the resident <b>to</b> the <b>ED</b> (THP), {{whether or not a}} medical dispatcher organized the transfer <b>to</b> the <b>ED,</b> transport mode, reason for admission <b>to</b> the <b>ED,</b> level of independence according to the Groupes Iso-Ressource score (GIRS), and diagnosis made in the ED. The French version of the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol grid was applied to each admission <b>to</b> the <b>ED,</b> and in some situations, the expert committee ruled on the appropriateness of the admission <b>to</b> the <b>ED.</b> MNH characteristics were also recorded. Two groups were constituted according to the appropriateness or not of admission <b>to</b> the <b>ED.</b> RESULTS:Mean age of the 1000 residents was 87. There were 706 women. Two-thirds were referred <b>to</b> the <b>EDs</b> by a physician, mainly a general practitioner. In 91. 7 %, the transfer <b>to</b> the <b>ED</b> was organized by a medical dispatcher, and 8. 8 % were transported by medicalized transport. More than 95 % had a GIRS ≤ 4. Among the admissions <b>to</b> <b>EDs,</b> 18. 1 % were inappropriate. Female gender (P =. 017), nonmedicalized transport (P =. 002), public MNH (P =. 044), and nonaccess to a geriatric opinion in an emergency (P =. 043) were determinants of inappropriate admission <b>to</b> <b>EDs.</b> CONCLUSION:In this first study on admissions <b>to</b> <b>EDs</b> of MNH residents using French data, we found a lower rate of admissions <b>to</b> the <b>ED</b> than that reported in the literature. Female gender, nonmedicalized transport, public MNH, and nonaccess to a geriatric opinion in an emergency were associated with inappropriate admission <b>to</b> <b>EDs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Endocrine {{disruptors}} (EDs) are compounds which {{interfere with}} the hormone system and may adversely affect the health and reproduction of man and animals.

In this review, an overview of most frequently asked questions is presented. These questions are: What are the sources of endocrine disruptors we find in the environment?

40|$|Emergency Departments (<b>EDs)</b> are {{supposed}} <b>to</b> provide healthcare {{to patients with}} acute clinical conditions.

This paper is intended to investigate this phenomenon, defining an objective criterion of inappropriateness and estimating the impact it has on ED hospitals in terms of quality and cost. For this purpose a descriptive statistical and econometric analysis is implemented.

5|$|Even before Haywood {{first became}} an {{official}} with the Western Federation of Miners, {{he was convinced that}} the system under which working people toiled was unjust. He described the execution of the Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing him toward membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Kelly's Army. He had suffered a serious hand injury in the mines, and found that his only support came from other miners.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the association of}} ED length of stay (EDLOS) and outcome of patients admitted to a ward, intensive care (ICU) or stepdown (high dependency) unit (SDU). METHODS: DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using linked administrative and clinical data. SETTING: 650 -bed, university-affiliated, tertiary referral hospital, whose ED has approximately 60 [*] 000 patient presentations per annum. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients admitted via the <b>ED,</b> <b>to</b> a ward (<b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ward), ICU (<b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ICU) or SDU (<b>ED</b> <b>to</b> SDU), and whose EDLOS was < 24 [*]h. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital outcome and LOS. RESULTS: A total of 43 [*] 484 patients over 4 years. Median EDLOS was 2 : 36 [*]h for ICU, 5 : 07 [*]h for SDU and 7 : 19 [*]h for ward (P < 0. 01) patients. EDLOS differed significantly, based on hospital outcome, for ward (alive, 7 : 18 [*]h vs died, 7 : 44 [*]h, P < 0. 001), but not SDU or ICU patients. At an EDLOS of 4 and 8 [*]h, 19. 4 % and 5. 2 % of ICU, 52. 1 % and 15. 5 % of SDU and 77. 9 % and 32. 6 % of ward patients remained in the ED. EDLOS {{was not a significant}} predictor of death, in comparison with increasing age and admitting unit across all three groups, and higher triage acuity for <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ward and <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ICU. CONCLUSIONS: EDLOS was greater for <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ward patients, and of the <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> ward patients who died. At an EDLOS of 4 [*]h there were fewer ICU, in comparison with ward, patients remaining in the ED. Future studies that report on EDLOS should differentiate for patients admitted from the <b>ED</b> <b>to</b> the ward, ICU or SDU.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Children in Australia are {{infrequent}} {{recipients of}} general practitioner (GP) home visits. OBJECTIVE: The {{objective of this}} article is to examine whether parents who brought their child to an emergency department (ED) for a lower urgency condition had contacted a home-visiting GP prior to arriving at the ED. METHODS: Electronic surveys were completed by 1150 parents of children aged ≤ 9 years presenting with lower urgency conditions (triage category 4 or 5) <b>to</b> the <b>EDs</b> of four hospitals in metropolitan Melbourne. RESULTS: Only 83 (7 %) parents had attempted to contact a home-visiting GP service and only 26 received a visit. Half of those who did receive a visit, and more than half who did not, reported being told <b>to</b> attend the <b>ED</b> by the service. DISCUSSION: There is infrequent use of home-visiting GP services by children who present <b>to</b> <b>EDs</b> with lower urgency conditions.

5|$|Ron Perranoski {{entered as}} the new pitcher for the seventh, Camilli took his place {{as the new}} catcher, and Ron Fairly {{replaced}} Wally Moon at first base. Burright became the new second baseman, replacing Gilliam who moved to third base while the previous third baseman, Tommy Davis, moved to center field. Perranoski allowed singles to Orsino and Pagán after a ground out by Felipe Alou. The Giants pinch hit Harvey Kuenn for Matty Alou and Bob Nieman for Hiller, but both recorded outs to end {{the top of the}} seventh. Ernie Bowman replaced Nieman at second base for the Giants {{in the bottom of the}} inning and no runs scored in the frame. The Giants continued to hit Perranoski in the top of the eighth, with singles by Davenport and Mays to open the inning. Jack Smith entered in relief but allowed a single <b>to</b> <b>Ed</b> Bailey pinch hitting for Larsen which scored Davenport to cut the Dodgers' lead to 7–6. Mays attempted to advance to third on the play but was called out. The play drew arguments from Mays, Alvin Dark, and third base coach Whitey Lockman as third base umpire Jocko Conlan appeared to call Mays safe before changing it to out. Carl Boles pinch ran for Bailey, and Cepeda reached on an error on his fly ball which allowed Boles to move to third. Stan Williams relieved Smith and walked Felipe Alou to load the bases. Orsino hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at seven runs apiece and Pagán grounded out to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|Tadalafil was {{initially}} formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) {{under a new}} drug development partnership between Glaxo and Icos that began in August1991. The drug was originally researched {{as a treatment for}} cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina, but focus quickly shifted <b>to</b> <b>ED</b> with the success of another PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra), which had been developed by Pfizer. Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company's 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo's core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform more studies, improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues. Cialis was approved in Europe in November2002 and in the United States a year later. The drug was approved for once-daily use for ED in Europe in June2007 and in the United States in January2008.|$|E
