5|$|The current {{president}} is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, {{who took over}} from Paul Nurse on 30 November 2015. Historically, the duties of <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>have</b> been both formal and social. The Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 left the president {{as one of the}} few individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an animal was justified. In addition, the president is to act as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.|$|E

25|$|During the Sri Lankan Civil War, {{multiple}} Human Rights Organizations {{have reported}} cases of rape, violence and disappearance {{of women in the}} 1990s, claiming to be committed by security forces. Amnesty International, for instance, believes that these actions might have been just a fraction of a widespread violence, claiming that many women have avoided giving testimony about the forces' treatment. Government officials, including <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> <b>have</b> denied the claims and agreed to co-operate with the investigations and prosecute whomever they find guilty. The UN Special Rapporteur, on the other hand, have reported that individual investigations and proceedings relating to these cases have started at the local magistrates courts.|$|E

Given that conclusion, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> instructed <b>the</b> Department not to defend the statute in such cases.|$|R
500|$|Kennedy was a stalwart backer of President Clinton {{during the}} 1998 Lewinsky scandal, often trying to cheer up the {{president}} {{when he was}} gloomiest and getting him to add past Kennedy staffer Greg Craig to his defense team, which helped improve the president's fortunes. In the trial after the 1999 impeachment of Bill Clinton, Kennedy voted to acquit Clinton on both charges, saying [...] "Republicans in the House of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> <b>have</b> wielded the impeachment power in precisely the way the framers rejected, recklessly and without regard for the Constitution or {{the will of the}} American people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{constitutional}} [...] "national intervention" [...] and [...] "state of siege" [...] {{powers of}} <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>have</b> been invoked frequently. The {{first of these}} powers was designed to [...] "guarantee the republican form of government in the provinces." [...] Since {{the adoption of the}} 1853 constitution, the federal government has intervened over 200 times, mostly by presidential decree. Under this authority, provincial and municipal offices may be declared vacant, appointments annulled, and local elections supervised. Between 1966 and 1973, all local legislatures were dissolved and provincial governors were appointed by the new president. A restoration of provincial and municipal government followed the return to constitutional government in 1973. After the March 1976 coup, the federal government again intervened to remove all provincial governors and impose direct military rule over all municipalities. Since 1983, representative local government has been in force again.|$|E

6000|$|... "By no means," [...] replied Mr. Malthus mildly. [...] "My case is peculiar. I am not, {{properly}} speaking, {{a suicide}} at all; but, as it were, an honorary member. I rarely visit the club twice in two months.

60|$|A President, {{with the}} {{possibility}} of re-election before him, would be as a minister who goes out knowing that he may possibly come in again before the session is over, and, perhaps, believing that the chances of his doing so are in his favor. Under the existing political phase of things in the United States, no President has any such prospect; but the ministers of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>have</b> that chance. It is no uncommon thing at present for a minister under one President to reappear as a minister under another; but a statesman has no assurance that he will do so because he has shown ministerial capacity. We know intimately the names of all our possible ministers--too intimately as some of us think--and would be taken much by surprise if a gentleman without an official reputation were placed {{at the head of a}} high office. If something of this feeling prevailed as to the President's cabinet, if there were some assurance that competent statesmen would be appointed as Secretaries of State, a certain amount of national responsibility would by degrees attach itself to them, and the President's shoulders would, to that amount, be lightened. As it is, the President pretends to bear a burden which, if really borne, would indicate the possession of Herculean shoulders. But, in fact, the burden at present is borne by no one. The government of the United States is not in truth responsible either to the people or to Congress.|$|E
60|$|But how am I {{to excuse}} the Constitution on those points {{as to which}} it has, as I have said, fallen through, in respect to which it has shown itself to be inefficient by the {{weakness}} of its own words? Seeing that all the executive power is intrusted to the President, it is especially necessary that {{the choice of the}} President should be guarded by constitutional enactments; that the President should be chosen in such a manner as may seem best to the concentrated wisdom of the country. The President is placed in his seat for four years. For that term he is irremovable. He acts without any majority in either of the legislative houses. He must state reasons for his conduct, but he is not responsible for those reasons. His own judgment is his sole guide. No desire of the people can turn him out; nor need he fear any clamor from the press. If an officer so high in power be needed, at any rate the choice of such an officer should be made with the greatest care. The Constitution has decreed how such care should be exercised, but the Constitution {{has not been able to}} maintain its own decree. The constituted electors of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>have</b> become a mere name; and that officer is chosen by popular election, in opposition to the intention of those who framed the Constitution. The effect of this may be seen in the characters of the men so chosen. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, the two Adamses, and Jackson were the owners of names that have become known in history. They were men who have left their marks behind them. Those in Europe who have read of anything, have read of them. Americans, whether as Republicans they admire Washington and the Adamses, or as Democrats hold by Jefferson, Madison, and Jackson, do not at any rate blush for their old Presidents. But who has heard of Polk, of Pierce, of Buchanan? What American is proud of them? In the old days the name of a future President might be surmised. He would probably be a man honored in the nation; but who now can make a guess as to the next President? In one respect a guess may be made with some safety. The next President will be a man whose name has as yet offended no one by its prominence. But one requisite is essential for a President; he must be a man whom none as yet have delighted to honor.|$|E
