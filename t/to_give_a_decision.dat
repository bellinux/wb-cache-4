500|$|Czarnikow v Roth, Schmidt & Co, the {{decision}} {{in which it was}} decided agreements excluding judicial supervision are invalid, is partially overruled by Sections 3 and 4. Section 3 provides that, where such an agreement is drafted, the High Court no longer has the automatic right to request additional reasons from the arbitrator or grant leave to appeal {{the decision}}. Such exclusion clauses must be specific, but can be general in nature; Section 3(2) states that it can be framed [...] "to relate to a particular award, to awards under a particular reference or to any other description of awards, whether arising out of the same reference or not". Section 3(6) provides an exception, which covers [...] "domestic" [...] arbitration agreements; these are defined as agreements where leave to appeal would not be valid in a jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom, and no parties are businesses or individuals legally based in the UK. In this situation, the exclusion clause is only valid if agreed to after the start of arbitration. A second exception is found in Section 4(1); where the contract arbitration is based on is within admiralty jurisdiction, to do with commodities trading, or an insurance agreement, it will not be valid unless either it was entered into after the start of arbitration or the law applicable to the contract is not that of England and Wales. In any situation, the High Court can be asked <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> on a point of law, or the exclusion clause removed, should all parties agree.|$|E

It was probably about that time that Hananiah fell in with some sectaries at Capernaum. To remove him from their influence his uncle advised him to leave the country, which he did, emigrating to Babylonia, where he opened a school that eventually acquired great fame (Sanh. 32b; Eccl. R. i. 8, vii. 26). He returned to his native country with ritualistic decisions which had been communicated to him by a Babylonian scholar, and which he submitted to his uncle (Suk. 20b). But during the evil days following the Bar Kokba rebellion, seeing the noblest of his people fall before the vengeance of the Romans, he again emigrated to Babylonia, settling at Nehar-Peḳod (see A. Neubauer, G. T. pp. 363 et seq.).|$|E
50|$|The {{court held}} that the ad hoc committee's {{investigation}} and subsequent recommendations had led to a decision seriously affecting individual rights and interests. The committee could never have been sure that it was properly acquainted with all of the considerations relevant to its recommendations unless it had properly heard the views of everyone involved. The first applicant had not been given a hearing at all in the National Assembly, whereas the purported hearing before the ad hoc committee had violated the common-law rules of natural justice. De Lille had been entitled to be heard fairly by an unbiased committee and had been entitled to make representations regarding the proposed sanction against her. The common-law rules of natural justice applied unless the relevant statute had expressly or by necessary implication excluded them. These rules required that, when a statute empowered a public official or body <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> prejudicially affecting an individual's rights or interests or legitimate expectations, such an individual must be heard before the decision is taken or any serious recommendations prejudicially affecting such rights, interests or legitimate expectations are made by the body concerned.|$|E

This prompts Zoey to present voice recordings of Ted from [...] "Natural History", saying how he was in support of the Arcadian’s preservation, particularly mentioning its ornate stonework of a lion head. With the LPC poised <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> the next morning, Ted is saddened to realize they will surely vote to preserve the Arcadian, thus causing him and Barney to lose their jobs. However, Lily comes {{up with a plan to}} possibly keep Ted’s relationship alive while having the Arcadian demolished. They go to Arthur to explain their plan, but Future Ted says that he can’t mention the specifics for legal reasons. The next day, the LPC explain they originally planned to destroy the Arcadian but Ted's description of the Lion Head Stonework meant they would instead preserve the Arcadian. However, they reveal the lion head had vanished the night before (the group got two construction workers to remove it), thus prompting them to ultimately decide not to preserve the Arcadian. Ted had hoped that Zoey would remain with him if it seemed the decision to demolish the Arcadian had not come from him; however, Zoey ends up leaving him anyway.|$|E

5000|$|When R. Yochanan went to Tiberias {{and founded}} an academy there, Shim‘on {{accompanied}} {{him and took}} the second position in the school (comp. B. M. 117a). He exceeded even Yochanan in acuteness, and the latter himself admitted that his right hand was missing when Shim‘on was not present (Yer. Sanh. ii. 19d, 20a). [...] "When he discussed halakhic questions {{it was as if}} he were uprooting mountains and rubbing them together," [...] says 'Ula of him (Sanh. 24a). Yochanan was often compelled by Shim‘on's logic to surrender his own opinion and accept that of Shim‘on (Yer. Yoma 38a), and even to act in accordance with the latter's views (Yer. 'Eruvim 18c). Yet it is said in praise of Shim‘on that all his objections to Yochanan's conclusions were founded on the Mishnah, and that with him it was not a question of showing himself to be in the right, but of securing a clear and well-established decision, and that when he could find no support for his opinion he was not ashamed to abandon it (Yer. Gittim iii. 44d). He had a strong love of truth and an unusually courageous way of saying what he thought. He even declared to the Patriarch Judah II that fear of the latter would never induce him to keep back God's word or any opinion derived from it (Yer. Sanh. 20a); and once he ventured to convey a veiled rebuke to the patriarch for avarice (Genesis Rabbah lxxviii. 16). Neither did he hesitate to revoke decisions of his colleagues, including Yochanan, even when action had already been taken in accordance with those decisions (Yer. Ket. 32d, 37a; B. B. 16b; Ket. 54b, 84b). On one occasion, when Yochanan presented a halakic demonstration before Yannai, and the latter praised him for it, Shim‘on boldly declared, [...] "In spite of R. Yannai's great praise, R. Yochanan's opinion is not correct" [...] (Yer. Sotah ii. 18b). He would defend his views fearlessly before the whole faculty (Kid. 44a), and sometimes he ventured <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> that conflicted with the Mishnah (Yer. Ter. vii. 44c; Yer. Hag. iii. 79c). Nevertheless, his opinions, when they differed from those of Yochanan, were not recognized as valid, except in three cases mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (Yeb. 36a).|$|E

The consent to charge jurisdiction to private persons must have been laid down explicitly in the contract. Both ways of jurisdiction have advantages and disadvantages.

40|$|Polishing is {{a highly}} skilled {{manufacturing}} process {{with a lot of}} constraints and interaction with environment. In general, the purpose of polishing is to get the uniform surface roughness distributed evenly throughout part’s surface. In order to reduce the polishing time and cope with the shortage of skilled workers, robotic polishing technology has been investigated. This paper studies about vision system to measure surface defects that have been characterized to some level of surface roughness. The surface defects data have learned using artificial neural networks <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> in order to move the actuator of arm robot. Force and rotation time have chosen as output parameters of artificial neural networks. Results shows that although there is a considerable change in both parameter values acquired from vision data compared to real data, it is still possible to obtain surface defects characterization using vision sensor to a certain limit of accuracy. The overall results of this research would encourage further developments in this area to achieve robust computer vision based surface measurement systems for industrial robotic, especially in polishing process.
