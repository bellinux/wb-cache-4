5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> {{the speed}} of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which {{the speed of}} light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.|$|E
5|$|The final report, of {{the same}} name, was {{released}} in 1997. It recommended that Australia should adopt a single system following detailed trials of potential systems, {{that it should be}} implemented with high definition capabilities from <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>that</b> each licensed commercial or public service should have access to a full 7MHz channel for its services, and that the eventual termination of analog PAL services should be driven by market factors and subject to regular review. The year 2000 was highlighted as a potential target date for the commencement of permanent digital terrestrial broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{makes clear}} at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> {{he was not}} running for a third term, and then thanking his fellow {{citizens}} {{for the opportunity to}} serve as their president. He then writes about the preservation of the Union, the core of American nationhood, and which, along with the Constitution binds all Americans together and provides for the popular well being. Concerned about the obstacles and potential hazards that lay ahead for the nation, Washington urges the nation's people to cherish and safeguard their hard-won system of republican government despite their many differences.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{response}} to the demand for the surrender of weapons, the deadline was extended several times until a date of 8 July was fixed. On 17 May, court-martials were established to try those that were arrested in possession of weapons, and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad. The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans. It was clear from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> the NDH weapons laws were not being enforced as strictly against Croats as they were against Serbs. Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that had been promised to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team decided {{early on}} in the {{development}} process {{to reduce the number of}} characters present in the game, as well as to make Sonic the only playable character; this decision was taken to get more quality out of fewer characters. While it felt that these ideas combined with traditional Sonic gameplay was a good beginning, it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born, in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story. Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term Sonic fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.|$|E
5|$|The system {{originated}} {{from one of}} several powerful tropical waves that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa {{in the second half of}} August. When the wave came off the African coast, it already had cyclonic rotation, although it was fairly disorganized. As the wave moved westward into open waters, it developed rapidly. Late on August 21, it formed a low-level circulation and was declared Tropical Depression Nine. The system quickly matured and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Humberto early on August 22. Beginning on a west-northwest track, it was clear from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> Humberto would not affect land, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge to the north which would eventually turn the storm northward. Favorable outflow and distinct banding pattern quickly formed in a very conducive environment, with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. Humberto intensified into a high-end tropical storm on the afternoon and evening of August 22. Early on August 23, the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Humberto.|$|E
5000|$|The Press Law {{was passed}} under the French Third Republic in 1881 by the then-dominant Opportunist Republicans {{who sought to}} liberalise the press and promote free public discussion.

5|$|The {{first was}} that the Paris Accord that ended the American {{commitment}} was seriously flawed at <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> in <b>that</b> it permitted the North Vietnamese to maintain their forces within territorial South Vietnam after {{the signing of the}} agreement, thereby dooming the cease-fire.|$|R
5000|$|Marbury School was {{a private}} non-denominational co-educational R-12 {{progressive}} school located in the Adelaide Hills at Aldgate, South Australia.

25|$|The {{animated}} {{science fiction}} show Futurama presents a satirical look at politics and current affairs {{in a number}} of its episodes.

25|$|While {{the mass}} {{conversion}} to independent {{cities such as}} occurred in the Hampton Roads region did not repeat elsewhere in the state, city-county annexations have generally created more conflicts and been a barrier to future regional cooperation than those of towns and counties. This may be because the individuals of the latter groups realize from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> they {{will be required to}} continue to work together afterward (since all towns are within counties).|$|E
25|$|Poor Sir Ed, {{who is a}} quiz of {{the first}} magnitude, and who I believe had not given a dinner for twenty years before, was all bustle and anxiety during {{the whole of the}} entertainment.

25|$|Hermeneutic {{theorists and}} {{therapists}} write that ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address this}} limitation of individualism because it upholds from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> human beings are relational and it attempts to explain human suffering and healing in these relational contexts. What ontological hermeneutics theory is saying {{is that it is}} not through isolated reflection upon personal cognitive and affective processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates human suffering and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the {{narratives}} are not oriented on {{one group of}} protagonists with a strong lead character, but instead are carried by an ensemble cast—though most books or short stories do have several strong characters who carry the action and plot forward. Flint had intended from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> the whole town would be the collective protagonist; a reflection of his philosophy that historic forces are not centered in the main on the actions {{of one or two}} key individuals, but on the many small independent actions of the many going about their daily lives and coping as best they can.|$|E

Establishing a trading port from scratch was in itself a daunting prospect, but Farquhar's administration was, in addition, practically unfunded, as Raffles did not wish his superiors to view Singapore as a liability. In addition, it was forbidden from earning revenue by imposing port duties, Raffles having decided from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> Singapore would be a free port.|$|E

50|$|The problem {{connected}} with the possible limitations upon space geometry caused by the singularity was left aside for further study. It is clear from <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original BKL model is applicable to both finite or infinite space; this {{is evidenced by the}} existence of oscillatory singularity models for both closed and open spacetimes.|$|R
25|$|Frank's wife Claire runs an NGO, the Clean Water Initiative, {{which she}} uses to {{cultivate}} her own power, yet its ultimate purpose remains unknown. Despite {{the success of}} the operation, Claire seeks to expand its scope to the international stage, often using Frank's connections. It is clear from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> Claire shares both her husband's cold-hearted, ruthless pragmatism and lust for power, and they frequently scheme together to ensure the success of each other's ventures. They both work with Remy Danton, a corporate lobbyist and former Underwood staffer, to secure funds for their operations and expand their influence.|$|E
25|$|Hostilities {{commenced}} on 24 July. Tryon was of {{the view}} at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> there was little he could do directly against the superior force, so he set about attempting to wear down his enemy, using feints and false alarms to reduce their attentiveness. They had to continuously maintain station outside his ports, while {{he and his men}} enjoyed the Irish countryside. They suffered the difficulties of communicating while at sea whereas Tryon could simply use the telegraph. Albert Markham commanded the blockader's squadron of cruisers, whose job was to stay close to Berehaven, watch for ship movements and attack anyone who emerged, while the ironclads stayed further away.|$|E
25|$|The Commission {{in charge}} of {{mounting}} the Great Exhibition was established in January 1850, and it was decided at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> the entire project would be funded by public subscription. An executive Building Committee was quickly formed to oversee the design and construction of the exhibition building, comprising Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Robert Stephenson, renowned architects Charles Barry and Thomas Leverton Donaldson, the Duke of Buccleuch and the Earl of Ellesmere, and chaired by William Cubitt. By 15 March 1850 {{they were ready to}} invite submissions, which had to conform to several key specifications: the building had to be temporary, simple, as cheap as possible, and economical to build within the short time remaining before the Exhibition opening, which had already been scheduled for 1 May 1851.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{planetary}} collision was inspired by websites with theories about such events. Von Trier decided from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> it would be clear {{from the beginning that}} the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing. The concept of the two sisters as main characters developed via an exchange of letters between von Trier and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz. Cruz wrote that she would like to work with von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play The Maids by Jean Genet. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in Melancholia. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself. The name was inspired by the 1791 novel Justine by Marquis de Sade.|$|E
25|$|McCann had {{maintained}} from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>that</b> {{he would only}} be at Celtic {{for five years and}} in September 1999 he officially announced that his 50.3% stake in Celtic was for sale. McCann had always wanted the ownership of Celtic to be spread as widely as possible and gave first preference to existing shareholders and season-ticket holders. This was to stop a new consortium taking over the club. 14.4million shares were sold by McCann at a value of 280 pence each. McCann made £40million out of this, meaning he left Celtic with a £31million profit. During his tenure, turnover at Celtic rose by 385% to £33.8m and operating profits rose from £282,000 to £6.7m. McCann was often criticised during his time at Celtic and many people disagreed with him over building a stadium which they thought Celtic couldn't fill, not investing enough in the squad and being overly focused on finance. However, McCann was responsible for the financial recovery of the club and for providing a very good platform for it to build on. After he left Celtic, the club were able to invest in players and achieved much success such as winning The Treble in 2000–01 and reaching the 2003 UEFA Cup Final.|$|E
500|$|Priestley {{engaged in}} {{numerous}} {{political and religious}} pamphlet wars. According to Schofield, [...] "he entered each controversy with a cheerful conviction that he was right, while most of his opponents were convinced, from <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>that</b> he was willfully and maliciously wrong. He was able, then, to contrast his sweet reasonableness to their personal rancor", but as Schofield points out Priestley rarely altered his opinion {{as a result of}} these debates. While at Leeds he wrote controversial pamphlets on the Lord's Supper and on Calvinist doctrine; thousands of copies were published, making them some of Priestley's most widely read works.|$|E
