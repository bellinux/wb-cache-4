Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles,</b> while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. Sephiria Arks faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to take those that give Creed immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to walk away, and the survivors of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles</b> of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.|$|E

5|$|Cairano first {{documented}} work is from December 24, 1489 {{with his}} commission for {{the cycle of}} twelve statues of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles</b> to be installed in the first dome {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli, Brescia.

5|$|Cairano's {{concentration}} on the Caesars is interrupted only briefly by {{the return of}} Tamagnino between 1499 and 1500. Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who {{has come a long}} way from his naive expression of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles,</b> Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Apostles</b> of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to go after him on his own terms. Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on <b>the</b> <b>Apostles,</b> however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, <b>the</b> <b>Apostles</b> of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E
5|$|What {{little is}} known about her life and {{background}} comes mostly from the early historian Flavius Josephus, who detailed a history of the Jewish people and wrote an account of the Jewish Rebellion of 67.

5|$|Apart {{from his}} operas, Wagner {{composed}} relatively {{few pieces of}} music. These include a symphony in C major (written {{at the age of}} 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle. The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles),</b> a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.|$|E

5|$|Bach had {{composed}} his Christmas Oratorio, {{based on}} the gospels of Luke and Matthew, in 1734, a work in six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide. He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725. The Ascension Oratorio appeared thus in the same liturgical year as the Christmas Oratorio. The text for the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others. It follows {{the story of the}} Ascension as told in Luke, Mark and the Acts of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Baptism in the Holy Spirit occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and <b>the</b> <b>apostles</b> Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem. The new believers had been baptized in water, but the Holy Spirit {{had not yet}} fallen on them. The Samaritans received the Holy Spirit when Peter and John laid their hands on them. The Apostle Paul was also filled with the Holy Spirit when Ananias of Damascus laid hands on him, and afterwards Paul was baptized with water.|$|E

He served until Hinckley's death on January 27, 2008. As the second most senior of <b>the</b> <b>apostles</b> behind Hinckley, Monson simultaneously served as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles; Boyd K.

5|$|For the Gospels, Sinaiticus is {{generally}} considered among scholars as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of <b>the</b> <b>Apostles,</b> its text is {{equal to that of}} Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is the most reliable witness of the text. In the Book of Revelation, however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, Papyrus 47, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).|$|E
5|$|In 1912 {{he built}} two pulpits {{for the church}} of Santa Maria in Blanes: the pulpit on the Gospel side had a {{hexagonal}} base, decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the pulpit of the Epistle side had the names of <b>the</b> <b>apostles</b> who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the flames of Pentecost.

5|$|The church's upper story {{features}} {{fragments of}} frescoes, {{mostly on the}} interior, though there are traces of mural painting {{on one of the}} blind arches as well.

Among the portraits of saints that can be recognised are John the Baptist, <b>the</b> <b>apostles</b> Peter and Paul, Constantine and Helena and the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Military saints were depicted on the south wall, while the north wall mostly features monks. All of the preserved frescoes were done in the 14th century and are an example of Palaiologan art. All captions to the frescoes are in Medieval Greek.|$|E
5|$|The {{colocation}} of the Angels and Apostles {{as well as}} the affinity {{between them}} suggest that both Tamagnino and Cairano obtained early ownership of the internal works at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, though at the end, it devolved to Cairano. Technically, however, the Angels of Tamagnino are far superior to <b>the</b> <b>Apostles.</b> In addition to the Angels, Tamagnino also delivered four busts for the pendentive of the first dome of the church, titled Dottori della Chiesa, and two smaller roundels for the frieze of the nave. But for these constructions, three of which were monumental, and the Angels, the sculptor received a smaller compensation than Cairano did for his Apostles.|$|E
