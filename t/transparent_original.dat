30|$|In Fig. 9, {{the added}} cloth on Adam is not IR {{transparent}} {{but it has}} little texture discernible on the IR and the original drawings appear clearly by transparency under it. This looks like a shadow in the IR {{as well as in}} the solution obtained with the method of the previous “IR <b>transparent</b> <b>original</b> pigments” section. Thus we mix seamless cloning with mixed boundary conditions and the shadow removal method. We replace the canonical drift-field of the colour image by the one of the IR in the region of interest. Then we put the drift-field to zero on the edge of the over-paint appearing in the IR. This method is illustrated in Fig. 9. The white lines of the mask are the areas where the drift-field is put to zero. In this figure we observe some transparent texture from the over-paint (over Adam’s hip and at the bottom of Eve’s veil). As expected, this texture appears in the final result.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Robustness is a {{critical}} requirement for a water-marking scheme to be practical. Especially, in order to resist geometric distortions a common way is to locally insert multiple-redundant watermarks {{in the hope that}} partial watermarks could still be detected. However, there exist watermark-estimation attack (WEA), such as the collusion attack, that can remove watermarks while making the attacked data further <b>transparent</b> to its <b>original.</b> Another kind of attack is the copy attack, which can cause protocol ambiguity within a watermarking system. The aim {{of this paper is to}} propose an efficient cover data recovery attack, which is more powerful than the conventional collusion attack. To this end, we begin by gaining insight into the WEA, leading to formal definitions of optimal watermark estimation and near-perfect cover data recovery. Subject to these definitions, an exquisite collusion attack is derived. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed watermark estimation and recovery algorithm. I...|$|R
40|$|The Yasuni National Park is a {{protected}} area {{located in the}} Amazon region of Ecuador and is {{recognized as one of}} the most biodiverse regions in the world. In recent years the park has received much attention due to the media exposure of the Yasuni-ITT Initiative. This Initiative proposed a moratorium on oil activities in the Ishpingo-Timbococha-Tiputini (ITT) blocks within the Yasuni National Park, in exchange for US$ 3. 6 billion in compensation over ten years, to be paid by the international community. In this paper we first conduct a feasibility analysis of the ITT Initiative and show that it was severely flawed from its inception. Second, we develop a financial approach for a 'New ITT Initiative'. We propose the sale or leasing of the rights of extraction of the oil deposits in the Park as a feasible strategy to keep the oil underground and consequently to protect the Yasuni National Park's ecosystem services. Our proposal is much more simplified and <b>transparent</b> than the <b>original</b> ITT Initiative and could be easily implemented through existing financial mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Background. Addition {{silicones}} {{are popular}} as dental impression materials {{and are used}} in bite registration procedures. Objective. This study aimed to compare the postsetting elasticities and other mechanical properties of thirteen addition silicone interocclusal recording materials. Materials and Methods. The following materials were investigated: Colorbite D, Futar D, Genie Bite, Jet Blue Bite fast, Memoreg 2, O-Bite, Occlufast Rock, Omni-Bite Plus, Regidur i, Registrado X-tra, Regofix transparent, StoneBite, and Variotime Bite. Thirty specimens of each material were tested. The elasticities and strengths of the materials were measured with a universal testing machine, and computer software {{was used to determine}} the E-moduli, ultimate tensile strengths, and ultimate elongations of the specimens. Results. The results were subjected to statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test (p≤ 0. 05). The statistics revealed that the mean E-modulus values varied significantly across the materials (p= 0. 000) and were highest for the StoneBite and Registrado X-tra and lowest for the Regofix transparent. The ultimate tensile strengths were highest for the Regofix transparent and Registrado X-tra (p= 0. 000) and lowest for the Jet Blue Bite fast and Memoreg 2 (p= 0. 000). The elongation percentages at the point of breaking varied significantly across the materials (p= 0. 000); the lowest value was observed for the StoneBite, whereas the Regofix <b>transparent</b> nearly doubled <b>original</b> length. Conclusions. The authors concluded that materials with the high E-moduli and great ultimate tensile strengths may be most useful clinically. Registrado X-tra and StoneBite best met these criteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy system}} is today facing a major double issue: the {{shrinking}} of easily accessible and cheap fossil {{resources on the}} upstream side, and climate change on the downstream side. Energy policies must integrate this double physical constraint, {{as well as other}} physical limits, and have a long time and a global horizon, in order to anticipate and avoid a future energy and climate crisis that could be dramatic to society. However, politics tend to focus on other aspects (satisfying immediate social desires for instance). This report hence discusses options available to allow for a better consideration of physical constraints in energy policies design. As they strongly rely on energy scenarios, it appears that energy policy makers need a more transparent and didactic frame for scenario design and analysis. That is why The Shift Project has been developing an <b>original,</b> <b>transparent</b> and pedagogical energy scenario modeling tool, Rogeaulito, which is intended to highlight physical constraints. By developing narratives (quantified stories) and organizing and animating workshops with policy makers, using Rogeaulito, it is possible to convey messages and knowledge about the energy system and issues, and improve the policy making process. Nevertheless, policy makers remain subject to socio-political influences and to self-interest concerns, which can prevent them from making socially optimal choices on the long term. Therefore, the civil society as a whole must be included in a continuous and coherent debate to improve the common understanding of energy issues, of the (physical, cultural and psychological) obstacles to solving them and of concrete consequences of the possible choices. It will then be possible to give a democratic, legitimate and collaborative orientation to long term energy policies. At the end, it appears that a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach, involving physics, environmental science, economics, technology, sociology, political science and psychology is required to finally produce energy policies appropriate in order to face the issues mentioned above...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{approach}} to detect and reconstruct transparent objects. This approach makes use of the fact that many transparent objects, especially the ones consisting of usual glass, absorb light in certain wavelengths [1]. Given a controlled illumination, this absorbtion is measurable in the intensity response by comparison to the background. We show the usage of a standard infrared emitter and the intensity sensor of a time of flight (ToF) camera to reconstruct the structure, which can not be measured by the usual 3 D measurements of the ToF camera, given we have a second view point. We take advantage of this fact by deriving this internal sensory contradiction from two ToF images and reconstruct an approximated surface of the <b>original</b> <b>transparent</b> object. Therefor we are using a perspectively invariant matching in the intensity channels from the first to the second view of initially acquired candidates. For each matched pixel in the first view a 3 D movement can be predicted given their original 3 D measurement and the known distance to the second camera position. If their line of sight did not pass a transparent object or suffered any other major defect, this prediction will highly correspond to the actual measured 3 D points of the second view. Otherwise, if a detectable error occurs, we approximate a more exact point to point matching technique and reconstruct the original shape by triangulating the points in the stereo setup. We tested our approach using a mobile platform with one Swissranger SR 4 k. As this platform is mobile, we were able to create a stereo setup by moving it. Our results show a detection of transparent objects on tables while simultaneously identifying opaque objects that also existed in the test setup. The viability of our results is demonstrated by a successful automated manipulation of the respective transparent object. I...|$|R
40|$|In Chapter 7 in Bierens (2004) the Wold {{decomposition}} {{was motivated}} by claiming that every zero-mean covariance stationary process Xt can be written as Xt = P∞ j= 1 βjXt−j + Ut, where E[Ut. Xt−j] = 0 for all j ≥ 1, and P∞ j= 1 βjXt−j is the projection of Xt on its past. However, in general this claim is incorrect. In this note I will give a more general (and hopefully correct) proof of the Wold decomposition. 1 Projections on spaces spanned by a sequence The fundamental projection theorem states that: Theorem 1. Given a sub-Hilbert space S of a Hilbert space H and an element y ∈ H, there exists a unique element by ∈ S such that ||y − by| | = infz∈S ||y − z||. Moreover the residual u = y − by is orthogonal to any z ∈ S: hu, zi = 0. Proof: See for example Bierens (2004, Th. 7. A. 3, p. 202). This result {{is the basis for}} the famous Wold (1938) decomposition for covariance stationary time series, which in its turn is the basis for time series analysis. Thanks to Peter Boswijk (University of Amsterdam) for pointing out an error in a previous version of this note. Moreover, the queries of the students in my graduate time series courses have led to substantial improvements of the proof of the Wold decomposition. 1 The proof of the Wold decomposition in Anderson (1994) is more <b>transparent</b> than the <b>original</b> proof by Wold (1938). However, rather than following Anderson’s proof, I will in this note derive first a general Wold decomposition for a regular sequence 1 in a general Hilbert space, and then specialize this result to the Wold decomposition for covariance stationary time series. First, we need to define sub-Hilbert spaces spanned by a sequence in a Hilbert space, as follows. Let {xk} ∞ k= 1 be a sequence of elements of a Hilbert space H, and let Mm = span({xj} m j= 1) be the space spanned by x 1, [...] ., xm, i. e., Mm consists of all linear combinations of x 1, [...] ., xm. Then Lemma 1. Mm is a Hilbert space. Proof: Without loss of generality we may assume that the m × m matrix Σm with elements hxi,xji,i,j= 1, [...] ., m, is non-singular, as otherwise we can remove one or more xj’s from the list {xj} m j= 1 and still span the same space. For example, suppose that rank(Σm) =m − 1, and let c =(c 1, [...] ., cm) 0 be the eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue. Then ° Pm j= 1 cjx...|$|R
