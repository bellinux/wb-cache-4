5000|$|The {{viewing lens}} {{is linked to}} the taking lens. Light rays {{entering}} the viewing lens are refracted by a prism and form a bright, life-size image on a piece of ground glass; the eyepiece is adjustable for sharp image. Unlike an ordinary <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> camera, the Goerz Minicord image is not only right side up, but also unreversed, due to the use of a prism instead of mirror. [...] Minicord is the only <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> camera in 16 mm subminiature photography.|$|E

50|$|Changeable lenses {{on medium}} format SLR and {{rangefinder}} cameras {{such as the}} Hasselblad line or Koni-Omega Press were the norm. The Mamiya <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> cameras are among the very few medium-format TLR cameras with interchangeable lenses.|$|E

50|$|Mamiya made {{a series}} of square format <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> (TLR) {{throughout}} the middle of the twentieth century. These were developed into the C cameras (C2, C3 through to C330s) which have interchangeable lenses as well as bellows focus.|$|E
50|$|The Rolleiflex SL66 is {{a single}} lens reflex camera made by Rollei, in regular {{production}} from 1966-82. The SL66 represented a change in direction for Rollei, which until that time had focused almost exclusively on its popular <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> cameras, the Rolleiflex and Rolleicord.|$|E

50|$|In 2015, MiNT {{released}} a <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> instant camera called InstantFlex TL70. It uses Fuji instax mini film {{with a size}} of 54 x 86 mm. A year later, TL70 2.0 was released with the 5 times brighter Fresnel Super Viewfinder upgrade, 32% larger magnifier, and improved shutter and aperture mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|A {{compromise}} {{for expensive}} rangefinder or SLR or <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> cameras was {{to offer a}} selenium meter as optional device that could be coupled to the camera's shutter speed controls. The scale of these instruments show not an exposure value but an aperture value to be set [...] "uncoupled" [...] Examples of Leica and Tessina are shown in the photographs ...|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Nikon GN lens was {{a notable}} example, {{while in the}} 1970s and 1980s pancake lenses were used in compact single <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> (SLR) cameras.|$|R
50|$|More recently, digital single <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> (DSLR) cameras {{have been}} used in the field of {{architectural}} photography. These cameras also employ detachable, tilt-shift lenses of varying (usually fixed) focal lengths.|$|R
50|$|A {{couple of}} the models were formed with a single <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> {{component}} combined with an interchangeable lens. And to give them flexibility, one or two versions also had lens mount adapters.|$|R
50|$|The Rolleicord was {{a popular}} medium-format <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> camera made by Franke & Heidecke (Rollei) between 1933 and 1976. It was a simpler, less {{expensive}} version of the high-end Rolleiflex TLR, aimed at amateur photographers who wanted a high-quality camera but could not afford the expensive Rolleiflex. Several models of Rolleicord were made; the later models generally had more advanced features and tend to be valued higher in today's market.|$|E
5000|$|The use of folding cameras {{declined}} in the late 1930s with advances in lens technology allowing superior enlargement, high quality images on smaller negatives, and shorter distances between the lens and the film. 35mm film made small-sized cameras practical without using bellows. Lens technology allowed 120/620 cameras to use shorter focal distances, and the <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> cameras became popular. However, some 35mm cameras continued to be built as folding cameras, e.g., the original Kodak Retina. Medium format folders were produced in USSR until the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|A single-lens {{reflex camera}} (SLR) is a camera that {{typically}} uses {{a mirror and}} prism system (hence [...] "reflex" [...] from the mirror's reflection) that permits the photographer to view through the lens and see exactly what will be captured. With <b>twin</b> <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> and rangefinder cameras, the viewed image could be {{significantly different from the}} final image. When the shutter button is pressed on a mechanical SLR, the mirror flips out of the light path, allowing light to pass through to the light receptor and the image to be captured.|$|E
50|$|Charles Summer, his father, was {{an amateur}} {{photographer}} {{who owned a}} then uncommon Exacta single <b>lens</b> <b>reflex</b> camera. The world-famous photographer Milton Rogovin was a family friend and early on exposed him to fine-art photographs.|$|R
