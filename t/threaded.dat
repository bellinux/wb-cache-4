They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and <b>threaded</b> onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-pass}} filter {{can be implemented}} quite directly from a ladder topology lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed direct current (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are {{sometimes referred to as}} chokes. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for coaxial implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being <b>threaded</b> on to the central conductor.|$|E
5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a <b>threaded</b> barrel end to accept a big five-port muzzle brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the muzzle brake. Other sources mention the muzzle brake was intended to soften a recoil and they say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BC– AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 AD– AD 121) invented the pulp papermaking process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making paper, ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of bamboo rolled into <b>threaded</b> scrolls, strips of silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a wooden frame sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper. Paper is used a lot.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert <b>threaded</b> shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E

40|$|DE 102005050126 B 3 UPAB: 20070517 NOVELTY - In a {{monitored}} <b>thread</b> {{guiding device}} in a knitting machine, {{in which a}} <b>thread</b> is guided under tension along a free <b>thread</b> transport zone, having <b>thread</b> supply unit(s), a receiving unit and an optical sensor unit for contact-free detection of <b>thread</b> in the transport zone, sideways oscillation of the <b>thread</b> from its path is caused along the transport zone. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A monitored <b>thread</b> guiding device in a knitting machine, in which at least one <b>thread</b> is guided under predetermined tension along a free <b>thread</b> transport zone, has unit(s) for supplying the <b>thread</b> along the zone and a unit for receiving and/or further guiding the tensioned <b>thread.</b> An optical sensor unit, for contact-free detection of <b>thread</b> in the transport zone, generates a control or regulation signal for the <b>thread</b> supply and/or receiving unit(s). The novel feature is that a device for causing sideways oscillation of the <b>thread</b> from its path is provided along the transport zone. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a corresponding monitored <b>thread</b> guiding process, in which controlled transverse oscillations are induced in the <b>thread</b> in the transport zone, optical detection of a consequent dynamic sensor signal is used to indicate an undamaged <b>thread</b> and lack of detection of such a signal is used to detect a broken <b>thread,</b> in which case operation of the knitting machine is halted. USE - For monitored guiding of <b>thread</b> in a knitting machine, especially a circular knitting machine. ADVANTAGE - Guiding of the <b>threads</b> is effectively monitored (especially as regards <b>thread</b> tension) while avoiding additional wear on the knitting machine side components (including the <b>thread</b> itself), so {{that the need for}} expensive and time-consuming maintenance operations is eliminated. Constant <b>thread</b> quality is ensured, especially so that <b>threads</b> of low (specifically non-optically resolvable) roughness are obtained. Yarn guiding within several <b>thread</b> guides can be individually monitored, so that a higher quality knitted product is obtained. The <b>thread</b> tension can be regulated in individual <b>thread</b> guides...|$|R
