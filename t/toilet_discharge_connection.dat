40|$|Greywater {{consists}} of household wastewater excluding <b>toilet</b> <b>discharges.</b> Three systems were compared for the biological treatment of greywater {{at a similar}} hydraulic retention time of approximately 12 – 13 hours. These systems were aerobic treatment in a sequencing batch reactor, anaerobic treatment in an up-flow anaerobic blanket reactor and combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment (up-flow anaerobic blanket reactor + sequencing batch reactor). Aerobic conditions resulted in a COD removal of 90 %, which {{was significantly higher than}} 51 % removal by anaerobic treatment. The low removal in the anaerobic reactor may have been caused by high concentration of anionic surfactants in the influent (43. 5 mg/L) and a poor removal of the colloidal fraction of the COD in up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. Combined aerobic-anaerobic treatment accomplished a COD removal of 89 %, similar to the aerobic treatment alone. Greywater methanization was 32 % for the anaerobic system and 25 % for the anaerobic-aerobic system, yielding a small amount of energy. Therefore, anaerobic pre-treatment is not feasible and an aerobic system is preferred for the treatment of greywate...|$|R

This work aims to design, develop and test a sand filter to retain solid waste material from the rain water, allowing the improvement of their quality. The experimental work was developed in the laboratory of Environmental Engineering at the “Centro Universitário Franciscano”, using sand as a filter for a water reservoir of 250 liters, with filter materials such as gravel, sand, and geotextil and a electrical water-pump to test the system of reverse flow. By the results obtained the maximum flow filtration rate estimated is 11, 800 L h- 1. The filter controls 100 % of particles larger than 0. 15 mm. Filtered water in 75 % of particles not removed by the filter has diameter less than 0. 075 mm.

40|$|Indian Railways (IR) {{is a large}} {{transport}} organization running 8700 trains, reaching 7000 {{stations and}} handling about 1. 6 crore passengers per day. IR runs several long distant trains, some of which involve journeys upto three nights. The number of non suburban passengers traveling on IR is about 0. 6 crore per day. There are three sources of fecal matter generation in IR (i) Toilets in trains, (ii) Railway stations; and (iii) Use of railway tracks for open defecation. The existing toilet system in the coaches discharges excreta directly {{to the ground and}} the railway tracks. The consequences include unacceptable hygienic conditions, particularly in the railway stations, and damage to rails. IR is making efforts to introduce environment friendly <b>toilet</b> <b>discharge</b> system, for which three options are being considered; modular, vacuum and chemical. Toilets at stations are a part of amenities being provided, linked to the category of the station. There is an attempt to modernize toilets at important stations. A related socio economic problem is that of people residing near the railway stations, without access to toilet facilities, using tracks for open defecation. The issue of dealing with fecal matter should be viewed in the larger context of waste management. With effective waste management, fecal matter can be recycled and used as liquid fertilizers and quality organic manures. This paper attempts to understand the issues related to fecal matter management on the IR, and provide a framework for solutions. ...|$|R

2500|$|Legally in the UK, train {{operators}} {{are allowed to}} discharge up to 25 litres of untreated waste at a time on to the track. Most Mk3 carriages have no <b>toilet</b> tanks, <b>discharging</b> directly onto the track. In the 2000s both the RMT trade union and politicians were concerned at {{the environmental impact of}} this legacy issue. The problem was first raised in 2003 after Railtrack staff at [...] abandoned local clean-up and then track maintenance procedures due to an excessive buildup of sewage waste in the area. In 2006 the RMT agreed waste-tank and clean-out developments at Northern Rail's Heaton depot in 2006 with GNER, plus new clean-out procedures at all other depots, to solve an ongoing dispute over the previous 18 months. By 2011, the European Union had started a formal investigation to see whether trains composed of such carriages were breaking EU environmental and health laws, although the Environment Agency confirmed that train companies claimed special exemptions to dump waste along the tracks. In 2013, transport minister Susan Kramer branded the practice [...] "utterly disgusting" [...] and called on the industry to take action. ATOC responded by stating that, as all new vehicles had to be fitted with compliant toilet tanks, with withdrawal of the HSTs by the end of 2017 the problem would be solved.

40|$|An annular {{centrifugal}} contactor pilot plant incorporating 30 stages of commercial 5 cm CINC V- 02 units {{has been built}} and operated at INL during the past year. The pilot plant includes an automated process control and data acquisitioning system. The {{primary purpose of the}} pilot plant is to evaluate the performance {{of a large number of}} inter-connected {{centrifugal contactor}}s and obtain temperature profile measurements within a 30 -stage cascade. Additional solvent extraction flowsheet testing using stable surrogates is also being considered. Preliminary hydraulic testing was conducted with all 30 contactors interconnected for continuous counter-current flow. Hydraulic performance and system operational tests were conducted successfully but with higher single-stage rotor speeds found necessary to maintain steady interstage flow at flowrates of 1 L/min and higher. Initial temperature profile measurements were also completed in this configuration studying the performance during single aqueous and two-phase counter-current flow at ambient and elevated inlet solution temperatures. Temperature profile testing of two discreet sections of the cascade required additional feed and <b>discharge</b> <b>connections.</b> Lamp oil, a commercially available alkane mixture of C 14 to C 18 chains, and tap water adjusted to pH 2 were the solution feeds for all the testing described in this report. Numerous temperature profiles were completed using a newly constructed 30 -stage centrifugal contactor pilot plant. The automated process control and data acquisition system worked very well throughout testing. Temperature data profiles for an array of total flowrates (FT) and contactor rpm values for both single-phase and two-phase systems have been collected with selected profiles and comparisons reported. Total flowrates (FT) ranged from 0. 5 - 1. 4 L/min with rotor speeds from 3500 - 4000 rpm. Solution inlet temperatures ranging from ambient up to 50 ° C were tested. Ambient temperature testing shows that a small amount of heat is added to the processed solution by the mechanical energy of the contactors. The temperature profiles match the ambient temperature of the laboratory but are nearly 10 ° C higher toward the middle of the cascade. Heated input solution testing provides temperature profiles with smaller temperature gradients and are more influenced by the temperature of the inlet solutions than the ambient laboratory temperature. The temperature effects of solution mixing, even at 4000 rpm, were insignificant in any of the studies conducted on lamp oil and water...|$|R

40|$|International audience[1] Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) {{have been}} {{correlated}} with an early development stage of high altitude positive intracloud (+IC) flashes {{in which the}} negative leader propagates up toward the upper positive charge region, while the positive leader propagates down toward the lower negative charge region. The resultant bidirectional leaders develop electrical potential differences {{in the vicinity of}} their heads with respect to the ambient potential distribution created by the thundercloud charges. These potential differences are believed to be of essential importance for the generation of TGFs. Using electrostatic calculations and a three-dimensional Cartesian fractal model, we quantify these potential differences produced in a developing +IC lightning discharge for given thunderstorm electric configurations. We present a case of a +IC lightning discharge in a realistic thunderstorm configuration that leads to a very high ($ 300 MV) potential difference and show how a delay {{in the development of the}} negative leader with respect to the positive one in a bidirectional leader system can facilitate a high potential difference in the negative leader head region.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of the inlet has a significant bearing on the relationship headwater elevation and discharge for culverts with a free outlet. The relative importance of inlet design depends upon {{the location of the}} control section. The primary purpose of the research reported here was to examine the effect of inlet design upon the head-discharge curve of a model culvert. Two types of flush inlets, selected to represent extreme conditions for flush inlets, were tested [...] a square-edged inlet and a well rounded inlet. For each inlet the head-discharge curve was measured and the two curves compared. The comparison indicated that for certain conditions an appreciable head-advantage was gained by using a rounded inlet. Observation and analysis of the flow characteristics indicated that this gain phenomenon occurred in the region where for the same head a square-edged inlet caused separation and inhibited full flow, while the rounded inlet promoted full flow in the culvert with a corresponding increase in <b>discharge.</b> In <b>connection</b> with measurements to establish friction factors and entrance losses in the model culvert for use in the analysis of the experimental, a few behavior curves were determined.

40|$|This report {{provides}} information about environmental programs during 2004 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). Seasonal activities that span calendar years are also included. Production of an annual site environmental report (ASER) {{is a requirement}} established by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) for all management and operating (M&O) contractors throughout the DOE complex. SLAC is a federally-funded, research and development center with Stanford University as the M&O contractor. The most noteworthy information in this report is summarized in this section. This summary demonstrates the effective application of SLAC environmental management in meeting the site's integrated safety management system (ISMS) goals. For normal daily activities, all SLAC managers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that proper procedures are followed so that worker safety and health are protected; the environment is protected; and compliance is ensured. Throughout 2004, SLAC focused on these activities through the SLAC management systems (described in Chapter 3). These systems were also the way SLAC approached implementing ''greening of the government'' initiatives such as Executive Order 13148. The management systems at SLAC are effective, supporting compliance with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. There were no reportable releases to the environment from SLAC operations during 2004. In addition, many improvements were continued during 2004, in waste minimization, recycling, decreasing air emission rates, stormwater drain system, groundwater restoration, and planning for a chemical management system to manage chemical use better. Program-specific details discussed are: (1) Air Quality [...] SLAC operates its air quality management program in compliance with its established permit conditions: 2004 was the seventh consecutive year the air quality management program operated without receiving any notices of violation (NOVs) from regulators. (2) Hazardous Waste [...] The Environmental Health Division of the San Mateo County Health Services Agency is the California certified unified permitting agency (CUPA) responsible for overseeing hazardous materials and waste management at SLAC. The CUPA made no facility inspections of SLAC during 2004. (3) Stormwater and Industrial Wastewater [...] SLAC operates its industrial and sanitary wastewater management program in compliance with established permit conditions: 2004 was the eighth consecutive year the program operated without receiving any NOVs from program regulators. During 2004 the last 32 unauthorized <b>discharge</b> <b>connections</b> to the stormwater system were eliminated. (4) Hazardous Materials Program [...] Although SLAC {{has been successful in}} meeting the regulatory requirements for managing hazardous materials, it has decided to pursue a more active strategy in reducing its use of such materials. The cornerstone of this effort is the implementation of a chemical management system (CMS). (5) Environmental Radiological Program [...] In 2004, no radiological incidents occurred that increased radiation levels or released radioactivity to the environment. In addition to managing its radioactive wastes safely and responsibly, SLAC worked {{to reduce the amount of}} waste generated. As detailed in Chapter 5, SLAC has implemented programs and systems to ensure compliance with all radiological requirements related to the environment.

40|$|Large wood {{maintains}} in-channel and floodplain habitats by {{influencing the}} biophysical {{character of the}} river corridor. Large wood dynamics in a river corridor are a product of both watershed-wide processes but also of local recruitment, transport, and storage. This complexity of scales added to the logistical constraints in taking measurements limits our understanding of large wood dynamics through the watershed. To begin to unravel this issue, we compiled a dataset {{of the volume of}} large wood deposited annually into 131 reservoirs across Japan, and compared large wood export to both flow discharge and watershed characteristics (watershed size, latitude, channel slope, percent forest, and forest type). We found that large wood was predominately transported during peak flow events. Large wood export increased logarithmically with watershed area. The decreasing export rate of large wood per watershed area is interpreted as a combination of annual export variability in upper watersheds, a non-significant increase in large wood recruitment along the longitudinal gradient (potentially human influenced), the increase in long-term storage on adjacent large floodplains, and significant decay/fragmentation downstream. Watersheds < 10 - 20 km 2 had a highly variable large wood export pattern, conforming generally to previously published work that suggest transport limitation in smaller watersheds. The data suggest that there is an export threshold (∼ 75 km 2) where large wood export is no longer related to watershed size. Export across all watershed sizes was controlled by watershed characteristics (slope, percent forested, etc.) and peak <b>discharge</b> events. The <b>connection</b> with upstream watersheds and laterally with the floodplain increases the net flux of large wood through downstream transport and retransport of buried logs. Identifying rates of large wood transport due to watershed connectivity as a potential key input process will improve our basic understanding of geomorphic and ecological patterns within the watershed. These results highlight the importance of understanding both the local and watershed scale dynamics of large wood in creating and maintaining more heterogeneous riparian and aquatic habitat along the river corridor...|$|R

The new {{millennium}} brought many new changes, and stormwater management {{was no exception}} in the State of Georgia. The {{new millennium}} has effected change in many arenas, {{not the least of}} which is stormwater management. Minimum compliance is no longer the standard, and stormwater is no longer an afterthought for community planning. For example: 2001 – The State of Georgia completed its Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM), providing a methodology for selecting and implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) for new development, in accordance with the goal of improving water quality through reduced sediment loads. 2003 – Nationally, Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program led cities and counties (86 in Georgia) to develop stormwater management programs. 2006 – Stringent measures in the Etowah River Basin were adopted through the Etowah Habitat Conservation Plan to prevent the “taking” of several endangered darters. Over the past few years in the Atlanta metropolitan area, the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD) developed six model stormwater management ordinances, addressing post-development stormwater management, floodplain management, conservation subdivision / open space development, illicit <b>discharge</b> and illegal <b>connections,</b> litter control, and stream buffer protection. The paper focuses on causes, effects, and remedies leading to the establishment and refinement of administrative procedures, professional trust, proactive approaches, and the elimination of plan implementation obstacles. As a community, we must pool our resources to help enable a positive return on our endeavors. The goal is not only to continually improve the protection and restoration of our streams and watersheds, but also to improve the process. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

40|$|The current {{need for}} {{forecasting}} Greenland Ice Sheet contributions to global sea level rise {{is complicated by}} the lack of understanding of ice sheet hydrology. The proportion of meltwater contributing to sea level rise, as well as the pathways transporting meltwater on, through, and out of the ice sheet, are not well understood. Remote sensing of hydrologic dynamics in combination with small-scale fieldwork allows examination of broad spatial and temporal trends in the Greenland hydrologic system responding to a changing climate. This dissertation reviews the current state of knowledge on Greenland Ice Sheet hydrology, and examines three components of the Greenland hydrologic system: (1) fjord sediment plumes as an indicator of meltwater output, (2) supraglacial streamflow as an indicator of meltwater input to the ice sheet, and (3) moulin distribution and formation as a mechanism diverting meltwater {{from the surface of the}} ice sheet to the bed. Buoyant sediment plumes that develop in fjords downstream of outlet glaciers are controlled by numerous factors, including meltwater runoff. MODIS retrievals of sediment plume concentration show a strong regional and seasonal response to meltwater production on the ice sheet surface, despite limitations in fjords with rapidly calving glaciers, providing a tool for tracking meltwater release to the ocean. Summertime field observations and high-resolution satellite imagery reveal extensive supraglacial river networks across the southwestern ablation zone transporting large volumes of meltwater to moulins, yet these features remain poorly mapped and their discharges unquantified. A GIS modeling framework is developed to spatially adapt Manning’s equation for use with high-resolution WorldView- 2 imagery to map supraglacial river <b>discharge.</b> Moulins represent <b>connections</b> between surface meltwater on the Greenland ice sheet and subglacial drainage networks, where increased meltwater can enhance ice sliding dynamics. A new high-resolution moulin dataset in western Greenland created from WorldView- 1 / 2 imagery in the 2012 record melt year is used to assess moulin distribution and formation. Moulin locations show a significantly different distribution compared to geospatial variables in the entire study area, with moulins forming in areas of thinner ice, higher velocity and extensional strain rate, as well as lower surface elevation and slope, and higher bed elevation and slope...|$|R
40|$|Enhanced {{biological}} {{phosphorus removal}} (EBPR) is a biological process for efficient phosphate removal from wastewaters through intracellular storage of polyphosphate by polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO) and subsequent removal of PAO {{from the system}} through wastage of sludge. In comparison to physical and chemical phosphorus removal processes, the biological process has several advantages such as high removal efficiency, low cost, and no chemical sludge production, but disturbances and prolonged periods of insufficient phosphate removal are still observed in conventional treatment systems and {{the applicability of the}} process for the treatment of saline waters remains unclear. In this PhD project two different aspects of the enhanced biological phosphorus removal were studied. In {{the first part of the}} research, potential existence of functional diversity among PAO clades and its influence on process performance was investigated, whereas in the second part of the study, salinity effects were assessed on the metabolism of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO) and glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAO). Functional diversity among PAO clades (Chapter 2 to 5) Although genetic diversity among PAO clades has been observed in past studies, PAO were often considered to behave functionally the same. Several recent studies suggested that PAO clades may be functionally different and that some PAO clades can perform better phosphate removal than other clades. Considering the significant role of the EBPR process in nutrient removal and recovery processes and the potential effect of PAO clades prevalence on the process performance, there was a need to investigate the potential existence of functional differences among PAO clades. The objective of this part of the study was to assess the existence of functional differences among PAO clades regarding the anaerobic metabolism in relation to their storage polymers and regarding the denitrification pathways. In Chapter 2, it was demonstrated in short-term experiments that significant functional differences exist between PAO I and II, with respect to the anaerobic volatile fatty acid (VFA) uptake metabolism. Although both PAO clades were able to shift their metabolism from a mixed poly-P and glycogen dependent metabolism to a metabolism that fully relies on glycogen, the HAc-uptake rate of both PAO clades decreased significantly where the decrease of HAc-uptake rates was most pronounced for PAO I. Consequently, at poly-P depleted conditions, the HAc-uptake rate of PAO II was four times faster than that of PAO I, whereas that of PAO I was slightly faster at poly-P non-limiting conditions. In addition, under conditions where poly-P was not limiting for the anaerobic HAc-uptake, PAO II performed a mixed metabolism that was partially dependent on glycogen and partially on poly-P for the generation of energy required of the HAc uptake, while PAO I relied to a much bigger extent on poly-P for the generation of energy. These findings are of major importance because they contribute to explain and clarify the controversy concerning the different stoichiometric and kinetic values observed in EBPR systems and are relevant for the development of operational guidelines for combined chemical and biological phosphate removal processes. In Chapter 3, the effect of the storage polymers on the metabolism of PAO II was assessed in long-term experiments and the results were compared to a previous study which was, based on the reported stoichiometry and kinetics, presumably conducted with a PAO I dominated biomass culture. The study supported the observations in short-term experiments regarding the functional diversity between PAO I and II. In addition, it provided interesting insights in the role of storage polymers on the regulation of the anaerobic HAc-uptake metabolism. As the influent P/C ratio increased, the poly-P content of the biomass increased while its glycogen content decreased. At higher P-contents, the kinetic P-release rates for HAc-uptake and maintenance increased. In parallel, the HAc-uptake rates increased up to an optimal poly-P/glycogen ratio of 0. 3 P-mol/C-mol. Above that optimal ratio, the HAc-uptake rate decreased. The stoichiometry of the anaerobic conversions showed that a metabolic shift occurred from a glycogen dependent metabolism towards a poly-P dependent metabolism when the poly-P content of the biomass increased. The changes in the HAc-uptake rates suggest that at low poly-P contents the ATP formation rate is the rate limiting step, while at high P-contents (and, thus, low glycogen contents) the NADH production rate becomes the rate limiting step for HAc-uptake. Electron microscopy showed that poly-P is stored in the form of large granules in each PAO cell and, therefore, the rate of poly-P consumption may be surface area limited. Therefore, a decrease in the poly-P content of the biomass could limit the ATP production and thereby trigger the ATP production from glycogen conversion at a smaller rate. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the Accumulibacter clades metabolism under dynamic conditions and clarify population dynamics observed in previous studies. To confirm the observations in Chapter 2 and 3, it was assessed in Chapter 4 if certain PAO clades had the ability to proliferate under conditions where the phosphate concentrations were just enough for assimilation into biomass. In a SBR system, inoculated with activated sludge, a mixed PAO-GAO culture was enriched after 16 SRT that comprised of 49 % PAO and 46 % GAO of the total bacterial population. More specifically, all PAO were closely related to 'Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis' Clade II. Under anaerobic conditions, the mixed PAO-GAO culture performed a typical GAO metabolism in which all energy for HAc-uptake was produced by the conversion of glycogen. This study confirmed the findings in chapter 2 and 3 that PAO in general can perform a glycogen dependent metabolism but that PAO II had a competitive advantage over PAO I under phosphate limiting conditions. Under aerobic conditions PAO II were capable of instantly taking up excessive amounts of phosphate when additional phosphate was added to the reactor. The study also demonstrated that from a practical perspective, PAO may remain in PAO II dominated activated sludge systems under phosphate limiting conditions for periods of up to 16 SRT for instance due to overdosing of iron while still being able to take up phosphate aerobically when phosphate becomes available in the influent. Chapter 5 focussed on the denitrification pathways of PAO. Several literature studies suggest that PAO I is able to use both nitrite and nitrate as external electron acceptor while PAO II is only able to use nitrite. The results from those previous studies are contradictory and inconclusive as no studies were conducted with EBPR cultures highly enriched with specific PAO clades under appropriate conditions. In chapter 5 the oxidative pathways (oxygen, nitrite and nitrate) of a PAO I culture were investigated in combination with different VFA feed (HAc and HPr), firstly after a cultivation period in anaerobic/anoxic mode and secondly after a cultivation period in anaerobic/anoxic/oxic mode. After cultivation in anaerobic/anoxic/oxic mode, the enriched culture was not able to take up P in the presence of nitrate, despite the observation of low denitrification rates. In the presence of oxygen and nitrite, rapid P-uptake was observed. The big difference in denitrification rates with nitrite and nitrate together with observation that side populations were still present in the highly enriched biomass, resulted in the hypothesis that the side population in the biomass might have been responsible for NO 3 to NO 2 conversions, where the carbon source was mainly obtained from released soluble microbial products. This hypothesis was further supported by a comparison of literature values from studies conducted with PAO enrichment with various degrees of PAO enrichment. This comparison showed that the biomass specific P-uptake rate in the presence of nitrate increases when the fraction of side populations increases. In addition, the P-removal/N-removal ratio in many past EBPR studies under anaerobic/anoxic/oxic conditions with nitrite was higher than the P-removal/N-removal with nitrate, suggesting that PAO in general are not capable of using nitrate as external electron acceptor and are dependent on the partial denitrification activity of other organisms. Overall, this research revealed that significant functional diversity exist in the metabolism of PAO regarding the anaerobic metabolism while the study suggest that for the denitrification pathways among the Accumulibacter clades PAO I and II, functional differences may not exist. The differences in the anaerobic metabolism contribute to a better understanding of metabolic differences observed in past studies, provides more insight in population dynamics and are from a practical perspective in particular relevant for the development of nutrient recovery and/or combined chemical and biological P-removal systems. The findings of the denitrification pathways of PAO I provide a better understanding of the role of PAO in combined nutrient removal systems, helps to explain practical issues such as anoxic P-release in full scale wastewater treatment plants and support the development of measures to mitigate such issues in the performance. In addition to the functional diversity, the research provided more insight in the role of the storage polymers on the regulation of the anaerobic substrate uptake metabolism, which also leads to a better understanding of EBPR processes in full scale treatment plants under dynamic conditions. Although this study provided clear insights in the functional diversity of PAO clades and their metabolism, it is just the starting point of research focused on the functional diversity of PAO clades. To enable future research on the functional diversity, reliable selection methods or methods for isolation of PAO should be developed to obtain highly enriched or pure cultures with specific PAO clades. Impact of salinity on the metabolism of PAO and GAO during short-term exposure (Chapter 6 and 7) Saline wastewater can be generated by industry, intrusion of saline water in the sewerage or when saline water is used directly as alternative water source for non-potable purposes such as flushing toilets. To prevent the environment from severe environmental issues like hypoxia and eutrophication, the nutrients (C, N and P) need to be removed from saline wastewaters before its discharge to the receiving water bodies. However, salinity may negatively affect the microorganisms responsible for the nutrient removal in biological nutrient removal systems. This study assessed the effect of salinity on the metabolism of the microbial populations that prevail in EBPR systems (PAO and GAO). In Chapter 6, the short-term salinity effects on the anaerobic metabolism of PAO and GAO were assessed. It was demonstrated that salinity affected both PAO and GAO, with PAO being the most sensitive organisms. With increasing salinity the HAc uptake rates were inhibited while the maintenance requirements increased (up to 4 % salinity) for both PAO and GAO. Interestingly, elevated salinity levels seemed to induce a shift from poly-P to glycogen consumption for HAc uptake and maintenance by PAO, whereas the stoichiometry of GAO related to the anaerobic HAc-uptake was unaffected. In addition, a structured model was developed, which could successfully describe the salinity effects on the different metabolic processes of PAO and GAO. In Chapter 7, the short-term salinity effects on the aerobic metabolism of PAO were assessed. The metabolism was very sensitive to even low salinity concentrations. An increase from 0. 02 to 0. 18 % salinity led to a decrease in the specific oxygen consumption, PO 4 and NH 4 uptake rates of 25 %, 46 % and 63 %, respectively. At 0. 35 % and higher salinity concentrations, the PO 4 -uptake, NH 4 -uptake and glycogen recovery were fully inhibited. Biomass growth was the most inhibited parameter, followed by poly-P formation and glycogen synthesis. The aerobic maintenance energy requirements increased up to a threshold concentration of 2 % salinity, above which it rapidly decreased. To supply additional energy to cover the increasing maintenance requirements, P was released at salinity concentrations higher than 0. 35 %. The aerobic maintenance P-release followed a similar trend like the maintenance oxygen consumption. The inhibition model developed in this study could successfully describe the observed salinity effects on the different metabolic processes in this study. Overall, the research demonstrated that the EBPR process, in particular the aerobic stage, may be very sensitive to salinity. The findings suggest that any saline discharge equivalent to more than 5 % seawater (with 3. 4 % salinity) addition or 15 % brackish water (with 1. 2 % salinity) by either seawater <b>toilet</b> flushing, industrial <b>discharges</b> or saline intrusion can cause serious upsets of the EBPR process. This indicates that the EBPR process may not be applicable for saline wastewater treatment and that salinity may even be a relevant inhibition factor for activated sludge systems, treating conventional domestic wastewaters. The presented data is however based on short-term (hours) experiments using sodium chloride. To give the organisms the opportunity to acclimatize to higher salinity concentrations or giving the system the possibility to select for more salt tolerant PAO strains, future studies should focus on the long-term salinity effects on EBPR cultures, considering different salt compositions as well as different compositions of organic carbon in the synthetic wastewater.
