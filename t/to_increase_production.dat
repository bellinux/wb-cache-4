5|$|Metformin {{has been}} {{suggested}} <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production</b> of lactate in the large intestine, which could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors. However, the clinical significance of this is unknown, {{and the risk of}} metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, {{but the government}} did not use this opportunity <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production</b> of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.|$|E
5|$|The Qinghe Special Steel Corporation ltd, {{established}} in 1987, {{had originally been}} a state-owned enterprise, and had been restructured into a private business. According to the State Administration of Work Safety, the plant had about 300 employees {{at the time of}} the accident, although Xinhua gave the employment figure as 650. In 2006, the factory produced 70,000 tonnes of steel and had hoped <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production</b> to 120,000 tonnes in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|To reduce {{bacterial}} growth, plasma {{concentrations of}} iron are lowered {{in a variety}} of systemic inflammatory states due <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> <b>production</b> of hepcidin which is mainly released by the liver in response <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> <b>production</b> of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6. This functional iron deficiency will resolve once the source of inflammation is rectified; however, if not resolved, it can progress to Anaemia of Chronic Inflammation. [...] The underlying inflammation can be caused by fever, inflammatory bowel disease, infections, Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), carcinomas, or following surgery.|$|R

5|$|The merger {{led to a}} {{clash of}} two {{organisational}} cultures. While VAT had a flat organisation, open communication among its workforce and a spirit of togetherness, SAT's organisation was strictly hierarchical. The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu-Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes, bus chassis, terminal tractors and military vehicles. Former VAT personnel had <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production</b> of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes, so it was {{three to four years}} before the Hämeenlinna factory could deliver results in line with its capacity.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Aronde, Simca marketed {{different}} trim {{levels of the}} Vedette under different model names, this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history. The basic version was called the Simca Vedette Trianon, the mid-level was the Simca Vedette Versailles and, {{at the top of}} the range, the Simca Vedette Régence. An option on all versions was a large glass moonroof that slid into the roof, called Vistadome The Vedette range was still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets, including the Netherlands and Germany, until 1956. As the new model caught on, Simca was able <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production</b> from the 150daily achieved during Ford's ownership of the factory to 250cars a day.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{seventeen}} countries produced concentrated uranium oxides, with Canada (27.9% {{of world}} production) and Australia (22.8%) being the largest producers and Kazakhstan (10.5%), Russia (8.0%), Namibia (7.5%), Niger (7.4%), Uzbekistan (5.5%), the United States (2.5%), Argentina (2.1%), Ukraine (1.9%) and China (1.7%) also producing significant amounts. Kazakhstan continues <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production</b> {{and may have}} become the world's largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826tonnes, compared to Canada with 11,100t and Australia with 9,430t. In the late 1960s, UN geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia. The find was the largest of its kind, with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25% of the world's then known uranium reserves of 800,000 tons.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the cold winter were {{exacerbated}} by problems in the energy sector which caused coal supplies to become low. The coal and electricity industries had been recently nationalised by Clement Attlee's government and placed {{under the control of}} the Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell. Shinwell oversaw efforts <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production,</b> but there were concerns that the coal supply was inadequate. At the start of the winter the coal stockpiles contained enough coal to last for just four weeks, compared to the usual supplies of ten to twelve weeks which existed before the war. However, Shinwell allowed himself to be lulled into a false sense of security by over-optimistic productivity reports from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). These reports failed to translate into real production as the government feared to take on the NUM, whose members' absentee rates were 2.5 times those of the pre-war period. The risk of a coal shortage caused the public to buy electric fires to ensure a source of heat for their homes. This, in turn, put a greater strain on the supply of electricity– the monthly demand increase caused by electric fires in 1946 was roughly the same as the annual increase in generating capacity. Shinwell was warned in mid-October that a coal shortage was possible, but gambled on a mild winter to keep consumption low so that he would not have to risk a confrontation with the miners.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{intends to}} change the menu every three months, each menu containing historical dishes ranging from the 14th to 19th centuries. Prior to opening, rumours were abound regarding the dishes to be served at Dinner, including one report from The Guardian which claimed that an ice-cream meat pie was {{to appear on the}} menu. Dishes that do appear include scallops and peas with cucumber ketchup and bergamot cured mackerel salad. Each item has been based on a historical recipe, such as the scallop dish which dates from 1826 and was published in The Cook and Housewife's Manual Mistress by Meg Dodds. One item which was reported in multiple reviews was the meat fruit, a chicken liver mousse made to look like a textured mandarin orange. The meat fruit was proving so popular that by November 2011, some 900 were being sold per week and the restaurant was aiming <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production</b> to be able to supply up to 1200 a week. During the Christmas period, the Meat Fruit is decorated to appear like a plum rather than a mandarine to accord with the holiday season.|$|E

25|$|The nation {{went from}} a surplus {{manpower}} pool with high unemployment and relief in 1940 to a severe manpower shortage by 1943. Industry realized that the Army urgently desired production of essential war materials and foodstuffs more than soldiers. (Large numbers of soldiers were not used until the invasion of Europe in summer 1944.) In 1940–43 the Army often transferred soldiers to civilian status in the Enlisted Reserve Corps in order <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production.</b> Those transferred would return to work in essential industry, although they could be recalled to active duty if the Army needed them. Others were discharged if their civilian work was deemed essential. There were instances of mass releases of men <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production</b> in various industries. Working {{men who had been}} classified 4F or otherwise ineligible for the draft took second jobs.|$|E
25|$|In some areas, {{individual}} {{rather than}} communal land ownership or leaseholds were established, providing families with motivation <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>production,</b> improve standards of living, and gain wealth.
