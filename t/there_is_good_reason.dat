25|$|Elizabeth kept {{a female}} {{companion}} with her {{most of the}} time. This person was not exactly a servant, but she would act in that role. She {{would be expected to}} carry things and aid Elizabeth on her daily round. Barbara Schnorrenberg suggests that Sarah Scott was in this function and says that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to suggest that she married poorly to escape that situation (Schnorrenberg 723). After Elizabeth's mother died, her father moved to London with his housekeeper, giving no money at all to his children. When Sarah was removed from her bad marriage, Elizabeth's father (whose ward she was) not only gave her no financial help but forbade either Elizabeth or Matthew, her brother, from relieving her distress.|$|E
25|$|Some {{argue that}} almost all of the above is based on an unhistorical {{projection}} of present concerns, onto the past. This alternative view argues that there are immense complexities of time, space, climate, geology and topography which, when combined with our extremely fragmentary information, makes generalizations almost impossible. Tree crops, dates, figs, olives, chestnuts etc, played a very important role in Roman agriculture. Grains were often intercultivated with these tree crops. Almost all species of trees grow again when cut down. Cutting down a wood does not, by itself, destroy woodland. Coppicing is one way in which wood could be harvested on a sustainable basis for example. Hypocausts were pre-adapted to burn poor quality fuels like straw as well as coal. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that both straw and coal were important fuels in antiquity, especially in Roman Britain where coal was abundant in many areas. A great deal of protection against soil erosion arises from terracing hillsides. We do not know how extensive terraces were in antiquity but {{a good deal of the}} soil erosion, here assumed to be caused by the Romans, may well date to the dark ages when the maintenance of terraces broke down. Changes in tree cover may well arise from differences in climate, which are still not well understood. But there is some evidence that the decline of the Roman West is linked to climate change.|$|E

500|$|In the Old Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, {{the goddess}} Ishtar sends Taurus, the Bull of Heaven, to kill Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. Enkidu tears off the bull's hind part and hurls the {{quarters}} {{into the sky}} where they become the stars we know as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. Some locate Gilgamesh as the neighboring constellation of Orion, facing Taurus as if in combat, while others identify him with the sun whose rising on the equinox vanquishes the constellation. In early Mesopotamian art, the Bull of Heaven was closely associated with Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare. One of the oldest depictions shows the bull standing before the goddess' standard; since it has 3 stars depicted on its back (the cuneiform sign for [...] "star-constellation"), <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to regard this as the constellation later known as Taurus.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the song}} is ostensibly about love and dependency, like many U2 songs, it also lends itself to {{religious}} interpretations. Listeners have heard an allusion to the Book of Job [...] and its tale of God serving as a lamp upon Job's head walking through the darkness. [...] Robyn Brothers suggests that ultraviolet light is [...] "a metaphor for a divine force both unseen {{to the naked eye}} and ultimately unknowable to the human intellect." [...] Conversely, Steve Stockman, author of Walk On: The Spiritual Journey Of U2, sees [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] as being about Bono's wife Ali Hewson, and [...] "how when he feels like trash, she makes him clean," [...] but says <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to interpret the song as being just as much about God. The song's title supports this view: indigo and violet rarely appear in song lyrics as frequently as other colours, while ultraviolet represents an unseen wavelength beyond the visible spectrum.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} indirect {{influence was}} Thomas Simpson, who achieved {{a result that}} closely resembled de Moivre's. According to Simpsons' work's preface, his own work depended greatly on de Moivre's; the latter in fact described Simpson's work as an abridged version of his own. Finally, Thomas Bayes wrote an essay discussing theological implications of de Moivre's results: his solution to a problem, namely that of determining the probability of an event by its relative frequency, was taken as a proof {{for the existence of}} God by Bayes. Finally in 1812, Pierre-Simon Laplace published his Théorie analytique des probabilités in which he consolidated and laid down many fundamental results in probability and statistics such as the moment generating function, method of least squares, inductive probability, and hypothesis testing, thus completing the final phase in the development of classical probability. [...] Indeed, in light of all this, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> Bernoulli's work is hailed as such a seminal event; not only did his various influences, direct and indirect, set the mathematical study of combinatorics spinning, but even theology was impacted.|$|E

500|$|According to the Historia Brittonum, Penda besieged Oswiu at Iudeu; {{this site}} has been {{identified}} with Stirling, {{in the north of}} Oswiu's kingdom. Oswiu tried to buy peace: in the Historia Brittonum, it is said that Oswiu offered treasure, which Penda distributed among his British allies. Bede states that the offer was simply rejected by Penda, who [...] "resolved to extirpate all of [...] nation, from the highest to the lowest". Additionally, according to Bede, Oswiu's son Ecgfrith was being held hostage [...] "at the court of Queen Cynwise, in the province of the Mercians"—perhaps surrendered by Oswiu as part of some negotiations or arrangement. It would seem that Penda's army then moved back south, perhaps returning home, but a great battle was fought near the river Winwaed in the region of Loidis, thought to be somewhere in the area around modern day Leeds, on a date given by Bede as 15 November. The identification of the Winwaed with a modern river is uncertain, but possibly it was a tributary of the Humber. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to believe it may well have been the river now known as Cock Beck in the ancient kingdom of Elmet. The Cock Beck meanders its way through Pendas Fields, close to an ancient well known as Pen Well on the outskirts of Leeds, before eventually joining the River Wharfe. This same Cock Beck whilst in flood also {{played a significant role in}} the much later Battle of Towton in 1461. Another possibility is the River Went (a tributary of the River Don, situated to the north of modern-day Doncaster). It may be that Penda's army was attacked by Oswiu at a point of strategic vulnerability, which would help explain Oswiu's victory over forces that were, according to Bede, much larger than his own.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the 2,400 species of praying mantises are ambush predators, although some ground and bark species actively pursue prey. Species that are predominantly ambush predators camouflage themselves and spend long periods standing perfectly still. They largely wait for their prey to stray within reach, but most mantises chase prey if it strays closely enough. In pure ambush mode, a mantis lashes out at remarkable speed when a target does get within reach. [...] When the prey is a butterfly or other flying insect, the mantis snatches {{it out of the}} air. Praying mantises are deliberate when they move, and only do so when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to.

2500|$|In early sources, {{there is}} an {{additional}} complex of beliefs that is connected with the afterlife: death {{could be described as}} an erotic embrace between the dead man and a lady who represents the afterlife.

Rán's nine daughters are also depicted as erotic partners in death. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to believe that such erotic elements are not just skaldic playfulness, but authentic pagan notions, since they appear in the oldest known skaldic poems.

Several skaldic poems and sagas describe death in battle or on the sea with erotic terminology.

2500|$|It {{is often}} {{problematic}} {{to identify the}} dividing line between [...] "Romanized" [...] villages and those sites that {{can be defined as}} [...] "small towns". Therefore, categorizing sites as small towns has largely focused on identifying sites that had some evidence of industry and trade, and not simply a basic agricultural economic unit that would almost exclusively produce goods for its own existence. Additional settlements along the principal route within Roman Dacia are mentioned in the Tabula Peutingeriana. These include Brucla, Blandiana, Germisara, Petris, and Aquae. Both Germisara and Aquae were sites where natural thermal springs were accessible, and each are still functioning today. The locations of Brucla, Blandiana, and Petris are not known for certain. In the case of Petris however, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to suppose it was located at Uroi in Romania.

This would indicate that the 1130–34 campaign had resulted in the acquisition of these territories.

Additionally, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to suspect that King Fergus of Galloway was brought into David's sphere of influence.

2500|$|Nevertheless, as Jaffe himself {{notes in}} his paper, [...] "no one has shown that source theory or another S-matrix based {{approach}} can provide a complete description of QED to all orders." [...] Furthermore, Milonni has shown the necessity of the vacuum field for the formal consistency of QED. In QCD, color confinement has led physicists to abandon the source theory or S-matrix based approach for the strong interactions. The Higgs mechanism, Hawking Radiation and the Unruh effect are also theorized {{to be dependent on}} zero-point vacuum fluctuations, the field contribution being an inseparable parts of these theories. Jaffe continues [...] "Even if one could argue away zero-point contributions to the quantum vacuum energy, the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking remains: condensates [...] that carry energy appear at many energy scales in the Standard Model. So <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> to be skeptical of attempts to avoid the standard formulation of quantum field theory and the zero-point energies it brings with it." [...] It is difficult to judge the physical reality of infinite zero-point energies that are inherent in field theories, but modern physics does not know any better way to construct gauge-invariant, renormalizable theories than with zero-point energy and they {{would seem to be a}} necessity for any attempt at a unified theory.|$|E
