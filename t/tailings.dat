5|$|In May 2007 the District Court's 2006 {{decision}} was overturned by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Circuit Court found {{in favor of}} the non-governmental organizations, ruling that discharge of <b>tailings</b> was not permitted under the EPA's New Source Performance Standard.|$|E
5|$|Waste rock removal: Rock {{extracted}} from the mine was removed from <b>tailings</b> piles and disposed of in a compacted cell. In Boulder Creek, another tributary of Spring Creek, the acidity level has lowered slightly.|$|E
5|$|Some {{heavy metals}} are either {{essential}} nutrients (typically iron, cobalt, and zinc), or relatively harmless (such as ruthenium, silver, and indium), {{but can be}} toxic in larger amounts or certain forms. Other heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury, and lead, are highly poisonous. Potential sources of heavy metal poisoning include mining, <b>tailings,</b> industrial wastes, agricultural runoff, occupational exposure, paints and treated timber.|$|E
5|$|MT 34 was reconstructed—and in {{many places}} relocated—and paved {{starting}} from the Twin Bridges end. The highway was reconstructed from that town to Sheridan in 1939. The reconstructed highway was removed from Middle Road and Tuke Lane to its present course between the two towns. MT 34 was reconstructed from Sheridan to Laurin in 1940. The reconstructed highway bypassed Bivens Creek Road {{and for the first}} time served Laurin directly. Two years later, MT 34 was placed on its modern alignment south through Alder and east through the dredge <b>tailings.</b> The new highway replaced Ruby Road, which bypasses Alder, and another road that bypassed the <b>tailings</b> by following the edge of the valley closer to Alder Creek. MT 34 was reconstructed on or very close to the old road through Alder Gulch to the east end of Virginia City in 1945. Improvements from the Ennis end of the highway began in 1948 when the highway from Ennis west to Old Virginia City Highway in the valley was graveled. Two years later, that stretch was reconstructed and paved. In 1951, MT 34 was placed on its present course west to the highway's summit, which bypassed Old Virginia City Highway. Finally, the modern highway from Twin Bridges to Ennis was completed when the route from Virginia City to the summit was reconstructed and paved in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The Liaison Office interviewed European refugee {{scientists}} and studied German physics journals. It compiled lists of German scientists {{of interest and}} possible locations of nuclear research and industrial facilities, and the mining and stockpiling of uranium and thorium ores. Little thorium was available in Germany or German-occupied Europe, and attention soon centered on the mines at Joachimsthal in Sudetenland (the German-annexed part of Czechoslovakia). Aerial reconnaissance was carried out periodically, and production was measured by assessing {{the size of the}} piles of <b>tailings.</b>|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} 'enriched', the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3% and 5%. This process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 {{and with a}} correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238, called depleted uranium or 'DU'. To {{be considered}} 'depleted', the uranium-235 isotope concentration should {{be no more than}} 0.3%. The price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment <b>tailings</b> containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The route {{parallels}} the track for roughly , over which time it passes {{to the north}} of Greenlawn Memorial Park. As the trackage and the highway approach a point known as Amboy Station, NY173 curves away from the railroad and heads southeast toward Amboy. After making the turn, NY173 meets Pottery Road (County Route164 or CR164), a local road leading to Camillus Airport, a simple one-runway facility located adjacent to the railroad line. NY173 continues into and through Amboy, passing a large area of <b>tailings</b> that was once the site of the Syracuse Municipal Airport. The brownfields are bordered to the north by Ninemile Creek and to the south by the Old Erie Canal, both of which are traversed by NY173 on its way into the densely populated Fairmount neighborhood of Camillus.|$|E
5|$|The {{corridor}} {{through which}} MT 287 passes {{was part of}} two migration routes along which settlers rushed to attempt to make their fortunes during the Alder Gulch gold rush that started in 1863. Virginia City {{was the target of}} both routes; the new town became the second capital of the Montana Territory in 1865. Settlers from the east followed the Bozeman Trail through Wyoming and eastern Montana, including the namesake city, and settlers from the south used the Virginia City branch of the Montana Trail from Utah and Idaho. After 10 years, the initial gold boom had ended, and the territorial capital moved to Helena in 1875. A second period of gold extraction came {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, when mechanical gold dredges arrived to tear up Alder Gulch to gather more gold. Gold dredge placer mining and some lode mining formed the basis of the area's economy until the gold ore was mostly exhausted; the dredge <b>tailings</b> along Alder Gulch remain a visible reminder of the area's mining past.|$|E
5|$|In Alder, MT 287 {{leaves the}} valley of the Ruby River and heads east through Alder Gulch, a narrow valley along which the highway ascends the more {{moderate}} mountains between the Tobacco Root Mountains to the north and the Gravelly Range to the south. The length of the valley is filled with <b>tailings,</b> or small hills of mining waste left behind by gold dredge placer mining over decades of mining. The highway passes through the village of Nevada City, the site of the Finney House and the Dr. Don L. Byam House. MT 287 follows the Alder Gulch Short Line Railroad, an isolated narrow-gauge railway, until the route reaches Virginia City. The highway enters the town on Nevada Street but mainly follows Wallace Street through the Virginia City Historic District, a National Historic Landmark preserving buildings of Montana's second territorial capital. MT 287 leaves Virginia City and ascends to its highest point along Daylight Creek. The highway descends into {{the valley of}} the Madison River along Eightmile Creek. MT 287 meets the northern end of S-249 (Varney Road) where the highway curves north on arriving at the Madison River. The highway enters the town of Ennis along Bauer Lane and curves east onto West Main Street before reaching its eastern terminus at US 287, which heads north and east along Main Street.|$|E
5|$|Since the post-World War II timber boom {{driven by}} the need of raw {{materials}} from industrial countries, Sabah forests have been gradually eroded by uncontrolled timber exploitation and the conversion of Sabah forest lands into palm oil plantations. Since 1970, forestry sector have contributed for over 50% of the state revenue, of which a study conducted in 1997 revealed the state had almost depleted all of its virgin forests outside the conservation areas. The state government were determined to maintain the state biodiversity while {{to make sure the}} state economy continue to alive. While in the same time facing hard task to control such activities although there is laws to prevent it. In addition, the need for development and basic necessities also became an issue while to preserving the nature. Mining activities had directly released pollutants of heavy metals into rivers, reservoirs, ponds and affecting groundwater through the leaching of mine <b>tailings.</b> An environmental report released in 1994 reported the presence of heavy metal at the Damit/Tuaran River that exceeded the water quality safe levels for consumption. The water in Liwagu River also reported the presence of heavy metal which was believed to be originated from the Mamut Copper Mine. Forest fire also have become the latest concern due to drought and fires set by irresponsible farmers or individuals such as what happened in the 2016 forest fires where thousand hectares of forest reserve areas in Binsuluk of the west coast Sabah are lost.|$|E
25|$|A <b>tailings</b> dam is {{typically}} an earth-fill embankment dam used to store <b>tailings,</b> which are produced during mining operations after separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore. Conventional water retention dams can serve this purpose, {{but due to}} cost, a <b>tailings</b> dam is more viable. Unlike water retention dams, a <b>tailings</b> dam is raised in succession throughout {{the life of the}} particular mine. Typically, a base or starter dam is constructed, and as it fills with a mixture of <b>tailings</b> and water, it is raised. Material used to raise the dam can include the <b>tailings</b> (depending on their size) along with dirt.|$|E
25|$|Uranium <b>tailings</b> are waste {{by-product}} materials {{left over}} from the rough processing of uranium-bearing ore. They are not significantly radioactive. Mill <b>tailings</b> are sometimes referred to as 11(e)2 wastes, from the section of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 that defines them. Uranium mill <b>tailings</b> typically also contain chemically hazardous heavy metal such as lead and arsenic. Vast mounds of uranium mill <b>tailings</b> are left at many old mining sites, especially in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a threat due to the <b>tailings</b> dam. An {{engineering}} report in March, 1988, gave information that the <b>tailings</b> dam overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton <b>tailings</b> pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed. The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the <b>tailings</b> pond, calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed, investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report {{out of the public}} eye.|$|E
25|$|The dam {{formed the}} {{southern}} wall {{of one of}} the mill's three holding ponds, which were used to evaporate <b>tailings</b> solution until the remaining solid waste could be buried. During its operation from 1967 to 1982, the mill produced 3.5 million tons of <b>tailings</b> at the rate of 4,000 tons a day. The 35-foot-high embankment was constructed on a deposit of collapsible clayey, silty sand a hundred feet deep. United Nuclear used a new design, recommended by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that used earth rather than <b>tailings</b> themselves as building material. The holding pond was not lined, in violation of standards in the Uranium Mill <b>Tailings</b> Radiation Control Act of 1978 that required that holding ponds be impermeable. This lack of lining allowed <b>tailings</b> solution to seep into the ground, weakening the foundation of the dam and contaminating the groundwater.|$|E
25|$|At 6:00 am, a United Nuclear Corporation {{employee}} {{noticed the}} breach and suspended further discharge of <b>tailings</b> {{solution to the}} holding pond. By 8:00, a temporary dike had stopped the flow of residual <b>tailings</b> solution.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>tailings</b> dams often store toxic {{chemicals}} from the mining process, {{they have an}} impervious liner to prevent seepage. Water/slurry levels in the <b>tailings</b> pond must be managed for stability and environmental purposes as well.|$|E
25|$|The main {{component}} {{groups are}} a battery site and a cyanide plant. The battery site includes boilers, concrete and stone mounts and foundations, and steam engines. An earth formation for a tramway runs southward from the battery, past an earth reservoir site, to two small <b>tailings</b> dumps. The cyanide plant is centred 150m {{south of the}} battery, with a recent <b>tailings</b> dump extending some distance to its west and covering the site {{of most of the}} former Golden Gate Township. Sections of a chain of <b>tailings</b> buckets (not in situ) are located at the battery end of the cyanide plant. The surviving remnants include <b>tailings</b> bucket chains, a boiler, an engine, timber stump foundations and concrete ponds.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} raised <b>tailings</b> dam designs, the upstream, {{downstream}} and centerline, named {{according to the}} movement of the crest during raising. The specific design used is dependent upon topography, geology, climate, the type of <b>tailings,</b> and cost. An upstream <b>tailings</b> dam consists of trapezoidal embankments being constructed on top but toe to crest of another, moving the crest further upstream. This creates a relatively flat downstream side and a jagged upstream side which is supported by <b>tailings</b> slurry in the impoundment. The downstream design refers to the successive raising of the embankment that positions the fill and crest further downstream. A centerlined dam has sequential embankment dams constructed directly on top of another while fill is placed on the downstream side for support and slurry supports the upstream side.|$|E
25|$|Flotation {{is one of}} {{the unit}} {{processes}} used to separate the bituminous component of oil sands as {{part of the process of}} oil extraction. Some of the bitumen is not recovered in the primary separation vessel and reports to the <b>tailings.</b> These <b>tailings</b> are typically retreated in a scavenging operation to try to recover some of the remaining bitumen.|$|E
25|$|The non-floating <b>tailings</b> are {{discharged}} {{through a}} hole in the bottom of the tank.|$|E
25|$|The Cell {{can also}} be applied to coal {{preparation}} plant <b>tailings</b> to recover fine coal previously discarded.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} cracks formed {{along the southern}} part of the embankment, allowing the acidic <b>tailings</b> solution to penetrate and weaken the embankment. A sand beach was constructed to protect the face of the embankment from the <b>tailings</b> solution, but it was not properly maintained. Prior to the collapse, the level of the <b>tailings</b> solution in the holding pond had risen two feet higher than the dam's designed limit, and the sand beach no longer provided the dam protection. The United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded in its report to Governor Bruce King of New Mexico that the principal cause of failure was differential settlement of the foundation beneath the dam wall, and the report commissioned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission corroborated this conclusion. Critical variations in <b>tailings</b> pond operation practice from approved procedures contributed further to the dam failure. United Nuclear's Chief Operating Officer, J. David Hann, blamed the failure of dam on the pointed shape of the bedrock beneath the embankment, which he said acted as a fulcrum and weakened the dam.|$|E
25|$|The Uranium Mill <b>Tailings</b> Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) was {{designed}} to establish programs for the stabilization and control of mill <b>tailings</b> of uranium or thorium mill sites, both active and inactive, {{in order to prevent}} or minimize, among other things, the diffusion of radon into the environment. Title II of the act gives the NRC regulatory and licensing authority over mill tailing at sites under NRC license on or after January 1, 1978.|$|E
25|$|Economic 'development' {{based on}} the {{extractive}} industries carries difficult consequences for local communities. There has been much contention around river <b>tailings</b> in the vast Fly River, submarine <b>tailings</b> from the new Ramu-Nickel-cobalt mine, commencing exports in late 2012 (after a delay from landowner-led court challenges), and from proposed submarine mining in the Bismarck Sea (by Nautilus Minerals). One major project conducted through the PNG Department for Community Development suggested that other pathways to sustainable development should be considered.|$|E
25|$|Mine dumps (<b>tailings)</b> {{could produce}} acid mine {{drainage}} which can seep into waterways and aquifers, with consequences on ecological and human health.|$|E
25|$|The Williamson diamond mine {{is a large}} {{open pit}} mine {{currently}} about 90 meters (300ft) deep. Diamond mining operations at the Williamson diamond mine are composed of four distinct activities: mining of the pit, re-treatment of <b>tailings</b> to recover missed diamonds, and gravel mining both on the property and adjacent to the property where gravel has been alluvially deposited. The open pit mining and <b>tailings</b> re-treatment are {{the largest of the}} four operations. The mine employs about 1,100 staff, mostly Tanzanians.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Congress {{passed the}} Uranium Mill <b>Tailings</b> Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA), a measure {{designed}} {{to assist in}} the cleanup of 22 inactive ore-processing sites throughout the southwest. This also included constructing 19 disposal sites for the <b>tailings,</b> which contain a total of 40 million cubic yards of low-level radioactive material. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are 4000 mines with documented uranium production, and another 15,000 locations with uranium occurrences in 14 western states, most found in the Four Corners area and Wyoming.|$|E
25|$|Under the Act, the DOE {{established}} the Uranium Mill <b>Tailings</b> Remedial Action (UMTRA) Project {{to monitor the}} cleanup of uranium mill <b>tailings.</b> The UMTRCA gave the NRC regulatory authority over the cleanup and licensing of mill tailing facilities at sites under NRC license. The EPA had the task of developing cleanup strategies and recording standards for mills. The UMTRA used on-site disposal methods for eleven of the mills, while excavating and disposing of the wastes found at the remaining thirteen sites to remote off-site disposal locations owned by the DOE.|$|E
25|$|An {{encounter}} with a comet tail happened again in 1999 when Ulysses flew through the ion <b>tailings</b> of C/1999 T1 (McNaught-Hartley). A coronal mass ejection carried the cometary material to Ulysses.|$|E
25|$|Site-specific {{baseline}} data and scientific studies of potential {{environmental and social}} effects have been and are being conducted by the project operators and their consultants. These studies address water quality and other concerns. Among these are: potential Acid mine drainage - the chemical stability and weathering products of the <b>tailings</b> (waste rock) removed from the mine and of the newly exposed and blast-fractured rocks within the proposed mine; seismic risks to the impoundment systems designed to contain the <b>tailings</b> and to control their chemical behavior; {{and the effects of}} road and bridge construction on fish habitat.|$|E
25|$|This {{also gave}} the DOE the {{responsibility}} of stabilizing, disposing, and controlling uranium mill <b>tailings</b> and other contaminated material at twenty-four uranium mill processing sites located across ten states and at approximately 5,200 associated properties.|$|E
25|$|Locally, mine {{reclamation}} {{and dealing}} with mine <b>tailings</b> that cause acid mine drainage left over from mine closures {{is a major problem}} and is likely to cost {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} to clean up.|$|E
25|$|Cyanidation of <b>tailings</b> {{commenced}} on the Croydon Goldfield in 1894. The Croydon Consols cyaniding plant operated between 1897 and 1904, {{during which}} period 9,500 tons of <b>tailings</b> were treated for a yield of 7,000 ounces of gold bullion. In 1897 the plant comprised one 12hp steam engine, ten vats each of 50 tons each, two sumps each of 50 tons, two solution vats each of 50 tons, four recovery boxes and six pumps, the whole valued at £3,000. It was reduced in 1901 to a 6hp steam engine, four 40 ton vats, two sumps each 3,960 gallons, one solution vat of 4,000 gallons capacity, two recovery boxes and a pump, valued at £1,500.|$|E
25|$|Introduced {{species and}} {{pollution}} presents {{a serious problem}} to some freshwater regions in New Guinea. For example, Lake Sentani (near Jayapura city) and Lake Wanam (near Lae city) have four and one endemic fish species respectively, but these are now seriously threatened. <b>Tailings</b> from mines has also polluted several rivers, including the Porgera River (Porgera Gold Mine), Strickland River (Porgera Gold Mine), Auga River (Tolukuma Mine), Ok Tedi River (Ok Tedi Mine), Fly River (Porgera Gold Mine and Ok Tedi Mine), Otomina River (Grasberg mine) and Ajkwa River (Grasberg mine). The Ok Tedi and Grasberg mines alone {{account for more than}} half the yearly <b>tailings</b> dumped into water by major mining operations worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Samarco: a {{joint-venture}} with Vale S.A. (50% ownership each). It {{is responsible}} for the worst environmental disaster in the history of mining in Brazil: the collapse of two iron ore <b>tailings</b> dams in Bento Rodrigues, a subdistrict of Mariana.|$|E
25|$|The {{health effects}} {{discovered}} from radon exposure in unventilated uranium mining prompted the switch away from uranium mining via tunnel underground mining towards open cut and In-situ leaching technology, {{a method of}} extraction that does not produce the same occupational hazards, or mine <b>tailings,</b> as conventional mining.|$|E
