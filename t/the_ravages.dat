5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 1340s, little {{remained}} of Ivan Alexander's initial successes. John VI Kantakouzenos' Turkish allies pillaged parts of Bulgarian Thrace in 1346, 1347, 1349, 1352 and 1354, to which were added <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of the Black Death. The Bulgarians' attempts to repel the invaders met with repeated failure, and Ivan Alexander's third son and co-emperor, Ivan Asen IV, was killed in battle against the Turks in 1349, as was his older brother Michael Asen IV in 1355 or a little earlier.|$|E

5|$|From {{the classic}} {{language}} {{to the present}} day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events.

A few marital alliances between Christian rulers and the Mongols of the Golden Horde continued, such as when the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a (d. 1312) and later to his successor Uzbek (1312–1341).|$|E
5|$|The Great Wall of China visible today largely {{dates from}} the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often {{extending}} its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.|$|E

5|$|At the time, he had {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Spanish authorities, since Betances gave last priority of medical treatment to those Spanish-born military rank and officers who were affected by the disease (they demanded preferential and immediate treatment, and he openly despised them for it). For his hard work to save many Puerto Ricans from <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of the cholera epidemic of 1856, Betances was commended by the city's government. However, when the central government established a Chief Surgeon post for the city, Betances (who was the acting chief surgeon) was passed over, {{in favor of a}} Spanish newcomer.|$|E
5|$|Edward III (13 November 1312– 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 {{until his}} death; he is noted for his {{military}} success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, EdwardII. EdwardIII transformed the Kingdom of England {{into one of}} the most formidable military powers in Europe. His long reign of 50 years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament—as well as <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and pollutants in seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, the GWR returned to direct government control, {{and by the end}} of the war a Labour government was in power and again planning to nationalise the railways. After a couple of years trying to recover from <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of war, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. The Great Western Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two more years, being formally wound up on 23 December 1949. GWR designs of locomotives and rolling stock continued to be built for a while and the region maintained its own distinctive character, even painting for a while its stations and express trains in a form of chocolate and cream.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} renewal {{of the civil war}} in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E
5|$|In Antigone, {{the protagonist}} is Oedipus' daughter, Antigone. She {{is faced with}} the choice of {{allowing}} her brother Polyneices' body to remain unburied, outside the city walls, exposed to <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of wild animals, or to bury him and face death. The king of the land, Creon, has forbidden the burial of Polyneices for he was a traitor to the city. Antigone decides to bury his body and face the consequences of her actions. Creon sentences her to death. Eventually, Creon is convinced to free Antigone from her punishment, but his decision comes too late and Antigone commits suicide. Her suicide triggers the suicide of two others close to King Creon: his son, Haemon, who was to wed Antigone, and his wife, Eurydice, who commits suicide after losing her only surviving son.|$|E

5|$|In the {{historical}} 1931 census preceding World War II, 78.1% of Cracovians declared Polish {{as their primary}} language, with Yiddish or Hebrew at 20.9%, Ukrainian 0.4%, German 0.3%, and Russian 0.1%. <b>The</b> <b>ravages</b> of history have greatly reduced the percentage of ethnic minorities living in Kraków. The official and unofficial numbers differ, {{as in the case}} of Romani people. Hence, according to the 2002 census, among those who have declared their national identity (irrespective of language and religion) in Kraków Voivodeship, 1,572 were Slovaks, followed by Ukrainians (472), Jews (50) and Armenians (22). Romani people, officially numbered at 1,678, are estimated at over 5,000. Statistics collected by the Ministry of Education reveal that, even though only 1% of adults (as per above) officially claim minority status, as many as 3% of students participate in programmes designed for ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|Nikola of Hodimir and Pribislav of Malduč claimed bail in May 1239 for the Omišani {{who murdered}} Dubrovnik nobleman Grubeša and looted his ship. They {{also agreed to}} pay {{compensation}} for personal property that had been looted. In Omiš during the same year, knez Nikola and his relatives made peace between Zachlumia and Split, agreeing to pay for damage {{earlier in the year}} when Malduš nephew Toljen ravaged Split. However, compensation for <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of Toljen was not paid, leading to conflict in the following year. After an unsuccessful attack on Omiš, the Split army captured Brač {{in the first half of}} 1240. The conflict continued until the peace agreement by which the brothers of Osor left the ships to Split and renounced looting. This was also the time period of the Split potestas Gargano, and Malduč sons Pribislav and Osor in Hvar and Brač.|$|E
5|$|In the beginning, {{there was}} only Primus, the god of light and creation, who had been brought forth by Cybertron itself as the {{counterpart}} to another, unnamed being. Deeming that his power was too great to be contained by himself alone, he split his potency into five beings, including of course himself, and also Solomus, who possessed great wisdom; Epistemus, who was a fount of knowledge; Adaptus, who could alter his shape into an infinity of forms; and Mortilus, the embodiment of death, the necessary end of life. For a time, these five entities, known as the Guiding Hand, led life on Cybertron to heights of harmony and creation, but eventually Mortilus tried to {{change the course of}} life so that the Cybertronians would become a Universe-conquering army. What followed was a veritable war of the gods, which ended in tragedy and devastation. Mortilus himself perished, but not before dealing severe and irreversible damage to {{the other members of the}} Guiding Hand. On the verge of death, Primus withdrew into the planet itself, communicating from then on through the supercomputer Vector Sigma; while the other three only survive as relics which are essential to the Cybertronian race. Solomus' essence had been imprisoned by Mortilus in a crystal container, but he managed to change it into a vessel which would let those who were worthy partake of his undying wisdom. In this form he is known as the Matrix of Leadership, which also provides a link to Primus and thus to life itself. Epistemus and Adaptus had been shred down to their very cores, but now became the first blueprints for the two most basic components of all Cybertronians from then on, namely the brain module and the transformation cog. With the death of Mortilus himself, a Cybertronian's life force would be immune to <b>the</b> <b>ravages</b> of time, rendering them effectively immortal.|$|E
