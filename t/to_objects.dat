5|$|A {{planetary}}-mass object (PMO), planemo, or planetary body is {{a celestial}} object with a mass that falls {{within the range of}} the definition of a planet: massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (to be rounded under its own gravity), but not enough to sustain core fusion like a star. By definition, all planets are planetary-mass objects, but the purpose of this term is to refer <b>to</b> <b>objects</b> that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include dwarf planets, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to clear their own orbit, the larger moons, and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system (rogue planets) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs).|$|E
5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due <b>to</b> <b>objects</b> in resonances with Neptune. They find that this pattern would be best explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and note that a number of these objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances if that object had semi-major axis of ≈700 AU.|$|E
50|$|Typically, a {{party has}} the right <b>to</b> <b>object</b> in court <b>to</b> a line of {{questioning}} or at {{the introduction of a}} particular piece of evidence. If the party fails <b>to</b> <b>object</b> in a timely fashion, he is deemed to have waived his right <b>to</b> <b>object</b> and cannot raise the objection on appeal. This is a form of implied consent.|$|R

5|$|Any {{class that}} {{fulfills}} the allocator requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for an object of type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) <b>to</b> <b>objects</b> of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, Waseda University {{initiated}} the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale intelligent humanoid robot, or android. Its limb control system {{allowed it to}} walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions <b>to</b> <b>objects</b> using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.|$|E
5|$|Revelation {{features}} several gameplay enhancements {{that aid}} puzzle solving and plot progression. Early in the game, players receive a camera, {{which can be}} used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to jot down notes instead of having to write down clues as with previous Myst games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached <b>to</b> <b>objects.</b> Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via a menu {{on the bottom of the}} game screen.|$|E
50|$|Unlike copyright, {{moral rights}} {{may not be}} {{assigned}} to another. However they can be waived. The right <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> false attribution of a work expires 20 years after a person's death.

5|$|The {{downside}} to the CSBS {{was that the}} settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared <b>to</b> <b>objects</b> on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners {{have been found}} to map novel labels <b>to</b> <b>objects</b> more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E
25|$|Variable {{pointers}} {{and references}} to a base class type in C++ can also refer <b>to</b> <b>objects</b> of any derived classes of that type. This allows arrays {{and other kinds}} of containers to hold pointers <b>to</b> <b>objects</b> of differing types (references cannot be directly held in containers). This enables dynamic (run-time) polymorphism, where the referred objects can behave differently depending on their (actual, derived) types.|$|E

50|$|Looking Cloud appealed his conviction. In the appeal, {{filed by}} {{attorney}} Terry Gilbert, who replaced his trial attorney Tim Rensch, Looking Cloud retracted his videotaped confession, {{saying that it}} was false. He appealed based on the grounds that his trial counsel Rensch was ineffective in failing <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the introduction of the videotaped statement, that he failed <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> hearsay statements of Anna Mae Aquash, failed <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> hearsay instruction for the jury, and failed <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> leading questions by the prosecution to Robert Ecoffey. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied Looking Cloud's appeal. On August 19, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the judgment of conviction. Richard Two Elk, adopted brother of Looking Cloud; Troy Lynn Yellow Wood, former AIM chairman John Trudell, and Aquash's daughters Denise and Debbie Maloney were other witnesses who testified at the trial that Looking Cloud had separately confessed his involvement to them prior to any indictments or arrests.|$|R
