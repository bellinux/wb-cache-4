Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) and Les (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell closes the door.

5|$|The first mass exterminations at Auschwitz {{took place}} in early September 1941, when 900 inmates were killed by {{gathering}} them {{in the basement of}} Block 11 and gassing them with Zyklon B. This building proved unsuitable for mass gassings, so the site of the killings was moved to the crematorium at Auschwitz I (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942). There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once. In order to keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo disinfection and de-lousing. They were ordered <b>to</b> <b>undress</b> outside and then were locked in the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a gas chamber, the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an air raid shelter for the SS. The gas chamber and crematorium were reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on site. Some 60,000 people were killed at Crematorium I.|$|E
5|$|Abi and Babe {{discover}} that Ben's half sister Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) {{has been using}} Phil's credit card, so they force her to return everything she has bought. Babe asks Abi for a favour, but Abi realises that Babe has already assumed that she would say yes, so calls Babe a user. As revenge, Babe sends Ben a letter, telling him of the fake pregnancy. Louise finds the letter and blackmails Abi, telling her to move away with Ben. Abi tries to persuade Ben into moving but he refuses, saying {{he needs to be}} there for alcoholic Phil, and Abi tells Louise that Ben will always believe his girlfriend over his sister. Abi tells Babe that she is worried that Ben will find out, so Babe suggests that Abi tells Ben the truth. However, Abi allows Louise to continue using Phil's credit card. Later, Abi catches Ben and Louise arguing and assumes it is over the letter, and she inadvertently reveals she was never pregnant, but Ben was referring to Phil's credit card. In The Vic, Ben gets drunk and kisses Abi in the toilets and starts <b>to</b> <b>undress</b> her, but then drags her into the pub in her underwear and reveals via the karaoke microphone that she made up her pregnancy. Abi is humiliated and is taken to Dot Branning's (June Brown) house by her uncle Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), however, an enraged Phil takes her away in his car, but is stopped by Jay, who insists that enough people have been hurt. When Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) confesses to killing Lucy, Max is released, but refuses to see Abi or Lauren.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins <b>to</b> <b>undress,</b> the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts <b>to</b> <b>undress</b> and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E

25|$|Outcomes have {{generally}} indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The {{main reason for}} this detrimental effect {{is the issue of}} body image. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to be thin, the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, boys may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal <b>to</b> <b>undress</b> for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.|$|E
25|$|Victims usually {{arrived at}} the camps by train. Almost all arrivals at the Operation Reinhard camps of Treblinka, Sobibór, and Bełżec were sent {{directly}} to the gas chambers, with individuals occasionally selected to replace dead workers. At Auschwitz, the camp officials usually subjected individuals to selections, {{and some of the}} new arrivals deemed fit to work were sent to slave labour. Those selected for death at all camps were told <b>to</b> <b>undress</b> and hand their valuables to camp workers. They were then herded naked into the gas chambers. To prevent panic, they told these were showers or delousing chambers. The procedure at Chełmno was slightly different. Victims there were placed in a mobile gas van and asphyxiated, while being driven to prepared burial pits in the nearby forests. There the corpses were unloaded and buried.|$|E

40|$|AIM: The present work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of the}} antimicrobial nano Ag/polypropylene (PP) dressing on incisional wound healing on the experimental level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male albino rats were divided into, control, PP/Ag dressing, Silver Sulfadiazine (Ag-SD) cream, blank PP dressing and undressed groups. Animals were sacrificed after 5, 10 and 15 days of incisional wound event. RESULTS: Reduction was found in incision wound length in PP/Ag dressed rats, Ag-SD cream treated rats, and blank PP dressed rats after 5, 10 and 15 days compared <b>to</b> <b>undressed</b> rats. Skin of PP/Ag group showed less adverse histopathological changes, enhanced granulation tissue formation, enhanced angiogenesis, accelerated re-epithelialization and quick complete healing; compared to all other groups. Significant decrease in TGF-β level was recorded in PP and Ag-SD cream groups as compared to blank PP group on day 5. While, significant decrease in TGF-β level was detected in PP group when compared with undressed and blank PP groups on day 10. TGF-β showed significant in PP group as compared <b>to</b> <b>undressed,</b> Ag-SD cream and blank PP groups on day 15. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that PP/Ag dressing enhances, promotes and {{plays an important role in}} wound healing...|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} {{events is}} based on the verdict of the court: On their way home from the lake, the girls ran into the two assailants, Viggo Kristiansen and Jan Helge Andersen, who had been bicycling around the area looking for potential victims. They were lured by Kristiansen, who pretended to be looking for lost kittens, up to a more secluded part of the terrain. At the trial, the court established that both girls were at this point first ordered <b>to</b> <b>undress,</b> then sexually assaulted by Kristiansen. Andersen contributed to this act by subduing the girls, as well as later sexually molesting Sørstrønen. After Kristiansen had raped Sløgedal Paulsen, he killed her by stabbing her three times, once in the abdomen/chest and two times in the neck, severing her right carotid artery.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in burlesque theater, {{the modern}} popular form of strip theater can {{minimize}} {{the interaction of}} customer and dancer, reducing the importance of tease in the performance in favor of speed <b>to</b> <b>undress.</b> Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. Less formal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will. Featured entertainers are not usually part of the rotation and they generally have set times when they will perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a DJ is present, {{he or she will}} emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to expect in future sets.|$|E
