25|$|When a simply {{supported}} beam is loaded in flexure, the top side is in compression, and the bottom side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and <b>tension</b> <b>flange,</b> but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E

Five rectangular beams and one T-beam were tested to failure under four-point bending. The measured load versus strain in GFRP plate, steel rebar, extreme compression fiber of concrete, and the load versus deflection for the section at midspan {{of the beams}} are plotted and compared to the predicted values. The {{results indicate that the}} flexural strength of RC beams can be signif-icantly increased by gluing GFRP plates to the tension face. In addition, the epoxy bonded plates improved the cracking behavior of the beams by delaying the for-mation of visible cracks and reducing crack widths at higher load levels...|$|R

Beams were not naturally or artificially corroded or notched but they were in good conditions before testing. The mid-span deflection and the strain along the whole CFRP lamina were recorded as function of the applied loading. The main objective of the experimental programme was the evaluation of the force transfer mechanism, the increment of the beam load carrying capacity and the bending stiffness.

Section loss due to corrosion has been simulated artificially by cutting part of the flange or the web, or machining the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> to a reduced thickness throughout the entire span. Fatigue cracks have been simulated by introducing partial or complete saw cut in the steel flange thickness. Another method of introducing an artificial damage is by loading the steel girder beyond yielding and then unloading. Liu et al. (2001) studied the effect of repairing damaged non-composite I-beams using HM-CFRP plate. The <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> of the damaged beams was completely cut. Their {{results indicated that the}} repaired specimens did not recover the total strength of the control intact specimen. The failure mode of specimen with full length repair was due to a gradual debonding of the CFRP laminate which initiated at mid-span and extended to the end as the load increased. Tavakkolizadeh and Saadatmanesh (2003) and (Al-Saidy et al. 2004) examined the effect of repairing partial cutting of the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> of composite beams using SM-CFRP sheets and HM-CFRP plates, respectively. Tavakkolizadeh and Saadatmanesh (2003) indicated that the repaired specimens did not recover the total strength of the intact specimen. Also their results showed that the girder having 25  % loss in <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> failed by rupture of CFRP. On {{the other hand}} the girder having 50  % loss in <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> failed by crushing of the concrete slab, followed by a limited debonding of the CFRP laminate at mid-span. In the case of the girder having 100  % loss in <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> complete debonding of CFRP laminate occurred. Al-Saidy et al. (2004) showed that repairing the girders using HM-CFRP plates was able to fully restore the strength of the original undamaged girders. The CFRP debonding mode of failure was not observed in their study and only crushing of the concrete slab or rupture of the CFRP plates was reported. Shaat (2007) studied the effect of repairing the damage composite steel beams by bonding SM-CFRP or HM-CFRP sheets on the bottom side of the tension steel flange and on both the bottom and top sides of the <b>tension</b> <b>flange.</b> The steel tension flanges were completely cut at mid-span to represent a severe section loss in bridge girders.

Because of this, rail overpass bridges are very often {{in the form of}} half-through girders, in which the headroom limita tion requires that the I-section beams that form the half-through girders are loaded {{at the level of the}} <b>tension</b> <b>flange,</b> rather than at the compression flange level in more conventi onal bridges. Half-through girder bridges are in general comprised of two parallel I-secti on beams joined by a concrete deck at the bottom/tension flange level as ill ustrated in Figure 1. Loading the beam at the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> level through the deck results in the top flange being subjected to compression, and the top flange is not braced against overall buckling. The compression flange of the I-section is restrained only by the stif fness of the usually flexible web and the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> is provided with continuous torsional restrain t through its connection to the concrete deck.

40|$|In recent years, carbon-fibre-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) {{laminates}} {{have been}} used in the repair and/or strengthening of existing steel structures. One advantage of using CFRP is its high tensile strength and stiffness compared with its low self-weight. This paper describes the research of strengthening steel structures with CFRP laminates under static conditions and comprises both laboratory tests and simplified analytical methods for predicting the capacity of steel girders strengthened with bonded CFRP laminates. The analytical solutions consist of calculation of bending capacity, normal stress distribution over the cross-section and interfacial shear stresses. By bonding CFRP laminates to the <b>tensioned</b> <b>flange</b> of a steel girder, it is possible to increase the moment capacity. The forces which are acting over the strengthened section, will cause interfacial stresses in the bond line. These interfacial stresses may cause debonding between the steel substrate and the laminate why these stresses must be considered in the design process. Simplified analyses were performed using Matlab to calculate the difference in stiffness and moment capacity depending on quantity and stiffness of the applied laminates. These solutions are based upon equilibrium statements over the section. The simplified analyses show {{that it is possible to}} increase the moment capacity by using bonded CFRP laminates to steel girders to a level of 20 %, see Figure 1. By using developed simplified solution described above, it is also possible to calculate to which extend the steel section has reached yielding. The solution shows for studied cross-section that a maximum increase in terms of the moment capacity is about 20 %, and, as a result, nearly the whole cross-section will be in compression. Tension will almost only be transmit by the CFRP laminate. To increase the moment capacity further, strengthening has to be made on the compressed area. Also, interfacial shear stresses in the bond line for the studied beams were calculated using an existing solution for calculation of interfacial stresses for arbitrary substrates. (Graph Presented) With results from the analytical solutions laboratory tests were conducted. The test specimens consist of CFRP laminates and epoxies of different material properties, which were attached to the <b>tensioned</b> <b>flange</b> of undistorted steel beams wifh H-shaped cross-sections. All beams were sand blasted cleaned and coated with a primer directly afterward. When the primer had cured, the epoxy was applied to the CFRP laminate and then bonded to the steel substrate by a hard roller. At the ends, the redundant epoxy was tapered shaped to reduce the stresses. The strengthened beams were tested in static four points bending where load-deformation of the beam and strain both in the steel section and the laminate was recorded. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Corrugated {{steel web}} with {{inherent}} high out-of-plane stiffness has a promising application in configuring large span highway bridge girders. Due to the irregularity of the configuration details, the local stress concentration poses a major fatigue {{problem for the}} welded flange plates of {{high strength low alloy}} structural steels. In this work, the methods of applying CFRP laminate and shot peening onto the surfaces of the <b>tension</b> <b>flanges</b> were employed with the purpose of improving the fatigue strength of such configuration details. The effectiveness of this method in the improvement of fatigue strength has been examined experimentally. Test results show that the shot peening significantly increases hardness and roughness in contrast to these without treatment. Also, it has beneficial effects on the fatigue strength enhancement when compared against the test data of the joints with CFRP strengthening. The stiffness degradation during the loading progress is compared with each treatment. Incorporating the stress acting on the constituent parts of the CFRP laminates, a discussion is made regarding the mechanism of the retrofit and related influencing factors such as corrosion and economic cost. This work could enhance the understanding of the CFRP and shot peening in repairing such welded details and shed light on the reinforcement design of welded joints between corrugated steel webs and flange plates...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation of end plate connections of various thicknesses welded to 10 WF 21 and 12 WF 27 beams and connected to various stiffened and unstiffened 8 WF columns are reported. Moment-rotation curves have been obtained for all connections tested and these have been compared {{to determine the effects}} on connection performance of the parameters of end plate thickness, column section, and column stiffener plates. Yield beam lines, representing first yield in a uniformly loaded beam, were drawn to obtain the connection moment at the yield beam line. The value of this moment indicated that the connections behaved semi-rigidly and was used in the comparison of various connections. It was observed that the thicker the end plate, the more rigid the connection and the greater the effect of column stiffeners on the rigidity of the connection. For an end plate connection of a particular width and depth connected to a particular column, there is a limiting moment which such a connection can sustain at the yield beam line, regardless of the thickness of end plate used. This limiting effect is due to deformation of the column section, specifically, of the column flange. Column stiffener plates increased the rigidity of all connections primarily by restraining the deformation of the column flanges adjacent to the <b>tension</b> <b>flanges</b> beams. Column stiffeners prevented column web bucking, however the column web buckles which developed in these tests were initiated at rotations greatly exceeding those expected in structural forms...|$|R

Deterioration in steel structures occurs due to excessive service load, fatigue damage or environmental contribution (corrosion). The researches efforts in this field generally focused on repairing naturally deteriorated steel structure elements or repairing artificially damaged steel structure elements. In 1996, two I-girders were removed from an old and deteriorated bridge. The two girders had uniform corrosion along their length and this corrosion mostly concentrated within the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> and the webs of the girders were not severely corroded.

Light-weight cold-formed steel channel sections along with fire resistive plasterboards are used to construct light gauge steel frame floor systems to provide the required fire resistance rating. However, simply adding more plasterboard layers is not an efficient method to increase FRR. Hence this research focuses on using joists with improved joist section profiles such as hollow flange sections to increase the structural capacity of floor systems under fire conditions and thus their FRR. In this research, the structural and thermal behaviour of LSF floor systems made of LiteSteel Beams with different plasterboard and insulation configurations was investigated using four full scale tests under standard fires. Based on the ultimate failure load of the floor joist at ambient temperature, transient state fire tests were conducted for different Load Ratios. These fire tests showed that the new LSF floor system has improved the FRR well above that of those made of lipped channel sections. The joist failure was predominantly due to local buckling of LSB compression flanges near mid-span with severe yielding of <b>tension</b> <b>flanges.</b> Fire tests have provided valuable structural and thermal performance data of tested floor systems that included time-temperature profiles, and failure times and temperatures.

The connection is comprised of T-stubs connecting the top and bottom flanges of the beam to the face of the column and channels connecting the T-stubs to a backplate at the back face of the hollow section column. The addition of the channels to a standard T-stub connection helps to distribute the beam <b>flange</b> <b>tension</b> load to the back face of the hollow section column thus reducing demand on the flexible column face which often will compromise the stiffness of the connection.

30|$|Design errors, corrosion, lack {{of proper}} maintenance, sub-standard materials, fatigue damage and vehicle-caused {{accidental}} damage are considered {{as the major}} problems in the steel structures (Kim and Yoon 2010). Fatigue damage induces cracks in the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> of the girders and {{it is critical to}} the service life of the girders (May et al. 2016; Zhu 2016; Fisher and Roy 2015). Corrosion reduces steel sections that can cause deterioration in steel structures. Various researches investigated the influence of the corrosion and fatigue damage on the behavior of steel structures and they also presented different methods to retrofit these steel elements. In these researches, the structural steel element may be naturally deteriorated or artificially damaged. Gillespie et al. (1996) studied two full-scale I-girders. The two girders were removed from an old and deteriorated bridge and they have 9754  mm long, 610  mm deep. The flange has 229  mm wide. A uniform corrosion occurred {{along the length of the}} specimen. The corrosion concentrated within the bottom flange and the webs of the beams were not corroded. 40 % reduction of the lower flange created these deteriorations. This corrosion caused a 29 % reduction in the beam stiffness. Liu et al. (2001) carried out on wide steel beams with 2438  mm span three-point bending tests. In their studied, the tension flanges of specimens were completely cut. Their results indicated that this damage causes decreasing the maximum load of the intact beam from 200 to 106  kN. Shaat (2007) and Eltaly (2016) completely cut the bottom flanges of wide beams and box beams, respectively, at mid-span to simulate a severe section loss in the steel beams. Shaat (2007) concluded that the flexural strength and stiffness of the girders was reduced by 60 and 54 %, respectively. Eltaly (2016) indicated that the strength of notched beam was dropped by 34 %. Tavakkolizadeh and Saadatmanesh (2001) estimated the effect of partial cutting of the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> using different depths of the cut (shallow and deep). These cutting simulated 80 and 40 % losses in the area of the flange for the deep and shallow cutting depth, respectively. The difference between deep and shallow cuts was the ductility loss in the case of deep cut. Tavakkolizadeh and Saadatmanesh (2003) tested composite girders with the partial cutting of the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> to simulate 25, 50, and 100 % loss of its tensile capacity. Kim and Brunell (2011) conducted an experimental program to estimate the effect of the notch level in the beam web at mid-span of the steel beams. Shulley et al.

TITLE: VERIFICATION OF SHEAR LAG IN LONGITUDINALLY WELDED TENSION MEMBERS. MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. J. Kent Hsiao, Ph. D., P. E. (CA), S. E. (UT) Tension members are used broadly as bracing members in buildings and truss. When double channels or double tees are welded to a gusset plate, stresses are distributed non-uniformly in connected members since {{only a part}} of its cross-section is connected. Shear lag factor describes this phenomenon. The main objective {{of this study is to}} verify shear lag factor of tension steel members with welded connections using the finite element computer analysis and the current design Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC 2010). The provision for calculating shear lag factor, U, is given by AISC Specification as 1 -x ̅/L for angles, tees, channels and wide <b>flange</b> <b>tension</b> members. Weld size and length of the weld are the main parameters studied here. The current AISC design provision over-estimates the design tensile strength of double channel shapes. While, for WT Shapes it under-estimates one. The increase in weld size and decrease in weld length shows slight change in shear lag factor. Comparison is also made with the equation proposed by Fortney and Thornton (2012). The equation under-estimates the design tensile strength of both sections...|$|R
40|$|The use of FRP {{profiles}} {{is appropriate}} and advantageous {{for construction of}} industrial and low-rise residential buildings as well as temporary structures built in emergency situations. But for FRP composite structures to be competitive with structures made of traditional materials, they must be safe, serviceable, durable and economical. Structural safety and serviceability depend on the structural members’, {{as well as on}} their joints’ or connections’, strength and stiffness. Currently, the connections in FRP structures are commonly made using bolted connections [1 - 2], akin to those used in steel structures while, as stipulated in a recent European guideline [3], bonded connections are not allowed for primary load bearing components. Figure 1. a) Connection tested in [4], b) new connection. With respect to bonded beam-to-column moment resisting connections, the authors in a recent paper [4] demonstrated that this prohibition appears to be unjustified. An identical pultruded GFRP I-profile was used to form the beam and the column elements. The two elements were connected by epoxy adhesive, and GFRP seat angles, bonded to the column compression flange and the beam <b>tension</b> and compression <b>flanges.</b> In addition, stiffeners were used in the connection region to strengthen the column flange and web. The beam, acting as a cantilever, was loaded by a point load near its free end, which subjected the connection to combined bending and shear. The connection (Figure 1 a) failed by debonding within the adhesive, achieving nearly the same percentage of the GFRP profile ultimate moment capacity as in the best performing bolted connections tested by others. As a follow up to the previous work, in order to further enhance the forgoing connection strength and stiffness, in this study the column and the seating angle bonded to the beam tension face and the column are strapped together using a carbon wrap as depicted in Figure 2 b. The new connection is loaded identically to the previously tested connection, and, compared to the companion unwrapped connection, the results of the improved connection show increase in both the ultimate moment resistance and rotational stiffness. This improvement makes adhesive connections an even more appealing choice for practical applications. [1]	L. C. Bank, A. S. Mosallam, G. T.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to reduce a manufacturing complexity of bottom sheet metal parts by improving the accuracy of parts produced. This study is aimed at using the finite element analysis to prove assumptions that there is a transition frontier between the processes of forming and drawing, and there are capabilities to control springback effect by moving this frontier positions. The process, the stress-strain state of which in the dome corresponds to the process of forming parts, and in the flange area to the drawing process, was considered to be a formingdrawing process. Based on previous studies, techniques to reduce a springback have been proposed which enable us to use three calculation schemes for the process simulation: The frontier transition position control between the processes of forming and drawing by changing the contact pressure on the flange by varying the frictions coefficients on the die and binder surfaces; Springback manage through the additional tensile forces in the flange area of the blank; Springback manage through the technological insert at the first process stage. For ease of comparison with previous research results the same geometric parameters and material properties of the items are used in the simulation. The springback analysis used a finite element method in the AutoFormTM incremental module with automatically mashed and standard tolerance computation properties. The blank, binder, punch, and die were then imported to the module by CATIATM interface in. iges format. The calculation has shown that the optimal value for the least thinning and springback parts are available for the second scheme whereby ring punch makes additional <b>tension</b> in the <b>flange</b> area (from 1. 09 to 0. 35 mm with thinning from 0. 80 to 0. 73 mm). The use of flange retention of sheet blank at the expense of variable frictional forces showed the springback value reduction by 4 times (from 1. 09 to 0. 27 mm). However thinning was 16 % (from 0. 80 to 0. 63 mm). Application of the scheme with technological insert allowed us to achieve the least thinning of the blank material (from 0. 80 to 0. 75 mm), but with only 1. 8 -fold (from 1. 09 to 0. 69 mm) springback decrease. As a result, it is found that in bottoms manufacturing the most preferred in terms of the smallest springback is the predominate forming zone, and the position of the transition frontier between the forming and drawing processes should be behind the cutting line of flange. </p...|$|R
30|$|Initial {{pretension}} forces applied on models A 1 Po, FE 5, A 1 m, and FE 6 are 0, 20, 40, and 60  % of {{the ultimate}} strength of bolt, respectively, {{and all the other}} properties are kept similar. In Fig.  11, the vertical difference in between two similar lines such as short dash and short dash with solid circle defines the magnitude of prying force corresponding to the shear force (<b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> force) for each bolt. It can be observed in Fig.  11 a that bolt tensile forces of corresponding models starting from different levels of pretensioning get closer as external load increases, and ultimately meet in the same point. Thus, prying force near the ultimate level of loading is not affected by the magnitude of pretension force. At the higher level of loading, contact force due to pretensioning of bolts is entirely neutralized, and only prying force is retained.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new welding-based {{solution}} that significantly increases the rotation {{capacity of a}} stiffened welded knee joint between cold-formed rectangular hollow sections under opening moment. The proposed solution is more economical than the use of internal sleeves and {{can be applied to}} new as well as existing structures. The solution involves the use of extra layers of weld on the inner (<b>tension)</b> <b>flange</b> of a stiffened welded knee joint. Laboratory test results are presented to demonstrate that the solution enabled such a joint between DuraGal C 450 150 × 50 × 4 or 150 × 50 × 5 rectangular hollow sections manufactured to AS 1163 to satisfy the rotation capacity requirement specified for plastic design of steel frames. The reason why the new solution results in increased rotation capacities is explained in terms of strain redistribution and strain reduction in the tensile regions around the knee joints...|$|E
30|$|An {{experimental}} {{program and}} an analytical model using ANSYS program {{were employed to}} estimate the structural performance of repaired damaged steel beams using fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials. The beams were artificially notched in the tension flanges at mid-spans and retrofitted by FRP flexible sheets on the tension flanges and the sheets were extended to cover parts of the beams webs with different heights. Eleven box steel beams, including one intact beam, one notch damaged beam and nine notches damaged beam and retrofitted with composite materials, were tested in two-point loading up to failure. The parameters considered were the FRP type (GFRP and CFRP) and number of layers. The results indicated that bonding CFRP sheets to both of the tension steel flange {{and part of the}} webs, instead of the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> only, enhances the ultimate load of the retrofitted beams, avoids the occurrence of the debonding and increases the beam ductility. Also the numerical models give acceptable results in comparison with the experimental results.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of strengthening reinforced concrete beams with epoxy-bonded Glass-Fiber-Reinforced-Plastic (GFRP) plates. The composite plate is epoxy-bonded to the <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> of the beam to increase its stiffness and strength. Seven rectangular and one T-beam, retrofitted with composite plates, were tested to failure under symmetrical 4 -point bending. The load versus deflection and the load versus strain in the composite plate, steel rebar and the extreme compression fiber of concrete were measured and plotted for the midspan section throughout {{the entire range of}} loading up to failure. Analytical models based on the equilibrium of forces and compatibility of deformations were developed to predict the stresses and deformations of the beam in the linear and nonlinear regions. The predicted and measured results correlated well. The analytical models were used in a parametric study to investigate the effects of design variables such as, plate area, plate strength and stiffness, reinforcement ratio, etc., on the moment-curvature relationships of typical rectangular and T cross sections...|$|E
40|$|Research {{work has}} been {{conducted}} to study the effect of upgrading steel I-beams using carbon-fibre-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) plates bonded to the <b>tension</b> <b>flange.</b> The investigation comprised two sections; numerical analysis using Finite Element (FE) method and laboratory tests. The investigation was carried out as a parametric study where CFRP plates with different material and geometrical properties were used along with {{two different types of}} adhesive. The aim of the investigation was to study how various material properties of the strengthening material affect the behaviour of the strengthened steel I-beams. Additionally, the magnitude and distribution of the interfacial shear and peeling stresses in the strengthened beams were analysed. The results show that the moment capacity of the strengthened steel beam can be increased up to about 18 %. It was also shown that yielding of the steel beam in the area of maximum moment does not affect the interfacial stresses {{near the end of the}} bond line, until excessive yielding and formation of plastic hing...|$|E
40|$|Bridges {{that are}} {{classified}} as fracture critical by AASHTO require more frequent inspections than other types of bridges, resulting in greater costs for their maintenance. Several historical events have shown, however, that severe damage can occur to a bridge without necessarily resulting in its collapse. A primary objective of this research project was to characterize the redundancy that exists in twin steel box-girder bridges, which are widely used in Texas and {{are classified as}} fracture critical. The main goal of the research was to develop guidelines for modeling a bridge’s behavior {{in the event that}} a fracture of a critical <b>tension</b> <b>flange</b> takes place. The research carried out under this project included laboratory testing, experimental evaluation of a full-scale box-girder bridge, and detailed structural analyses. Data gathered from the experimental testing program were used to validate nonlinear finite element models as well as simplified engineering models. Based on the results of this research, engineers now have guidelines for modeling the response of twin steel box-girder bridges following the fracture of one of its girders. 17.
