5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with <b>their</b> <b>achievements</b> and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
