40|$|The {{theoretical}} modelling of chemically active transition metal (TM) centres is a notoriously difficult task. The metal-ligand interactions in these complexes are often highly directional and the concoction of suitable analytic interaction potentials can {{be far from}} trivial.

40|$|Heterocycles {{are present}} {{in more than half}} of organic compounds. For organic chemists, they are valued as {{synthetic}} targets or scaffolds to construct valuable products. For the past two decades, the Howell group has made contributions towards the synthesis and applications of 4 -membered heterocyclic compounds, such as oxetanes and beta-lactones. Most of the previously reported transformations that involve strained heterocyclic compounds rely on traditional methods in which rendering the reaction with good and predictable selectivity (regio-, chemo- and stereoselectivity) is challenging. The works described took advantage of the intrinsic reactivity of strained heterocycles and combined that with the highly selective transformations promoted by transition metal (<b>TM)</b> <b>catalysts.</b> Three successful methodologies were developed. Chapter 1 describes the discovery and scope of a novel Pt-catalyzed expansion of spirocyclopropyl oxetanes to synthetically useful 3 -methylenetetrahydrofurans. This unprecedented oxetane expansion was realized via cyclopropane activation under platinum catalysis. Mechanistic studies, through 13 C-labelling and 13 C-DEPT NMR analyses, suggested that the oxetane expansion was promoted by a regioselective carbon-carbon bond activation of cyclopropane with platinum. Chapter 2 describes two transition metal catalyzed transformations of alpha-methylene-beta-lactones. First is a Rh-catalyzed conjugate addition with aryl boronic acids to access various beta-lactones. beta-Lactones are highly privileged synthetic products and intermediates. They have been shown to elicit serine hydrolase inhibition. They are also used as intermediates to obtain difunctionalized acyclic compounds, and this was the goal in the next method. The second method developed involves a chemoselective opening of beta-lactones to form beta-hydroxy amides. Ring opening of beta-lactones with several nucleophiles typically provide a mixture of two major products; opening via the (a) alkyl C–O bond, or (b) the acyl C–O bond. The selective ring-opening was realized via activation of acyl carbon-oxygen bond under palladium catalysis. Under the developed conditions, several beta-lactones were selectively opened with various amine nucleophiles and gave beta-hydroxy amides as sole product. This method was also translated to a Pd-catalyzed asymmetric kinetic resolution of racemic to enantioenriched beta-lactones...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} oxidation using transition metals (TM) as the active material {{is an important}} technological process, which is still not fully understood. Recently, {{there has been an}} increasing awareness that the surface of the <b>TM</b> <b>catalysts</b> employed might be oxidized under the oxygen-rich conditions of the catalytic reaction (ambient pressures of O 2 and other reactant gases). The resulting changes in the composition and structure of the surface can then also strongly influence the catalytic activity of the material. In the present work the catalytic CO oxidation over the Pd(100) surface is studied as a model system. Recent experimental results for this system suggest that the Pd(100) surface might actually be oxidized under conditions as applied in industrial oxidation catalysis. However, it is still being discussed, if the observed oxidic phase is already a thick, bulk-like oxide film or a nanometer thin surface oxide layer, and if the actual active state of the catalyst under reaction conditions is then mainly dominated by a metallic or an oxidic phase. To address this topic from a theoretical point of view a multiscale modeling approach has been employed in this work. To describe the system quantitatively on an atomic (microscopic) level density-functional theory (DFT) has been used. The results of the DFT calculations have then been combined with concepts from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to transfer the information obtained in the microscopic regime to meso- and macroscopic length and time scales. In a first step the atomistic thermodynamics approach is used to obtain a large scale picture about the thermodynamic stability of different phases in a constrained thermodynamic equilibrium with an O 2 and CO gas phase (i. e., the formation of CO 2 is not considered). Focussing on temperature and pressure conditions representative of technological oxidation catalysis it is found that a thin surface oxide structure or a CO covered metal surface are the relevant system states under these conditions. In a second refining step the stability of the surface oxide structure under steadystate conditions is then investigated using kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, now explicitly taking into account the on-going CO 2 formation. The result is that despite the catalytic CO oxidation reaction the surface oxide on Pd(100) is still stable under stoichiometric p O 2 /p CO ratios in the gas phase at elevated temperatures. This indicates the importance of this surface oxide and calls for detailed studies evaluating its contribution to the overall catalytic activity...|$|R
40|$|In Pt-transition metal (<b>TM)</b> alloy <b>catalysts,</b> the {{electron}} transfer from the TM to Pt is retarded {{owing to the}} inevitable oxidation of the TM surface by oxygen.

Herein, we propose a novel synthesis strategy that selectively modifies {{the electron}}ic structure of surface Co atoms with N-containing polymers, resulting in highly active and durable PtCo nanoparticle catalysts useful for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The polymer, which is functionalized on carbon black, selectively interacts with the Co precursor, resulting in Co-N bond formation on the PtCo nanoparticle surface. Electron transfer from Co to Pt in the PtCo nanoparticles modified by the polymer is enhanced by the increase in the difference in electronegativity between Pt and Co compared with that in bare PtCo nanoparticles with the TM surface oxides. In addition, the dissolution of Co and Pt is prevented by the selective passivation of surface Co atoms and the decrease in the O-binding energy of surface Pt atoms. As a result, the catalytic activity and durability of PtCo nanoparticles for the ORR are significantly improved by the electronic ensemble effects.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth of}} world’s {{population and the}} increasing economic industrialization {{has led to an}} ever increasing demand to energy and goods. Simultaneously, we are confronted with a foreseeable depletion of cheap oil and sustainability issues for gas and coal conversion. These facts have stimulated the quest for renewable resources. Perhaps their major role as energy supplier may be questioned on the long term, but renewable feedstock for the manufacture of chemicals is not unrealistic. Keeping or using the original chemical functionality of the bio-based molecules may be advantageous in many cases, especially when the atom economy of the reaction to form the desired product is very high, or, in other words, when waste formation can be neglected. Besides the design and development of novel reaction technologies, chemo- and bio-catalysis will {{play a major role in}} that coming feedstock transition. This thesis focuses on the catalytic synthesis of short amines from renewable feedstock. Amines are a group of chemical compounds that contain nitrogen atoms. Their functionality such as polarity and nucleophilicity can be exploited in various ways, which is why they are produced on a large industrial scale. For instance, they are building blocks of polymers, surfactants, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and they are used as CO 2 absorbents or as catalysts, for instance for polyurethane synthesis. So far, industrial amines are produced from petrochemical resources like methanol (e. g. in case of MMA, DMA and TMA) and ethylene (e. g. in case of ethanolamines and ethylenediamines). Moreover, their synthesis procedures involve toxic, explosive and/or expensive chemicals and intermediates, therefore not in line with the green chemistry principles of tomorrows chemical industry. In this research, we looked for new, innovative catalytic processes for the safe and efficient production of short amines from carbohydrates. From a chemical point of view, these sugar structures are highly functional and therefore suitable as alternative carbon source for the production of chemicals. The cellulose building block, glucose, for instance contains one oxygen atom per carbon atom, comprising five alcohol groups and one carbonyl functional group. These C-O bonds, especially the carbonyl, are reactive towards a selectively transformation into C-N bonds via the different technologies that are available hereto. Catalysis plays a key role in achieving the reactions’ high selectively. Notwithstanding the undeniable importance of homogeneous catalysis in today’s chemical industry, solid catalysts offer several advantages, when compared to dissolved catalysts. They are separated more easily from the product mixture and allow for continuous processing. This research therefore focused on the exploration of heterogeneous catalytic processes. The first goal was to develop a new reaction route to produce short amines from carbohydrates. This process implies a cleavage of C-C bonds besides the formation of novel C-N bonds. Classic reaction types to split C-C bonds, like retro-aldol condensation and hydrogenolysis, are known to require a high reaction temperature, typically well above 200 °C, which leads to thermal degradation and thus low product selectivity. Inspired by the working mechanism of Aldolase enzymes, an efficient low-temperature chemocatalytic process was therefore developed. This process requires an amine (as the nitrogen source) and a metal catalyst and is carried out under hydrogen pressure at temperatures well below 150 °C. The amine is essential to cleave the C-C bond at the low temperature, while the metal activates hydrogen to hydrogenate unsaturated intermediates. This reductive aminolysis process thus converts reducing sugars efficiently into acyclic ethylenediamines, like N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), and ethanolamines, like N,N-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE). It was demonstrated that different primary and secondary amines reagents can be used in this novel catalytic process. The main reaction product was always the corresponding ethylenediamine. Selectivity up to 84 % could be achieved at full sugar conversion, even in absence of solvent. As an example, one of the obtained ethylenediamines, viz. N,N’-bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) -N,N’-dimethylethylenediamine (BHEDMEDA), was successfully esterified and quaternized. The resulting “diester diquat” surfactant has potential applications as detergent or fabric softener. The second part of this research unraveled the complex mechanism behind the reductive aminolysis process. The reaction mechanism was initially proposed, based on a kinetics and reactivity study and was further validated by a Density Functional Theory (DFT) study. The C-C cleavage that is observed occurs in a controlled fashion and is initiated after electron rearrangement within a zwitterionic iminium intermediate that is formed after nucleophilic amine attack at the reductive sugar end. DFT calculations confirmed that the reaction route involving the amine facilitated C-C scission is energetically the most favorable one. After scission, the commercial redox catalyst ensures an efficient hydrogenation of the resulting reactive, unsaturated retro-aldol fragments into stable short amines. This way, the thermodynamic equilibria are directed towards the desired intermediates and the targeted amines are ultimately obtained with high selectivity. To our delight, a (cheap) commercial silica supported nickel catalyst showed excellent performance to this end. Optimization of the process parameters afforded an excellent ethylenediamine product yield of 92 % at full sugar conversion, using the supported nickel catalyst. The reductive aminolysis is impacted by a peculiar solvent effect. The ethylenediamine yield increased significantly when the reductive aminolysis was carried out in methanol instead of tetrahydrofuran. This observation was confirmed by DFT calculations, demonstrating that the presence of methanol considerably lowers the energy barriers of the desired reaction steps, resulting in a faster and thus more selective formation of the desired ethylenediamine product. Reductive aminolysis thus allows for the efficient conversion of reducing sugars into the corresponding ethylenediamine at low temperature. However, the formation of corresponding ethanolamines via a similar mechanism is difficult, since selective enaminol hydrogenation mainly led to the corresponding glucamine, instead of the ethanolamine. The use of stoichiometric amount of the amine reagent on the other hand lowered the selectivity of the process. In the third part of this research, we therefore aimed for the development of an alternative, selective route to produce DMAE from a renewable carbon source, viz. ethylene glycol (EG), by using heterogeneous transition metal (<b>TM)</b> <b>catalysts.</b> DMAE is currently produced on an industrial scale from the reaction of dimethylamine (DMA) with ethylene oxide (EO) for its use as a surfactant building block. There are recent reports that describe excellent progress in the direct synthesis of EG from glucose and even cellulose. This motivates the strategy to produce of DMAE from EG. Recent technologies for the amination of EG as described in research literature use (expensive) homogeneous TM complexes that are difficult to separate from the product mixture. The use of heterogeneous <b>TM</b> <b>catalysts</b> (in the gas phase) mostly requires high reaction temperatures (> 200 °C) in order to activate the unreactive EG substrate. This ultimately results in low selectivity towards the corresponding ethanolamine. This work therefore proposes the use of a base (KOH) to stimulate the dehydrogenation of EG, allowing the conversion of EG into DMAE with high selectivity (94 %) at strongly reduced temperature, viz. 150 °C, using a commercial silica-alumina supported nickel catalyst. On top of the facilitation effect on dehydrogenation, the KOH directs the reaction to DMAE at the expense of TMEDA, resulting in the unique selectivity for this base-catalyzed process. status: publishe...|$|R

The importance of transition metals (TM) in catalysis was our motivation {{to work on}} the development of new empirical force fields and their applications.

Therefore, we parametrized the VALBOND TRANS force field by refining non-bonded parameters for a large test set of octahedral iridium(III) compounds. The optimized force field allowed a successful ranking of lowest-energy diastereomers and the performance of subsequent molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. Inspired by the natural process of the photosynthesis, Ir-catalysts are also relevant for the light-induced artifical oxidation of water leading to the synthesis of dioxygen.

40|$|Carbenes {{have played}} an {{important}} role as reactive intermediates in synthetic organic chemistry for many years. The isolation of stable versions of these important carbon species has resulted in an explosion of research and applications not only as ancillary ligands for transition metal (<b>TM)</b> based <b>catalysts,</b> but also as small molecule activators, and organocatalysts in their own right. One aspect of my work is exploration of the reactivity of bis(diisopropylamino) cyclopropenylidene (BAC) and cyclic(alkyl) (amino) carbenes (CAACs), first isolated by our group. Due to their unique steric and electronic properties, these species are perhaps the most distinct representatives of the carbene ligand set and as such allow the isolation of a variety of catalytically active TM complexes unobtainable by other routes and frequently different from their cyclic diamino carbene (NHCs) counterparts. Inspired by the novel reactivity of these new carbenes in TM chemistry, I have also explored the activation of heteroallenes using these species. Similarly to NHCs, CAACs and BACs react with carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide and to give the corresponding zwitterionic betaines. However, unlike NHCs, a second equivalent of CS 2 reacts with the BAC-CS 2 adduct leading to a bicyclic thieno[2, 3 -diamino]- 1, 3 -dithiole- 2 -thione, which results from a novel ring expansion process. Surprisingly, and also in contrast to NHCs, CAAC does not react with carbodiimide, whereas BAC exclusively gives a ring expanded product, analogous to that obtained with CS 2. The intermediate amidinate can be trapped, using a lithium tetrafluoroborate adduct of BAC as a carbene surrogate. In related work, I demonstrate that depending on their electronic and steric properties, stable singlet carbenes can react with white phosphorus at room temperature to yield P 4, P 3, P 2, and even P 1 fragments that are stabilized by the carbene moiety. Therefore, stable singlet carbenes can achieve the tasks that transition metals do with P 4, namely activation, aggregation, and importantly, fragmentation. The next challenge is to use the resulting adducts, to prepare useful organophosphorus derivatives. This would avoid the use of Cl 2 gas, which is important to meet the growing demand in phosphorus derivatives using environmentally friendly processes...|$|R
