2500|$|Carl Bianchi, then <b>the</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Director</b> of the Courts in Idaho, saw an {{opportunity}} to attach a modernization of the bicycle law onto the larger revision of the traffic code.

Addressing {{the concerns of the}} state's magistrates, who were concerned that [...] "technical violations" [...] of traffic control device laws by cyclists were cluttering the court, the draft also contained a provision that allowed cyclists to treat a stop sign as a yield sign—the so-called “rolling stop law.” The new bicycle law passed in 1982, despite objections among some cyclists and law enforcement officers.|$|E
2500|$|... “The {{perils of}} the state as patron of the arts” was the {{headline}} of a Washington Post editorial criticizing the Virginia Museum’s reaction to its own theater's premiere of Childe Byron. [...] In his commentary, staff writer Paul G. Edwards noted that America’s tradition of free speech and first amendment prohibition on governmental interference with public expression were challenged anew by the Virginia Museum trustees’ “obnoxious” attempts to censor the play that had been commissioned by their own artistic director. [...] Indeed, the first production of Childe Byron caused a stir in conservative Richmond, the capitol of the old Confederacy. [...] The play's subject matter drew controversy when <b>the</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>director</b> of the museum, in response to pressure from some trustees and a few influential patrons, called on artistic director Keith Fowler to remove a homosexual kiss and delete the word [...] "fuck" [...] from an historical quotation attributed to Byron. With playwright Linney's backing, Fowler declined the censorship directive.|$|E
