5|$|The {{compromise}} proposal {{was referred to}} a special committee proposed by Crittenden's fellow Kentucky senator, Lazarus Powell. Though {{it was believed that}} Republicans in general, including their representatives on the committee, were disposed to accept Crittenden's compromise or one substantially similar to it, President-elect Lincoln had already instructed his trusted allies in the legislature to resist any plan to extend slavery into the territories. Consequently, when the committee held its first meeting, the Republican members blocked Crittenden's plan and six others from coming to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vote. Despite their opposition, however, the Republicans presented no alternative plan. After the rejection of Crittenden's plan in committee, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia followed South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 2005, {{during the}} hearing on Judge John Roberts's {{nomination}} for Chief Justice of the United States, Feingold {{was one of}} three Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of sending Roberts's nomination to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full vote. He also announced that he would vote to confirm Roberts. Feingold graduated from Harvard Law School the same year as Roberts, 1979. Feingold voted against Samuel Alito in committee and voted against cloture of debate regarding Alito's nomination on the Senate floor.|$|E

25|$|The Act also limited {{debate over}} {{discharge}} petitions (to bring concurrent resolutions out of committee and onto <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vote) to one hour, and debate on concurrent resolutions themselves to 10 hours. The Act required {{a simple majority}} vote in the Senate to approve a concurrent resolution on any reorganization plan. The Act did not authorize the establishment of any new executive branch agency, banned the abolition of any such agency, and exempted 21 independent agencies, boards, commissions, and departments (including the Comptroller General of the United States and the Government Accounting Office) from reorganization. It also denied the president the power to use reorganization authority to extend the life or functions of any agency beyond the period authorized by law.|$|E
25|$|The Smith bill won several early {{tests in}} the House, which also voted to {{substantially}} cut the NLRB's budget. Smith won a snap vote in the House Rules Committee permitting him to bring his bill directly to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vote and bypass the committee process (where Roosevelt and his House allies had intended to bottle up the bill). In an attempt to defuse the legislative crisis, Madden fired 53 staff and forced another five to resign, and decentralized the NLRB's trial process to give regional directors and field agents more authority. But the House easily passed the Smith bill {{by a vote of}} 258 to 129 on June 7, 1940. To protect the NLRB, Roosevelt convinced Senator Elbert D. Thomas, chair of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, to hold no hearings or votes on the bill, and the legislation died.|$|E
25|$|General Edmund Hogan {{was also}} a veteran of several heated {{political}} campaigns for seats in the council of the Territorial Legislature. Hogan represented Arkansas in the Territorial General Assembly of Missouri in 1816 and 1818, when Arkansas {{was part of the}} Missouri Territory. In the election of 1827, there were three candidates, Colonel Walker, General Hogan and Judge Scott. The election was apparently very heated. After the election was over, tensions appeared to calm and everything appeared quiet. On May 31, 1828 a public hanging occurred in Little Rock, which drew spectators from far and near. When the hanging was over Judge Scott {{made his way to the}} store of McLane & Badgett on the west side of Main street. He was discussing the circumstances of the hanging, when General Hogan entered the store. General Hogan was a man weighing nearly three hundred pounds, and stood over six feet tall. Judge Scott was a small man, not weighing more than one hundred and thirty pounds. The conversation went on, with both Scott and Hogan taking part, neither showing any animosity to the other. The conversation soon diverged from the hanging to politics, and before the men knew it they were discussing the old Walker and Hogan political race. This seemed to revive in the mind of General Hogan something that occurred in the triangular race between himself, Walker and Scott. He turned to Scott and accused him of writing a letter which was derogatory to Hogan. Scott at once informed the general that he had been misinformed. Hogan reiterated the statement and said that he believed that it was true. Scott denied it again, and apparently accused Hogan of lying. Both men were standing up and as soon as Scott made the last remark, Hogan struck him, knocking him to the floor. Scott remained on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, apparently knocked senseless. As Scott revived, he struggled to his feet, and Hogan prepared to strike another blow. As Scott arose he unsheathed a dirk from a sword cane which he carried and plunged the dirk several times into the body of General Hogan. Hogan fell and expired within an hour. Judge Scott was arrested by his brother, United States Marshal George Scott, and taken before an officer for trial. The facts as stated above were there proven, and the court held Hogan to have been the aggressor and released Judge Scott.|$|E

500|$|As vice president, Breckinridge was {{tasked with}} {{presiding}} over the debates of the Senate. In an early address to that body, he promised, [...] "It shall be my constant aim, gentlemen of the Senate, to exhibit at all times, to every member of this body, the courtesy and impartiality which are due to the representatives of equal States." [...] Historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that, while Breckinridge fulfilled his promise {{to the satisfaction of}} most, acting as moderator limited his participation in debate. Five tie-breaking votes provided a means of expressing his views. Economic motivations explained two—forcing an immediate vote on a codfishing tariff and limiting military pensions to $50 per month ($ in present-day currency). A third cleared <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vote on Douglas's motion to admit Oregon to the Union, and a fourth defeated Johnson's Homestead Bill. The final vote effected a wording change in a resolution forbidding constitutional amendments that empowered Congress to interfere with property rights. The Senate's move from the Old Senate Chamber to a more spacious one on January 4, 1859, provided another opportunity. Afforded the chance to make the last address in the old chamber, Breckinridge encouraged compromise and unity among the states to resolve sectional conflicts.|$|E
500|$|On December 9, Temple Owls matched {{up against}} Georgetown. Fran Dunphy earned his 400th career victory, as his Owls upset the tenth-ranked Hoyas 68–65. At their first home game {{in almost a}} month, Temple Owls took an early 6–0 lead and did not trail the entire game. They led by 11 in the first half, and a {{backdoor}} cut to Ramone Moore put the Owls up 39–32 at the break. The Hoyas manage {{to tie the game}} at 56 when Chris Wright sunk a pair of free throws. A three-pointer from Moore and a putback shot from Rahlir Jefferson enabled Temple Owls to take a 61–56 lead. A hook shot by Georgetown's Julian Vaughn cut the Hoya deficit to one with less than a minute remaining, but Hollis Thompson missed a layup that would have given the Hoyas the lead. Jefferson grabbed the rebound and then netted two foul shots, and a last-second halfcourt shot by Austin Freeman went over the backboard. Temple Owls' fans rushed the court after the buzzer, as Georgetown suffered their first loss of the year. Moore shot 12-for-18 from <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> career-high 30 points. Dunphy congratulated his team's defensive effort, holding the Hoyas to 44 percent shooting, and said, [...] "it's all about these guys. They're all great players and great people." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{amendments}} removing Kentucky's constitutional {{prohibition on}} a state lottery had been introduced in every legislative session since the mid-1970s, Wilkinson's election provided the issue with fresh momentum, and the General Assembly passed the amendment by the required majorities in the 1988 session. Another amendment passed during Wilkinson's term required landowner approval before strip mining could occur {{on a piece of}} property. This amendment essentially overturned a 1956 court ruling and negated the practice of issuing broad form deeds which allowed property owners to sell their mineral rights while retaining ownership of structures and other improvements above-ground. A third amendment for which Wilkinson advocated would have allowed elected state officials to succeed themselves in office. During his gubernatorial campaign, he insisted that he would not seek to have such an amendment apply to himself, but shortly after his election, he reversed course and insisted on an amendment that did not exclude present incumbents. The amendment became one of Wilkinson's top priorities in the 1988 legislative session, and he threatened to work against legislators who opposed it. Legislators proposed that a succession amendment include provisions to lengthen the terms of state legislators in order to maintain a balance of power between the executive and legislative branches; Wilkinson insisted that the General Assembly pass a [...] "clean" [...] succession amendment, free from any other provisions that might diminish the amendment's chances of being approved by the state's voters. The Kentucky House of Representatives passed such an amendment, but the state Senate continued to press for legislative concessions, proposing annual legislative sessions and mandatory runoffs in gubernatorial primaries when one candidate did not receive a majority of the votes cast. When Wilkinson rejected both proposals, Senate leaders refused to bring the amendment to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vote. Wilkinson's reversal on his campaign promise not to seek succession for present incumbents damaged his reputation.|$|E
