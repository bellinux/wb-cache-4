500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first I ever heard of the film was <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind." [...] LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well they may,' said James; 'for {{who loves}} them better than he? I grudge myself <b>this</b> lovely <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> he is lying there, and my poor Clara is caged {{up at that}} place--the two who would the most enjoy it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Maude, {{he was on}} the {{platform}} <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>when</b> he saw me, he turned on his heel and hurried out of the station. I read guilt in his eyes. I am sure that his accounts are wrong again.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay, plotting," [...] {{repeated}} Harvey, casting his cloth away; [...] "murder and all {{the crimes}} in the calendar, I take it. I hear him and Mr. Grafton among the stalls <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>when</b> they sees me they look like Knipe, here, caught with a fowl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{absolutely}} and entirely well," [...] he declared stoutly, [...] "both when I left home <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and <b>when</b> I entered that room {{to wait for}} you.

60|$|There was {{but little}} room for bitter {{thoughts}} in Joe's mind on <b>this</b> June <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> it seemed good to be alive, and before he had traversed half a mile he put far from him all forebodings, thinking only of {{what he would do}} to add to the comfort of aunt Dorcas, and the happiness of the princess.|$|R
6000|$|On <b>this</b> {{particular}} Christmas <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> {{she heard}} the gate slam, Honora sprang {{up from the table}} to don her green velvet coat. Poor Peter! As though his subjugation could be more complete! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "George Larkins rode in <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to see <b>when</b> papa {{would come}} home, {{and he told}} me. He said I had better not tell Margaret, for {{he did not believe}} it." ...|$|R

"But, sir, when I said so {{to myself}} on rising <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>when</b> I looked round {{the room to}} gather courage and comfort from the cheerful aspect of each {{familiar}} object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn {{from top to bottom}} in two halves!" ...|$|R
60|$|After this I slept again, soundly <b>this</b> time, till <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> I awoke much refreshed, and got up. At {{last the}} hour drew near at which, {{according}} to Ayesha, Leo was to awake, {{and with it}} came She herself, as usual, veiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said Varney, [...] "a tear from my lady {{would have}} blotted out all I could have said. Besides, I had not these proofs until <b>this</b> very <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> Anthony Foster's sudden arrival with the {{examinations}} and declarations, {{which he had}} extorted from the innkeeper Gosling and others, explained the manner of her flight from Cumnor Place, and my own researches discovered the steps which she had taken here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you why I say so. Because I went to the drawer <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> before going to parade, and I saw some of Mrs. Clinton's baby's night-gowns in it. Yes, I see they {{are all in the}} wash-tub now; but they were there <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>when</b> I heard you say you had put the child into one of our baby's night-gowns because it had no clean ones of its own, I knew that you were lying, and that you had done this on purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Them was the cap'n's words," [...] said Mr. Smith, coldly. [...] "After you'd 'ad it {{they was}} going to stow you away in the Seabird, which sailed <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> However, <b>when</b> the cap'n see you overcome, his 'art melted, and instead o' putting you aboard the whaler he took your feet and Mr. Wilks your 'ead, and after a great deal o' trouble got you upstairs and put you to bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I'll shell {{as many as}} you want," [...] said he, [...] "but I've {{got a lot to}} do this afternoon. There is the phaeton to be washed, that I don't {{want the}} doctor to come home and find muddy yet; and I ought to have done it <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> madam, <b>when</b> I was walking about the garden with you, a tellin' you what I had and a hearin' what I ought to have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thought I {{should find}} you here, Mealing,' he said. 'They {{gave me this}} at the station to give to you; you dropped it <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> you {{got out of the}} train.' ...|$|E
60|$|My father said, <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>when</b> my {{face was}} in repose and thoughtful, that I looked {{precisely}} as young Edward Twichell of Hartford used to look some is months ago--chin, mouth, forehead, expression--everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, sir. I {{thought he}} seemed chippier than ever <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> he went out. His last words were that he'd bet me {{a packet of}} Woodbines that he landed the old fool." ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile the {{conversation}} at Button's was fast and brilliant. [...] "By Wood's thirteens, and the divvle go wid 'em," [...] cried the Church dignitary in the cassock, [...] "is it in blue and goold ye are <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> Sir Richard, <b>when</b> {{you ought to}} be in seebles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} apologize, I know, for {{bringing}} these people up without notice, but I didn't suppose you'd object when you understood how naturally {{it all came}} about. I thought a little livening up, as I said, wouldn't, hurt us. We've had a quiet winter, to put it mildly." [...] He laughed a little. [...] "I didn't {{have a chance to}} see you until <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>when</b> I went to your room they told me you'd gone out." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was doing}} this very thing on <b>this</b> {{particular}} <b>morning</b> <b>when</b> he happened to glance up in the blue, blue sky. There he saw a broad-winged bird sailing in wide, graceful circles. Instantly Peter crouched a little lower in his hiding-place, for he knew this for {{a member of the}} Hawk family and Peter has learned by experience {{that the only way to}} keep perfectly safe when one of these hook-clawed, hook-billed birds is about is to keep out of sight.|$|R
