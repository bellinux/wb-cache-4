50|$|A <b>tie,</b> <b>strap,</b> tie rod, eyebar, guy-wire, {{suspension}} cables, or wire ropes, are an {{examples of}} linear structural components designed to resist tension. It {{is the opposite}} of a strut or column, which is designed to resist compression. Ties may be made of any tension resisting material.|$|E
50|$|Catcher pouches {{could not}} be used for any other purpose. The catcher pouch was to be used only for letters (sometimes {{newspapers}} were an exception). The maximum weight of a filled catcher pouch was to be 50 pounds. The catcher pouch was to be locked and placed upside down on the mail crane no sooner than 10 minutes before the scheduled arrival of the Mail Train. The catcher pouch was to be tied in the middle before it was to be transferred. If a small amount of mail, it should be put in the lower half below the <b>tie</b> <b>strap.</b> If a large amount of mail, it should be divided equally between the upper half and {{the lower half of the}} catcher pouch.|$|E
50|$|Tie down {{hardware}} {{is used to}} turn webbing into a <b>tie</b> down <b>strap.</b> There {{are various}} categories of <b>tie</b> down <b>strap</b> hardware that allow {{for the creation of}} a virtually unlimited number of different types of <b>tie</b> down <b>straps.</b> These pieces of hardware fall into several categories including fasteners, end fittings, and buckles.|$|R
50|$|The terms used to {{describe}} chain arrangements can be confusing. Most modern chains do not have only cutter teeth and drive links. There are <b>tie</b> <b>straps</b> which separate the cutters from each other.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tie</b> down <b>straps</b> (also called ratchet straps, lashing <b>straps</b> or <b>tie</b> downs) are {{fasteners}} used to {{hold down}} cargo or equipment during transport. <b>Tie</b> down <b>straps</b> are essentially webbing that is outfitted with tie down hardware. This hardware allows the <b>tie</b> down <b>strap</b> to attach to the area surrounding the cargo or equipment, loop over the cargo or equipment, and/or attach to the cargo or equipment. It usually also includes a method of tensioning the strap, such as a ratchet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tie</b> downs, <b>tie</b> <b>straps,</b> cargo straps, E-track straps, {{cargo hoist}} straps, tow ropes, winch straps, cargo nets, {{and dozens of}} other items are used by {{thousands}} of shipping and trucking companies every day. The transportation industry is perhaps the largest user of high strength webbing in the world.|$|R
50|$|Two {{common types}} of <b>tie</b> down <b>straps</b> are loop straps and two-piece straps.|$|R
50|$|Heavy loads are {{sometimes}} secured to vehicles with <b>tie</b> down <b>straps,</b> heavy duty strapping, or tensioned chains.|$|R
50|$|Two-piece <b>tie</b> down <b>straps</b> are {{a single}} {{assembly}} that is constructed out of two separate pieces of webbing each with their own hardware that are fastened at {{one end to the}} area surrounding the equipment to be protected and connect to each other, typically at the fastener.Webbing with linking device is a product used for fastening of goods with truck, trailer, pallets, boxes, containers etc. This is also known as Ratchet lashing, Ratchet <b>straps,</b> Ratchet <b>tie</b> down, <b>tie</b> down <b>straps,</b> lashing with webbing etc.|$|R

[...] The film shows at least one sedated but not anesthetized baboon with his wrists and ankles <b>tied,</b> <b>strapped</b> to an operating table, his shaved head secured with dental cement inside a helmet. A hydraulic device known as Penn 2 slams the baboon's head from behind, pushing it forward at a 60-degree angle with a force of what the researchers said was up to 1000 g, apparently intended to simulate whiplash.|$|R
40|$|We {{were asked}} at the {{previous}} Atlas collaboration meeting to confirm our proposal that the Argonne design option could maintain the <b>tie</b> <b>straps</b> in a prestressed condition after welding. This was deemed {{necessary to maintain}} compression loading of the steel plate stack. The compression load requirement was set at a load equivalent to that necessary to maintain continuity of the stack using friction. We will attempt to prove that through the strap testing and the ultimate construction of the 25 cm prototype stack {{that we have in}} fact met these requirements...|$|R

50|$|A quiver is an {{accessory}} for holding the bow. It is often made of leather and it {{attaches to the}} bridge and tailpiece with <b>ties</b> or <b>straps.</b> It is used to hold the bow while a player plays pizzicato parts.|$|R
50|$|A jacket (jeogori, 저고리) and {{trousers}} and an overcoat are worn. The jacket has loose sleeves, the trousers are roomy and <b>tied</b> with <b>straps</b> at the ankles. A vest may be worn over the shirt. A black hat could be worn.|$|R
50|$|Hand-held stilts {{are used}} as {{childhood}} toys and in circus skills workshops and are of two main types: string and can/bucket stilts and pole stilts. Unlike other forms of stilts, hand-held stilts are not <b>tied</b> or <b>strapped</b> to the wearer.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of buckles found in <b>tie</b> down <b>straps.</b> The two most common are {{threaded}} buckles and snap buckles. Threaded buckles work like those found on backpacks and duffel bags {{for the purpose of}} adjusting the length of the <b>tie</b> down <b>strap.</b> Snap buckles are also commonly found on backpacks and duffel bags to allow fastening of the strap. These two components are often used in conjunction with the threading buckle providing tension and the snap buckle providing fastening. While threading buckles come in metal varieties for use with tensioning fasteners like over-center and ratchet fasteners, snap buckles are often plastic and are not designed to withstand a great deal of tension.|$|R

5000|$|The {{anatomy of}} the cymbal plays a large part in the sound it creates. A hole is drilled {{in the center of}} the cymbal, which is used to either mount the cymbal on a stand or for <b>tying</b> <b>straps</b> through (for hand playing). The bell, dome, or cup is the raised section {{immediately}} surrounding the hole. The bell produces a higher [...] "pinging" [...] pitch than the rest of the cymbal. The bow is the rest of the surface surrounding the bell. The bow is sometimes described in two areas: the ride and crash area. The ride area is the thicker section closer to the bell while the crash area is the thinner tapering section near the edge. The edge or rim is the immediate circumference of the cymbal.|$|R

50|$|The early {{cast iron}} rails of the 18th century and before used {{integral}} fixings for nailing or bolting to the railroad <b>ties.</b> <b>Strap</b> rails {{introduced in the}} late 18th century, of cast and later rolled iron were nailed to wooden supports via countersunk holes in the metal. The introduction of rolled rail profiles in the 1820s such as the single flanged T parallel rail and later double flanged T parallel rail required the use of chairs, keys to hold the rail, and bolts or spikes to fix the chair. The flat bottomed rail invented by Robert L. Stevens in 1830 was initially spiked directly to wooden sleepers, later tie plates were used to spread the load and also keep the rail in gauge with inbuilt shoulders in the plate. Outside North America {{a wide variety of}} spring based fastening systems were later introduced in combination with baseplates and flat bottomed rail, these are now ubiquitous on main line high speed railways.|$|R

50|$|A {{cable tie}} (also {{known as a}} hose tie, steggel <b>tie,</b> zap <b>strap</b> or zip <b>tie,</b> and by the brand names Ty-Rap and Panduit strap) {{is a type of}} fastener, for holding items together, {{primarily}} electrical cables or wires. Because of their low cost and ease of use, cable ties are ubiquitous, finding use {{in a wide range of}} other applications. Stainless steel versions, either naked or coated with a rugged plastic, cater for exterior applications and hazardous environments.|$|R
50|$|Wrought iron {{was used}} for minor {{structural}} and decorative elements starting in the 18th century. Until the mid-19th century, the use of wrought iron in buildings was generally limited to small items such as <b>tie</b> rods, <b>straps,</b> nails, and hardware, or to decorative ironwork in balconies, railings fences and gates. Around 1850 its structural use became more widespread as iron mills began to roll rails, bulb-tees, and eventually I-beams. It was also used for decorative purposes, such as ornamental balconies or hardware. Since wrought iron is handmade, no two pieces are identical.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the often}} taboo nature of strap-on activities, {{information}} on their history is difficult to find. An 1899 report by Haberlandt documented current and historical use of double-ended dildos in Zanzibar, {{and is one of}} the few historical documents of this kind. Female-female dildo usage in ancient China has been documented, but it is not clear if this was double-dildos, strap-on dildos, or just a simple dildo being used by one woman on another. In ancient Greece, dildos were made of stone or padded leather, and some evidence shows aforementioned leather was used to make a harness as well, with olive oil used for anal penetration. A double-penetration dildo was found in ancient France, but its use is lost to time. A 19th-century Chinese painting shows a woman using a dildo strapped to her shoe, showing that creative use of strap-ons was already well under way. Many artifacts from the Upper Paleolithic have been found that appear to be dildos, including a double [...] "baton" [...] with a hole in the middle, theorized to be for a strap to hold it to a wearer. The Kama Sutra includes mention of dildos (darshildo in Hindi) made from a wide variety of materials, and used by hand, with <b>ties</b> (<b>straps),</b> or in a harness. It is likely the history of the strap-on parallels the history of the dildo, and given the age of many discoveries, is a rather long history.|$|R

50|$|The TLC Tugger is a tapeless {{foreskin}} restoration device {{invented by}} Ron Low. The device {{consists of a}} silicone 'tugger', retaining cone, and an elastic strap. The silicone tugger is placed against the glans. Skin from the penile shaft or inner skin is then rolled over the tugger. The retaining cone is then used to hold the skin in place. Finally, a strap {{is attached to the}} tugger and then tied around the knee in order to induce tension. This tension allows the inner or outer foreskin to grow. A newer version of the TLC Tugger has been created called the TLC Tugger X which includes weights that can be <b>tied</b> to <b>straps</b> to add extra tension allowing for faster growth of the foreskin.|$|R

5000|$|On {{his arrival}} at Treblinka aboard the Holocaust train from Warsaw, Wiernik was {{selected}} to work rather than be immediately killed. [...] Wiernik's first job with the Sonderkommando required him to drag corpses from the gas chambers to mass graves. Wienik was traumatized by his experiences. He later wrote in his book: [...] "It often happened that an arm or a leg fell off when we <b>tied</b> <b>straps</b> around {{them in order to}} drag the bodies away." [...] He remembered the horrors of the enormous pyres, where [...] "10,000 to 12,000 corpses were cremated at one time." [...] He wrote: [...] "The bodies of women were used for kindling" [...] while Germans [...] "toasted the scene with brandy and with the choicest liqueurs, ate, caroused and had a great time warming themselves by the fire." [...] Wiernik described small children awaiting so long in the cold for their turn in the gas chambers that [...] "their feet froze and stuck to the icy ground" [...] and noted one guard who would [...] "frequently snatch a child from the woman's arms and either tear the child in half or grab it by the legs, smash its head against a wall and throw the body away." [...] At other times [...] "children were snatched from their mothers' arms and tossed into the flames alive." [...] However, he was also encouraged by the occasional scenes of brave resistance. In chapter 8, he describes seeing a naked woman escape the clutches of the guards and leap over a ten foot high barbed wire fence unscathed. When accosted by a Ukrainian guard on the other side, she wrestled his machine gun out of his grasp and shot two guards before being killed herself.|$|R

It was lined with baize, a coarse woolen cloth, and he carried {{only a small portion of}} water and a few biscuits. There was a single hole cut for air and it was nailed and <b>tied</b> with <b>straps.</b> Brown later wrote that his uncertain method of travel was worth the risk: [...] "if you have never been deprived of your liberty, as I was, you cannot realize the power of that hope of freedom, which was to me indeed, an anchor to the soul both sure and steadfast." ...|$|R
