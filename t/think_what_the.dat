500|$|In 2010, Browner {{became a}} key part of the {{administration}} team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. [...] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as [...] "probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country" [...] and said that the administration was [...] "prepared for the worst". [...] She added that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished." [...] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that [...] " [...] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe." ...|$|E
500|$|Many US {{newspaper}} {{critics were}} less {{taken with the}} film. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "a clunk-headed action picture" [...] that [...] "simply becomes a monotonous series of bad-guy confrontations." [...] Frank Lovece of Newsday {{described it as a}} [...] "soullessly gritty" [...] film, which apart from one believable scene involving Thirlby, is [...] "all tough-guy talk and humorless cynicism". Kyle Smith of the New York Post, who found the police tactics distasteful, wrote, [...] "Justice is supposed to be blind, but in this case I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Law really wants is unaccountability" [...] and called Dredd a [...] " [...] thudding, repetitive movie". He also wrote, [...] "It’s not that the movie is in bad taste or cheesy (though it is) but that all of its hyper-violence adds up to nothing". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called it a [...] "gray and ugly film", said that there was little to draw viewers in, and wrote that apart from the drug-induced slow-motion sequences, the film offers nothing new.|$|E
500|$|James Berardinelli of ReelViews {{gave the}} film {{two and a}} half stars out of four, and claimed that many of the film's ideas for {{altering}} its familiar storyline [...] "sound better on paper than they turn out in execution." [...] Finding it tedious to view the film's story told multiple times, he wrote that the film [...] "slips into boredom." [...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle also gave the film {{two and a half}} stars, and although he praised its [...] "snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations", he considered the film's plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation. Peter Rainer writing for The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a C+ and called it [...] "a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children." [...] He was not overly critical of the film, but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer-animated films set by Pixar. Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic, and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current. While Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's vocal performances, he wrote, [...] "Hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania... One aches to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> great Looney Tunes directors could have done with this material." ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain {{leaned back}} in his chair and {{regarded}} him thoughtfully. [...] "I can't <b>think</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter with you, Jem," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Hendrie, {{will you}} {{be good enough to}} play? The king of clubs to beat. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter with you to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>think</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> use of Harry's coming home," [...] Gertrude {{was heard}} saying to Richard. [...] "It is very disagreeable;" [...] whereat Mary relapsed into a giggle, and Ethel felt frantic.|$|R
60|$|I said I {{had been}} trying to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> tray had to do with it.|$|E
60|$|I dread to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> result {{might have}} been had his answer been other than it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fellow's doing here, anyhow," [...] Carton remarked discontentedly. [...] "A few {{generations ago}} {{we should have}} hung him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} I don't mean cryin' {{out like a}} baby," [...] said Hetty, looking down with a modest smile, [...] "but I saw tears in his eyes, and {{sometimes}} they got on his cheeks. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter with him." ...|$|R
60|$|The wonder {{was that}} I {{did not kill}} him on the spot. I cannot <b>think</b> <b>what</b> possessed <b>the</b> man,--he must have known me better.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am in dreadful {{uncertainty}} about her. She {{was very much}} agitated yesterday--and with her delicate health--I am afraid to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> turn <b>the</b> agitation may have taken.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A feebler sort of beast I never saw. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{world is}} coming to. Scraggy, weedy legs.... Wonder how they keep warm in winter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't nonsense. You are a {{minister}} {{and it would}} ruin you to marry a girl like me. <b>Think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Rexton people would say of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{really must}} speak to him, Archdeacon. Only <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Thornes will say if they hear that their parish clergyman spends his whole time philandering with this woman." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. Another Labour? I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> {{on earth}} <b>the</b> country is about.|$|R
5000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> made <b>the</b> {{greatest}} {{impression on}} me,” he wrote years later, “were the tall glasses of fresh California orange juice. I {{had never seen}} anything like those large glassfuls before.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Passing the forts in {{that trying}} way {{required}} {{the same sort}} of nerve that a person must have when ghosts are about him in the dark, I should <b>think.</b> <b>What</b> does <b>the</b> Standard-Bearer think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fie,' said she; 'what {{a ridiculous}} thing to ask anyone to do; just <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{neighbours}} {{would say if}} they saw me. They would think I had taken leave of my senses.' ...|$|E
60|$|The poor chap {{gave one}} of those mirthless laughs. He was looking anxious and worried, {{like a man who}} has done the murder all right but can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> deuce to do with the body.|$|E
6000|$|... (3.) Fearful cogitations haunt him, misgivings, direful apprehensions of God, terrify him. Now he hath time to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> loss {{of heaven}} will be, {{and what the}} torments of hell will be: now he looks no way but he is frighted.|$|E
6000|$|The short parley {{between the}} {{proprietor}} of the museum and the accuser gave Teddy time to <b>think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> lawyer had said, and he added, as the constable approached him: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{help him}} to the ship," [...] {{answered}} Dave. He was as much shocked as his companion, {{and he could not}} help but <b>think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> supercargo had said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> is <b>the</b> {{matter with}} it,' the duck grumbled to her {{neighbour}} {{who had called}} in to pay her a visit. 'Why I could have hatched two broods {{in the time that}} this one has taken!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It only {{wants the}} low solemn surge and ripple of the tide, and its dash on the rocks,' said Guy. 'If {{ever there was}} music, it is there; but it makes one <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> ear must be that can take {{in the whole of}} those harmonics.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{learn the}} high-priest's mind and <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> high-priest thinks," [...] I {{answered}} darkly, though {{in my heart}} I was terribly afraid for Merapi, and, to speak truth, for myself also, because of the doubts which arose in me {{and would not be}} quenched.|$|E
6000|$|... "Her {{heart has}} always been there, and her father is in treaty for a farm for him, so I fear there is little hope of keeping them. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> parish will do without her. By the bye, how does Joe Reynolds get on with his drawings?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{must put}} the best face upon it," [...] exclaimed that lady; [...] "he was always romantic. But, as he says, or <b>thinks,</b> <b>what</b> is <b>the</b> use of friends {{if they do not}} help you in a scrape?" ...|$|R
500|$|Boyle {{was offered}} a knighthood in late 2012, but turned it down, saying [...] "I'm very {{proud to be an}} equal citizen and I <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Opening Ceremony was {{actually}} about." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{try not to}} get {{involved}} in caucuses that make me look like a radical, right-wing nut. I don’t <b>think</b> that’s <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Tea Party is, but I want to avoid the appearance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes?" [...] She {{raised her}} head. [...] "It was wrong {{of me to}} say that. They are really fond of me. It's {{the only thing that}} makes life worth living--when they're fond of you, isn't it? I daren't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> place would be without them. By the way, is it beautiful?" ...|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{then spent}} some time in fruitless {{attempts}} to make some lighted birch bark go down into the stump, and burn there. He succeeded very well in getting pieces completely on fire; but, after they were dropped into the hole, they would not burn. Rollo could not <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> reason could be.|$|E
60|$|Mary did kiss him, {{and he did}} go. But as she {{was still}} {{lingering}} in the room, putting away a book, or a reel of thread, and then sitting down to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> morrow would bring forth, the doctor again {{came into the room}} in his dressing-gown, and with the slippers on.|$|E
5000|$|Boyle {{was offered}} a knighthood in late 2012, but turned it down, saying [...] "I'm very {{proud to be an}} equal citizen and I <b>think</b> that's <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Opening Ceremony was {{actually}} about." ...|$|R
6000|$|And here, at I cannot <b>think</b> <b>what</b> hour of <b>the</b> morning, I shall dry up, and remain--Yours, {{really in}} {{want of a}} little help, ...|$|R
6000|$|RANSOM: [...] "I {{have been}} trying to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> was <b>the</b> very humblest pie I could eat, by way of penance; and it appears to me that I had better begin by saying that I have come to ask her for the money I refused." ...|$|R
