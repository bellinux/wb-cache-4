5|$|Horses were {{a central}} asset to Finnish {{military}} forces during the Winter War (1939–40) and Continuation War (1941–1944), when {{tens of thousands}} of horses were the main locomotive power of the army due to the shortage of automobiles.

All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were marked for identification and as necessary, were returned or reported dead.
