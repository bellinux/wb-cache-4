25|$|One {{should expect}} that a gill {{breathing}} arthropod would modify its gills to breathe air {{if it were}} adapting to terrestrial environments, and not evolve new respiration organs from bottom {{up next to the}} original and still functioning ones. <b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> fact that insect (larva and nymph) gills are actually a part of a modified, closed trachea system specially adapted for water, called tracheal gills. The arthropod trachea can only arise in an atmosphere and {{as a consequence of the}} adaptations of living on land. This too indicates that insects are descended from a terrestrial ancestor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> tens-column. The tens-column so far {{contains}} only one digit: the tens-digit of the multiplicand (though it might contain a carry digit under the line). Find {{the product of}} the multiplier and the tens-digits of the multiplicand. Then, if there is a carry digit (superscripted, under the line and in the tens-column), add it to this product. If the resulting sum is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit over to the next column: in this case the hundreds column.|$|E
25|$|The {{presentation}} of each result {{is given in}} a stylized form, which, although not invented by Euclid, is recognized as typically classical. It has six different parts: First is the 'enunciation', which states the result in general terms (i.e., the statement of the proposition). <b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> 'setting-out', which gives the figure and denotes particular geometrical objects by letters. Next comes the 'definition' or 'specification', which restates the enunciation {{in terms of the}} particular figure. Then the 'construction' or 'machinery' follows. Here, the original figure is extended to forward the proof. Then, the 'proof' itself follows. Finally, the 'conclusion' connects the proof to the enunciation by stating the specific conclusions drawn in the proof, in the general terms of the enunciation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> tens-column. The tens-column might contain two digits: the tens-digit of {{the first}} number and the tens-digit of the second number. If one of the numbers has a missing tens-digit then the tens-digit for this number can be {{considered}} to be a 0. Add the tens-digits of the two numbers. Then, if there is a carry digit, add it to this sum. If the sum was 18 then adding the carry digit to it will yield 19. If the sum of the tens-digits (plus carry digit, if there is one) is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit (which should be a 1) over to the next column: in this case the hundreds-column.|$|E
25|$|Although asado is eaten {{all over}} the country, its origin may {{be traced back to}} the Pampas.

It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as cabrito al asador (roast kid or goat) in the province of Córdoba.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} {{praise from}} critics with The Moving Picture World stating, [...] " [...] picture which touches {{the heart and}} arouses the strongest emotions.

500|$|The {{music of}} the game was {{composed}} by Inon Zur, whose previous works included [...] and Fallout Tactics. Inon Zur worked with Jeremy Soule, the composer for Icewind Dale, to maintain {{the tone of the}} music. Inon Zur also worked closely with Interplay audio director Adam Levenson while composing the music; Zur and Levenson had worked together on several previous titles. Inon Zur said that while composing the theme for the game, [...] "I wrote and rewrote the main theme several times", and [...] "we tried to create a piece that would preserve the sound of the first Icewind Dalewe made great efforts to convey the new elements also. Capturing all of this in 30-45 seconds was not easy however I believe that we eventually found the right path for this game's soundtrack." [...] Zur described the composing process, [...] "After learning the storyboard and getting additional insight from the producers/music supervisor I'll start to compose. The thematic idea (main melody or rhythmical groove) comes first. <b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> accompaniment followed by the orchestration," [...] and that, [...] "each piece should have its own unique flavour so every step is carefully examined. I {{have to make sure that}} the main idea of the piece is reflected in all these steps." [...] He called the composing experience [...] "very pleasant and rewarding." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> {{outer wall}} of the Anemas Prison, which connects to a double stretch of walls. The outer wall {{is known as the}} Wall of Leo, as it was {{constructed}} by Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820) in 813 to safeguard against the siege by the Bulgarian ruler Krum. This wall was then extended to the south by Michael II (r. 820–829). The wall is a relatively light structure, less than 3m thick, buttressed by arches which support its parapet and featuring four towers and numerous loopholes. Behind the Leonine Wall lies an inner wall, which was renovated and strengthened by the additions of three particularly fine hexagonal towers by Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842). The two walls stand some 26 m apart and are pierced by a gate each, together comprising the Gate of Blachernae ( [...] , porta tōn Blachernōn). The two walls form a fortified enclosure, called the Brachionion or Brachiolion ("bracelet") of Blachernae (...) [...] by the Byzantines, and known after the Ottoman capture of the city in Greek as the Pentapyrgion (Πενταπύργιον, [...] "Five Towers"), in allusion to the Yedikule (Gk. Heptapyrgion) fortress. The inner wall is traditionally identified by scholars like van Millingen and Janin with the Wall of Heraclius, built by Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) after the Avar-Persian siege to enclose and protect the Church of the Blachernitissa. Schneider however identified it in part with the Pteron (Πτερόν, [...] "wing"), built at the time of Theodosius II to cover the northern flank of the Blachernae (hence its alternate designation as proteichisma, [...] "outwork") from the Anemas Prison to the Golden Horn. Consequently, Schneider transferred the identity of the Heraclian Wall on the short stretch of sea wall directly attached to it to its east, which displays a distinct architecture. The identity of the Pteron remains an unresolved question among modern scholars, however.|$|E

2500|$|The {{classical}} {{music of the}} Great Highland Bagpipe is called Pìobaireachd, which consists of a first movement called the urlar (in English, the 'ground' movement,) which establishes a theme. The theme is then developed {{in a series of}} movements, growing increasingly complex each time. [...] After the urlar there is usually a number of variations and doublings of the variations. [...] <b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> taorluath movement and variation and the crunluath movement, continuing with the underlying theme.

[...] He published lasting contributions on the subject, including Genocide: State power & mass murder; Taking lives: Genocide & state power; and [...] "Genocide and the reconstruction of social theory: Observations on the exclusivity of collective death" [...] in Armenian Review. Horowitz's last scholarly pieces on genocide were his preface to R. J. Rummel's Death by government, and his essay on state-sponsored terror, [...] "Counting Bodies.

2500|$|There is a {{progression}} from this {{opening of the}} nominal group, with the greatest specifying potential, through items that have successively less identifying potential and are increasingly permanent as attributes of the head. As Halliday points out, [...] "the more permanent the attribute of a thing, the less likely it is to identify it in a particular context" [...] (that is, of the speech event). The most permanent item, of course, is the head itself. This pattern from transient specification to permanent attribute explains why the items are ordered {{as they are in}} a nominal group. The deictic ("those") comes first; this is followed by the numerative, if there is one ("five"), since the number of apples, in this case, is the least permanent attribute; next comes the interpersonal epithet which, arising from the speaker's opinion, is closer to the speaker–now matrix than the more objectively testable experiential epithet ("shiny"); <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> more permanent classifier ("Jonathon", a type of apple), leading to the head itself. This ordering of increasing permanence from left to right is why we are more likely to say [...] "her new black car" [...] than [...] "her black new car": the newness will recede sooner than the blackness.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> A634 to {{the west}} of Blyth. The bridge here has three arches, was built for William Mellish of Blyth Hall around 1770, {{probably}} by the architect and bridge designer John Carr of York, and is a Grade I listed structure. Despite its age, it is called Blyth New Bridge, to distinguish it from Blyth Old Bridge which carries the same road over Oldcotes Dyke, a little further {{to the west}}. Before the next crossing of the B6045, the river is joined by Oldcotes Dyke, which flows eastwards from Roche Abbey, and drainage of the surrounding flood plain from here to the Idle is managed by the Rivers Idle and Ryton Internal Drainage Board. A network of drainage channels accompany the river from here to the junction with the River Idle, passing under the A1 road, collecting the runoff from the drainage channels of Whitewater Common, and skirting Serlby and Scrooby. To the north of Scrooby, the channel passes under the A638 Great North Road, the road into Scrooby village and the East Coast Main Line railway, crossing the [...] contour at the railway bridge. The Great North Road bypassed Scrooby, passing {{to the west of}} the village, when it was reconstructed as a turnpike road in 1776. The construction included a number of brick arches, to allow the Ryton to flow under it even in times of flood, which can still be seen from Mill Lane. The river used to flow through the village, and powered Scrooby water mill, an 18th-century mill which was used to grind corn. Milling stopped in 1939, and the river was diverted to follow its present course further to the north in the 1960s. Beyond the railway, flood banks have been raised on both sides of the channel until it meets the River Idle just above Bawtry bridge, the limit of navigation on that river.|$|E

2500|$|The salmon {{has long}} been {{at the heart of}} the culture and {{livelihood}} of coastal dwellers, which can be traced as far back 5,000 years when archeologists discovered Nisqually tribes remnants. The original distribution of the Genus Oncorhynchus covered the Pacific Rim coastline. History shows salmon used tributaries, rivers and estuaries without regard to jurisdiction for 18–22 million years. Baseline data is near impossible to recreate based off the inconsistent historical data, but confirmed there have been massive depletion since 1900s. The Pacific Northwest was once sprawled with native inhabitants who practiced eco management, to ensure little degradation was caused by their actions to salmon habitats. As animists, the indigenous people relied not only for salmon for food, but spiritual guidance. The role of the salmon spirit guided the people to respect ecological systems such as the rivers and tributaries the salmon used for spawning. Natives often used the entire fish and left no waste by creating items such turning the bladder into glue, bones for toys, and skin for clothing and shoes. The first salmon ceremony was introduced by indigenous tribes on the pacific coast, which consists of three major parts. First is the welcoming of the first catch, <b>then</b> <b>comes</b> <b>the</b> cooking and lastly, the return of the bones to the Sea to induce hospitality so that other salmon would give their lives to the people of that village. Many tribes such as the Yurok had a taboo against harvesting the first fish that swam upriver in summer, but once they confirmed that the salmon had returned in abundance they would begin to catch them in plentiful. The indigenous practices were guided by deep ecological wisdom, which was eradicated when Euro-American settlements began to be developed. Salmon have a much grander history than what is presently shown today. The Salmon that once dominated the Pacific Ocean are now just a fraction in population and size. The Pacific salmon population is now less than 1–3% of what it was when Lewis and Clark arrived at the region. In his 1908 State of the Union address, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt observed that the fisheries were in significant decline: ...|$|E
