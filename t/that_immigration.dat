5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed by the executive branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E
5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> detention, {{for the purposes of}} processing and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed the provisions of the Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> to the United States {{is beneficial}} to the US economy. With few exceptions, the evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low-skilled immigration adversely affects low-skilled natives. Studies also indicate <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> either has {{no impact on the}} crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate in the United States. Research shows that the United States excels at assimilating first- and second-generation immigrants relative to many other Western countries.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{empirical}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> increases {{crime in the}} United States.

25|$|McCain campaigned against Proposition 200, a 2004 Arizona state {{initiative}} {{intended to}} prevent illegal immigrants from voting, receiving welfare benefits, and mandated state agencies to report illegals to the federal government.

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that illegal immigration increases the rate of crime in the United States. There is scholarly consensus that illegal immigrants commit less crime than natives.

25|$|Prehistoric Wales {{in terms}} of human {{settlements}} covers the period from about 230,000 years ago, the date attributed to the earliest human remains found in what is now Wales, to the year AD 48 when the Roman army began a military campaign against one of the Welsh tribes. Traditionally, historians have believed that successive waves of immigrants brought different cultures into the area, largely replacing the previous inhabitants, with the last wave of immigrants being the Celts. However, studies of population genetics now suggest that this may not be true, and <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> was on a smaller scale.|$|E
25|$|Around 2005, an {{increasing}} number of banks saw illegal immigrants as an untapped resource for growing their own revenue stream and contended that providing illegal immigrants with mortgages would help revitalize local communities, with many community banks providing home loans for illegal immigrants. At the time, critics complained that this practice would reward and encourage illegal immigration, as well as contribute to an increase in predatory lending practices. One banking consultant said that banks which were planning to offer mortgages to illegal immigrants were counting on the fact <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> enforcement was very lax, with deportation unlikely for anyone who had not committed a crime.|$|E

25|$|The overall {{assessment}} of several British reports {{was that the}} increase in the Arab population was primarily due to natural increase. These included the Hope Simpson Enquiry (1930), the Passfield White Paper (1930), the Peel Commission report (1937), and the Survey of Palestine (1945). However, the Hope Simpson Enquiry did note that there was significant illegal immigration from the surrounding Arab territories, while the Peel Commission and Survey of Palestine claimed <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> played only a minor role in the growth of the Arab population. The 1931 census of Palestine considered the question of illegal immigration since the previous census in 1922. It estimated that unrecorded immigration during that period may have amounted to 9,000 Jews and 4,000 Arabs. It also gave the proportion of persons living in Palestine in 1931 who were born outside Palestine: Muslims, 2%; Christians, 20%; Jews, 58%.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} even {{suggests that}} increases in immigration may partly explain {{the reduction in}} the U.S. crime rate. A 2005 study showed <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> to large U.S. metropolitan areas does not increase, and in some cases decreases, crime rates there. A 2009 study found that recent immigration was not associated with homicide in Austin, Texas. The low crime rates of immigrants to the United States despite having lower levels of education, lower levels of income and residing in urban areas (factors that should lead to higher crime rates) may be due to lower rates of antisocial behavior among immigrants. A 2015 study found that Mexican immigration to the United States was associated with an increase in aggravated assaults and a decrease in property crimes. A 2016 study finds no link between immigrant populations and violent crime, although there is a small but significant association between undocumented immigrants and drug-related crime.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, a {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a free market think tank, found that legalization of low-skilled illegal {{resident}} workers in the US would result in a net increase in US GDP of $180 billion over ten years. The Cato Institute study did not examine the impact on per capita income for most Americans. Jason Riley notes that because of progressive income taxation, in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of federal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage based on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in, which also reflects on immigrants. In any event, the typical immigrant and his children will pay a net $80,000 more in their lifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS. Legal immigration policy is set to maximize net taxation. Illegal immigrants even after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in taxes. In 2010, an econometrics study by a Rutgers economist found <b>that</b> <b>immigration</b> helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks to their country of origin, particularly boosting trade of final goods as opposed to intermediate goods, but that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} Italian {{immigration policy}} and immigration law, giving {{special attention to}} the political discourse <b>that</b> keeps forcing <b>immigration</b> {{to the top of the}} institutional policy agenda. In this body of discourse, immigration is criminalized and foreign-ness becomes synonymous with criminality. Italian political parties have reinforced this association between crime and immigration to keep a firm grip on the electorate in a climate of political instability. This chapter examines several aspects of this political strategy. It also observes that institutional approaches to immigration have not changed substantially over the past three decades.
