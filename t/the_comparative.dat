40|$|The seeming {{demise of}} <b>the</b> field of <b>comparative</b> {{economics}} as it {{evolved in the}} 20 th century is often seen {{as the result of}} the collapse of the communist economy, which left us with only one economic system, capitalism. Moreover, <b>the</b> old <b>comparative</b> economics has been replaced by <b>the</b> new <b>comparative</b> economics, which focuses on varieties of capitalism and ascribes an almost exclusive explanatory role to institutions. I argue that the demise of <b>the</b> old <b>comparative</b> economics has more to do with the fact that it was fatally flawed in terms of the criteria it used for comparing economic systems rather than with the demise of communism or the fact that it failed to understand the causes of inter-system differences in outcomes. The great advantage of <b>the</b> new <b>comparative</b> economics is in its choice of a single criterion for judging the performance of an economic system. I illustrate these advantages of such a single criterion by examining the contributions of <b>the</b> new <b>comparative</b> economics to <b>the</b> cross country analysis income levels, and, on the basis of this analysis, I then suggest that there is still value in the approach of <b>the</b> old <b>comparative</b> economics to <b>the</b> analysis of economic outcomes. new comparative economics, old comparative economics, institutions, comparative growth...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{disputes}} {{that a strong}} contrast can be drawn between <b>the</b> Old <b>Comparative</b> Theology and <b>the</b> New <b>Comparative</b> Theology, looking particularly at the arguments of Hugh Nicholson as well as drawing on Francis Clooney. It disputes a simplistic and monolithic dismissal of <b>the</b> Old <b>Comparative</b> Theology as guilty of ‘Orientalism’, and seeks to show that in figures like Rowland Williams, as well as F. D. Maurice that the discipline was important in breaking down boundaries between traditions. Building on this, an argument is made that <b>the</b> New <b>Comparative</b> Theology {{should be seen as}} part of a lineage of progression and understanding that links it with <b>the</b> Old <b>Comparative</b> Theology and <b>the</b> Theology of Religions, and that any attempt to see these as different, or contrasting, discourses is based upon a distorted or partial historical understanding. In this the work of Tomoko Masuzawa is also assessed, and issues surrounding the terms ‘religion’ and ‘world religion’ are discussed. It is also suggested that the weight of history may be a factor as to why <b>the</b> New <b>Comparative</b> Theology came to prominence in the USA rather than in Europe, or at least the UK...|$|R

Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking <b>the</b> <b>comparative,</b> and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of comparative philology in the 19th century, together with ethnological discoveries in the 20th century, established {{the science of}} myth. Since the Romantics, all study of myth has been comparative. Wilhelm Mannhardt, James Frazer, and Stith Thompson employed <b>the</b> <b>comparative</b> approach to collect and classify the themes of folklore and mythology. In 1871 Edward Burnett Tylor published his Primitive Culture, in which he applied <b>the</b> <b>comparative</b> method {{and tried to explain}} the origin and evolution of religion.* Robert A. Segal, Theorizing about Myth, 16 Tylor's procedure of drawing together material culture, ritual and myth of widely separated cultures influenced both Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. Max Müller applied the new science of comparative mythology to the study of myth, in which he detected the distorted remains of Aryan nature worship. Bronisław Malinowski emphasized the ways myth fulfills common social functions. Claude Lévi-Strauss and other structuralists have compared the formal relations and patterns in myths throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised.

It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than <b>the</b> <b>comparative</b> patch on the black-throated.|$|E

The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6µm) in a pyroxene fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. <b>The</b> <b>comparative</b> rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur {{in the same way as}} copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source is molybdenite (MoS2). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>comparative</b> age and {{proximity}} of their stadiums {{has led to}} various discussions {{about the possibility of}} both Dundee clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium. The most recent proposal was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to jointly host the UEFA Euro 2008 championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium. With planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park, special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules at the time forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved, although it was resurrected in June 2008, following doubts about joint-host Ukraine's ability to stage Euro 2012, and the SFA's keenness to act as an alternative host.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} historiographical debate over <b>the</b> <b>comparative</b> {{strengths of the}} fleets, although they were ostensibly evenly matched in size, each containing 13 ships of the line.

This is accentuated by the weight of broadside of several of the French ships: Spartiate, Franklin, Orient, Tonnant and Guillaume Tell were each significantly larger than any individual British ship in the battle. However inadequate deployment, reduced crews, and the failure of the rear division under Villeneuve to meaningfully participate, all contributed to the French defeat.|$|E
