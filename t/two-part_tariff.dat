This {{project is a}} public-private partnership designed as a hybrid scheme based largely on the design-build-operate (DBO) model. Under this model a private operator would design and construct the system, and operate it for 30 years, including the associated demand and commercial risks.

40|$|This paper {{sets up a}} {{microeconomics}} {{model to}} analyze the market outcomes of <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> and three-part tariffs. Specifically, this paper compare the market outcomes of a single <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> to a single three-part tariffs under the assumptions that the market structure is monopolistic, there is no demand uncertainty, and demand curve is a linear straight line. The results show that a single <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> and a single three-part tariffs bring forth the same market outcomes except lump-sum fees. The lump-sum fees of the three-part tariffs are the lump-sum fees of the <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> plus the revenue loss caused by an allowance (free volume provided to customers). Therefore, according to this result, the monopolist {{has no reason to}} prefer three-part <b>tariffs</b> to <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs.</b> However, if customers do not use up all allowance or there is demand uncertainty, three-part tariffs can generate more profits to the monopolist than <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs.</b> Moreover, three-part tariffs can be used by the monopolist to raise lump-sum fees without losing customers and profits...|$|R

The same potential for higher efficiency exists for <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> at wholesale level for a given market structure, but the fixed part of the wholesale tariff can negatively affect the latter. In a simulated competition model of next-generation telecommunications access networks that has been calibrated with engineering cost data, we show that the latter effects strongly outweigh the former.

40|$|Service {{providers}} often offer {{tariff structures}} with several <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> that {{consist of a}} fixed fee and a usage price, such that consumers may pick the tariff they prefer. Prices of tariffs have significant impacts on service providers' profit, because they simultaneously influence consumers' tariff choices and their usage. The number of tariffs also plays an important role, because more tariffs segment the market better but also increase the administrative burden and require more marketing effort. This article presents a mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization problem to determine profit-maximizing tariffs; compares several heuristic search methods, in particular, the gradient method, stochastic search, and simulated annealing, to solve this problem; analyses the profitability of different tariff structures; and outlines the factors that drive differences in profitability across various tariff structures. The results show that especially for large samples of more than 100 consumers, simulated annealing performs best and deviates only 0. 2 % from the optimum. Structures with fewer <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> are generally sufficient, because additional <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> only negligibly increase service providers' profit.

50|$|Finding {{that the}} single-part tariff, {{particularly}} for Central generating stations, was conducive neither to economic generation of power as per merit-order, nor to satisfactory {{operation of the}} regional grids, the government of India adopted in 1992 a <b>two-part</b> <b>tariff</b> formula for NTPC stations based on {{the recommendations of the}} KP Rao Committee.|$|E
50|$|The <b>two-part</b> <b>tariff</b> {{is another}} form of price {{discrimination}} where the producer charges an initial fee then a secondary fee {{for the use of}} the product. An example of this is razors, you pay an initial cost for the razor and then pay for the replacement blades. This pricing strategy works because it shifts the demand curve to the right: since you have already paid for the initial blade holder you will buy the blades which are now cheaper than buying a disposable razor.|$|E

50|$|A <b>two-part</b> <b>tariff</b> (TPT) {{is a price}} {{discrimination}} technique in which {{the price of a}} product or service is composed of two parts - a lump-sum fee as well as a per-unit charge. In general, {{price discrimination}} techniques only occur in partially or fully monopolistic markets. It is designed to enable the firm to capture more consumer surplus than it otherwise would in a non-discriminating pricing environment. Two-part tariffs may also exist in competitive markets when consumers are uncertain about their ultimate demand. Health club consumers, for example, may be uncertain about their level of future commitment to an exercise regimen.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} element to remember concerning two-part tariffs {{is that it}} is still price discrimination, of which an important feature is that the product or service offered by the firm must be identical to all consumers, hence, price charged may vary, but not due to different costs borne by the firm, as this would imply a differentiated product. Thus, while credit cards which charge an annual fee plus a per-transaction fee {{is a good example of}} a <b>two-part</b> <b>tariff,</b> a fixed fee charged by a car rental company in addition to a per-kilometre fuel fee is not so good, because the fixed fee may reflect fixed costs such as registration and insurance which the firm must recoup in this manner. This can make the identification of two-part tariffs difficult.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{commodity}} taxation when firms use <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> {{in model}} of competition A la Hotelling. Three kinds of taxes are considered: a specific tax, an ad valorem {{one on the}} subscription fee and an ad valorem one on the per usage fee. We first derive the equilibrium tariffs, market shares and profits. We show that the tax on the subscription fee is profit neutral (unlike the other two) but socially costly (like the other two) as it modifies the consumption choice of the consumers. In a context of costly public funds the ad valorem taxation on the variable fee dominates specific taxation. Moreover, the ranking between ad valorem taxation on the fixed fee and an ad valorem taxation on the variable fee depends on the relative magnitude of economic parameters, in particular the degree of differentation. Finally, we show that the government might prefer the use of <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> rather than the use of more general <b>tariffs.</b> <b>two-parts</b> <b>tariffs,</b> commodity taxation...|$|R

Examining whether the merger’s potential efficiency gains can overcome its anti-competitive effects in terms of welfare, we show that when firms merge usually both of the above mentioned efficiencies are realized and they are passed on to consumers.

40|$|Two-sided market {{models in}} which {{platforms}} compete via <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs,</b> i. e. a subscription and a per-transaction fee, are often plagued by {{a continuum of}} equilibria. This paper augments existing models by allowing for heterogeneous rading behavior of agents on both sides. We show that this simple method yields a unique equilibrium even in the limit as the heterogeneity vanishes. In case of competitive bottlenecks we find that in this equilibrium platforms benefit from the possibility to price discriminate if per-transaction costs are relatively large. This is the case because <b>two-part</b> <b>tariffs</b> allow platforms to better distribute these costs among the two sides. Under two-sided single-homing price discrimination hurts platforms if per-transaction fees can be negative. ...|$|R
