40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 80 - 82) This study {{attempted to}} determine the physical and microbiological effects of ground hospital solid waste materials on a selected part of the sanitary sewerage system of the City of Los Angeles. The quality of the sewage {{and the effect of}} the sewage on the sewer pipelines were examined during the study. Ground solid waste materials were introduced into the disposal system of two hospitals. Two specially designed solid <b>waste</b> <b>grinding</b> units were installed in a major hospital which was connected to a relatively large, fast-flowing sewer line. A third grinder was installed in a smaller facility which was connected to a sewer line of minimum size and flow. A small number of sewage samples were withdrawn {{prior to the start of}} solid <b>waste</b> <b>grinding</b> and samples were withdrawn monthly for the duration of the investigation. Existing criteria and methods for physical and microbiological analyses of sewage were employed for all samples. Existing methods for evaluation of sewer pipelines were also employed. All sewage samples were analyzed by the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Standards Laboratory. Pipeline tests were performed by <b>the</b> City's industrial <b>waste</b> control officials. Sewage samples were withdrawn from a point slightly downstream from each hospital's connection to the sewer line. The results of analyses of sewage samples taken before and during the grinding operations were compared to one another and to the Los Angeles City's maximum legal levels allowed for discharge of sewage into a sewer. The same results were also compared to the average results of similar tests performed on sewage entering the City's main sewage treatment plant during the year 1968. Based on the comparative results of these analyses, it was concluded that addition of ground hospital solid wastes apparently had no significant effect on the sewage. Additional tests of this type are needed, however, before positive conclusions may be drawn. Several recommendations for similar future studies were made. Based on the results of pipeline evaluations, it was concluded that heavier solid waste materials may tend to settle in sewers with a slow rate of flow. There appeared to be no deleterious effects of ground hospital <b>wastes</b> on <b>the</b> sewer lines, however. Recommendations were made for this phase of future studies, including evaluating the condition of the pipelines prior to the start of grinding (which was not done in this study). The study results must be considered provisional in nature. Further investigation into this method of hospital solid waste disposal, however, could lead to a potential solution for a major public health problem...|$|R

Using the answers in the questionnaire, I found out which factors influence the separation of <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> with <b>the</b> population. The basic factors were the age and the gender. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to discover, whether the individual age categories differ in the separation of <b>the</b> <b>waste.</b> <b>The</b> most, <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> was always separated by inhabitants at the age between 36 ? 50 years. At least, at the age of 66 and plus: generally, younger people separated <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> more than older people, which may be caused by public education and good awareness of young people. On the contrary, old people were most often prevented from sorting out <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> by <b>the</b> illness, the distance of the containers or their unwillingness to separate was based on little knowledge and information...|$|R
