5|$|In 1913 the brothel was {{expanded}} again. A one-story structure {{was added to}} the building, increasing the number of cribs by eight; four of <b>the</b> <b>added</b> cribs opened directly onto Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley. When copper prices went up, the more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy. The Dumas also experienced an upswing in patronage. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>added</b> patronage, the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916, and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.|$|E

Some even displayed astrological models of the universe.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{and construction of}} the park, many structures were added, redesigned or modified. These changes often resulted in budget increases.

The cost of the park, as itemized in the following table, amounted to almost $500million.|$|E

5|$|Ice ages {{during the}} Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate {{to the region}} {{starting}} 2 to 3million years ago. <b>The</b> <b>added</b> precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer). With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate the Grand Canyon 2million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2million years ago.|$|E
5|$|If one removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, {{the result is a}} tree. Reversing this process, if one augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, the result is a 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of <b>the</b> <b>added</b> edge, together with <b>the</b> <b>added</b> edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If one augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, the result is again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is to start with a single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>add</b> gene encodes {{adenosine}} deaminase, and the adenine riboswitch that is upstream {{exposes the}} gene's start codon and the Shine-Dalgarno sequence when adenine {{is present in}} the binding pocket. [...] This behavior facilitates adenosine deaminase translation, and in this way, <b>the</b> <b>add</b> adenosine riboswitch contributes to a metabolic negative feedback mechanism that regulates the amount of adenine present in the system.|$|R
5000|$|LWW-Element-Set {{is similar}} to 2P-Set in that it {{consists}} of an [...] "add set" [...] and a [...] "remove set", with a timestamp for each element. Elements are added to an LWW-Element-Set by inserting the element into <b>the</b> <b>add</b> set, with a timestamp. Elements are removed from the LWW-ELement-Set by being <b>added</b> to <b>the</b> remove set, again with a timestamp. An element {{is a member of}} the LWW-Element-Set if it is in <b>the</b> <b>add</b> set, and either not in the remove set, or in the remove set but with an earlier timestamp than the latest timestamp in <b>the</b> <b>add</b> set. Merging two replicas of the LWW-Element-Set consists of taking the union of <b>the</b> <b>add</b> sets and <b>the</b> union of the remove sets. When timestamps are equal, the [...] "bias" [...] of the LWW-Element-Set comes into play. A LWW-Element-Set can be biased towards <b>adds</b> or removals. <b>The</b> advantage of LWW-Element-Set over 2P-Set is that, unlike 2P-Set, LWW-Element-Set allows an element to be reinserted after having been removed.|$|R
