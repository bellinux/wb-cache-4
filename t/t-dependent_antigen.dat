The iRNA(T) and iRNA(B) were prepared, respectively, from the thymuses of BALB/c mice and from the spleens of nude mice which had been immunized with <b>T-dependent</b> <b>antigens.</b> Injection of nude mice with both iRNA(T) and iRNA(B) caused {{an increase in the number}} of specific RFC and the secondary antibody formation response after boosting with a small dose of the corresponding antigen. Injection of iRNA(T) preparation into nude mice could induce the anamnestic response after boosting. However, neither of the iRNA(T) or iRNA(B) preparation could induce in nude mice the proliferation of the number of specific RFC.

Further analysis revealed that α-GC led to priming of class II-restricted Th cells in vivo. Additionally, we observed that α-GC enhanced production of antibodies reactive with T-independent antigen, showing the effects of NKT cells on B cells independently of Th cells.

We demonstrate that interferon gamma (IFN- gamma) stimulates, and interleukin 4 inhibits, the expression of IgG 3 by alpha delta-dexactivated cells. The production of IFN-gamma by non-T cells in response to bacterial products, possibly capsular polysaccharides, may provide an explanation underlying the ability of TI antigens, which are unable to directly stimulate T cell-derived cytokines to induce Ig isotype switching...|$|R

B-memory cell function, as judged by anti-SRBC responsiveness in vitro of spleen cells of CPS-K, was amplified by the secondary injection of SRBC into SRBC-primed mice, whereas it was decreased markedly by injection of CPS-K. When CPS-K was injected simultaneously with, or 1 or 2 days before the secondary injection of SRBC, B-memory cell function was also decreased markedly. On the other hand, CPS-K did not inhibit induction of B-memory cell function when injected simultaneouly with the primary injection of SRBC. However, CPS-K inhibited induction of B-memory cell function when injected 3 days before the primary injection of SRBC. The inhibition by CPS-K of amplification of B-memory cell function in response to SRBC when CPS-K was injected simultaneously with the secondary injection of SRBC occurred markedly in mice primed with SRBC 8 days or longer before the secondary injection, whereas it was not detectable in mice primed 3 days before. It is concluded that the CPS-K-mediated signal and the SRBC-mediated signal act competitively on the same subpopulations of B cells in induction and amplification of memory, and that the susceptibility of B cells to the CPS-K-mediated negative signal changes correspondingly with their maturation stage...|$|E

40|$|The {{cannabinoid}} receptor 2 (CB 2) {{has been reported}} to modulate B cell functions including migration, proliferation and isotype class switching. Since these processes are required for the generation of the germinal center (GC) and antigen-specific plasma and memory cells following immunization with a <b>T-dependent</b> <b>antigen,</b> CB 2 has the capacity to alter the quality and magnitude of T-dependent immune responses. To address this question, we immunized WT and CB 2 (-/-) mice with the <b>T-dependent</b> <b>antigen</b> 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrophenylacetyl (NP) -chicken-gamma-globulin (CGG) and measured GC B cell formation and the generation of antigen-specific B cells and serum immunoglobulin (Ig). While there was a significant {{reduction in the number of}} splenic GC B cells in CB 2 (-/-) mice early in the response there was no detectable difference in the number of NP-specific IgM and IgG 1 plasma cells. There was also no difference in NP-specific IgM and class switched IgG 1 in the serum. In addition, we found no defect in the homing of plasma cells to the bone marrow (BM) and affinity maturation, although memory B cell cells in the spleen were reduced in CB 2 (-/-) mice. CB 2 -deficient mice also generated similar levels of antigen-specific IgM and IgG in the serum as WT following immunization with sheep red blood cells (sRBC). This study demonstrates that although CB 2 plays a role in promoting GC and memory B cell formation/maintenance in the spleen, it is dispensable on all immune cell types required for the generation of antigen-specific IgM and IgG in T-dependent immune responses...|$|E

Phosphorylated tyrosine- 391 of CD 19 binds Vav to mediate a sustained increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. This response correlates with activation by the CD 19 –Vav complex of phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate 5 -kinase for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate.

The NAC-induced inhibitory effect might be a functional consequence of: (i) a down-regulation of the expression on the B cell surface of CD 40 and CD 27 co-stimulatory molecules and (ii) a down-regulation of interleukin (IL- 4) production. In contrast, NAC up-regulated interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. NAC did not induce any effect on the T cell-independent B cell polyclonal activation system.
