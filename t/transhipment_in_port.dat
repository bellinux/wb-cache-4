40|$|Many {{small island}} states have {{developed}} economies that are strongly dependent on tuna fisheries. Consequently, they {{are vulnerable to}} the socio-economic {{effects of climate change}} and variability, processes that are known to impact tuna fisheries distribution and productivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the impacts of climate oscillations on the tuna-dependent economy of Seychelles. Using a multiplier approach, the direct, indirect and induced economic effects of the tuna industry expenditure benefiting the Seychelles' economy declined in 1998 by 58, 26 and 35 %, respectively (mean decline: 42 %), a year of strong climate oscillation in the western Indian Ocean. Multivariate patterns in tuna purse-seine vessel expenditures in port were substantially modified by strong climate oscillations, particularly in 1998. A cointegration time-series model predicted that a 40 % decline in tuna landings and <b>transhipment</b> <b>in</b> <b>Port</b> Victoria, a value commensurate with that observed in 1998, would result in a 34 % loss for the local economy solely through reductions in cargo handling expenditures. Of several indices tested, the Indian Oscillation Index was best at predicting the probability of switching between low and high regimes of landings and transhipment, which translate into impacts for the economy. It is hypothesised that a late 2006 /early 2007 climate oscillation was compounded by prior overfishing to produce a stronger impact on the fishery and economy of Seychelles. The effects of fishing and climate variability on tuna fisheries are complex and pose significant challenges for fisheries management and the economic development of countries in the Indian Ocean...|$|E

40|$|The {{handling}} of explosives and ammunition introduces a safety risk for personnel and third parties. Accidents related to storage, transport and <b>transhipment</b> may result <b>in</b> severe injury and material damage. TNO {{has developed a}} number of tools to quantify the consequences and risks of accidental explosions. Risk {{is defined as the}} multiplication of the probability of an event and its consequences. The tools differ in their application, considering explosion safety on a military base (within the home country or on a mission), or external safety (related to third parties outside a military base). Some tools are aimed at consequences, others also give risk quantities as output. Risk-NL is our national software for the risk analysis of ammunition storage sites. The individual risk and group risk calculated with Risk-NL have to be compared to Dutch risk criteria. Specifically for <b>transhipment</b> <b>in</b> <b>ports</b> the TNO <b>Transhipment</b> Tool can be employed. In this tool the probability of an accidental explosion depends on the exact type and frequency of the transhipment. The AASTP- 5 Consequence Analysis Tool was developed for military bases abroad, taking into account the protection offered by specific armoured containers against various threats. This tool has been integrated in the latest version of the NATO Field Storage Manual AASTP- 5, and is available for member nations. In the research program ‘Survivability of Compounds’, funded by the Dutch MoD this tool was further developed to predict not only physical consequences, but also consequence for the mission goals (i. e. at the system level). The Klotz Group Engineering Tool has been developed together with international partners in the Klotz Group, a group of explosives safety experts from 8 nations. This tool predicts the hazard from accidental explosions in reinforced concrete ammunition storage sites in detail. By comparing various scenarios the tools described above can also be used in cost-benefit analysis.

40|$|Europe Combined Terminals is a {{container}} <b>transhipment</b> company <b>in</b> the <b>port</b> of Rotterdam. Since the establishment in 1966, ECT grew fast. In the mean time ECT became {{the biggest and}} most advanced container <b>transhipment</b> company <b>in</b> Europe. ECT has two locations of <b>transhipment</b> <b>in</b> the <b>port</b> of Rotterdam. The first location is in the 'Eemhaven', the 'Home Terminal'. The second location of transhipment is the 'Maasvlakte', the 'Delta Terminal'. In the 'Eemshaven' the container <b>transhipment</b> takes place <b>in</b> a conventional way with manned equipment. The 'Delta Terminal' contains four terminals. The Delta Multi User terminal is a conventional terminal. The remaining three terminals (the Delta Dedicated North terminal, the Delta Dedicated East terminal and the Delta Dedicated West terminal) use a mainly automatic system. The quay transport and the stack are fully automatic. The landside still uses manned equipment. The partly automatic system that is described above does not always perform at the required level. The performance is expressed <b>in</b> terms like <b>port</b> time of vessels, the quay crane productivity, the waiting time of the truck drivers etcetera. Alternative terminal concepts have to be designed {{in order to be able}} to reach te desired level. The setting during this research is the second 'Maasvlakte'. The improved terminal concept design is studied here from a stacking system point of view. The various stacking systems used <b>in</b> the container <b>transhipment</b> and also new concepts of stacking systems are studied. By means of a multi criteria analysis, three stacking systems are selected. These systems are: the Autmatic Stacking (ASC) Crane System, the Overhead Bridge Crane (OHBC) System and the high bay warehouse. After this a comparison has been made between the ASC-system and the OHBC-system with use of the criteria use of space, transfer capacity, flexibility, reliability and costs. The comparison not only contains the two systems, but also the various lay-outs (particulary the placing of the transferpoints) of the systems. Because of the variety of concepts and the superficial research of these concepts, it was not possible to compare the high bay warehouse with the ASC- and OHBC-system on the same level. A quick scan has been made of the various concepts of the high stacking system. The comparison between the ASC-system and the OHBC-system shows that there is no obvious preference for one of the systems above. Higher cost of ground shows an increasive attractiviness of the OHBC-system. The comparison does show clearly that a stack lay-out with the transferpoints as a transport lane in the stack, offers great benefits in relation to the present lay-out with the transferpoints on top of the stackarea's. The lay-out with the transferpoints in the stacking area, stacks more containers per substack than the present lay-out. The waterside and landside transport takes place with the Automatic Lifting Vehicle (self unloading Automatic Guided Vehicle). Rough it was found that the all the concepts of the high bay warehouse are much more space effective than the ASC- and OHBC-system. If the cost of ground is high, a comprehensive study of the high bay warehouse is strongly recommendedCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{network of}} container transport services, both {{on land and}} at sea, is becoming increasingly fine-meshed. The {{growth in the number}} of intermodal transfer points on the land side, at the sea–land interface in the seaports and at the connecting points of liner services <b>in</b> <b>transhipment</b> <b>ports</b> leads to an increasing number of routing options for a container flow between two regions somewhere on the globe. This increase complicates forecasting the container throughput of a <b>port</b> <b>in</b> the traditional way by linking it directly to a specific hinterland area. In the approach presented here, a port is considered as a nodal point in a network of container routings, where the routings using a certain port add up to the port's container throughput. The model presented here is intended to explain the market share of the port's routings for each of the traffic zones or regions that comprise a port's potential hinterland. Explanatory variables include transport cost, transit time, frequency of service and indicators of quality of service. A logit model is used to quantify the routing choice and to derive from that a demand function to be used for port traffic forecasting and for the economic and financial evaluation of container port projects. The authors had the opportunity to calibrate logit models in the framework of the evaluation of the Maasvlakte- 2 container <b>port</b> expansion project <b>in</b> the <b>port</b> of Rotterdam.

40|$|Studies of {{food and}} foodways are vital to {{exploring}} past (and present) cultures. The food remains discovered {{at the port of}} Quseir al-Qadim are especially revealing, offering important information about the ancient spice trade and the food practices of those engaged in this trade. Quseir al-Qadim acted as a <b>transhipment</b> <b>port</b> <b>in</b> the Indian Ocean spice trade during both the Roman and medieval Islamic periods. It is located on the Red Sea coast of Egypt and was active between ca. AD 1 – 250 (Myos Hormos) and again during ca. AD 1050 – 1500 (Kusayr). This monograph describes the analysis and interpretation of the botanical remains (foodstuffs, wood) recovered during the excavations that took place between 1999 – 2003, conducted by the University of Southampton, UK. The spectacular preservation conditions at Quseir al-Qadim meant that food remains and wood were found in abundance, including fragments of onion skin, citrus rind, garlic cloves, aubergine seeds, banana skins, wooden bowls, spoons and combs, as well as many of the Eastern spices traded through the port, such as black pepper, ginger, cardamom and betelnut. These remains are fully analysed and discussed under three overarching themes: trade, agricultural innovation and food consumption. The results provide significant new evidence for the Eastern trade and for the changes in agriculture that indirectly resulted from it. They also allow real insights into the lives of those working <b>in</b> the <b>ports.</b> They show the changes in the nature and scale of the Indian Ocean trade between the Roman and Islamic periods, as well as a major shift in the way the inhabitants of the ports saw themselves and located themselves in the wider world. Richly illustrated and thought-provoking, this volume identifies how studies of food enable fuller dialogues regarding ‘globalization’ and also highlights clearly the importance of food in the dynamics of cultural identity and geopolitics.

40|$|Persistent {{development}} in global trade has significantly increased {{the demand for}} liner shipping, of which the industry is now being characterised by larger vessel size, comprehensive geographical coverage and frequent restructuring of shipping lines like <b>transhipment.</b> <b>In</b> turn, {{this has led to}} tense port competition, and port attractiveness is playing a pivotal role in this aspect. Understanding this and using container transhipment as a case study, this paper investigates the attractiveness of the major <b>ports</b> <b>in</b> Northern Europe acting as transhipment hubs. Through a Likert-style questionnaire directed towards the top 30 shipping lines, it was found that Hamburg and Rotterdam are the most attractive options acting as transhipment hubs within Northern Europe, with Antwerp and Bremerhaven closely behind. Felixstowe and Le Havre are the least attractive options requiring substantial improvements to change the current situation. In general, the opinion of shipping lines <b>in</b> <b>port</b> attractiveness seems to be in accordance to their decisions on transhipment hub choices. It is believed that this paper can shed some light on the attractiveness of major North European ports and the methodology of assessing port attractiveness, as well as providing a springboard for further research related to port competition.

40|$|The port of Gdansk {{located at}} the mouth of the Vistula has a {{tradition}} of over a thousand years and is firmly connected with both the Polish and world sea trade. In 1970 s construction of a new deep-water Northern Port was started. The next decade was less favourable when an economical and political crisis adversely affected the size and structure of the port turnovers. A new period for the port of Gdansk started after 1989. At present the port of Gdansk is the biggest port on the Baltic Sea, capable of servicing ships of "Balti-max" class. The port consists of two parts - the inner port {{located at the}} mouth of the Martwa Wisła (the Dead Vistula) and the outer port - protruding into the sea, modern, deep-water Northern Port capable of servicing ships up to 150 thousand tons of dead-weight capacity and draught up to 15 m. Two specialist transhipment terminals were located here - of coal and liquid fuels (rebuilt in 1998). The second terminal is linked by a system of pipelines with the Refinery of Gdansk, with the Petrochemistry of Płock, with Russia and with refineries in Germany. The size of <b>transhipments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>port</b> of Gdansk remained at the level of 16. 5 - 20. 5 m tons in 1995 - 1999. It is not much <b>in</b> comparison with <b>transhipment</b> capacity of the port that is 55 m tons. Through the ferry terminal of PZB (Polska Żegluga Bałtycka - Polish Baltic Navigation) pass yearly from 97 thousand to 125 thousand passengers. Regular sailing lines link the port with ports of Sweden, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, Egypt, the Red Sea, India Sea and the Caribbean. A forecast for transhipment turnovers of the port of Gdansk until 2010 assumes two variants. A pessimistic variant takes, among others, an assumption of maintaining the land character of trade exchange of Poland and lack of development for transport links between the port and the hinterland An optimistic variant forecasts a favourable pace of the country's economic growth, a high increase in turnovers of the Polish foreign trade, especially in exports. An increase in competitiveness, a development of all fields of activity <b>in</b> the <b>port,</b> a full use of the port space, and improvement of transport links with the hinterland - all this will substantially affect an increase <b>in</b> <b>transhipment</b> turnovers. Important advantages to achieve such assumptions are proper bathymetric conditions and free terrain <b>in</b> the outer <b>port,</b> enabling location of large investments. In 1998 a terminal for import of liquid petrochemical gas (LPG) was opened. Rudoport (Oreport) and Europort will operate a modernised ore pier. Rudoport is going to import iron ores. In autumn of 2000 Europort will start its operation; it is a modern terminal of transhipment of grain and feed. It will serve for transhipment of grain and feed coming from Canada and the USA, and going to states of the former USSR, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The next investment will be a terminal of liquid chemical and oil-derived products. Further plans forecast construction of a terminal for natural gas (LNG). A novelty <b>in</b> the <b>port</b> is to be a huge container terminal with a yearly transhipment capacity of 500 thousand TEU. Container ships carrying up to 6 thousand TEU will be able to harbour here. It will cover a few dozen hectares <b>in</b> the Northern <b>Port.</b> <b>In</b> the hinterland of the terminal the Baltic Logistic Centre will come into being. A condition for development of the forecast investments is the fastest possible construction of the highway A-l and linking it with the <b>port.</b> <b>In</b> mid- 1999 construction of a bridge over the Dead Vistula was started. The bridge will be a fragment of a new ring road that will link the port with exit roads in the direction of Warsaw, Bydgoszcz and Łódź, and the ring road around the Gdansk agglomeration (then with the highway A-l). For 2002 construction of a tunnel (under the port canal) is planned. This enterprise will eliminate heavy car traffic that has to pass from the western part of the port through the crowded centre of Gdansk; it will improve transport within the port itself and will link the western part of the port with the national road network. Implementation of the presented above plans may substantially contribute to making at the same time the oldest and largest port on the Baltic one of the best and competitive ones on the Baltic and European market of sea trade in the coming 21 st century.

40|$|Traditionally, {{maritime}} economists, {{ports and}} shipping lines have considered container transhipment {{to be more}} expensive than direct call services, mainly {{by virtue of the}} extra feeder costs and container lift charges involved. This seems contrary to ongoing industry developments, with transhipment hubs now quite common in most major regions. Here, modelled costs for <b>transhipment</b> <b>in</b> northern Europe have been estimated and compared with an alternative multiport service. The conclusion is that transhipment can offer substantial operating and capital cost advantages compared with multiport direct call services. The explanation for transhipment advantages relates to diseconomies both at sea and <b>in</b> <b>port</b> associated with multiport style itineraries, coupled with container handling cost and productivity advantages pertaining to pure transhipment terminals, added to enhanced feedership economies of scale. In line with a move towards hub–hub shuttles and associated feeder services, these results indicate that further developments might be expected in regard to offshore transhipment hub terminals being provided as low-cost container transfer points for very large vessels. Policy makers {{need to be aware of}} the net benefits, both ecological and economic, resulting from increased use of offshore transhipment terminals as an alternative to continued artificial development (and duplication) of big ship container terminal capacity within constrained traditional port locations, and any requirement for support thereof.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues <b>in</b> <b>Transhipment</b> Container Terminal (TCT) management is to have fairly reliable and affordable predictions about vessel arrival. Terminal operators need to estimate the actual time of arrival <b>in</b> <b>port</b> <b>in</b> order to determine the daily demand for each work shift with greater accuracy. In this way, the resources required (human resources, equipment as well as spatial resources) can be allocated more efficiently. Despite contractual obligations to notify the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) 24 hours before arrival, ship operators often have to revise it due to unexpected events like weather conditions, delay <b>in</b> a previous <b>port</b> and so on. For planners the decision-making processes related to this topic can sometimes be so complex without the support of suitable methodological tools.

30|$|Low density, {{high value}} goods (LDHV) require faster, more reliable, {{door-to-door}} transport services [18] and road {{is the preferred}} mode for hauls of around 200  km. A recent study revealed that over longer distances, such as 500  km, road transport dominates on many European corridors [19]. Examining the nature/characteristics of transport modes, we found that rail (and waterways) transport is dependent on road for door-to-door service, and requires <b>transhipment</b> <b>in</b> terminals, involving extra cost and time, {{as well as a}} higher risk of loss, damage and delay. This presents a challenging market for rail freight service providers, but also a significant opportunity. The potential LDHV market is estimated to be 1.9 billion tonnes, or 12 % of the total tonnage currently transported by road, in the EU- 27 and Switzerland (CH), over distances of 200  km. [18].|$|R
50|$|The port {{benefits}} from the natural depth of its water (up to 18 meters) and offers {{one of the longest}} linear quays available in the Mediterranean (3.4 kilometers). These characteristics, together with the availability of dedicated equipment (22 Ship-to-shore cranes, reaching up to 23 rows of containers) and specialized know how (over 1300 employees) enable the port to serve simultaneously 4 Ultra Large Container Carriers, a unique feature among Mediterranean ports.The throughput of the port reached 3.467.772 million TEUs in 2008, then declined consistently from 2009 to 2011, reflecting the global economic crisis. From 2011 to 2013 the traffic volumes in Gioia Tauro increased, but then fell again between 2013 and 2015, suffering from the difficult conditions of the <b>transhipment</b> market <b>in</b> the Mediterranean and the competition from other major <b>transhipment</b> hubs <b>in</b> Greece, Egypt and Malta.|$|R
