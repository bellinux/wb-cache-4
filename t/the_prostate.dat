40|$|Several chronic {{studies in}} rats {{indicating}} that cadmium exposure can induce tumors of <b>the</b> ventral <b>prostate</b> {{have recently been}} completed in our laboratory. In one such study, a single dose of cadmium, s. c., increased prostatic tumor incidence only at doses below 5. 0 mumol/kg, the approximate threshold for cadmium-induced testicular damage. In a further study, prostatic tumors were elevated with higher doses of cadmium (30 mumol/kg, s. c.) if testicular damage was prevented by zinc pretreatment. Most recently, we found that dietary cadmium (25 to 200 micrograms/g) also can increase prostatic neoplastic lesions, but these were reduced by zinc-deficient diets. Thus it appears that cadmium produces prostatic tumors only if testicular function is maintained. Furthermore, we find that metallothionein (MT), a protein associated with cadmium tolerance, may be deficient in <b>the</b> rat <b>prostate,</b> and <b>the</b> prostatic MT gene, {{at least in the}} ventral lobe, is unresponsive to metal stimuli. In liver, MT gene expression, as assessed by MT- 1 mRNA, was quite apparent in control tissue and was induced in a dose-dependent manner 24 hr following cadmium exposure (1 to 10 mumol/kg, s. c.). However, in <b>the</b> ventral <b>prostate</b> very low constitutive levels of MT- 1 mRNA were detected and increases did not occur with cadmium exposure.

If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the binding of secretory proteins in <b>the</b> ventral <b>prostate</b> to <b>the</b> surface of sperm. METHODS: We used different techniques {{to demonstrate the}} possibility of ventral prostate secretory proteins binding to sperm in golden hamsters. Polyclonal antibodies against crude secretion of <b>the</b> ventral <b>prostate</b> cultured in rabbits were used to detect the antigens in hamster epididymal, uterine and oviductal spermatozoa by indirect immunofluorescence technique. The uterine and oviductal spermatozoa were collected after mating with the males with or without ventral <b>prostate</b> glands. <b>The</b> ventral <b>prostate</b> secretory proteins were isolated and transblotted to the membrane, which was incubated with the biotinylated epididymal sperm membrane proteins, and then the biotinylated binding proteins were stained. RESULTS: An immunoreaction restricted to the middle piece was observed in the sperm incubated with <b>the</b> ventral <b>prostate</b> secretion and ejaculated sperm recovered from the uteri and oviducts. The rate of the epididymal sperm bound with <b>the</b> ventral <b>prostate</b> secretory proteins was (80 +/- 5) %, and the rats of the sperm binding to <b>the</b> ventral <b>prostate</b> secretory proteins were (30. 0 +/- 4. 6) % from the uterus and (16. 0 +/- 3. 6) % from the oviduct after mating with the males with ventral prostate glands, significantly higher than after mating with those without prostate glands (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Background: The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the indications for a second prostate biopsy in patients suspected with prostate cancer after an initial negative <b>prostate</b> biopsy. Methods: <b>The</b> present study included 421 patients who underwent repeat prostate biopsy between January 2007 and December 2015 at three hospitals. Clinicopathological data, including patient age, body mass index, history of prostate biopsy, prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, PSA density, PSA velocity, and PSA fluctuation patterns, were analyzed. The patients were stratified into two groups based on the first PSA pattern (increase/decrease) within 1 year after <b>the</b> initial negative <b>prostate</b> biopsy. Results: Prostate cancer was detected in 100 (23. 8 %) of the 421 patients at <b>the</b> second <b>prostate</b> biopsy.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>prostate</b> {{is a part}} of {{the male}} {{reproductive}} system that helps make and store seminal fluid. In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3 centimeters long and weighs about 20 grams. It is located in the pelvis, under the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. <b>The</b> <b>prostate</b> surrounds part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder during urination and semen during ejaculation. Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely defecation. <b>The</b> <b>prostate</b> contains many small glands which make about 20% of the fluid constituting semen. In prostate cancer, the cells of these prostate glands mutate into cancer cells. <b>The</b> <b>prostate</b> glands require male hormones, known as androgens, to work properly. Androgens include testosterone, which is made in the testes; dehydroepiandrosterone, made in the adrenal glands; and dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone within <b>the</b> <b>prostate</b> itself. Androgens are also responsible for secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.|$|E

Dogs can produce in one hour as much prostatic fluid as a human can in a day. They excrete this fluid along with their urine to mark their territory. In many rodents and bats, the prostatic fluid contains a coagulant. This mixes with and coagulates semen during copulation to form a mating plug that temporarily prevents further copulation.
