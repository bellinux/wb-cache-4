5|$|The Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In some areas, pasties are a {{significant}} tourist attraction, including an annual Pasty Fest in Calumet, Michigan in late June.

5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>and,</b> although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} March 1958 {{to enlarge the}} village to house a {{population}} of 15,000 and the basics were completed {{by the time that}} the French granted independence on 28 November 1960. Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>and</b> became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.|$|E
5|$|Operation Leader was a {{successful}} air attack conducted by the United States Navy against German shipping {{in the vicinity of}} Bodø, Norway, on 4 October 1943, during World War II.

The American airmen located many German and Norwegian ships in <b>this</b> <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> are believed to have destroyed five and damaged another seven. Two German aircraft searching for the Allied fleet were shot down as well. Three American aircraft were destroyed in combat during the operation, and another crashed while landing.|$|E

5|$|Problems {{with water}} quality {{in some of}} the former Manchester Docks basins became {{apparent}} with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters of <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>and</b> decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air injection system was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality {{to such an extent that}} the number of invertebrate species present, like freshwater shrimp, increased by more than30. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{area near}} the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich {{rainforest}} {{and part of the}} Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests ecoregion, an important centre for biodiversity. It is habitat for the drill monkey, which is found in the wild only in <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>and</b> across the border in Cameroon. The areas surrounding Calabar, Cross River State, also in this forest, are believed to contain the world's largest diversity of butterflies. The area of southern Nigeria between the Niger and the Cross Rivers has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population, with it being replaced by grassland (see Cross-Niger transition forests).|$|E
5|$|The largest {{source of}} wealth for Plymouth Colony was the fur trade. The {{disruption}} of this trade caused by Myles Standish's raid at Wessagussett created great hardship for the colonists {{for many years to}} come, and was directly cited by William Bradford as a contributing factor to the colonists' economic difficulties in their early years. The colonists attempted to supplement their income by fishing; the waters in Cape Cod bay were known to be excellent fisheries. However, they lacked any skill in <b>this</b> <b>area,</b> <b>and</b> it did little to relieve their economic hardship. The colony traded throughout the region, establishing trading posts as far away as Penobscot, Maine. They were also frequent trading partners with the Dutch at New Amsterdam.|$|E

5|$|The semi-final, against Everton, {{was played}} at Villa Park. Everton were renowned for their {{powerful}} midfield of Ball, Harvey and Kendall, but opted to play more defensively than usual.

Mike Doyle suffered an injury in the first half, and spent 20 minutes off the field. City had the better of the game, but goalscoring chances were missed by Lee and Young. With little time remaining, Young forced a corner. Young took the corner himself, from which teenager Tommy Booth scored the game's only goal.|$|E

5|$|Whilst Bowlby's early {{writings}} on maternal deprivation {{may be seen}} as part of the background to the later development of attachment theory, there are many significant differences between the two. At the time of the 1951 publication, there was little research in <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>and</b> no comprehensive theory on the development of early relationships. Aside from its central proposition of the importance of an early, continuous and sensitive relationship, the monograph concentrates mostly on social policy. For his subsequent development of attachment theory, Bowlby drew on concepts from ethology, cybernetics, information processing, developmental psychology and psychoanalysis. The first early formal statements of attachment theory were presented in three papers in 1958, 1959 and 1960. His major work Attachment was published in three volumes between 1969 and 1980. Attachment theory revolutionised thinking on the nature of early attachments and extensive research continues to be undertaken.|$|E
