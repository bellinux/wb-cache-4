25|$|To {{learn the}} Tironian note system, scribes {{required}} formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; by the Classical period (c. 7th century BC to 5th century AD), the number increased to some 5,000 symbols {{and then to}} some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD); the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. Sigla were mostly used in lapidary inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> indecipherable.|$|E
25|$|Networks {{of various}} sorts play an {{integral}} part in many theories of semantic memory. Generally speaking, a network is composed {{of a set of}} nodes connected by links. The nodes may represent concepts, words, perceptual features, or nothing at all. The links may be weighted such <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> stronger than others or, equivalently, have a length such that some links take longer to traverse than others. All these features of networks have been employed in models of semantic memory, examples of which are found below.|$|E

25|$|The first {{recognition}} of widespread sedimentary rock on Mars {{came from the}} Mars Orbiter Camera which found that several areas of the planet - including Valles Marineris and Terra Arabia - have horizontally layered, light-toned rocks. Follow-up observations of those rocks' mineralogy by OMEGA found <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> rich in sulfate minerals, and that other layered rocks around Mawrth Vallis are rich in phyllosilicates. Both class of minerals are signatures of sedimentary rocks. CRISM has used its improved spatial resolution to look for other deposits of sedimentary rock on Mars' surface, and for layers of sedimentary rock buried between layers of volcanic rock in Mars' crust.|$|E
25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots have the {{distinction}} of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see Alex). Parrots and the corvid family of crows, ravens, and jays are considered the most intelligent of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest HVCs. Dr. Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at UCSD who has studied the physiology of birds, has discovered that the lower parts of avian brains {{are similar to those of}} humans.|$|E
25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots are able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> able to {{associate}} words with their meanings and form simple sentences. Along with crows, ravens, and jays (family Corvidae), parrots are considered the most intelligent of birds. The brain-to body size ratio of psittacines and corvines is {{comparable to that of}} higher primates. One argument against the supposed intelligent capabilities of bird species is that birds have a relatively small cerebral cortex, which is {{the part of the brain}} considered the main area of intelligence in other animals. However, birds use a different part of the brain, the mediorostral HVC as the seat of their intelligence. These species tend to have the largest hyperstriata, and Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who studied bird physiology, has discovered that the lower part of the avian brain is functionally similar to that in humans. Not only have parrots demonstrated intelligence through scientific testing of their language-using ability, but also some species of parrots such as the kea are also highly skilled at using tools and solving puzzles.|$|E

Negative reviewers tended to feel that the show was not as substantial as it could have <b>been,</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> material <b>was</b> poorly chosen or ill-matched to the performers, and <b>that</b> <b>some</b> performances <b>were</b> not successful (notably Wopat).|$|R
25|$|Superficially {{lanthanide}} complexes {{are similar}} to those of the transition metals in <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> coloured. However, for the common Ln3+ ions (Ln = lanthanide) the colors are all pale, and hardly influenced by the nature of the ligand. The colors are due to 4f electron transitions. As the 4f orbitals in lanthanides are “buried” in the xenon core and shielded from the ligand by the 5s and 5p orbitals they are therefore not influenced by the ligands to any great extent leading to a much smaller crystal field splitting than in the transition metals. The absorption spectra of an Ln3+ ion approximates to that of the free ion where the electronic states are described by spin-orbit coupling (also called L-S coupling or Russell-Saunders coupling). This contrasts to the transition metals where the ground state is split by the crystal field. Absorptions for Ln3+ are weak as electric dipole transitions are parity forbidden (Laporte Rule forbidden) but can gain intensity due to the effect of a low-symmetry ligand field or mixing with higher electronic states (e.g. d orbitals). Also absorption bands are extremely sharp which contrasts with those observed for transition metals which generally have broad bands. This can lead to extremely unusual effects, such as significant color changes under different forms of lighting.|$|E
