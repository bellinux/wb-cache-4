5|$|Martin and Halcli waived {{their rights}} to the Article 32 hearing, meaning that their cases could move {{immediately}} to court-martial or administrative action. Wickson was given immunity by USAF Lieutenant General Eugene Santarelli, commander of the 17th Air Force, <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> the hearings. The AWACS crew members' hearing, which began on 19 October 1994 at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma was an open hearing and presided over by Colonel William Colwell, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Lieutenant General Stephen Croker, USAF, commander of the 8th Air Force. May's hearing, beginning on 7 November 1994 at Sembach Air Base, Germany was a closed hearing and presided over by Colonel Edward M. Starr, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Santarelli. Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and O'Brien declined requests <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> either hearing.|$|E
5|$|McCormack {{transferred}} to the United States Air Force on 25 July 1950. After leaving the AEC in August 1951, he became Special Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Development. In January 1952 he was appointed Director of Nuclear Applications at the Air Research and Development Center in Baltimore, Maryland. He was subsequently promoted to major general, and became Deputy Commander of the Air Research and Development Command. He was called <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> the Oppenheimer security hearing. Like other witnesses, McCormack testified that Oppenheimer was loyal, and that while {{the two men had}} disagreed over the merits of the Super, that he saw nothing dishonest or disloyal in Oppenheimer's opposition to it.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was acquitted}} {{on all four}} counts brought against him. Celestin, who shares a story credit on The Birth of a Nation, was convicted of sexual assault and {{received}} a six-month to one-year prison sentence in 2001, later raised to {{two to four years}} per state sentencing guidelines. Appealing the case on grounds of ineffective counsel at the first trial, Celestin's initial conviction was overturned in 2005 and he was granted a new trial to rehear the charges. Despite the accuser's willingness <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> a second trial, prosecutors declined because other witnesses had scattered all over the world.|$|E
5000|$|Previously, {{victims were}} able <b>to</b> attend and <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> parole {{consideration}} hearings with either their {{next of kin}} and up to two members of their immediate family, or two representatives. The measure removed the limit {{on the number of}} family members, and allows victim representatives <b>to</b> attend and <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> the hearing without regard to whether members of the victim's family were present.|$|R
50|$|The panel {{determined}} that Mr. Nixon was too ill <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> for <b>at</b> least six weeks. But the doctors {{made a point}} of protecting the confidentiality of the former President's medical records and refused to cite a reason for recommending against his testifying. Mr. Nixon never testified.|$|R

While the Cray family is watching the Everglades episode on television, Wahoo receives {{a phone call from}} Tuna, who is now living with her mother, Gordon's estranged wife, in Chicago. Neither of them is looking forward <b>to</b> <b>testifying</b> <b>at</b> Gordon's criminal trial, but Tuna promises that, regardless, she and her mother will be visiting Florida again. They promise to meet up again soon, addressing each other by the nicknames they pinned on each other during the adventure, [...] "Lance" [...] and [...] "Lucille." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{family members}} are afraid <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> the mock trial and at the real deposition; Buster fakes a coma, Lindsay and Lucille fake {{entering}} rehab, and Gob flees the country to perform in a USO Tour in Iraq. The deceptions are all uncovered by the prosecution, and in Iraq Gob is arrested for inadvertently inciting an anti-US riot. Buster and Michael travel to Iraq to rescue Gob, and while there, uncover evidence that the mini-palaces George Sr. built in Iraq were actually ordered and {{paid for by the}} CIA for wiretapping purposes. After this discovery, the US government drops all of the charges against George Sr. In the general confusion, everyone except George Michael forgets Maeby's sixteenth birthday.|$|E
5|$|The Glina massacres were {{killings of}} Serb peasants {{in the town}} of Glina in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) that {{occurred}} between May and August 1941, during World War II. The first wave of massacres in the town began on 11 or 12 May 1941, when a band of Ustaše led by Mirko Puk murdered a group of Serb men and boys in a Serbian Orthodox church before setting it on fire. The following day, approximately 100 Serb males were murdered by the Ustaše in the nearby village of Prekopi. Estimates of the overall number of Serbs killed from 11–13 May range from 260 to 417. Further killings in Glina occurred between 30 July and 3 August of that same year, when 700–2,000 Serbs were massacred by a group of Ustaše led by Vjekoslav Luburić. Ljubo Jednak, the only survivor of these killings, went on <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> the trials of the several prominent figures in the NDH after the war. Puk was captured by British forces in 1945 while attempting to flee to Austria and was extradited to Yugoslavia the following year, where he committed suicide. Luburić escaped Yugoslavia after the war and moved to fascist Spain, where he was killed by a person generally assumed to be an agent of the Yugoslav State Security Service.|$|E

5000|$|Lipka {{pleaded guilty}} {{and was sentenced}} by United States District Judge Charles Weiner to 18 years imprisonment, and fined $10,000. In addition, {{he was ordered to}} repay the $10,000 he had {{received}} from [...] "Sergei Nikitin" [...] in the FBI's sting operation. [...] His guilty plea meant that Mitrokhin would not have <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> publicly <b>at</b> a trial.|$|R

25|$|February 26 {{was chosen}} because the {{officers}} {{had been able to}} arrange to have themselves and their allies serve as duty officers on that date, facilitating their access to arms and ammunition.

25|$|Young {{is known}} to have filed a missing person's report with Chicago Police, before unsuccessfully {{requesting}} money from Nelson's parents to finance a search for their son. When Nelson's two brothers arrived in Chicago to search for their missing brother, Young offered both brothers a job with Gacy's construction company. Young was never summoned <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> Gacy's trial as to the circumstances surrounding Nelson's disappearance.|$|E
60|$|Is that it? We {{shall never}} know. For Mrs. Eddy is liable <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> again <b>at</b> any time. But until she does it, I think we must {{conclude}} that the Deity was Author of the whole book, and Mrs. Eddy merely His telephone and stenographer. Granting this, her claim as the Voice of God stands-for the present--justified and established.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to Bonin's {{impending}} trials, both Miley and Munro {{had agreed}} <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> against Bonin <b>at</b> both trials {{in exchange for}} being spared the death penalty, with Deputy District Attorney Stirling Norris also agreeing to seek the dismissal of additional charges of sodomy and robbery filed against Munro if he honored his agreement <b>to</b> <b>testify.</b> In the case of Miley, Norris agreed to accept two separate pleas of guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment, with a possibility of parole after 25 years, if Miley agreed <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> against Bonin <b>at</b> both upcoming trials. (Prior to his suicide, Vernon Butts never formally agreed <b>to</b> either <b>testify</b> against Bonin, or to accept any form of plea bargain.) ...|$|R
5|$|Additionally, three doctors {{involved}} in Smith's treatment during her incarceration challenged {{the expansion of}} the inquest to include events that took place outside the province of Ontario.

25|$|The coroner's jury {{concluded}} that Spence and his accomplices were the suspects in Morgan's assassination. Spence immediately {{turned himself in}} {{so that he would}} be protected in Behan's jail. When the prosecution called her <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> Spence's preliminary hearing, the defense objected because her testimony was hearsay and because a spouse could not testify against her husband. The judge agreed and dismissed the charges.|$|E
25|$|A December 2011 {{article in}} the Huffington Post noted that Kennedy dissented on an {{interpretation}} of the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses, where a lab tech who created a forensic report on a case is required <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> trial if called. His dissent, joined by Roberts, Breyer, and Alito, claimed that the rule would place a burden on understaffed labs. However, in Williams v. Illinois, Kennedy sided with Scalia's interpretation of the amendment.|$|E

25|$|This {{case against}} the Wests would {{collapse}} when Anna Marie and her 13-year-old half-sister declined <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> the court case on 7 June 1993, with the child rape victim expressing her desire {{to return to her}} family, and Anna Marie choosing to withdraw her statement both because of her noting the misery of her younger siblings, and her fear of Rose's vindictiveness. Shortly thereafter, Anna Marie spoke further with DC Savage, further emphasising that her mother Rena and half-sister Charmaine were also missing.|$|E

25|$|Bowes asked Gowrie if {{he would}} send them to Elizabeth, {{saying that he had}} made {{previous}} arrangements for this, and established that Gowrie got them from Sanders Jordan.

Gowrie explained that the letters were still relevant to those who deposed the Queen. Bowes argued that recent events and establishments were confirmed by acts of parliament and public instruments and the letters were not now significant. Gowrie would not give him the letters.|$|E
25|$|Custer's 7th Cavalry was {{originally}} scheduled to leave Fort Abraham Lincoln on April 6, 1876, but on March 15 he {{was summoned to}} Washington <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>at</b> congressional hearings.
