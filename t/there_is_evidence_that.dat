5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigated whether improvement {{can sometimes}} {{increase the likelihood}} that the recipient will use increasingly more coercive actions to attempt to obtain further improvement from the giver. It also investigated how it would do so. The source of the research question was a paradoxical real-life phenomenon, that of improvement sometimes preceding such extreme actions as revolutions and strikes.;Two studies were performed in which subjects worked on tasks, received pay from a fictitious manager, and communicated with the manager about the pay. In study 1, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> large and small improvement increased contentment and decreased perceived strength. Their effects on aspiration level <b>were</b> not clear. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> large improvement decreased perceived conflict and that small improvement increased it, though the latter only among males. Finally, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> large improvement decreased escalation likelihood and that small improvement increased it.;It was proposed that the mixed results regarding small improvement 2 ̆ 7 s effects on perceived conflict may have been due to small improvement having different short and long term effects on perceived conflict. Study 2 tested whether a short series of small improvements decreased perceived conflict and thereby escalation likelihood, and whether a long series increased both. The results of study 2 replicated those of study 1, except that small improvement 2 ̆ 7 s effect on contentment was not clear. Also, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> both large and small improvement increased aspiration level. Small improvement did not have different short and long term effects on perceived conflict, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> other <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> as in study 1 a long series of small improvements increased perceived conflict among males and decreased it among females. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> no differences between the short and long term effects of small improvement on contentment, aspiration level or perceived strength. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the short series of small improvements decreased escalation likelihood and the long series of small improvements increased it. Thus, the present research demonstrated that long term small improvement received in response to active seeking leads to the escalation of instrumental actions, but exactly how it does so was not uncovered...|$|R
5|$|In {{a species}} of marine green algae Ulvaria obscura, a major {{component}} of some algal blooms, dopamine is present in very high concentrations, estimated at 4.4% of dry weight. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> this dopamine functions as an anti-herbivore defense, reducing consumption by snails and isopods.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tropics}} {{there is little}} {{variation}} in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always warm enough for a food supply, but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> this enables the migrants to obtain more of their preferred foods such as fruits.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation is a more intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
