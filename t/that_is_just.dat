5|$|Located about 1.8° west of Epsilon (ε) Tauri is T Tauri, the {{prototype}} of a class of variable stars called T Tauri stars. This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between magnitude 9 to 13 {{over a period of}} weeks or months. This is a newly formed stellar object <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a main sequence star. The surrounding reflection nebula NGC 1555 is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity. To the north lies Kappa Tauri, a visual double star consisting of two A7-type components. The pair have a separation of just 5.6 arc minutes, making them a challenge to split with the naked eye.|$|E

The redistricting that followed the 2000 census also gave Moran a portion of Reston, Virginia. His district {{is located in the}} Dulles Technology Corridor and is the home of many federal defense contractors as well as a significant number of those who work in the information technology industry. Many federal employees also reside within the district, mostly due to its proximity to Washington and because the United States Department of Defense and various other agencies are headquartered there.|$|E

25|$|Raf kinases {{found in}} retroviruses (such as murine v-Raf) are {{secondarily}} {{derived from the}} corresponding vertebrate genes of their hosts. These Raf genes encode severely truncated proteins, that lack the entire N-terminal autoinhibitory domain, and the 14-3-3 binding motifs. Such severe truncations are known to induce an uncontrolled activity of Raf kinases: <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> exactly what a virus may need for efficient reproduction.|$|E

25|$|Though not {{linked to}} flying saucers or odd aerial lights, {{it is perhaps}} worth noting {{that there is a}} long history of claims of contact with non-earthly intelligences. The {{founding}} revelations of many of the world's religions involve contact between the founder and a supernatural source of wisdom, such as a god in human form or an angel. In this context, it might be expected that most of the 1950s contactees would form their own religions, with the contactee as sole spiritual leader, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what happened, almost invariably.|$|E
25|$|Eyelid {{fluttering}} {{artifacts of}} a characteristic type were previously called Kappa rhythm (or Kappa waves). It is usually {{seen in the}} prefrontal leads, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>just</b> over the eyes. Sometimes they are seen with mental activity. They are usually in the Theta (4–7nbsp&Hz) or Alpha (7–14nbsp&Hz) range. They were named because they were believed to originate from the brain. Later study revealed they were generated by rapid fluttering of the eyelids, sometimes so minute {{that it was difficult}} to see. They are in fact noise in the EEG reading, and should not technically be called a rhythm or wave. Therefore, current usage in electroencephalography refers to the phenomenon as an eyelid fluttering artifact, rather than a Kappa rhythm (or wave).|$|E

25|$|The Elgin Military Museum {{may well}} be the only such museum on the {{continent}} that has space dedicated to an elephant. However, Jumbo, the largest elephant ever held in captivity, met his demise here in St. Thomas, Ontario on September 15, 1885. In 1985, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of his death, a life-size monument of this gentle animal was installed on the brow of the hill a hundred yards up the street from the museum. Finding a home for the monument had proved to be a significant problem until several members of the museum board (who just happened to serve on the Jumbo Monument Committee) convinced other members of the museum board to permit the statue of Jumbo to be placed in the parking lot the museum had just built on Talbot Street. However, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the beginning of the 'menagerie' which also includes the kangaroo and dolphins.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas {{wakes up}} to find himself entombed alive in a {{cemetery}} in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to escape.

While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect and mistreatment, he discovers that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who had conducted his psychological tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. Nicholas locates Feingold and forces him to find CRS's real office, whereupon he takes Christine hostage. Nicholas demands to be taken to the leader of CRS. Attacked by CRS troops, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars the door behind them. The CRS troops begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes that Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells Nicholas that the conspiracy is a hoax, a fiction <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> part of the game, that his finances are intact, and that his family and friends are waiting {{on the other side of}} the door. He refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge—Conrad, bearing an open bottle of champagne.

40|$|The medieval {{commentators}} of the Nicomachean Ethics paid {{special attention}} to the Aristotelian distinction between things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by nature and things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by law. This paper examines how three commentators from {{the first half of the}} 14 th century understood this text: Radulfus Brito, Walter Burley and Geraldus Odonis. The interpretations of the first two was notoriously influenced by that of Aquinas, in spite of the Condemnation of 1277, since they understood Natural Justice in terms of Aquinas’s theory of Natural Law. On his part, Odonis, who was the first Franciscan to write a commentary on the Ethics, is more original, as evidenced in (i) his idea that in all manifestations of Legal Justice there are always underlying natural elements; (ii) his concern to link Aristotle’s teaching on Natural Justice with certain Platonic themes; and by (iii) his rather convincing analyses of the examples that Aristotle offers when addressing the possibility of change in both things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by nature and things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> by law...|$|R

It was released on 30 January 2009. Though failing to do well at the box office and being declared a [...] "flop", the film received generally positive reviews from critics. Neil Genzlinger from The New York Times said: [...] "It is Mr. Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this far-ranging, cameo-filled film. He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc."
