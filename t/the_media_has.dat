5|$|<b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> {{historically}} {{come under}} {{varying degrees of}} pressure over time to censor their criticism of the government. Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed and media outlets are periodically forced to close. Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 due to the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism. Access to the internet has grown dramatically over the past decade, with an estimated 352,000 residents of Madagascar accessing the internet from home or {{in one of the}} nation's many internet cafés in December 2011.|$|E
5|$|The press had an {{aggressive}} {{coverage of the}} accident. Several major press organizations attended the memorial service, and newspapers published close-up pictures of crying next of kin on their front pages. The Norwegian Press Complaints Commission, a committee appointed by the newspapers themselves, acquitted Dagbladet after a complaint for their aggressive image use. However, the accident coverage started an internal debate among journalists about their coverage of major accidents. The conclusion was that private sorrow {{was not to be}} covered in the media and since <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> had a strict self-enforcement of such a policy.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Washington Post {{linked with}} {{approval}} to Romm's {{review of the}} scientific literature on climate change. Time magazine explored Romm's critique of Matthew Nisbet and praised {{his analysis of the}} decline of media coverage regarding climate change. National Geographic quoted him about the part that <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public. The same year, Technology Review quoted Romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies, and the Toronto Star quoted him regarding President Obama's 2011 State of the Union address. In 2012 in The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman cited Romm on the connection between drought and Climate change, and The Atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the Democrats to discuss climate change. National Geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice and the effect of climate change on the polar bear, and Current TV's Bill Press interviewed Romm about record-breaking heat.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> {{estimated}} that 26,000 {{people who would}} need evacuation have not volunteered this information to Emergency Officials.

40|$|Criticisms {{are often}} voiced {{at the fact}} that there is no well-informed European public. However, as the process of European {{integration}} <b>has</b> advanced, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>have</b> been devoting more resources and space to the coverage of European affairs. At the same time, <b>the</b> national <b>media</b> <b>have</b> gone from being mere transmitters of information to having their own voice on European issues. In this respect, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>have</b> emerged as actors capable of influencing the opinions of citizens, thereby contributing to the emergence of a European public sphere. The present study analyzes whether a Europeanization of <b>the</b> national <b>media</b> <b>has</b> taken place by studying how national newspapers provide information in Europe and whether a European public sphere is emerging. The results reveal that some European topics have experienced a certain Europeanization, but there is still an absence of European debate in the respective national public spheres...|$|R

25|$|The effect <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> on the population's view of shark attacks has {{generally}} been negative.

25|$|Some {{aspects of}} American culture codify racism.

25|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> {{not always}} been {{sympathetic}} towards the organisation. In 1995, the Independent Television Commission banned one of Survival International's advertisements, citing the Broadcasting Act 1990, which states that organisations cannot advertise their work if it is wholly or mainly of a political nature. The ad was broadcast on the music cable channel The Box and the MTV satellite offshoot VH-1. It featured Richard Gere urging viewers to help to stop the slaughter and exploitation of tribal people.|$|E
25|$|Khan's non-macho persona, {{and close}} ties with {{director}} Karan Johar, have led to persistent media rumours about his sexuality, which has made for a rocky relationship with fan magazines.

25|$|The {{media of}} Mongolia {{refers to the}} print, {{broadcast}} and online media in Mongolia.

Censorship of media outlets is forbidden under the 1998 Media Freedom Law.

25|$|The salsa {{controversy}} is also {{closely tied to}} the decades-long estrangement between the governments of the United States and Cuba, and the United States embargo against Cuba. Radio stations in the United States would get bomb threats (presumably from Cuban exiles) for playing Cuban records over the air. Homegrown salsa on the other hand, was embraced. For a time the Cuban state media officially claimed that the term salsa music was a euphemism for authentic Cuban music stolen by American imperialists, though <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> since abandoned this theory.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally {{the party}} had no {{consistent}} color identity. After the 2000 election, the color red became associated with Republicans.

Bush were colored red, and states won by Democratic nominee Al Gore were colored blue. Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> come to represent the respective political parties using these colors.

25|$|The {{delay in}} {{fertility}} becomes a problem among middle class women when they delay childbirth past their fertility peak. Since fertility peaks {{at a certain}} age, pushing childbirth past that age significantly decreases the probability that certain women {{will be able to}} have children. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> been an influence on women's fertility choices: popular celebrities who have managed to have children well into their forties and other medical miracles covered in the media oftentimes give women false hope that they themselves will also be able to bear children later in life. For every success story, however, there are many more disappointments.|$|E
25|$|Miss Representation is a {{documentary}} by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, exploring and displaying {{the role that}} mainstream media plays in society today with regards to women and the under-representation of women in influential positions. Prominent women in today's society were featured in discussing how <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> impacted their life along with their views on how the media is impacting {{the lives of people}} from an early age. These media messages have a severe impact on how individuals carry themselves along with what aspects bog them down like insecurities with body image. This film encourages viewers to start to see beyond the message and not compare themselves to these picture perfect computer-generated images.|$|E
25|$|Both the Israeli Defense Forces and militant Palestinian {{groups have}} been accused of violating the rights of {{children}} and causing injury and death. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>has</b> been used manipulatively to create support for different sides.

At the same time, various educational projects have been established to counter indoctrination and negative stereotypes. Joseph Massad has argued that the Western media are far more sensitive to the deaths of Jewish children than to child fatalities among Palestinians, while Giulio Meotti has argued the opposite position – that antisemitism has become socially acceptable in Western media and that the world tolerates murder of Jewish children.|$|E
