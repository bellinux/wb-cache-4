25|$|A tumbrel, or <b>tumbril</b> (F tombereau) was a tipcart—usually {{used for}} {{carrying}} dung, sand, stones, and so forth—which transported condemned prisoners to the guillotine during the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tumbril</b> of a ducking stool is in {{the crypt}} of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick. There is also a ducking chair in Canterbury, where the High Street meets the River Stour.|$|E
25|$|On 17 July 1793, {{four days}} after Marat was killed, Corday was {{executed}} by the guillotine, wearing the red overblouse denoting a condemned traitor who had assassinated {{a representative of the}} people. Standing alone in the <b>tumbril</b> amid a large and curious crowd she remained calm, although drenched by a sudden summer rainfall. Her corpse was disposed of in the Madeleine Cemetery.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{before the}} <b>tumbrils</b> arrive. Be {{sure you are}} there, my soul," [...] said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the street, [...] "before the <b>tumbrils</b> arrive!" ...|$|R
60|$|Wonderful {{things must}} {{have been going on}} inside Mr. Polly. Oh! {{wonderful}} things. It {{must have been}} like a badly managed industrial city during a period of depression; agitators, acts of violence, strikes, the forces of law and order doing their best, rushings to and fro, upheavals, the Marseillaise, <b>tumbrils,</b> the rumble and the thunder of the <b>tumbrils....</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend, I don't care a {{pinch of}} snuff for the whole Royal Artillery establishment--officers, men, <b>tumbrils,</b> waggons, horses, guns, and ammunition." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the reign}} of Edward I, when the King was calling on his feudal tenants to show their title to rights which they claimed to exercise, the Prior of Christchurch, Canterbury claimed to be {{entitled}} to maintain at Monks Risborough a gallows, a <b>tumbril</b> and a pillory. The King's counsel, objecting to the claim, said that there was no pillory at Monks Risborough. It is said that the Cadsden Road used to be known as Gallows Lane and the crossing of the Upper Icknield Way with Cadsden Road as Gallows Cross.|$|E
500|$|... "The peasants {{have been}} lining up outside Cartier's {{this week to}} gawk at a diamond {{as big as the}} Ritz that costs well over a million dollars. It is destined to hang round the neck of Mrs. Richard Burton. As {{somebody}} said {{it would have been nice}} to wear in the <b>tumbril</b> on the way to the guillotine.... In this Age of Vulgarity marked by such minor matters as war and poverty, it gets harder everyday to scale the heights of true vulgarity. But given some loose millions, it can be done-and worse, admired".|$|E
2500|$|Following her {{sentencing}} Corday {{asked the}} court if her portrait could be painted, purportedly to record her true self. She made her request pleading, [...] "Since I still have {{a few moments to}} live, might I hope, citizens, that you will allow me to have myself painted." [...] Given permission, she selected as the artist a National Guard officer, [...] Jean-Jacques Hauer, who had already begun sketching her from the gallery of the courtroom. Hauer's likeness (see above) was completed shortly before Corday was summoned to the <b>tumbril,</b> after she had viewed it and suggested a few changes.|$|E
60|$|The {{fortunate}} girl-wife went {{on through}} Brompton to Walham Green with a stunned feeling. So women have felt in <b>tumbrils.</b> A nightmare of butlers, a galaxy of possible butlers, filled her soul.|$|R
6000|$|Prince, I {{can hear}} the trumpet of Germinal, [...] The <b>tumbrils</b> toiling up the terrible way; [...] Even to-day your royal head may fall-- [...] I think I will not hang myself to-day.|$|R
60|$|He stopped. There {{was a heavy}} lumbering {{of wheels}} within hearing. They both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three <b>tumbrils</b> faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.|$|R
60|$|The second <b>tumbril</b> empties {{and moves}} on; the third comes up. Crash!--And the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look, Citoyenne," [...] he said, and {{he pointed}} out the first <b>tumbril,</b> which was coming round {{the corner of the}} Rue St. Honore.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{say he had}} a hand in {{the escape}} of the ci-devant Duc de Sermeuse and all his brats from the very <b>tumbril</b> which was taking them to execution." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad Fortune!" [...] cries The Vengeance, {{stamping}} {{her foot}} in the chair, [...] "and here are the <b>tumbrils!</b> And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!" ...|$|R
60|$|From that attic window she {{had seen}} {{beautiful}} Paris writhing under the pitiless lash of the demon of terror which it had provoked; she had heard the rumble of the <b>tumbrils,</b> dragging day after day their load of victims to the insatiable maker of this Revolution of Fraternity--the Guillotine.|$|R
60|$|And {{the afternoons}} were very lively. There was always plenty to see: first and foremost, the long {{procession}} of <b>tumbrils,</b> winding {{its way from}} the prisons to the Place de la Révolution. The forty-four thousand sections of the Committee of Public Safety sent their quota, each in their turn, to the guillotine.|$|R
60|$|I {{went to a}} {{hotel in}} a <b>tumbril.</b> It {{required}} strong self-suppression for me to keep from climbing {{to the top of}} it and giving an imitation of Sidney Carton. The vehicle was drawn by beasts of a bygone era and driven by something dark and emancipated.|$|E
60|$|The <b>tumbril</b> slowly approached, the groans and execrations swelled {{up around}} him, {{and at last}} he beheld her--beautiful, serene, full of life, a still smile upon her lips. For a long moment he gazed upon her, {{standing}} as if stricken into stone. Then heedless of those about him, he bared his head, and thus silently saluted and paid homage to her. She did not see him. He had not thought that she would. He saluted her as the devout salute the unresponsive image of a saint. The <b>tumbril</b> crawled on. He turned his head, and followed her with his eyes for awhile; then, driving his elbows into the ribs of those about him, he clove himself a passage through the throng, and so followed, bare-headed now, with fixed gaze, a man entranced.|$|E
60|$|He {{was sentenced}} {{on the very}} anniversary of that terrible night on which {{the men of the}} Marat Company broke into the prison of Le Bouffay, and he was {{accompanied}} in the <b>tumbril</b> by Grandmaison the pitiless, who was now filled with self-pity {{to such an extent that}} he wept bitterly.|$|E
60|$|As The Vengeance descends {{from her}} {{elevation}} to do it, the <b>tumbrils</b> begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted {{their eyes to}} look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak, count One.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{could not}} be worse, monsieur; it would be impossible. But we who are quiet men think that it cannot go on much longer; even the sans-culottes are getting tired of bloodshed. There {{is no longer a}} great crowd to see the executions, and the <b>tumbrils</b> pass along without insults and imprecations being hurled against the prisoners.|$|R
60|$|He {{had been}} apprised {{that the final}} hour was Three, {{and he knew he}} would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the <b>tumbrils</b> jolted heavily and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he {{resolved}} to keep Two before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{his courage}} did not fail him. Far from it, indeed; if hers {{had been a}} mood of gentle calm, his was one of ecstatic exaltation. At five o'clock that same {{afternoon}} he stepped from the <b>tumbril</b> under the gaunt shadow of the guillotine. He turned to the people, his eyes bright, a flush on his cheeks.|$|E
60|$|The sudden spiritual passion which {{inflamed}} {{him when}} he beheld her in the <b>tumbril</b> {{on her way to}} the scaffold is a fitting corollary to her action. She in her way and he in his were alike sublime; her tranquil martyrdom upon the altar of Republicanism and his exultant martyrdom upon the altar of Love were alike splendidly futile.|$|E
60|$|She {{mounted the}} <b>tumbril</b> {{awaiting}} {{in the prison}} yard, and, disdaining the chair offered her by Sanson, remained standing, to show herself dauntless to the mob and brave its rage. And fierce was that rage, indeed. So densely thronged were the streets that the <b>tumbril</b> proceeded at a crawl, and the people surging about the cart screamed death and insult at the doomed woman. It took two hours to reach the Place de la Révolution, and meanwhile a terrific summer thunderstorm had broken over Paris, and a torrential rain had descended upon the densely packed streets. Charlotte's garments were soaked through and through, so that her red smock, becoming glued now to her body and fitting her like a skin, threw into relief its sculptural beauty, whilst {{a reflection of the}} vivid crimson of the garment faintly tinged her cheeks, and thus heightened her appearance of complete composure.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her {{a moment with a}} glance that was almost of surprise, then, with a slight {{compression}} of the lips and the faintest raising of the shoulders, he turned from her and strode over to the window. There was a considerable concourse of people {{on their way to the}} Place de la Republique, for the hour of the <b>tumbrils</b> was at hand.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile {{will not}} {{the people of the}} Place de la Revolution, the {{inhabitants}} along the Rue Saint-Honore, as these continual <b>Tumbrils</b> pass, begin to look gloomy? Republicans too have bowels. The Guillotine is shifted, then again shifted; finally set up at the remote extremity of the South-East: (Montgaillard, iv. 237.) Suburbs Saint-Antoine and Saint-Marceau it is to be hoped, if they have bowels, have very tough ones.|$|R
6000|$|In such circumstances, the Aristocrat, the unpatriotic {{rich man}} is packing-up for departure. But he shall not get departed. A wooden-shod force has seized all Barriers, burnt or not: all that enters, all {{that seeks to}} issue, is stopped there, and dragged to the Hotel-de-Ville: coaches, <b>tumbrils,</b> plate, furniture, 'many meal-sacks,' in time even 'flocks and herds' {{encumber}} the Place de Greve. (Dusaulx, Prise de la Bastille, p. 20.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not shame {{me before}} Sir Percy," [...] murmured the young girl, casting shy {{glances at the}} elegant {{cavalier}} before her, vainly trying {{to find in the}} indolent, foppish personality of this society butterfly, some trace of the daring man of action, the bold adventurer who had snatched her and her lover from out the very <b>tumbril</b> that bore them both to death.|$|E
60|$|The young Duc de Châteaudun was there, he who, {{nine years}} later, {{went to the}} {{guillotine}} on that cold September morning, his hair dressed in the latest fashion, the finest Mechlin lace around his wrists, playing a final game of piquet with his younger brother, as the <b>tumbril</b> bore them along through the hooting, yelling crowd of the half-naked starvelings of Paris.|$|E
60|$|He {{could already}} hear the {{indictment}} against him, {{could see the}} filthy mob of Paris dancing a wild saraband round the <b>tumbril,</b> which bore him towards the guillotine; he could hear their yells of execration, could feel the insults hurled against him, by those who had most admired, most envied him. And from all this he would have escaped if he could, {{if it had not}} been too late.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you'll {{all want}} help from somewhere," [...] {{retorted}} Chauvelin coolly. [...] "From above or from below, what? {{if the people}} get to know what miscreants you are. I do believe," [...] he added, with a vicious snap of his thin lips, [...] "that they would cheat the guillotine of you and, in the end, drag {{you out of the}} <b>tumbrils</b> and tear you to pieces limb from limb!" ...|$|R
60|$|ART. IV. The French army shall {{carry with}} it all its artillery, of French calibre, with the horses {{belonging}} to it, and the <b>tumbrils</b> supplied with sixty rounds per gun. All other artillery, arms, and ammunition, as also the military and naval arsenals, shall be given up to the British army and navy {{in the state in}} which they may be at the period of the ratification of the Convention.|$|R
60|$|The strong escort of the National Guard, with Commandant Santerre {{and his two}} drummers, {{had much}} ado to keep back the mob. It was not {{the policy of the}} revolutionary {{government}} to allow excesses of summary justice in the streets: the public execution of traitors on the Place de la Révolution, the processions in the <b>tumbrils,</b> were thought to be wholesome examples for other would-be traitors to mark and digest.|$|R
