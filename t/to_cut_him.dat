5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934, Brimsek was invited to the Detroit Red Wings {{training}} camp for a shot at playing in the National Hockey League (NHL). Jack Adams, the Red Wings' coach and manager, made a bad impression on Brimsek. He felt that Adams {{had a habit of}} favoritism. This led him to try out for another professional team, the Baltimore Orioles of the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL). Unfortunately for Brimsek, the Orioles decided <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him.</b> Disappointed, Brimsek hitchhiked back to Eveleth. On his way back home, he had a chance meeting with the owner of the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets, John H. Harris. The Yellow Jackets were in need for a goaltender and Harris proceeded to sign Brimsek to the team. Brimsek started for the Yellow Jackets {{for the first time in}} 1934–35 by playing 16 games exhibition games. Out of those 16 games, he won 14 of them.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August, Godwin-Austen {{realized}} the peril of his situation, with XV Brigade nearly able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off from behind, his troops exhausted, and his artillery completely deficient and running low on ammunition, and informed General Henry Maitland Wilson, {{who was in}} command at Cairo while Wavell was absent in England, that retreat from Tug Argan and evacuation from British Somaliland was now a necessity. If his forces could be evacuated, perhaps 70 percent of them might be removed. Otherwise, he {{would be forced to}} fight to the death, with his entire command destroyed. Wilson agreed to Godwin-Austen's request the next day, and preparations were made to flee after dark on 15 August. During that day, Observation Hill was attacked for the final time by De Simone's forces. De Simone had decided to doggedly press his attack in the gap, in lieu of completing the flanking maneuver, and finally this proved successful. By 7:00pm XIII Brigade had seized Observation Hill, and the British retreated from it in disarray. After sundown, the defenders of the remaining hills were withdrawn, along with the Punjab troops, who departed just as II Brigade was able to make inroads through their abandoned positions. British resistance had collapsed, and as Godwin-Austen and his forces fled towards Berbera, the Italians were in control of Tug Argan.|$|E
25|$|In the novel, Goldfinger captures Bond {{and threatens}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> in half with a {{circular}} saw as Oddjob tortures him using his pressure points. Bond offers {{to work for}} Goldfinger {{in exchange for his}} life, but Goldfinger refuses to spare him, and he blacks out.|$|E
60|$|They found Mrs. Muldoon in the kitchen. A less convincing {{story than}} that {{by which the}} Professor sought to account to Mrs. Muldoon for the how and the why of Malvina it would be {{impossible}} to imagine. Mrs. Muldoon out of sheer kindness appears <b>to</b> have <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> short.|$|R
60|$|So, {{ordering}} {{the others to}} follow him, he issued forth from the lines. Some obeyed him, and others did not. After a while he returned within the lines again, apparently {{for the purpose of}} calling those who remained there to account for not obeying him. He found Lord Wenlock, one of the leaders, sitting upon his horse idle, as he said, in the town. He immediately denounced him as a traitor, and, riding up <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> down with a blow from his battle-axe, which cleft his skull.|$|R
60|$|Burgess parted {{with him}} with the firm {{conviction}} that Mike was a young slacker. Keenness in fielding was a fetish with him; and <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> practice struck <b>him</b> as a crime.|$|R
25|$|The second relief attempt of the Siege of Mantua ended {{badly for}} Austria when General Napoleon Bonaparte routed Feldmarschall Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's army at the Battle of Bassano. In the sequel, Wurmser marched for Mantua, evading French {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off. He reached there with 16,000 soldiers on 12 September 1796, but was defeated and {{driven into the}} fortress by the French on the 15th. With Wurmser's Austrians and the original garrison crowded into the encircled city, disease and hunger began exacting a serious toll on the garrison.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Italy {{across the}} Great St Bernard Pass in May 1800 and seized Milan on 2 June. Reacting to the {{surprise}} French offensive, Melas ordered O'Reilly to take 3,000 troops and an artillery convoy to defend Piacenza. The Austrian army commander hoped to use Piacenza as a base to launch a counterattack against Milan. In the event, Piacenza fell to the French before O'Reilly reached it. On 6 June, after an 11-hour skirmish, he successfully managed to save the artillery convoy and withdraw to the west, while fending off a French column that tried <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off.|$|E
25|$|Isabella now marched south towards London, pausing at Dunstable, {{outside the}} city on 7 October. London was {{now in the hands}} of the mobs, {{although}} broadly allied to Isabella. Bishop Stapledon failed to realise the extent to which royal power had collapsed in the capital and tried to intervene militarily to protect his property against rioters; a hated figure locally, he was promptly attacked and killed– his head was later sent to Isabella by her local supporters. Edward, meanwhile, was still fleeing west, reaching Gloucester by the 9th. Isabella responded by marching swiftly west herself in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off, reaching Gloucester a week after Edward, who slipped across the border into Wales the same day.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, Cantor was {{featured}} in the Mike McGlone series of GEICO commercials where he is introduced as an announcer who could make any sport exciting. Subsequently, the camera <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> animatedly announcing a chess match.|$|R
25|$|Lloyd George now {{prepared}} for a showdown with Robertson, who was still unhappy over the handing over of British divisions to General Reserve. He proposed that the CIGS be reduced to his pre-1915 powers (i.e. reporting to the Secretary of State for War, not direct to the Cabinet) and that the British military representative at the Supreme War Council in Versailles be Deputy CIGS {{and a member of}} the Army Council (i.e. empowered to issue orders to Haig). He offered Robertson a choice of remaining as CIGS with reduced powers or else accepting demotion to Deputy CIGS at Versailles – either way, Lloyd George would now have been able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> out of the decision-making loop.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{became a}} race between Lee and Sheridan, with Lee attempting to obtain supplies for his retreat and Sheridan attempting <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off, with the Union infantry close behind. At Sayler's Creek on April 6, {{nearly a quarter}} of the Confederate army (about 8,000 men, the majority of two corps) was cut off and forced to surrender; many of the Confederate supply trains, crossing the creek to the north, were also captured. Although Grant wrote to him suggesting that surrender was his last remaining course of action, Lee still attempted to outmarch the Union forces. In Lee's final attack at Appomattox on the morning April 9, John B. Gordon's depleted corps attempted to break the Union lines and reach the supplies in Lynchburg. They pushed back Sheridan's cavalry briefly but found themselves faced with the full Union V Corps. Surrounded on three sides, Lee was forced to surrender his army to Grant at Appomattox Court House that day, with the formal surrender ceremony taking place two days later.|$|E
25|$|After {{some time}} of peace, Glaurung returns to exterminate {{the men of}} Brethil. Turambar leads an {{expedition}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off, and stabs Glaurung from beneath while the dragon is crossing a ravine. As Glaurung is dying {{on the bank of}} the ravine, Turambar pulls his sword from the dragon's belly, and blood spurts onto his hand and burns him. Overwhelmed with pain and fatigue, he faints. Niënor finds him and mistakes his swoon for death. In a last effort of malice Glaurung opens his eyes and informs her that she and Turambar are brother and sister. Glaurung then dies, and his spell of forgetfulness passes from Niënor. Remembering her entire life and knowing that her unborn child was begotten in incest, she throws herself from the nearby cliff into the river Taeglin and is washed away. When Turambar wakes, Brandir informs him of Niënor's death and of their true relationship as siblings, as he had overheard the dragon's words. Mablung confirms Brandir's tale, and Turambar takes his own life upon his sword.|$|E
60|$|He {{felt himself}} now pent in, all but trapped. Since {{he had set}} foot last in England ugly things had risen up, on which he had {{calculated}} too little,--namely, Norman castles. A whole ring of them in Norfolk and Suffolk <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off from the south. A castle at Cambridge closed {{the south end of}} the fens; another at Bedford, the western end; while Lincoln Castle <b>to</b> the north, <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off from York.|$|R
50|$|Clark {{played in}} {{thirteen}} {{games in the}} 2005 season making 57 tackles and three interceptions. While he played well for Washington and wanted to re-sign with the team, the Redskins decided <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> ties with <b>him</b> and signed Adam Archuleta to be their new starting safety.|$|R
2500|$|Ben Stiller {{threatened}} to badly sing a rendition of Little River Band's [...] "Reminiscing" [...] until {{a total of}} $200,000,000,000 in donations was reached. Throughout the show, the camera <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> continuing to sing as the goal was not reached.|$|R
25|$|Anxious that Allied troops {{might use}} {{the road from}} Salvatierra <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off, Foy {{instructed}} Maucune to hold the road open until his 8,000 soldiers got past the danger point. Maucune sent the convoy ahead to Tolosa and turned back. He assigned one brigade to hold Villafranca de Ordicia and the second brigade to defend Beasain. Foy's column left Villareal de Álava in the predawn hours of 24 June with Saint Paul's brigade acting as the rearguard. Longa's troops {{caught up with the}} Italians but were unable to slow them down. Graham attacked Maucune with the soldiers he had available. Bradford's Portuguese were repulsed in their first attack on Villafranca but eventually pressed their opponents back. The KGL light battalions attacked and captured Beasain, but Maucune pulled back to high ground and continued to defy the Allies. Meanwhile, Foy's column crossed behind Maucune and got away toward Tolosa. On 24 June Maucune sustained 200 casualties and Graham lost 93, while the Italians and Longa's Spaniards each lost about 100 men.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Leipzig on 16 October 1813, Napoleon made a bid {{to crush}} Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia. During the day's action, Doumerc took command of the I Cavalry Corps after Latour-Maubourg {{suffered}} a bad wound. After inconclusive fighting in the morning, the French emperor directed his cavalry to smash {{a hole in the}} Allied line at 2:00 PM. Schwarzenberg brought up the Austrian reserve cavalry and managed to slow the French drive. About 2:30 PM, Doumerc spotted a weak point in the enemy defenses and launched Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle's 1st Heavy Cavalry Division at it. The charge quickly dispersed two infantry battalions, overran 26 guns, and nearly cut its way to Czar Alexander I of Russia's headquarters. However, before either Murat or Doumerc could bring up support, Bordesoulle was counterattacked by the Czar's escort and a large force of Russian cuirassiers. The decisive moment passed and the day's battle ended with the Allies driven back to their start line but intact. After Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig, his former ally Bavaria joined the Allies and sent a corps <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off from France. At the Battle of Hanau, the French emperor completely outgeneraled the Bavarian Karl Philipp von Wrede, crushing his left flank with a powerful attack and carving an escape route for his troops. Doumerc led the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division in the action.|$|E
25|$|After Fatboy {{breaks a}} tree in Albert Square, Leon helps to replace it but is horrified to {{discover}} the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day Zsa Zsa makes a joke when Leon speaks after a prolonged silence, causing Leon to walk out. She finds him to apologise, as she had not realised the discovery had affected him badly. He then recalls the day his mother {{died in a car}} crash when it took an hour for firemen <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> free and he was unable to lean over to close his mother's eyes. He admits to Zsa Zsa that he sometimes feels alone. He fails most of his GCSE exams. Months later he flirts with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) in the local bookmaker's and agree to meet later. He obtains two tickets to a music festival in France and plans to take Zsa Zsa, but he reveals to Fatboy that he slept with Glenda, who tells Mercy, who then tells Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Leon if he has seen anyone else but he says no. Zsa Zsa then seduces Leon in Fatboy's van before throwing him out in his underwear and leaving Walford for France. Leon decides that as his bags are packed he will go to France anyway, hinting that he will follow Zsa Zsa to apologise and resume their relationship. Before leaving, he tells Fatboy that he will always be his best friend and they continue to stay in touch.|$|E

50|$|When Greneral Steinmetz {{approached}} Gosselies, he realised {{that the}} French were strong enough <b>to</b> completely <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off. He quickly directed the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Westphalian Landwehr to march against the French left flank, to divert French {{attention to him}} and to check French advance. He continued his retreat towards Heppignies successfully. Protected by the 6th Lancers and the 1st Silesian Hussars, Steinmetz reached Heppignies with scarcely any loss, although he was perused by General Girard {{at the head of}} the French 7th Division of the II Corps, as Reille continued his advance along the Brussels road with the remainder.|$|R

500|$|Francis Mackey, an {{experienced}} harbour pilot, had boarded Mont-Blanc {{on the evening}} of 5 December 1917; he had asked about [...] "special protections" [...] such as a guard ship, given the Mont-Blanc's cargo, but no protections were put in place. Mont-Blanc started moving at 7:30am on 6 December, heading towards Bedford Basin. Mackey kept his eye on the ferry traffic between Halifax and Dartmouth and other small boats in the area. He first spotted Imo when she was about [...] away and became concerned as her path appeared to be heading towards his ship's starboard side, as if <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off his own course. Mackey gave a short blast of his ship's signal whistle to indicate that he had the right of way, but was met with two short blasts from Imo, indicating that the approaching vessel would not yield its position. The captain ordered Mont-Blanc to halt her engines and angle slightly to starboard, closer to the Dartmouth side of the Narrows. He let out another single blast of his whistle, hoping the other vessel would likewise move to starboard, but was again met with a double-blast in negation.|$|E

500|$|The 1950 playoffs were {{overshadowed by}} an on-ice mishap {{in the opening}} game between Toronto and Detroit, in which the Red Wings' young star player, Gordie Howe, was seriously injured. Late in the game with Toronto leading 4–0, Kennedy stole the puck from Detroit defenseman Jack Stewart and was {{carrying}} it down the left wing about six feet from the boards into the Detroit end of the rink. Stewart was pursuing him from behind and Howe was coming in fast from the side to try <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off. Kennedy saw Howe coming at the last moment, {{and was able to}} dodge Howe's check while passing the puck to Sid Smith, but Howe could not stop and crashed head-first into the boards, with Stewart falling on top of him. Howe sustained a concussion, facial fractures, and a lacerated right eyeball, and doctors had to perform emergency procedures on him at the hospital to save his life. Detroit coach Tommy Ivan and general manager Jack Adams accused Kennedy of deliberately butt-ending Howe. Kennedy had not been assessed a penalty on the play. After the game Kennedy said, [...] "I don't know how he got it. I avoided his check along the boards and didn't feel anything hit me, although he may have struck my stick." ...|$|E
500|$|Zeratul is a Nerazim prelate {{and one of}} {{the main}} Protoss protagonists. The {{character}} is voiced by Jack Ritschel in StarCraft and Brood War, and by Fred Tatasciore in all three parts of StarCraft II. A renowned psionic warrior and assassin, Zeratul is somewhat secretive and calculating, but is nevertheless honorable and loyal to his species. He teaches Tassadar how to use dark templar energies and facilitates the final attack on the Overmind by slaying several cerebrates. Following the death of the Overmind, Zeratul tries to put in motion the reunification of the Khalai survivors with the wayward dark templar and unmask the secrets of Samir Duran's experiments. After Duran revealed he had been breeding Protoss-Zerg hybrids for a greater master, Zeratul set out to find Duran's master and his plan, which encompasses all of his activities in the three installments of StarCraft II. [...] In Wings of Liberty, he gives Jim Raynor a crystal with his memories to emphasize the importance of the latter's mission to de-infest Kerrigan. [...] In Heart of the Swarm, he guides Kerrigan to Zerus, the original home of the Zerg, and encourages her to re-infest herself so she can stop Amon, a fallen Xel'naga who is revealed to be the master of Duran and seeks to destroy all life in the Korpulu Sector and remold it in his image. Zeratul will also feature in the events of Legacy of the Void (originally believed to be the central character, the actual protagonist of the story is Artanis). He appears early on but is killed as he severs Artanis's nerve cords <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off from Amon's control. [...] He is described by GameSpot as a [...] "dark warrior who champions the light" [...] and a [...] "willing scapegoat" [...] for his people and ranked in their top ten heroes chart.|$|E
500|$|On 31 May 1916, Princess Royal was the {{flagship}} of the 1st BCS, {{under the command}} of Rear-Admiral Osmond Brock. The squadron had put to sea {{with the rest of the}} Battlecruiser Fleet, led by Beatty in Lion, to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the British ships to their west by mid-afternoon and turned about to fall back on the German battleships, then about [...] behind him. Beatty turned <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>him</b> off, but was out of position to do that and had to settle for a pursuit. This began what was to be called the [...] "Run to the South" [...] as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper's course. The Germans opened fire first, three minutes later, followed almost immediately afterward by the British. The sisters were in the lead and were engaged by their opposite numbers, the battlecruisers, [...] and Derfflinger. Fire from both German ships was very accurate, and both Lion and Princess Royal were hit twice within three minutes of the Germans' opening fire. Lion scored her first hit on Lützow two minutes later, but one of Lützows 305mm (12in) shells hit 'Q' turret at 16:00. It blew the front roof and the centre face plates off the turret, killed or wounded everyone inside, and started a fire that continued to smoulder despite efforts to put it out. Accounts of subsequent events differ, but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the smouldering fire ignited the propellant charges in the turret working room at 4:28. They burnt violently, with the flames reaching as high as the masthead, and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting. The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors, and it is probable that the magazine would have exploded, sinking the ship, if it had not already been flooded. At 16:30 the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. After confirming the sighting himself, Beatty ordered his ships to turn around and fall back upon the oncoming Grand Fleet. During the Run to the South Princess Royal was hit a total of six times by Derfflinger, but none of them were serious.|$|E
