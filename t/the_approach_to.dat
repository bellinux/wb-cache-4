5|$|On 1 June 1960, an Avro Anson {{aircraft}} suffered {{engine failure}} soon after take-off from Northolt and crash-landed {{on top of}} the nearby Express Dairies plant in South Ruislip. There were no fatalities. Later that year, on 25 October, a Pan Am Boeing 707, heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty-one passengers on board. A Lufthansa Boeing 707 also attempted to land at the station on 28 April 1964 but was dissuaded by a red signal flare fired by personnel from Air Traffic Control. In the days before navigational aids such as instrument landing systems (ILS) and the global positioning system (GPS) were available, the letters NO (for Northolt) and LH (for Heathrow) were painted on two gasometers on <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> each airfield, one at Southall for <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> Heathrow's diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> Northolt's runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors. By the 1980s movements of privately owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft. Civil flights were limited to 28 per day, with a maximum of 7,000 a year. This limit remained in force in 2008.|$|E

5|$|One major {{challenge}} was <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, {{connected to a}} major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E

5|$|As the war progressed, Temple was {{promoted}} to colonel and became governor of Tilbury Fort in Essex, a post {{that had previously been}} held by his father. The fort was close to Temple's childhood home at Longhouse Place and was of strategic importance because it controlled <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> London by river. During the Second Civil War, there were Royalist uprisings in Kent and Essex. Temple's control of Tilbury Fort for Parliament enabled Lord Fairfax's troops to cross from Gravesend to Tilbury on route to Colchester for the siege of royalists in that town.|$|E

5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> Felling station.

The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> {{the west}} of the {{important}} city of Augusta Taurinorum (Turin, Italy), Constantine met a large force of heavily armed Maxentian cavalry. In the ensuing battle Constantine's army encircled Maxentius' cavalry, flanked them with his own cavalry, and dismounted them with blows from his soldiers' iron-tipped clubs. Constantine's armies emerged victorious. Turin refused to give refuge to Maxentius' retreating forces, opening its gates to Constantine instead. Other cities of the north Italian plain sent Constantine embassies of congratulation for his victory. He moved on to Milan, where he was met with open gates and jubilant rejoicing. Constantine rested his army in Milan until mid-summer 312AD, when he moved on to Brixia (Brescia).|$|E
5|$|At {{the western}} end of Highway3, two major traffic {{concerns}} have been the focus of controversy since the mid-1990s and early 2000s: the Essex Bypass and <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the Ambassador Bridge.

5|$|Beato's {{photographs}} of the Second Opium War {{are the first to}} document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His {{photographs of}} the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E
5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work {{came in the form of}} the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E

McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis.

5|$|Grand River Avenue {{crosses to}} the east into Livingston County through Fowlerville to Howell.

In <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> Brighton, Grand River Avenue passes through rural southeast Michigan lake country. In Brighton, Grand River Avenue crossed the western end of the I-96 freeway.
