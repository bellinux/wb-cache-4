5|$|With Taejon captured, North Korean forces {{began the}} effort of {{surrounding}} the Pusan Perimeter from all sides in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> it. The North Korean 4th Infantry Division and the North Korean 6th Infantry Division advanced south in a wide maneuver. The two divisions were coordinating <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. They advanced on UN positions pushing back US and South Korean forces repeatedly. Forces of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for North Korean forces.|$|E
5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result {{in the loss of}} all or part of his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he needed to take Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's plan envisaged {{that the}} Allies would throw many troops <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> his right flank {{in order to}} cut the French {{communication}} line from Vienna. As a result, the Allies' centre and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable. To encourage them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his own caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon's main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite the Heights. According to the plan, the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, then from the Heights they would launch a decisive assault {{to the center of}} the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.|$|E

A picture which in its mounting ferocity exceeded all the battles {{that had previously}} been fought on the Eastern front!" [...] The Polish winter bought a lull to the major fighting. A Russian invasion of Silesia must wait for spring. By this time, the Russians feared the German army, which seemed to appear from nowhere and to win despite substantial odds against them, while the Germans regarded the Russian army with [...] "increasing disdain." [...] Hindenburg and Ludendorff were convinced that if sufficient troops were transferred from the Western Front, they could force the Russians out of the war.|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} class of assosiative algebras those are similar <b>to</b> <b>enveloping</b> algebra of gl(n; C).

5|$|North Korean {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. The North Korean 3rd Division {{was ordered to}} attack from the north, against the flank. The North Korean 4th Division would attack across the Kum River from the east and south, in order <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division. Although the North Korean 2nd Infantry Division was ordered to attack from Chongju against the American right flank, it was slow to move and arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|On August 5, the KPA's 12th Division {{pushed back}} the ROK Capital Division in the Ch'ongsong-Kigye area, and linked up with {{elements}} of the 766th which had infiltrated the area of Pohyunsan. Unopposed, they began to prepare to attack P'ohang to secure entry into the UN's newly established Pusan Perimeter. The Regiment was ordered to begin an attack in coordination with the KPA's 5th Division. The Korean People's Army planned simultaneous offensives across the entire Perimeter, including a flanking maneuver by the 766th and the 5th Division <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> UN troops and push them back to Pusan. The 766th was not reinforced; North Korean planners intended it to move unseen around the UN lines {{while the majority of}} the UN and North Korean troops were locked in fighting around Taegu and the Naktong Bulge.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 24, the ROK 1st Infantry Division {{advanced}} towards the town of Taechon with its 11th and 12th Infantry Regiment on point. Although Chinese booby traps and mortar fire tried to delay the Koreans along the way, the 1st Infantry Division still managed <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> the town by the dusk of November 24. But unknown to the Koreans, the 1st Infantry Division was marching into a Chinese assembly area, and the resistance around Taechon immediately increased as the result. On the night of November 24, the defending PVA 66th Corps counterattacked the Koreans with infantry and cavalry charges, and the Chinese and Korean troops were soon locked in a seesaw battle from November 25 to 26.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe study {{forms of}} coalgebras and Hopf algebras (i. e., coalgebras and Hopf algebras which are {{isomorphic}} after a suitable {{extension of the}} base field). We classify all forms of grouplike coalgebras according {{to the structure of}} their simple subcoalgebras. For Hopf algebras, given a W*-Galois field extension K⊆L for W a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra and a K-Hopf algebra H, we show that all L-forms of H are invariant rings [L⊗H]W under appropriate actions of W on L⊗H. We apply this result <b>to</b> <b>enveloping</b> algebras, duals of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, and adjoint actions of finite-dimensional semisimple cocommutative Hopf algebras...|$|R

Furthermore, the enhancement of infection does not occur through increases in virus receptor levels or virus binding, indicating that virus fusion is enhanced. The liposomes are easily generated, store well, and allow enhanced infection with a variety of virus vectors and cell types...|$|R
5|$|The Germans {{started the}} withdrawal, while the {{motorized}} Allied forces broke {{out from their}} bridgeheads and pursued the German units from behind. The rapid Allied advance posed a major threat for the Germans, who could not retreat fast enough. The Germans tried to establish a defense line at the Rhône to shield the withdrawal of several valuable units there. The US 45th and 3rd Divisions were pressing to the north-west with uncontested speed, undermining Wiese's plan for a new defense line. Barjols and Brignoles were taken by the two American divisions on 19August, which also were about <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> Toulon as well as Marseille from the north, cutting off the German units there.|$|E
5|$|In the North, the Wons Position {{formed a}} {{bridgehead}} {{at the eastern}} end of the Enclosure Dike; it had a long perimeter of about nine kilometres <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> enough land to receive a large number of retreating troops without making them too vulnerable to air attack. On 12 May units with a combined strength of only two battalions were still present, so the line was weakly held. This was exploited by the first German unit to arrive, the single bicycle battalion of 1. Kavalleriedivision. At noon it quickly penetrated the line in a concentrated attack, forcing the defenders to withdraw to the Enclosure Dike. For some the German advance cut off their escape route by land; they sailed away from the small port of Makkum, taking the last remaining vessels on the eastern side of Lake IJssel. This denied the Germans any craft for a crossing attempt, which plan was now abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Soviet {{offensive}} {{continued in}} the north. The offensive liberated Kalinin and the Soviets reached Klin on 7 December, overrunning {{the headquarters of the}} LVI Panzer Corps outside the city. As the Kalinin Front drove west, a bulge developed around Klin. The Soviet front commander, General Ivan Konev, attempted <b>to</b> <b>envelop</b> any German forces remaining. Zhukov diverted more forces to {{the southern end of the}} bulge, to help Konev trap the Third Panzer Army. The Germans pulled their forces out in time. Although the encirclement failed, it unhinged the German defenses. A second attempt was made against the Second Panzer Army near Tula, but met strong opposition near Rzhev and was forced to halt, forming a salient that would last until March 1943. In the south, the offensive went equally well, with Southwestern Front forces relieving Tula on 16 December 1941. A major achievement was the encirclement and destruction of the German XXXIX Corps, protecting Guderian's Second Panzer Army's southern flank.|$|E
