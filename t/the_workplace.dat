40|$|Objectives: Sickness absence in {{workplaces}} {{may reflect}} working conditions. It may also reflect a "healthy hire effect," i. e., that workplaces recruit individuals with experience of sickness absence differently. The {{purpose of the}} study was to determine if a history of sickness absence among recruits is associated with the average level of sickness absence in workplaces. Material and Methods: In a register-based follow-up study, Swedish workplaces with at least 5 employees in 2006 were selected (approximately 127 000 workplaces with 3. 9 million employees). <b>The</b> <b>workplaces</b> were categorized according to <b>the</b> average <b>workplace</b> sickness absence in 2006 and the recruits were categorized according to the individual sickness absence in 2005. <b>The</b> <b>workplaces</b> with a high average level of sickness absence were more likely than those with a low level to hire employees with high sickness absence in the year preceding employment: men - odds ratio (OR) = 7. 2, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 6. 6 - 7. 8, women OR = 7. 5, 95 % CI: 6. 9 - 8. 1. Results: The results show that there is a greater likelihood of employing individuals with high levels of sickness absence in <b>the</b> <b>workplaces</b> with many days of the average sickness absence than in <b>the</b> <b>workplaces</b> with few days of the average sickness absence. Conclusions: The results suggest that sickness absence in workplaces may reflect a healthy hire effect. Funding Agencies|AFA Insurance [090299]</p...|$|R

5|$|A {{successful}} {{test for}} beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published {{as an international}} voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202.

5|$|Beryllium is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to {{beryllium}} in <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> {{can lead to a}} sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing {{a better understanding of the}} work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring occupational exposures to beryllium.|$|E
