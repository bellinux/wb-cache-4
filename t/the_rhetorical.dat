5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from essentially the same cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests this is probably {{an indication of the}} antiquity of the tradition of the story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical</b> verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 18 is {{a typical}} English or Shakespearean sonnet. It {{consists}} of three quatrains followed by a couplet, {{and it has the}} characteristic rhyme scheme: abab cdcd efef gg. The poem reflects <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical</b> tradition of an Italian or Petrarchan Sonnet. Petrarchan sonnets typically discussed the love and beauty of a beloved, often an unattainable love, but not always. It also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} for Defoe's contemporaries in assessing whether {{the work was}} ironic was {{the proximity of the}} speaker's voice to that of the High Anglicans whose views are being ridiculed. The pamphlet mixes both real observation and fabrication, and assumes <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical</b> style of his target. Defoe uses and imitates the language and metaphor of fanatical churchman, particularly Sacheverell's sermons; the speaker's comparison of the Dissenters to vipers is one that Sacheverell often made. Although The Shortest Way does not parody the genre of the Anglican sermon, it does deploy some of the same structures; the initial Aesopic fable of the Cock and the Horses is expanded upon in a way that parallels the use of a biblical quotation to initiate a sermon.|$|E

The rhetorician must act as a rhetorical critic of their own work, they must examine the necessity of their research as well as the analysis. A rhetorician must also be able to defend the method of their analysis and the accuracy of their research.|$|R

25|$|Argumentation {{theory is}} {{interdisciplinary}} {{in the sense}} that no one discipline will be able to provide a complete account. A full appreciation of argumentation requires insights from logic (both formal and informal), rhetoric, communication theory, linguistics, psychology, and, increasingly, computer science. Since the 1970s, there has been significant agreement that there are three basic approaches to argumentation theory: the logical, <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical</b> and the dialectical. According to Wenzel, the logical approach deals with the product, the dialectical with the process, and <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical</b> with the procedure. Thus, informal logic is one contributor to this inquiry, being most especially concerned with the norms of argument.|$|E

25|$|The {{philosophical}} {{underpinnings of}} the scientific revolution were laid out by Francis Bacon, who {{has been called the}} father of empiricism.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rhetorical</b> {{question}} mark or percontation point {{was invented by}} Henry Denham in the 1580s and was used {{at the end of}} a rhetorical question; however, its use died out in the 17th century. It was later revived in modern-day society by Matt DiRoberto. It was the reverse of an ordinary {{question mark}}, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it. This character can be represented using the reversed question mark (⸮) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the Irony mark, but these are very rarely seen.|$|E
25|$|Even {{what we hear}} must be {{attached}} to a visual image. To help recall something we have heard rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking {{as well as the}} appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical</b> textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.|$|E
25|$|The early Christian monks adapted {{techniques}} {{common in}} the art of memory as an art of composition and meditation, which was in keeping with <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical</b> and dialectical context in which it was originally taught. It became the basic method for reading and meditating upon the Bible after making the text secure within one's memory. Within this tradition, the art of memory was passed along to the later Middle Ages and the Renaissance (or Early Modern period). When Cicero and Quintilian were revived after the 13th century, humanist scholars understood the language of these ancient writers {{within the context of the}} medieval traditions they knew best, which were profoundly altered by monastic practices of meditative reading and composition.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{purposes}} of <b>rhetorical</b> criticism fall within three evaluative categories: academic, ethical, and political.

Rhetorical criticism has gained more recognition and importance in the past forty years, especially in the academic field.

25|$|Trained at the University of Chicago in {{the history}} of {{philosophy}} under the tutelage of Richard McKeon, where McKeon emphasized <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical</b> and pragmatic functions of philosophy (Dewey), Rabinow renewed this activity and moved beyond the work of his advisor, Clifford Geertz. Encounters with Robert Bellah and Hubert Dreyfus at UC Berkeley {{in the context of a}} National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship year (1976–77) led to a focus on interpretive social science and ethical practice on the one hand, and an education in Heidegger and the question of technology and modern philosophy on the other. The work with Dreyfus led to a fortuitous encounter with Michel Foucault in 1979, the development of an intense dialogic working relationship, and a joint book with Dreyfus, Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics, as well as an anthology of Foucault’s works (in consultation with Foucault), The Foucault Reader, published shortly before his death.|$|E
25|$|While the {{scientific}} study of language is known as linguistics and is generally considered a social science, a natural science or a cognitive science, the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as Wittgenstein claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical,</b> associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including prose forms (such as the novel), poetry and drama, also {{lies at the heart of}} the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a foreign language usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of Lysias is relatively simple and {{would later be}} regarded as a model of pure diction for Atticists. Most of <b>the</b> <b>rhetorical</b> figures are sparingly used—except such as consist in the parallelism or opposition of clauses. The taste of the day not yet emancipated from the influence of the Sicilian rhetoric probably demanded a large use of antithesis. Lysias excels in vivid description; he has also the knack of marking the speaker's character by light touches. The structure of his sentences varies a good deal according to the dignity of the subject. He has equal command over the periodic style (κατεστραμμένη λέξις) and the non-periodic or continuous (εἰρομένη, διαλελυμένη). His disposition of his subject-matter is always simple. The speech has usually four parts: introduction (προοίμιον), narrative of facts (διήγησις), proofs (πίστεις), which may be either external, as from witnesses, or internal, derived from argument on the facts, and, lastly, conclusion (ἐπίλογος).|$|E
