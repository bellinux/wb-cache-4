5000|$|A centitone (also Iring) is {{a musical}} {{interval}} (2) equal to two cents (2) proposed {{as a unit}} of measurement (...) by Widogast Iring in Die reine Stimmung in der Musik (1898) as 600 steps per octave and later by Joseph Yasser in A Theory of Evolving Tonality (1932) as 100 steps per equal <b>tempered</b> <b>whole</b> <b>tone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{composer}} Olivier Messiaen {{called the}} <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale his first mode of limited transposition. The composer and music theorist George Perle calls the <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale interval cycle 2, or C2. Since {{there are only}} two possible <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale positions (that is, the <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale can be transposed only once), it is either C20 or C21. For this reason, the <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale is also maximally even and may be considered a generated collection.|$|R
5000|$|In music, a <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> {{scale is}} a scale {{in which each}} note is {{separated}} from its neighbours by the interval of a <b>whole</b> <b>tone.</b> There are only two complementary <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scales, both six-note or hexatonic scales: ...|$|R
5000|$|A major scale {{may be seen}} as two {{identical}} tetrachords {{separated by}} a <b>whole</b> <b>tone.</b> Each tetrachord consists of two <b>whole</b> <b>tones</b> followed by a semitone: ...|$|R
5000|$|The meantone is {{the mean}} between the major <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> (9:8 in just intonation) and the minor <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> (10:9 in just intonation), i.e., the {{geometric}} mean of 9:8 and 10:9.|$|R
5000|$|A tritone (abbreviation: TT) is {{traditionally}} {{defined as a}} musical interval composed of three <b>whole</b> <b>tones.</b> As the symbol for <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> is T, this definition may also be written as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|Ratio {{interval}} r = , and unit hundredth of the <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> [...] (b = [...] and d = 100), then m = 344.247... and t (...) = 344.247 hundredths of the <b>whole</b> <b>tone.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This {{tone row}} {{consists}} of alternating minor and major triads starting {{on the open}} strings of the violin, followed by a portion of an ascending <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale. This <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale reappears in the second movement when the chorale [...] "It is enough" [...] (Es ist genug) from Bach's cantata no. 60, which opens with consecutive <b>whole</b> <b>tones,</b> is quoted literally in the woodwinds (mostly clarinet).|$|R
50|$|Any {{augmented}} fourth can be decomposed {{into three}} <b>whole</b> <b>tones.</b> For instance, the interval F-B is an augmented fourth {{and can be}} decomposed into the three adjacent <b>whole</b> <b>tones</b> F-G, G-A, and A-B.|$|R
5000|$|Ratio {{interval}} r = 2 (octave) and unit hundredth of the <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> [...] (b = [...] and d = 100), then m = 588.4949... and t(2) = 588.4949 hundredths of the <b>whole</b> <b>tone.</b>|$|R
50|$|A neutral third can {{be formed}} by {{stacking}} a neutral second {{together with a}} <b>whole</b> <b>tone.</b> Zalzal's wosta, a neutral third of 354.55 cents, may be constructed through {{the addition of a}} <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> and a three quarter tone: 9/8 X 12/11 = 27/22. Based on its positioning in the harmonic series, the undecimal neutral third implies a root one <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> below the lower of the two notes.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} {{creates a}} <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> context. This changes to an A Lydian context which, in bars 15-21, transitions, through {{the addition of}} G natural, to the <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> context of a new motive at bar 21. This A Lydian context serves to transition from the <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> mode on A to the A major context, inflected by occasional Lydian Ds, of the second theme at bar 67.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, the <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale's {{interval}} vector contains:and {{has only}} two distinct transpositions (every even transposition of the <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale is identical with the original and every odd transposition has no common tones whatsoever).|$|R
5000|$|A septimal <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> of 8:7 as we {{have seen}} is {{approximated}} by two secors, and a neutral third of 11:9 by three secors. In miracle, a minor third plus a septimal <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> is also equated with the 11th harmonic. This means that the gap between a minor third plus a septimal <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> [...] and the 11th harmonic (an 11:8 ratio), 385:384 [...], is also tempered out. Miracle, therefore, is the temperament tempering out 225:224, 1029:1024 and 385:384 at the same time.|$|R
50|$|There are 6 <b>whole</b> <b>tones</b> in an octave.|$|R
5000|$|In 12 equal {{temperament}} this interval is not tempered out; the septimal <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> and septimal minor third {{are replaced}} by the normal <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> and minor third. This makes the diesis a semitone, about three times its [...] "correct" [...] size. The septimal diesis is tempered out {{by a number of}} equally tempered tuning systems, including 19-ET and 24-ET; these tunings do not distinguish between the septimal <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> and septimal minor third. It is not tempered out however by 22-ET or 31-ET (or indeed any equal temperament with at least 30 steps).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> {{scale has}} no leading tone and because all tones {{are the same}} {{distance}} apart, [...] "no single tone stands out, and the scale creates a blurred, indistinct effect". This effect is especially emphasised {{by the fact that}} triads built on such scale tones are augmented. Indeed, one can play all six <b>tones</b> of a <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scale simply with two augmented triads whose roots are a major second apart. Since they are symmetrical, <b>whole</b> <b>tone</b> scales do not give a strong impression of the tonic or tonality.|$|R
