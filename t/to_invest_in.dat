40|$|<b>Investing</b> <b>in</b> {{art objects}} yields {{financial}} and psychic returns. The psychic returns arise since art has a superior consumption good aspect as well. The {{question is whether}} {{it is possible to}} measure the psychic returns. One valuation method for estimating the psychic returns <b>to</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> artworks is their rental price. Here, we make use of the prices charged by a Canadian fine art company for its art rental services and calculate the implied psychic returns to be about 28 percent. Next, we review the finance-theoretic approaches to measuring the psychic returns <b>to</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> artworks. We follow Hodgson and Vorkink’s (2004, Canadian Journal of Economics) suggestion that the alpha parameter in the CAPM captures the extent of net psychic returns. The evidence on alpha from the art market applications of the CAPM coupled with the transaction cost data from international art auctions also suggests that the psychic returns <b>to</b> <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> artworks might amount to about 28 per cent...|$|R
