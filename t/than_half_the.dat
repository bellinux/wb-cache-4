Vasan took over, for his directorial debut.|$|E

5|$|The Fulbe {{ruling class}} became wealthy slave owners and slave traders. Slave villages were founded, whose {{inhabitants}} provided food for their Fulba masters to consume or sell. At one time more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> population were slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of carronades {{at this time}} also resulted in guns that were easier to handle and required less <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> gunpowder of long guns, allowing fewer men to crew them than long guns mounted on naval garrison carriages.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{poll shows}} {{a high degree}} of {{satisfaction}} with the work of the local police department. More <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> people surveyed during a 2005–2006 poll declared themselves satisfied (62.3%) or very satisfied (3.3%) with the activity of the county police department. The study found the highest satisfaction with car traffic supervision, the presence of officers in the street, and road education; on the negative side, corruption and public transport safety remain concerns.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{designed}} the distinctive dust jacket– {{a collage of}} newspaper articles in four languages– to highlight that the vignettes carried a sense of journalism or news. The frontispiece is a woodcut portrait of the author, which during the printing process bled through to the next page, ruining more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> print run so that only 170 of the 300 copies printed were deemed suitable to sell. The rest were sent to reviewers and friends.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss's {{academic}} rankings remained {{generally the}} same in his following year at the academy. His scores in drawing, mathematics, and physics were above average, while his merits in French language and history were among the worst. He finished 33rd {{in the class of}} 66. He maintained his spot as the most disciplined in his class, earning fewer <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> demerits than the second-best.|$|E

5|$|Cork is {{produced}} from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested {{from the living}} trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable industry. More <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine bottles. Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E
5|$|FETA {{began to}} be {{concerned}} over the structural wear of the bridge in the 21st century. The planned theoretical capacity for the bridge (30,000vehicles per day in each direction) was routinely exceeded as traffic levels outstripped predictions. The Scottish Government stated in 2006 that 60,000vehicles travelled on more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> days in a year. This raised concerns about the lifespan of the bridge, originally planned at 120 years.|$|E

5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} {{the uniqueness of the}} solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, but they can be completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the uniqueness of the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E
5|$|In general, ticks are to {{be found}} {{wherever}} their host species occur. Migrating birds carry ticks with them on their journeys; a study of migratory birds passing through Egypt found more <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> bird species examined were carrying ticks. The species of tick often differed between the autumn and spring migrations, probably because of the seasonal periodicities of the different species.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December 1781, Zong {{arrived at}} Black River, Jamaica, with 208slaves on board, less <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> number taken from Africa.

5|$|The whole {{operation}} took nearly a month. The armies took dried {{food for the}} soldiers and fodder for the horses, because of the inhospitable conditions. They also consumed garlics and onions, to prevent altitude sickness. Only 4,300 mules and 511 horses survived, less <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> original complement.|$|E
