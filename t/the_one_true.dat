5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Atlus {{and published by}} Namco for the Famicom. An enhanced Super Famicom port was developed by Opera House and released by Atlus in 1995. The second entry in the Megami Tensei series, the gameplay features the unnamed protagonist exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland, battling and recruiting demons as they are pushed into {{taking part in a}} conflict between the demonic forces of Lucifer and the army of <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>True</b> God.|$|E
5|$|Shining Armor, Princess Celestia and {{the others}} {{apologize}} to Twilight for not believing her, and Princess Celestia commends Twilight Sparkle, for it was her instincts and conviction to them that ultimately saved the day; she is heralded as <b>the</b> <b>one,</b> <b>true</b> hero. The wedding ceremony is quickly rescheduled, with Twilight eagerly overseeing preparations for a much happier and profoundly appreciative Cadance. Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are married, and a celebration ensues, with Twilight as the wedding singer ("Love is in Bloom"). During the ceremony and the reception, Twilight's ingering anxiety of losing touch with her brother is finally put to rest when Shining confesses that he persuaded Cadance to accept his proposal when he mentioned she would gain Twilight as a sister-in-law. Furthermore, just before the couple departs for their honeymoon, Shining thanks his sister for all she has done and the siblings reaffirm their love.|$|E
5|$|The player {{begins on}} an island as a new god, created from a family's prayers. After saving their {{drowning}} son, the god follows the grateful family to their village. A large creature is later discovered who tells of its former master, a god named Nemesis, who desires to reign supreme as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> god by destroying all others. The player is told of the Creed; an energy source {{with the ability to}} destroy gods. Nemesis destroys his former creature and attacks the village. A mysterious vortex opens that the player enters to escape Nemesis. The player is transported to a second island and greeted by another god, Khazar. Khazar reveals that it was he who sent the vortex and requests assistance against another god, Lethys, Nemesis' underling, in exchange for resources to rebuild the village.|$|E

5|$|The Messians {{instruct}} the hero {{to use the}} Seven Pillars of Solomon, collected during his travels, at ground zero of the missile attacks in order to open a gateway to the demon world of Atziluth and defeat the demons once and for all. Once in the demon world, the heroes travel through several areas and defeat the ruling demon overlords. If the heroes are carrying Bael with them, they can choose to restore him into his true form, the god Baal. The god Izanagi also asks the heroes to rescue the goddess Izanami, who has been killed by the demons. After defeating all the overlords and managing to revive Izanami, the gods help the heroes travel to Lucifer's castle. If Bael has been restored into Baal, Lucifer explains that the demons are actually ancient gods cast into hell by <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>True</b> God, who is using the party to defeat his enemies, destroy both worlds and create a paradise where mankind will be under his rule forever. Lucifer offers to help the player prevent God's plans, and claims that Satan, {{who was responsible for}} the nuclear war, must be dealt with. The heroes then travel back to the human world to confront Satan. If they did not accept Lucifer's help and killed him instead, they defeat Satan and are then transported before God, who turns them into new deities and creates the Millennial Kingdom. If Lucifer is in their party, they have the chance to do battle with God. After defeating the god, he warns them that he will revive in time, and that without his help they have chosen a difficult path. Lucifer then returns to Atziluth with all the demons, sealing the rift between worlds and leaving humans to rebuild and recover from the war on their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{employees}} pursue Michael, and {{he confesses}} that {{he created the}} rumors to conceal <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> rumor. Andy fears {{that it might be}} the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's ultrasound picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a tire iron in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they essentially reveal was nothing.|$|E

25|$|Most Islamic {{tradition}} conveys Jesus and {{his teaching}} conformed to the prophetic model: a human, as with previous prophets, sent by God {{to a certain}} people at a certain time, to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> God.

25|$|Protestants {{reject the}} Roman Catholic Church's {{doctrine}} {{that it is}} <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> church, believing in the invisible church, which consists of all who profess faith in Jesus Christ. Some Protestant denominations are less accepting of other denominations, and the basic orthodoxy of some is questioned {{by most of the}} others. Individual denominations also have formed over very subtle theological differences. Other denominations are simply regional or ethnic expressions of the same beliefs. Because the five solas are the main tenets of the Protestant faith, non-denominational groups and organizations are also considered Protestant.|$|E

25|$|The Iglesia Ni Cristo {{claims to}} be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> church and the {{restoration}} of the original church founded by Jesus, and that all other Christian churches are apostates. INC doctrine cites that the official registration of the Church with the Government of the Philippine Islands on July 27, 1914, by Felix Y. Manalo—upheld by its members to be the last messenger of God—was an act of divine providence and the fulfillment of biblical prophecy concerning the reestablishment of the Church of Christ in the Far East concurrent with the coming of the Seventh seal marking the end of days.|$|E
25|$|The Qur’an {{does not}} convey the {{specific}} teachings of Jesus. What has {{developed over the}} years was authored by later followers of Islam. What {{is found in the}} Qur’an's about Jesus is that his teaching conformed to the prophetic model: a human sent by God to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> God. In the case of Jesus, Muslims believe that his mission was to the people of Israel and that his status as a prophet was confirmed by numerous miracles. The Qur’an's description of specific events at the end of Jesus’ life have continued to be controversial between Christians and Muslims, while the classical commentaries have been interpreted differently to accommodate new information.|$|E
25|$|In Ultima, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the Avatar, who embodies eight virtues. First {{introduced}} in , the Three Principles and the Eight Virtues marked a reinvention of the game focus from a traditional role-playing model into an ethically framed one. Each virtue is associated with a party member, one of Britannia's cities, and one of the eight other planets in Britannia's solar system. Each virtue also has a mantra and each principle a word of power that the player must learn. The Eight Virtues explored in Ultima are Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility. These Eight Virtues are based on the Three Principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Principles are derived from <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>True</b> Axiom, the combination of all Truth, all Love, and all Courage, which is Infinity.|$|E

25|$|The {{first and}} {{earliest}} view of Jesus in Islamic thought {{is that of}} a prophet; a human being chosen by God to present both a judgement upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to <b>the</b> <b>one,</b> <b>true</b> God, is foundational for all Muslims. From this basis reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Jesus {{is no more than a}} messenger repeating the same message of the ages. Jesus is not traditionally perceived as divine, yet Muslim ideology is careful not to view Jesus as less than this, for in doing so would be sacrilegious and similar to rejecting a recognized Islamic prophet. The miracles of Jesus and the Qur'anic titles attributed to Jesus demonstrate the power of God rather than the divinity of Jesus—the same power behind the message of all prophets.|$|E
25|$|Raine {{enters the}} surface, {{where he is}} {{immediately}} attacked by bandits, but is saved by Dan Hagar (voiced by actor John Goodman), a local wasteland settler who brings Raine to his settlement. Hagar informs him that a powerful technologically advanced organization known as the Authority, that considers itself <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> government of the wasteland, is hunting for Ark survivors for an unknown purpose. Raine briefly aids Hagar's settlement {{and others in the}} local area by completing a few small jobs, and during this time it is revealed that the nanotrites injected into Raine's blood before he was sent into hibernation have granted him superhuman abilities to help him survive the harsh environment, but have made him valuable to the Authority. Hagar believes Raine's continued presence is too dangerous for the settlement, and sends him to the nearby town of Wellspring instead.|$|E
25|$|The main magical {{system of}} the series relies on a system of {{attributes}} which are inherent to every living creature. These attributes are transferable to and from both man and animal, so brawn from a dog can be transferred to a man. Once an individual gives an attribute to another, the giver loses that particular attribute until {{the death of the}} recipient. Each person can only give one endowment in their lifetime. Endowments include brawn (physical strength), grace (physical dexterity), wit (memory and clearness of thought), metabolism (speed at which the body's processes operate), glamor, voice, stamina, sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, talent, will, bloodlust, and pain. The third and fourth last are more difficult to create and are only known by the Inkarrans. The last two are perverse in nature and were devised by <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> master of evil to strengthen her troops and torture the humans, specifically Fallion.|$|E

25|$|A family story {{initially}} recounts {{an actual}} historical event concerning named family members. Seasoned {{with time and}} re-telling, the story gets revised and honed to express specific values and character traits valued in the family. Instead of historical accuracies, the narration becomes a medium to re-state and re-enforce shared values of the family group. These stories generally {{take the form of}} an anecdote and follow the pattern of many common traditional tales. A favorite family story involves how the parents met, or how they decided on <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> partner among several. In one family, if the story is to be believed, the prospective bride had to untie all the knots in the string to demonstrate her care and diligence. Another family tells how the young couple got stuck {{at the top of a}} Ferris wheel when he proposed, and she had to either say yes or jump. Given time and repetition, the anecdotes serve to shape the family story as a whole, populating it with real individuals and historical events made personal. In their transmission, these stories serve to codify the norms of behavior within the family.|$|E

500|$|Some Indian writers {{state that}} Anekantavada is an inclusivist {{doctrine}} positing that Jainism accepts [...] "non-Jain teachings as partial versions of truth", {{a form of}} sectarian tolerance. Others scholars state this is incorrect and a reconstruction of Jain history because Jainism has consistently seen itself in [...] "exclusivist term as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>true</b> path". Classical Jain scholars saw their premises and models of reality as superior than the competing spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which Jainism considered inadequate. For instance, the Jain text Uttaradhyayana Sutra in section 23.63 calls the competing Indian thought to be [...] "heterodox and heretics" [...] and that they [...] "have chosen a wrong path, the right path is that taught by the Jinas". Similarly, the early Jain scholar Haribhadra, who likely lived between the 6th and 8th century, states that {{those who do not}} follow the teachings of Jainism cannot be [...] "approved or accommodated".|$|E
