500|$|US67 {{crosses the}} Mississippi River into Davenport on the Rock Island Centennial Bridge. [...] Adjacent {{to the bridge}} is Modern Woodmen Park, home of the Midwest League's Quad City River Bandits. [...] Vehicles can {{continue}} to the north on Gaines Street, but US67 traffic is forced <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> to the south to connect to River Drive. [...] Prior to 2010, River Drive carried U.S. Route 61 (US61), but the street now carries its business route. [...] River Drive is prone to seasonal flooding from the Mississippi, {{as was the case}} in 1993, 1997, 2001, 2008, and 2011.|$|E
500|$|A sign on {{eastbound}} I-70 correctly informs motorists that I-70 ends at its four-level stack interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). West of the interchange, {{the freeway}} has {{an average annual}} daily traffic value of 94,221 vehicles. [...] East of the interchange, I-70 formally continued as a four-lane highway for local traffic that averaged 25,300 vehicles per day. [...] The Interstate's speed limit reduces to [...] and then [...] as it passes through its final interchange, a partial cloverleaf junction with MD122 (Security Boulevard), which continues southeast into Baltimore as Cooks Lane. Just east of the interchange, I-70 entered the city of Baltimore and the freeway's median expands into a park and ride facility that was accessed at the Interstate's eastern terminus at a U-turn adjacent to Leakin Park. Eastbound I-70 traffic that wished to access Cooks Lane had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> at the terminus and exit from a westbound loop ramp. Westbound access to I-70 is done via a single entrance ramp off Ingleside Avenue, which is {{considered part of the}} MD 122 interchange. The very short section of I-70 in the city of Baltimore is maintained by the Baltimore City Department of Transportation instead of the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA). The 1.95-mile extension beyond I-695 to the I-70 Park and Ride facility was formally dropped from the Interstate system at the AASHTO Spring 2014 meeting.|$|E
2500|$|Left in/left out (LILO) {{junction}} [...] These junctions {{restrict the}} ingress and egress {{of the minor}} roads; they only permit left-turn entries. To turn to opposite direction, motorists may need <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> on the expressway. These junctions are very common in urban expressways such as in Sungai Besi Expressway and Damansara–Puchong Expressway.|$|E

50|$|In {{the field}} of road transport, a {{turnaround}} {{is a type of}} junction that allows traffic traveling in one direction on <b>a</b> road <b>to</b> efficiently <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> (<b>to</b> reverse course and travel the opposite direction) typically without backing up or making dangerous maneuvers {{in the middle of the}} traffic stream. While many junction types permit U-turns, the term turnaround often applies to road junctions built specifically for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|On 18 August 2008 {{the ship}} {{experienced}} problems opening the bow door in Santander for cars to be off-loaded. As {{a result of}} this the ship had to re-dock, aft into the port first, and the vehicles had to reverse off. This led to further delays and the problem was not fixed before the next crossing to Plymouth later that day; meaning that vehicles had <b>to</b> reverse or <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> <b>to</b> disembark.|$|R
2500|$|The M4 has two of {{only three}} four-level stack {{interchanges}} in the UK, including the first UK example at the junction with the M5 (Junction 20/"Almondsbury Interchange") and the other at the junction with the M25 (J4b). Junction 4b also has to make provision for a railway line passing beneath the M4. [...] Due {{to the nature of}} such junctions, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>u-turn</b> at Junction 20 or Junction 4b.|$|E
2500|$|MD 236 was {{constructed}} as {{a gravel road}} starting in 1929 from the north end. [...] By 1930, a small segment of the highway was completed south from Charlotte Hall. [...] MD 236 was completed in 1933 from Budds Creek to Charlotte Hall, albeit with a county-maintained gap between Wainwright Road and Ryceville Road toward the Budds Creek end. [...] The portion of Thompsons Corner Road in the county system {{was transferred to the}} state highway system in 1956. [...] MD 236 originally continued north along what is now MD 236A to its northern terminus at an acute intersection with MD 5 just south of the MD 5MD 6 intersection in Charlotte Hall. [...] When MD 5 was expanded to a divided highway through Charlotte Hall in 1962, MD 236 remained accessible only from southbound MD 5; traffic from northbound MD 5 needed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> at MD 6 to access MD 236. [...] The northern end of MD 236 was relocated to its present perpendicular intersections with the opposing directions of MD 5 between 1981 and 1993.|$|E

50|$|To go to Bandar Utama Damansara, via the {{northbound}} {{route of}} New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE), {{you should see}} the 1 Tech Park (formerly the Sony building) on your left, right after the toll plaza. Continue straight, all the way down until you see an intersection on your left leading <b>to</b> Damansara Jaya. <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> here and continue. Just before you see the toll booth again, go up the ramp on your left. At the traffic light you can opt to turn left to go to BU11/BU12 or to turn right to head to the BU1 until BU10.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} is split between several drainage basins. The rivers {{in the northwestern}} part drain into the Pchyozhva and Oskuya Rivers, left tributaries of the Volkhov. The north of the district lies in the basins of the Syas River and its right tributary, the Volozhba. The center and the south belong to the basin of the Msta River, which crosses {{the southern part of}} the district. The principal tributary of the Msta within the {{district is}} the Mda, which crosses the whole district from south <b>to</b> north, <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> near Nebolchi, flows south, and joins the Msta from the right. The rivers in the eastern areas of the district drain into the Pes River. Since the Pes belongs to the basin of the Volga, and the Syas, the Pchyovzha, and the Msta all belong to the basin of the Neva, the district is crossed by the divide between the basins of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caspian Sea.|$|R
50|$|On {{interchanges}} with U-turns, traffic {{intending to}} complete a left turn must either pass the interchange, <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> and then exit right, or exit right first and then <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn.</b>|$|R
50|$|Occasionally, on {{a divided}} highway, special U-turn ramps exist to allow traffic <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn,</b> though often their use is {{restricted}} to emergency and police vehicles only.|$|E

50|$|A {{recent case}} (Davis v Schrogin 2006) is lately quoted as a defence to Powell v Moody. However, Davis v Schrogin does not {{supersede}} Powell v Moody {{and that the}} latter is still considered in out-of-court settlements. This is because {{in the case of}} Davis v Schogin, the car driver emerged from a line of traffic <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> and not from a side road.|$|E
5000|$|Davis has {{delivered}} motivational presentations {{for more than}} 3,000 schools in 25 countries. [...] One of his main messages is how individuals can decide <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> in their lives through hard work and persistence, making good personal choices that lead to personal respect and healthy relationships. Additional presentations at school assemblies discuss handling peer pressure, avoiding bullying and preventing substance use and abuse.|$|E
5000|$|Burlingame was {{originally}} established as Council City {{and was an}} important stop on the Santa Fe Trail. The Council City post office was opened on April 30, 1855. [...] The wide brick main street, Santa Fe Avenue, was built wide enough for an oxen team to be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn.</b> The city and post office name was changed from Council City to Burlingame on January 30, 1858, in honor of Anson Burlingame.|$|E

50|$|At the Pelham Bay Park station, Manhattan-bound buses use stops {{directly}} {{adjacent to}} where Bay Plaza and Orchard Beach-bound buses pick up passengers—along southbound Amendola Place—resulting in passengers sometimes boarding buses {{going in the}} wrong direction. Westbound buses use the southernmost two stops, while terminating eastbound locals and buses towards Bay Plaza and Orchard Beach use the northernmost two stops closest to the subway. The setup requires westbound service <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> onto the New England Thruway before heading onto Pelham Parkway.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, TIME {{correspondent}} Theodore H. White treks to Henan {{to investigate}} the famine. He discovers that while people are dying every day and some have even resorted to cannibalism, the Nationalist Government is still not doing anything to help the refugees. Chiang Kai-shek even wants to give up defending Henan, leaving the refugees to the Japanese. White's report is eventually published in the magazine, causing the Nationalist Government <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> on their policy. However, when relief supplies are being distributed in the province, the local officials and soldiers start fighting over who should receive a larger share.|$|E

50|$|Just before 10 a.m. as the Leinster was sailing {{east of the}} Kish Bank in a heavy swell, {{passengers}} saw a torpedo {{approach from}} the port side and pass {{in front of the}} bow. A second torpedo followed shortly afterwards, and it struck the ship forward on the port side {{in the vicinity of the}} mail room. Captain Birch ordered the ship <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> in an attempt to return to Kingstown as the ship began to settle slowly by the bow; however, the ship sank rapidly after a third torpedo struck the Leinster, causing a huge explosion.|$|E
50|$|There are two intersections {{where the}} Parkway crosses under the {{intersecting}} road, at Martin Road and Interstate 565. Currently the frontage roads end at Martin Road because a non-limited access portion still exists {{between it and}} the Whitesburg Drive overpass. Plans for construction under way call for the frontage roads to be raised up to Martin Road's grade and have signalled intersections; it will work like the overpasses except for the over/under relationship being reversed. At the I-565 interchange, it is possible for Parkway traffic <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> by executing a sequence of ramp lane changes, although no signage indicates this.|$|E
