40|$|National audienceNone of the {{far-reaching}} {{experiments in}} electricity industry liberalisation {{was able to}} ensure the timely and optimal capacity mix development. The theoretical market model features market failures due to the specific volatility of prices, {{and the difficulty of}} creating complete markets for hedging. In this paper, we focused on a specific failure, i. e. the impossibility of allocating the various risks borne by the producer onto suppliers and consumers in order to allow capacity development. Promotion of short-term competition by mandating vertical de-integration tends to distort investments in generation by impeding efficient risk allocation. Following Joskow's (2006) line, we developed an empirical analysis of how to secure investments in generation through vertical arrangements between decentralised generators and large purchasers, suppliers or consumers. Empirical observations as risk analysis shows that adopting such arrangements may prove necessary. Various types of long-term contracts between generators and suppliers (fixed-quantity and fixed-price contract, indexed price contract, <b>tolling</b> <b>contract,</b> financial option) appear to offer effective solutions for risk allocation. Vertical integration appears to be another effective way to allocate risk. But it remains an important complementary condition to efficient risk allocation, i. e. that retail competition is sticky or legally limited {{in order to have a}} large part of risks borne by consumers on the different market segments...|$|E
40|$|Electricity {{prices in}} {{competitive}} markets are extremely volatile with salient {{features such as}} mean-reversion and jumps and spikes. Modeling electricity spot prices is essential for asset and project valuation as well as risk management. I introduce the mean-reversion feature into a classical variance gamma model to model the electricity price dynamics as a mean-reverting variance gamma (MRVG) process. Derivative pricing formulae are derived through transform analysis and model parameters are estimated by the generalized method of moments and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. A real option approach is proposed to value a <b>tolling</b> <b>contract</b> incorporating operational characteristics of the generation asset and contractual constraints. Two simulation-based methods are proposed to solve the valuation problem. The effects of different electricity price assumptions on the valuation of tolling contracts are examined. Based on the valuation model, I also propose a heuristic scheme for hedging tolling contracts and demonstrate {{the validity of the}} hedging scheme through numerical examples. Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and Generalized ARCH (GARCH) models are widely used to model price volatility in financial markets. Considering a GARCH model with heavy-tailed innovations for electricity price, I characterize the limiting distribution of a Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimator of the conditional electricity price distribution, which corresponds to the extremal quantile of the conditional distribution of the GARCH price process. I propose two methods, the normal approximation method and the data tilting method, for constructing confidence intervals for the conditional VaR estimator and assess their accuracies by simulation studies. The proposed approach is applied to electricity spot price data taken from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland market to obtain confidence intervals of the empirically estimated Value-at-Risk of electricity prices. Several directions that deserve further investigation are pointed out for future research. ...|$|E

40|$|The South African National Roads Agency Ltd (SANRAL) is the {{custodian}} of the 9 208 km national {{road network}} in South Africa. SANRAL's mandate is to develop, maintain and operate this national economic asset. 26, 3 °/o {{of the national}} road network consists of toll roads. The operation and maintenance of the toll facilities are let by SANRAL through a public open tender process. The successful tenderer is then appointed by SANRAL on a contract basis as the toll road operator. The operation and management of toll facilities involve various technical and managerial disciplines, such as electrical, mechanical and civil engineering, toll collection, and operations management. Historically, <b>toll</b> operations <b>contracts</b> were fragmented into separate sub-contracts {{for each of the}} disciplines. This resulted in a substantial amount of project management input from SANRAL. In addition to SANRAL's high level of management input, it also carried the risk of fraud. SANRAL had no incentives for a toll operator to increase the toll revenues, neither did it impose any penalties for poor performance. In order to simplify the project structure, as well as to improve on the old <b>toll</b> <b>contract</b> format, SANRAL developed a new <b>toll</b> operations <b>contract</b> model, aptly named Comprehensive Toll Road Operations and Maintenance or CTROM (C-T -ROM). Amongst others, the benefits of the new contract format are: • That it simplifies SANRAL's management input by providing a single point of contact between SANRAL and a principal toll operator, under whose supervision all the sub-contractors reside. The toll operator therefore assumes the responsibility and accountability to manage the sub-contractors. • The introduction of penalties that are imposed on the toll operator, should he not perform his contractually specified duties and obligations. • The transfer of fraud risk to the toll operator. • An increase in the toll revenue by offering the toll operator a revenue-sharing incentive. The first contracts let under the CTROM format were the N 2 North Coast Toll Road and the N 2 South Coast Toll Road in July 2001. As these toll routes had been in operation for a while before the CTROM contracts were procured, comparisons could be made on the pre-CTROM and post-CTROM costs. Initial indications were, although there were some structural differences between {{the old and the new}} format, that these two CTROM contracts were between 7 and 13 °/o more expensive than their predecessors. An extrapolation of these values to all the current CTROM contracts results in additional costs to SANRAL of between R 10 m and R 20 m per annum, when compared to the previously used managed contract format. The more expensive CTROM contracts have brought about significant benefits, such as the tra'nsfer of fraud risk from SANRAL to the toll operator, as well as a simpler project structure in the form of a single point of responsibility. The intention of this research report is to determine whether the increase in cost has been worthwhile, and whether there are areas for further improvement. In other words, are the more expensive CTROM contracts providing SANRAL with an associated increase in value for its money? Not only is SANRAL concerned with the prudential expenditure of its toll revenues, but it is also under legislated obligations to ensure that funds are spent in the most appropriate and efficient ways. In order to better understand value for money and related concepts, the author explores various academic theories in the form of a literature study. By building a platform from which to conduct further analyses, the author can then apply the newly found knowledge to test the hypothesis that SANRAL is not achieving optimal value for money on its CTROM contracts. Concepts and theories that are studied in the literature review include: • The legislative and institutional framework; and • Key terminology such as risk management, the public sector comparator, value for money, and performance penalties on contracts. Many of the concepts have been explored worldwide, especially in developed countries such as Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, where those countries' governments actively encourage private sector investment in public infrastructure. In the analytical part of the research report, the author explores the causes of the additional costs on two of SANRAL's toll routes, namely: • The Mariannhill Toll Route, which is located on the N 3 between Pinetown and Key Ridge in the province of KwaZulu-Natal; and • The N 17 Toll Route between Springs and Wemmer Pan in the province of Gauteng. The analyses suggest that the operations and maintenance (O&M) costs of the N 3 Mariannhill and N 17 toll routes under the CTROM contracts are 46, 3 °/o and 20, 4 °/o more expensive than on the previous contracts. Some of the factors that could play a role in the increased cost of the CTROM contracts are: • The contract duration; • Risk transfer to the toll operator; • Penalties applied when the toll operator does not conform to the required specifications; and • Complex performance specifications.

First, we investigate the overall effects of the winner’s curse on bidding behaviour in such auctions. Second, we examine {{the effects of}} the winner’s curse on contract auctions with differing levels of common-value components. Third, we investigate how the winner’s curse affects bidding behaviour in such auctions when we account for the possibility for bidders to renegotiate.

Besides, we observe that this winner’s curse effect is even larger for projects where the common uncertainty is greater. Perhaps more interestingly, we show that the winner’s curse effect is weaker when the likelihood of renegotiation is higher, i. e. bidders will bid more strategically in weaker institutional frameworks, in which renegotiations are easier. Besides our conclusion contrasts with standard results. While the traditional implication would be that more competition is not always desirable when the winner’s curse is particularly strong, we show that, in <b>toll</b> road concession <b>contract</b> auctions, more competition may be always desirable...|$|R
40|$|Contractual {{agreements}} between public agencies and private {{companies in the}} form of public-private partnerships (PPPs) have proven to be beneficial to both the public and private sectors.

Hosting governments normally allow concession renegotiations when certain serious risk scenarios occur. International PPP practices have shown conflicting results from renegotiations, and many renegotiations have raised serious questions about the viability of the PPP approach.

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} the {{contractual}} design of <b>toll</b> infrastructure concession <b>contracts.</b> We highlight {{the fact that}} the contracting parties try to sign not only complete rigid contracts in order to avoid renegotiations but also flexible contracts in order to adapt contractual framework to unanticipated contingencies and to create incentives for cooperative behavior. This gives rise to multiple toll adjustment provisions and to a tradeoff between rigid and flexible contracts. Such tradeoff is formalized with an incomplete contract framework, including ex post maladaptation and renegotiation costs. Our model highlights the fact that trade-offs are complex and do not correspond to previous propositions coming from a transaction cost framework. More precisely, those previous works argue that a rigid contract is to be preferred as soon as specific assets are high. We highlight the fact that this proposition may be true, but only if other conditions concerning maladaptation costs, renegotiation costs and the probability to see the contract enforced are met. Furthermore, our results stress {{the fact that the}} institutional environment in which the contract is embedded matters.

40|$|Highway {{concessions}} {{are becoming}} quite popular {{all around the}} world as a means to promote private participation in the management and financing of public infrastructure. The congestion problems caused by the limited capacity of the road infrastructure networks in many metropolitan areas are prompting public authorities to adopt the concession approach to improve highway capacity, {{while at the same time}} implementing a congestion pricing approach. This paper describes and assesses the case study of a toll highway concession program, recently implemented in the city of Madrid, to build four radial toll highways intended to reduce congestion and at the same time to raise revenues to fund the new infrastructure. The concessions, which started their operations in 2003 and 2004, have not worked as well as expected. There are several reasons for this. The most important one is that they managed to capture only a small share of the traffic in the corridor. This has caused serious financial problems to the concessionaires, who are now on the verge of bankruptcy. This paper analyses both the reasons behind the government’s adoption of the concession approach, and the reasons why this approach ultimately proved unsuccessful.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the sources of discrepancy between the actual traffic in motorways under concession schemes and the traffic forecast ex-ante. The demand forecast for a specific project is the main variable influencing its realization. From a public sector perspective, socio-economic evaluations are driven by demand forecasts, which gives the basis for choose and hierarchy public projects in order to maximise social welfare. From a private sector perspective, traffic forecasts are the base of financial evaluation and toll setting. Despite its importance and the numerous and important developments in the field, the differences of forecast and ex-post traffic are usually very high. Some recent studies show that differences as big as 20 % are much more the rule than the exception. A huge amount of uncertainty {{is associated with the}} forecasting exercise. First because transport is a derived demand and depends on many exogenous variables, also uncertain; because modelling is and simplification exercise, implies many assumptions and rely on field data, many times incomplete or of low quality; moreover, modelling human (in this case users) behaviour is always a dangerous enterprise. Although these arguments could explain at least the larger part of errors associated with forecasts, one can wonder whether the agents implicated in the forecast would or could use this uncertainty strategically in their favour. In a competition for the field scheme (bids), the bidder may overestimate the demand {{in order to reduce the}} toll included in the bid. This strategic behaviour can introduce a high bias in forecasts. Also, overoptimistic (or overpessimistic) forecasters may introduce a bias in the forecast. We propose to focus in turn on the three main groups of agents involved in the demand forecast process. The forecasters, the project promoters and the users. Study all the issues related to them would be a too ambitious (or more concretely impossible) task. We then focus on some particular issues related to the modelling of the actors' behaviour in the context of the demand forecast for toll roads. Regarding the forecaster behaviour, we present the results of the first large sample survey on forecasters' perceptions and opinions about forecasting demand for transport projects, based on an on-line survey. We first describe the main characteristics of forecasters. We then describe the last forecast forecasters prepared. We turn to the models forecasters apply, the errors they declare on past forecasts and the main sources of errors according to them. We then describe the forecast environment in terms of pressure forecasters receive. These unique results provide a picture of the world of forecasters and forecasts, allowing for a better understanding of them. We turn then to the study of the optimism and overconfidence in transport forecasts. Optimism and overconfidence in general are recognized human traits. We analyze the overoptimistic bias by comparing the distribution of stated errors with actual errors found in literature; we also compare the own skilful of subjects in doing forecasts with studies showing self-evaluations of a common skill - driving. We finally propose a regression of the competence, quality and errors on the main forecasters' and projects' specific variables. Results show that the distribution of errors transport forecasters state has a smaller average magnitude and a smaller variance than those found in literature. Comparing forecasters perception of their own competence with the results found in literature about drivers skill self-evaluation, however, we could not find a significant difference, meaning that the forecasters' overconfidence is in line with what could be viewed as a normal human overconfidence level. The pressure for results forecasters receive and the strategic manipulation they affirm exist merit a special attention. They imply that while forecasters' behavioural biases may exist and should be take in account when evaluation forecasts, the project promoter may influence forecasts by pressuring the forecasters to produce results which better fit his expectancies. We then study the bidders' strategic behaviour in auctions for road concessions. We address three questions in turn. First, we investigate the overall effects of the winner's curse on bidding behaviour in such auctions. Second, we examine the effects of the winner's curse on contract auctions with differing levels of common-value components. Third, we investigate how the winner's curse affects bidding behaviour in such auctions when we account for the possibility for bidders to renegotiate. Using a unique, self-constructed, dataset of 49 worldwide road concessions, we show that the winner's curse effect is particularly strong in <b>toll</b> road concession <b>contract</b> auctions. Thus, we show that bidders bid less aggressively in toll road concession auctions when they expect more competition. We observe that this winner's curse effect is even larger for projects where the common uncertainty is greater. Moreover, we show that the winner's curse effect is weaker when the likelihood of renegotiation is higher. While the traditional implication would be that more competition is not always desirable when the winner's curse is particularly strong, we show that, in <b>toll</b> road concession <b>contract</b> auctions, more competition may be always desirable. Modelling aggregated users' behaviour, we study the long term traffic maturity. We argue that traffic maturity results from decreasing marginal utility of transport. The elasticity of individual mobility with respect to the revenue decreases after a certain level of mobility is reached. In order to find evidences of decreasing elasticity we analyse a cross-section time-series sample including 40 French motorways' sections. This analysis shows that decreasing elasticity can be observed in the long term. We then propose a decreasing function for the traffic elasticity with respect to the economic growth, which depends on the traffic level on the road. Although “unconditional” decreasing elasticities were already proposed in the literature, this is the first work, as far as we know, putting this idea in evidence and giving it a functional form. This model provides better interpretation of the coupling between traffic and economic growth, and a better long-term forecast. From the disaggregate perspective, we study the main individual modal choice variable, the value of time. The value of travel time savings is a fundamental concept in transport economics and its size strongly affects the socio-economic evaluation of transport schemes. Financial assessment of tolled roads rely upon the value of time as the main (or even the unique) willingness to pay measure. Values of time estimates, which primarily represent behavioural values, as then increasingly been used as measures of out-of-pocket money. In this setting, one of the main issues regarding the value of time is its distribution over the population. We apply the Logit, the Mixed Logit and the Bayesian Mixed Logit models to estimate the value of time in freight transport in France. Estimations with mixed logit faced many difficulties, as expected. These difficulties could be avoided using the Bayesian procedures, providing also the opportunity of properly integrating a priori beliefs. Results show that 1) using a single constant value of time, representative of an average, can lead to demand overestimation, 2) the estimated average value of time of freight transport in France is about 45 Euro, depending on the load/empty and hire/own account variables, which implies that 3) the standard value recommended in France should be reviewed upwards. Cette thèse a pour objectif d'étudier les sources d'écart entre le trafic réel vérifié ex-post sur les autoroutes en concession et les prévisions ex-ante. La demande prévue pour un projet est la principale variable déterminant sa réalisation. Du point de vue du secteur public, les gains socio-économiques sont déterminés par les prévisions de la demande, ce que sert de base de choix et hiérarchisation des projets publics en vue de maximiser le bien-être social. Du point de vue du secteur privé, les prévisions de trafic sont à la base de l'évaluation financière et de la fixation du montant du péage. Malgré son importance et les nombreuses et importantes évolutions dans le domaine, les différences entre les prévisions et le trafic ex-post sont souvent très élevées. Des études récentes montrent que des différences de l'ordre que 20 % constituent plutôt la règle que l'exception. Une part d'incertitude très élevée est associée à l'exercice de prévision. D'abord parce que le transport est une demande dérivée et dépend de plusieurs variables exogènes, aussi incertaines; Parce que la modélisation est un exercice de simplification qui implique des nombreuses hypothèses et s'appuye sur des données de terrain, souvent incomplètes ou de mauvaise qualité; en outre, la modélisation du comportement humain (dans ce cas, les usagers) relève toujours du défis. Bien que ces arguments puissent expliquer au moins la plus grande partie des erreurs associées aux prévisions, on peut se demander si les agents impliqués dans les prévisions pourraient utiliser cette incertitude stratégiquement en leur faveur. On propose ici d'étudier les trois principaux groupes d'agents impliqués dans le processus de prévision de demande en transport, dans le cadre particulier d'une autoroute concédée (à péage) : les prévisionnistes, les enchérisseurs et les utilisateurs. L'étude de toutes les questions liées à leur comportement serait une tâche trop ambitieuse (ou plus concrètement impossible). Nous nous avons donc concentres sur certaines questions particulières liées à la modélisation du comportement des acteurs dans le contexte de la demande prévue pour les autoroutes à péage. Tout d'abord, pour étudier le comportement des|$|R
