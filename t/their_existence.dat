5|$|Apathetic agnosticism: The {{view that}} no amount of debate can prove or {{disprove}} the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they {{do not appear to be}} concerned about the fate of humans.

5|$|The Xel'Naga then {{discovered}} the Zerg, small parasitic larvae that could control the nervous systems of other species. The Xel'Naga {{saw this as}} purity of essence, and guided {{the evolution of the}} Zerg as well. However, the Zerg were animals, concerned only with self-preservation. To help further the Zerg as a species, the Xel'Naga created the Overmind, a central consciousness to organize the Zerg. They hid <b>their</b> <b>existence</b> from the Overmind, however. On becoming aware of <b>their</b> <b>existence</b> (after being filled with an overriding directive it could not fight off), the Overmind attacked the Xel'Naga, infesting and destroying the greater whole of the race. In StarCraft II Wings of Liberty, Xel'Naga watchtowers provide vision in a large circular radius around the tower.|$|E

5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's status as an Alien prequel.

5|$|At {{the head}} of Macedonia's {{government}} was the king (basileus). From at least the reign of PhilipII, the king was assisted by the royal pages (basilikoi paides), bodyguards (somatophylakes), companions (hetairoi), friends (philoi), an assembly that included members of the military, and (during the Hellenistic period) magistrates. Evidence is lacking regarding {{the extent to which}} each of these groups shared authority with the king or if <b>their</b> <b>existence</b> had a basis in a formal constitutional framework. Before the reign of PhilipII, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham City Football Club, an {{association}} football club based in Birmingham, England, {{was founded in}} 1875 as Small Heath Alliance. For the first thirteen years of <b>their</b> <b>existence,</b> there was no league football, so matches were arranged on an ad hoc basis, supplemented by cup competitions organised at local and national level. Small Heath first entered the FA Cup in the 1881–82 season, and won their first trophy, the Walsall Cup, the following season. During the 1880s, they played between 20 and 30 matches each season.|$|E

5|$|Bors is {{alerted to}} the {{situation}} and overreacts upon learning {{that one of the}} three anarchists has escaped. Fearing that the agent will alert the world to <b>their</b> <b>existence,</b> he initiates plans for a war economy and decides to question Silvia in her hospital room. Their dialogue reveals the story of his escape during the collapse of governments and the establishment of the microstate. He was damaged and in transport for repairs when the anarchist revolution began 200 years prior, allowing him to survive in hiding. Enraged by his calm indifference to the prospect of war, Silvia attacks him and attempts her escape, but is restrained by guards.|$|E
5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. <b>Their</b> <b>existence</b> is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Admiral Fisher was {{prevented}} from ordering an improved {{version of the}} preceding s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915. To obtain ships suitable for the doctrinal roles of battlecruisers, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified <b>their</b> <b>existence</b> by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.|$|E
