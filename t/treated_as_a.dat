5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can be <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.|$|E
30|$|In earlier theory demonstrations, {{graphene}} was <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{isotropic material}} [29, 30]. Graphene can transfer from dielectric-like to metallic-like when the permittivity is tuned to approach zero. Recently, graphene became well accepted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anisotropic material. When graphene was <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> anisotropic material [31, 32], a linear relation between its in-plane permittivity and effective mode index can be observed. The electric distributions are also different {{in or out}} of graphene when it is <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> isotropic or anisotropic material [33]. In this case, the in-plane permittivity can be tuned by the chemical potential, while the out-of-plane permittivity (in a direction perpendicular to the graphene sheet) does not [33].|$|R

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can be <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E

Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.

5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E

5|$|In 1671 Morgan {{attacked}} Panama City, {{landing on}} the Caribbean coast and traversing the isthmus before he attacked the city, which was on the Pacific coast. The battle was a rout, although the privateers profited less than in other raids. To appease the Spanish, with whom the English had signed a peace treaty, Morgan was arrested and summoned to London in 1672, but was <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hero by the general populace and the leading figures of government and royalty including Charles II.|$|E

5|$|It was {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the woolly hare(Lepus oiostolus),but is now <b>treated</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate species.

In 2005, {{it was found}} that molecular phylogenetics indicated the Yunnan hare and the woolly hare to be sister taxa, and they may exhibit allopatric speciation or parapatric speciation. It might also be related to the Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis) and probably be its northern form.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life is when exactly life begins and ends.
