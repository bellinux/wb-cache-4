40|$|Because {{the tether}} of a {{tethered}} satellite system (TSS) {{can be extremely}} long, {{it would be difficult}} to inspect the damage to the tether. The ultimate configuration of a TSS could be a space elevator (SE). The tether needs to carry a crawler or climber <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> <b>damage</b> to the tether or transport travelers on the SE. Coriolis force due to the climber motion causes librational motion of the tether. The numerical simulations have shown that the original mission-function (MF) control is not applicable to a TSS with a climber because it was intended for subsatellite deployment and retrieval control using a tether, not for a climber on the tether. This paper proposes a new MF control to suppress the librational motion of a tether with a climber. The proposed MF control is a modified version of the original MF control. The active force to drive the climber is determined from the MF. A simplified dynamic model of a TSS with a single climber is used to evaluate the derived controller. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} Lamb waves <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> <b>damage</b> in composite laminates. The proposed methodology employs a network of transducers {{that are used to}} sequentially scan the structure before and after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving Lamb wave pulses. A damage localization image is reconstructed by analyzing the cross-correlation of the scatter signal envelope with the excitation pulse envelope for each transducer pair. A potential damage area is then reconstructed by superimposing the image observed from each actuator and sensor signal path. Both numerical and experimental case studies are used to verify the proposed methodology for composite laminates. Three-dimensional finite element models with a transducer network consisting of four transducer elements are used in the numerical case studies. The experimental case studies employ a transducer network using four piezoelectric transducers as transmitter elements and a laser vibrometer to measure the response signals at four locations close to the transducers. The results show that the method enables the reliable detection of structural damage with locating inaccuracies of the order of a few millimeters inside as well as outside of an inspection area of 100 x 100 mm(2) ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This work {{presents}} {{a method to}} assess and prevent tissue trauma in real-time during surgery. BACKGROUND: Tissue trauma occurs routinely during laparoscopic surgery with potentially severe consequences. As such, {{it is crucial that}} a surgeon is able to regulate the pressure exerted by surgical instruments. We propose a novel method to assess the onset of tissue trauma by considering the mechanical response of tissue as it is loaded in real-time. METHODS: We conducted a parametric study using a lab-based grasping model and differing load conditions. Mechanical stress-time data were analysed to characterise the tissue response to grasps. Qualitative and quantitative histological analyses were performed <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> <b>damage</b> characteristics of the tissue under different load conditions. These were correlated against the mechanical measures to identify the nature of trauma onset with respect to our predictive metric. RESULTS: Results showed increasing tissue trauma with load and a strong correlation with the mechanical response of the tissue. Load rate and load history also showed a clear effect on tissue response. The proposed method for trauma assessment was effective in identifying damage. The metric can be normalised with respect to loading rate and history, making it feasible in the unconstrained environment of intraoperative surgery. SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates that tissue trauma can be predicted using mechanical measures in real-time. Applying this technique to laparoscopic tools has the potential to reduce unnecessary tissue trauma and its associated complications by indicating through user feedback or actively regulating the mechanical impact of surgical instruments...|$|E

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P ME 2017 Radeckixxxiii, 281 pages :illustrationsThe {{non-destructive}} evaluation (NDE) techniques {{making use of}} guided ultrasonic waves (GUWs) have been well developed for years. In particular, the Rayleigh-Lamb waves (RLWs), as a representative type of the GUWs are extensively used in NDE, as well as structural health monitoring (SHM). However, most of the existing approaches have been developed based {{on the use of}} linear features of the RLW, for example the change of the amplitude or the time-of-flight. Although those approaches are normally effective <b>to</b> <b>inspect</b> <b>damage</b> in large-scale structures, from infrastructure to mechanical systems, where the tolerance for the damage size is above few millimetres, they may not be enough for undersized damage. To circumvent such a deficiency, the analysis of the nonlinear features of RLWs was introduced, which can be induced to the wave through different sources, such as fatigue cracks, de-bonding at adhesive joints, plastic zone in materials, or the medium itself owing to material nonlinearity. The influence of these nonlinear sources on the representation of the wave signal in frequency domain can be observed by exploiting such features as the mixed frequency responses (e. g. nonlinear wave modulation spectroscopy), shift of resonance frequency (e. g. nonlinear resonant ultrasound spectroscopy), dual frequency mixing, high-or sub-harmonics generation as reviewed in [72]. The high-order harmonics generation is a nonlinear feature of the particular interest. It is the energy transfer of the incident wave from the fundamental frequency w 0 to its high-order harmonics (2 w 0, 3 w 0 and so on). The aim of the current work is to achieve an insight into the high-order harmonic generation due to the presence of the different sources of nonlinearities in an examined structure, and particularly the "breathing" type damage (such as fatigue crack). The waves concerned are generated by coupled PZT elements. The available theoretical knowledge in numerical and experimental nature is reviewed to understand the behaviour of the generated high-order harmonic, precisely, the second order harmonic, due to the presence of the nonlinear material and "breathing" damage. By extending the nonlinear Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA) in conjunction {{with the use of the}} Spring Model (SM), a dedicated modelling and numerical simulation approach is developed to advance the insight into the generation and accumulation of nonlinearity of guided waves propagating in fatigued materials. The accuracy of the calculated numerical simulation, while considering the synchronism condition is examined. Moreover, the waves excited in the low-and high-frequency regions of the Lamb wave dispersion curves are analysed. Various cases are examined depending on the few characteristics, such as the type of the excitation used, the size and the placement of the damage. The presented results exhibit interesting features, which give different view on the modelling of the high-order harmonic generation in the contrast to the available literature. The results from the performed experiment are shown as a validation of the developed model. The first part of the work is focused on the review of the available analytical solutions of the high-order harmonic generation and propagation in the elastic, isotropic and homogenous structure. For the purpose of comparison, the numerical method-Local Interaction Simulation Approach (LISA) - is expanded by the hyper-elastic material definition in the two-dimensional matter. The cumulative synchronism condition of the high-order symmetric mode was considered, which states that if between two considered modes the phase velocity matching and the non-zero power flux conditions are satisfied, the linearly increasing pattern of the second harmonic with the propagation is observed. The increasing pattern of the second harmonic was observed. However, the trend was in the slight contradiction to the analytical prediction. Instead of the linear increase with the propagation distance, the slight flattening was observed, suggesting that the obtained behaviour is for the case of the approximate phase velocity matching, not exact. Such observation has its roots in the definition of the numerical simulation and it is discussed in the work. The second part of this work is focused on the nonlinearity induced by "breathing" fatigue crack. The conjunction of the nonlinear LISA method with the SM approach was used in order to analyse the influence on the generated second harmonics, and also, the interaction of second harmonic modes generated from different sources of nonlinear behaviour. It was observed, that depending of which excitation types is chosen, the resultant second harmonic magnitude may have different trends upon the propagation distance. Final part of the work contains the results from the experiment performed to validate the developed numerical simulation model. The consistent results were obtained, which give a great potential for further development in the areas of numerical simulations and nonlinear damage detection applications. The conclusions drawn from this study are: 1. The cumulative synchronous pair can be also found among the basic Lamb wave modes; 2. The difference of the second harmonics magnitude behaviour on the propagation distance, when considering various excitation types, is more visible for the high frequency Lamb wave mode pair than for the low frequency mode pair; 3. High influence of the defined numerical parameters and beam thickness on the propagating second harmonic, generated from the high-order symmetric Lamb wave mode pair, is observed; 4. The relative acoustic nonlinear parameter ß' exhibits more appropriate features of defining the damage severity in the structure than analysing the second harmonic magnitude alone; and 5. It is shown through experimental and numerical investigation that the nonlinear material does not have a major influence on the generated second harmonic due to the "breathing" crack phenomenon, for the certain amplitudes of excitation.
