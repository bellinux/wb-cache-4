5|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display <b>territorial</b> <b>behaviour</b> only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.|$|E

5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The mating season, which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the conception rate is often as high as 95%. The mating season, or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and <b>territorial</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E

40|$|Territorial animals settle {{territory}} {{disputes and}} discourage conspecific intrusion via close-range confrontations {{as well as}} nonconfrontational long-range signalling. Since individuals often differ consistently in general aggression and risk taking, the relative use of either close- or long-range <b>territorial</b> defence <b>behaviour</b> is likely to vary with {{the personality of the}} territory owner. Here we quantified the relationship between dawn song, a well-studied long-range signal, and responses to a close-range confrontation as well as how individuals in a territorial population vary in this relationship. For this we recorded dawn song and experimentally simulated territory intrusions via playbacks in wild personality-typed male great tits, Parus major. We show that males that sang at a higher rate at dawn also showed stronger vocal responses towards a simulated intruder, but spent less time in proximity to the intruder. Moreover, males with a higher exploration score, an established proxy for personality traits, showed the strongest vocal and spatial responses during the confrontation, yet exploration behaviour did not predict the dawn song rate.

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{behaviour}} of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, {{it has been suggested}} the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. The legs were robust and strong to support the bulk of the bird, and also made it agile and manoeuvrable in the dense, pre-human landscape. Though the wings were small, well-developed muscle scars on the bones show that they were not completely vestigial, and may have been used for display behaviour and balance; extant pigeons also use their wings for such purposes. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, {{there is no evidence that}} the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius receives more rainfall and has less seasonal variation than Rodrigues, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive <b>territorial</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Archaeology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. This study {{investigates the}} {{evolution}} of modern mammalian faunas in the central interior of southern Africa by testing the hypothesis that {{the evolution of}} the black wildebeest, Connochaetes gnou, was directly associated with the emergence of Highveld-type open grasslands in the central interior. Southern Africa can be distinguished from other arid and semi-arid parts of the continent by the presence of an alliance of endemic grazing ungulates. The black wildebeest is characteristic of this alliance. Open habitats are essential for the reproductive behaviour of the black wildebeest, because territorial males require an unobstructed view of their territories in order to breed. The specialised <b>territorial</b> breeding <b>behaviour</b> of the black wildebeest is the reason why the black wildebeest is historically confined to the Highveld and Karoo areas and why it is reproductively isolated from sympatric blue wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus. The finds from a number of fossil-rich localities, dating from the recent past to approximately a million years ago, have been identified. The remains referred to ancestral C. gnou have been subjected to detailed qualitative and quantitative osteological comparisons with cranial and post-cranial elements of modern and fossil reference specimens. This material includes extant southern African alcelaphines and fossil materials of C. gnou, the extinct giant wildebeest, Megalotragus priscus, and North African fossil alcelaphines. The results show that cranial changes in fossil C. gnou, particularly the more forward positioning of the horns, basal inflation of the horns and the resultant re-organisation of the posterior part of the skull, preceded other skeletal modifications. These cranial changes indicate a shift towards more specialised <b>territorial</b> breeding <b>behaviour</b> in the earliest ancestral black wildebeest, evident in the specimens of the c. million year old Free State site of Cornelia-Uitzoek. Since the <b>territorial</b> breeding <b>behaviour</b> of the black wildebeest can only function in open habitat and since cranial characters associated with its <b>territorial</b> breeding <b>behaviour</b> preceded other morphological changes, it is deduced that there was a close association between the speciation of C. gnou from a C. taurinus-like ancestor and the appearance of permanently open Highveld-type grasslands in the central interior of southern Africa. This deduction is supported by the lack of trophic distinction between the modern black and blue wildebeest, suggesting that the evolution of the black wildebeest was not accompanied by an ecological shift. It is concluded that the evolution of a distinct southern endemic wildebeest in the Pleistocene was associated with, and possibly driven by, a shift towards a more specialised kind of <b>territorial</b> breeding <b>behaviour,</b> which can only funtion in open habitat. There are significant post-speciation changes in body size and limb proportions of fossil C. gnou through time. The tempo of change has not been constant and populations in the central interior underwent marked reduction in body size in the last 5000 years. Vicariance in fossil C. gnou is evident in different rates of change that are recorded in the populations of generally smaller body size that became isolated in the Cape Ecozone. These daughter populations, the result of dispersals from the central interior, became extinct {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene...|$|R

25|$|Crocodiles {{are also}} the most vocal of all reptiles, {{producing}} {{a wide variety of}} sounds during various situations and conditions, depending on species, age, size and sex. Depending on the context, some species can communicate over 20 different messages through vocalizations alone. Some of these vocalizations are made during social communication, especially during territorial displays towards the same sex and courtship with the opposite sex; the common concern being reproduction. Therefore most conspecific vocalization is made during the breeding season, with the exception being year-round <b>territorial</b> <b>behaviour</b> in some species and quarrels during feeding. Crocodiles also produce different distress calls and in aggressive displays to their own kind and other animals; notably other predators during interspecific predatory confrontations over carcasses and terrestrial kills.|$|E
40|$|Many animals defend territories against conspecific {{individuals}} using acoustic signals. In birds, male vocalizations {{are known}} to {{play a critical role}} in territory defence.

We recorded free-living birds in Costa Rica using an eight-microphone Acoustic Location System capable of passively triangulating the position of animals based on their vocalizations. We recorded 17 pairs of birds for 2 - 4 consecutive mornings and calculated the territory of each individual as a 95 % fixed kernel estimate around their song posts. We compared territories calculated around male vs. female song posts, including separate analyses of solo vs. duet song posts. These spatial analyses of singing behaviour reveal that males and females use similarly sized territories with more than 60 % overlap between breeding partners. Territories calculated based on solo vs. duet song posts were of similar size and similar degrees of overlap. Solos and duets were performed at similar distances from the nest for both sexes.

25|$|The rate of interbreeding {{increases}} when dingoes come {{to urban}} centres, {{due to the}} prospect of easily accessible food resources. However, since interactions between dingoes and other feral domestic dogs in the bush differ greatly from those in urban places, so too do the rates of hybridisation. It is known that domestic dogs {{get lost in the}} bush time and again. However; it is assumed that the behavioural differences between dingoes and other domestic dogs are big enough to make it difficult for these dogs to be integrated into dingo-society and successfully breed, especially in remote areas. A further spreading of hybrids might hasten the process of interbreeding by reducing behavioural differences. This could partially explain the higher proportion of dingo-hybrids in Southeast Australia. The most likely possibility is that the <b>territorial</b> <b>behaviour</b> of established dingo-packs, which keeps away all foreign dogs (dingoes included) and prevents them from breeding, curbs the rate of interbreeding. Dingoes owned by humans as pets are likely to use their owner’s home as a base from which to roam, or are abandoned when they reach adulthood. The result of this pet trend is that contacts between dingoes and other domestic dogs are increasing; because pet dingoes grow up without learning the social behaviours that curb mating and therefore crossbreeding. Many such hybrids are rejected by owners or stray to the bush where they may breed with “pure” dingoes. In addition it is proven that hybrids can appear when dingoes mate with livestock guardian dogs; interbreeding can even occur with dogs that were acquired by their owners to specifically kill dingoes.|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{research}} is about midwifery one-to-one support in labour. One-to-one support in labour {{is associated with}} improved birth outcomes. However, uncertainty exists as {{to what it is}} that produces such positive birth outcomes. UK publications advocate the midwife to provide one-to-one support in labour, but research findings question their ability to focus entirely on women due to their medical, technological and documentation responsibilities. All of these studies were based within hospital environments and none were completed in the UK. This indicates a gap in knowledge concerning how midwifery one-to-one support translates into practice in the UK and within midwife–led environments. Methods: The aim of this research was to explore midwifery one-to-one support in labour in a real world context of midwife-led care. An ethnographic approach was completed over three case study sites (Alongside midwife-led unit, freestanding midwife-led unit and women’s homes) each including ten labouring women receiving midwifery one-to-one support in labour. Findings: Two main themes: Balancing the needs of the woman and balancing the needs of the NHS organisation. Inside the birth environment midwives used their knowledge, experience, intuition and motivation to balance six components. These included presence, midwife-woman relationships, coping strategies, labour progress, birthing partners and midwifery support. Outside the birth environment midwives experienced surveillance and <b>territorial</b> <b>behaviours</b> which were heightened during transfer from a midwife-led birth environment to the labour ward.

We investigated the DEP with {{male and female}} root voles (Microtus oeconomus Pallas 1776) using field dyadic arena tests conducted in enclosures where we could test {{for the effects of}} familiarity (familiar versus stranger), ownership (resident versus intruder status) and resource-holding potential (body mass) on <b>territorial</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The results showed that males put more effort into territorial defence than females, and males could discriminate between neighbours and strangers. In males, aggressiveness was influenced by a significant two-way interaction between treatment and ownership. Male residents were more aggressive towards stranger intruders than towards neighbour intruders, while male intruders were less aggressive towards stranger residents than towards neighbour residents. In females, neither treatment nor ownership status had a significant effect on aggressiveness. Familiar males performed more social behaviours but less non-social behaviours than stranger males. Furthermore, there was a clear dominance hierarchy between residents and intruders in stranger dyads, with the male territory holders dominating the intruder in pairwise interactions. To our knowledge, these results demonstrate for the first time DEP in a small mammal with a known pedigree and present the first evidence for “prior resident advantage” in voles. We argue that both ownership status and familiarity status affect how much an individual invests in territory defence.

500|$|The {{concept of}} meta{{population}}s was defined in 1969 as [...] "a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize". Metapopulation ecology is another statistical {{approach that is}} often used in conservation research. Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality, and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms. Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement; because, it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat. Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved {{an expansion of the}} range as plant populations expanded from one area to another.

In this thesis, I examined how arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) used seasonally superabundant foods (geese and their eggs) and how {{access to these}} foods influenced population dynamics of arctic foxes. I addressed this {{against a backdrop of}} variation in lemming and vole abundance (small mammals hereafter) – the main foods of arctic foxes throughout most of their range. Field work was done at the large goose colony at Karrak Lake and surrounding areas in the Queen Maud Gulf Bird Sanctuary in Nunavut, Canada, in the spring and summers of 2000 to 2004. Behavioural observations of individually-marked arctic foxes showed that they took and cached 2, 000 - 3, 000 eggs per fox each year and that the rate at which they took eggs was largely unrelated to individual attributes of foxes (e. g. sex, size, and breeding status) and nesting distribution of geese. Further, the rate at which foxes took eggs varied considerably within individuals in that foxes were efficient at taking eggs at times and inefficient at other times. This may have resulted from foxes switching between foraging actively and taking eggs opportunistically while performing other demands such as <b>territorial</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Comparison of stable isotope ratios (&# 61540; 13 C and &# 61540; 15 N) of fox tissues and those of their foods showed that the contribution of cached eggs to arctic fox diets was inversely related to collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus) abundance.

Although the division into the three branches is still valid the sheer amount of data and basic reading that students must amass necessitates more detailed approaches together with making constant references to modern studies in Linguis-tics, Literature, Communication Studies, and Ethnography. Also the amount of field data that students should be familiarised with makes it more than difficult to encompass syntax, semantics, and pragmatics within a comprehensive course that usually in itself is just a part of a wider curriculum.

40|$|Elevation {{gradients}} {{are associated}} with sharp environmental clines that {{play a crucial role}} in the phenotypic diversification of animal populations. In a variety of organisms, the reproductive output of females declines with elevation in parallel to the drop in environmental productivity and shortening of the breeding season. Little evidence is available on male traits associated with reproductive activities, such as territorial defence and signalling, which may decline because of the low economic defendability of resources and the selective advantage of investing in parental rather than mating (e. g. signalling, chasing intruders) effort in such conditions. Along a broad elevational gradient, we investigated variation in the intensity of territorial defence and sexual signalling in males of the water pipit Anthus spinoletta exposed to song playbacks simulating the territorial intrusion of a conspecific. We found that birds from the lower limits of the species distribution approached song stimuli more closely than those from the upper limits. Moreover, physically challenging songs (broad frequency bandwidths and fast trills) elicited a closer approach, and low elevation birds uttered songs ending with the broadest bandwidths. Other responses to the intrusion, such as the number of songs uttered or the latency to approach, exhibited seasonal or spatial variation irrespective of elevation. This study illustrates the decline of some trait associated with aggressive <b>territorial</b> <b>behaviours</b> during male-male conflicts along elevation, and points to the allocation in sexual signalling and motor constraints to signal production, as potential mechanisms underlying it.
