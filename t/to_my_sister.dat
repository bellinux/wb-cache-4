The rape of Turner’s wife is used as a reason to justify Turner’s rebellion. [...] This is fiction. I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape. [...] Given what happened <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> and how no one was held accountable for it, I find this invention self-serving and sinister, and I take it as a cruel insult to my sister’s memory." ...|$|E

She remarked, [...] "I was talking <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister</b> on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that!".
