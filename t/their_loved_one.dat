25|$|The last subtitle, {{which was}} {{introduced}} by Senators John Conyers and Patrick Leahy, allows {{for the preservation of}} immigration benefits for victims of terrorism, and the families of victims of terrorism.

25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and {{the indignity of}} their situations was directly related to easing {{the pain of the}} living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E

500|$|According to the Houston Chronicle, [...] "perhaps the best, most {{meaningful}} Aggie tradition {{of all is}} one you wish never happened." [...] While students at many schools prize their individuality, [...] "Aggies are all about unity and loyalty. [...] When an Aggie falls, the family comes together to remember." [...] This remembrance occurs annually on April 21 as Aggies observe Muster, a solemn event to honor current students and alumni who died during the previous year. [...] Over 300 Musters are held around the world, with the largest taking place at Reed Arena on the Texas A University campus. [...] All Muster ceremonies feature the Roll Call for the Absent. [...] As {{the names of the}} deceased Aggies are called, a family member or friend answers [...] "Here," [...] and lights a candle, to symbolize that although <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> is not present in body, his or her spirit will shine forever.|$|E

2500|$|Aggie Muster is a time-honored {{tradition}} at Texas A University which {{celebrates the}} camaraderie {{of the school}} while remembering the lives of Aggies who have died, specifically those in the past year. Muster officially began on April 21, 1903, as a day for remembrance of fellow Aggies. Muster ceremonies today take place in approximately 320 locations globally. The largest muster ceremony occurs in Reed Arena, on the Texas A campus. The [...] "Roll Call for the Absent" [...] commemorates Aggies, alumni and current students, who died that year. [...] Aggies light candles, and friends and families of Aggies who died that year answer “here” when the name of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> is “called”. Campus muster {{also serves as a}} 50th-year class reunion for the corresponding graduating class. Some non-campus muster ceremonies do not include the pageantry of the campus ceremony, and might consist simply of a barbecue.|$|E

2500|$|In adulthood, {{being left}} arouses primal fear {{along with other}} {{primitive}} sensations which contribute to feelings of terror and outright panic. [...] Infantile needs and urgencies reemerge and can precipitate a symbiotic regression in which individuals feel, at least momentarily, unable to survive without the lost object. [...] People may also experience the intense stress of helplessness. When they make repeated attempts to compel <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> to return and are unsuccessful, they feel helpless and inadequate to the task. [...] This helplessness causes people to feel possessed of what Michael Balint calls “a limited capacity to perform the work of conquest – the work necessary to transform an indifferent object into a participating partner.” [...] According to Balint, feeling one’s ‘limited capacity’ is traumatic in that it produces a fault line in the psyche which renders the person vulnerable heightened emotional responses within primary relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Detective-III John Metcalf, LAPD, first {{investigated}} Minsky in 1982 for {{the same}} M.O. involving 4 victims. [...] Metcalf again ran across Minsky in 1998, after his release from a 2-year sentence in Massachusetts. According to Metcalf's testimony, Minsky preyed on women randomly selected from a phone book. He was able to imitate voices of various people {{to aid in the}} deception. Minsky would start cold calls by whispering at a barely audible level until the victim called out a name, giving him the information needed to continue the ruse. He would then pose as an attorney to convince them that the aforementioned loved one was in legal trouble. In variations of the scam, he would say that the loved one was involved in a hit and run accident that carried a mandatory two-year sentence. He would tell the victim that a witness would have to be bribed with sex or money in order to drop charges so that <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> would be released from jail. Minsky met with the women as the so-called witness at various locations such as hotels, and sexually assaulted some of them. In some of the cases, he urged the victim to dress provocatively for the meeting. In the 1982 cases Minsky was difficult to prosecute because there was no weapon or threat of bodily injury.|$|E
5000|$|Palliative care is an {{especially}} demanding task for cancer caregivers than less progressive cancer because the care required for those with terminal cancer {{tends to be more}} demanding. [...] Caregivers in this situation often report high caregiver burden lasting the entire period. Caregiver distress also tends to increase as patients progress through this phase, causing a lower caregiver quality of life. Having a difficult time with caregiving increases distress caregivers face as they enter the bereavement period after the death of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> whereas finding meaning in caring for <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one</b> may relate to better long term adjustment for caregivers. Before bereavement, loved ones often face anticipatory grief, where they mourn and prepare for the loss of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one.</b> Families often react with fears of abandonment, anxiety, hopelessness and helplessness, and an intensified attachment to <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one.</b> Upon the death of <b>their</b> <b>loved</b> <b>one,</b> caregivers typically experience grief, which in a minority of cases may be complicated by a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder later in the grief process.|$|E
