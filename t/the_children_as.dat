5|$|The gangsters are {{planning}} to rob a famous chocolate shop in Paris using <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> decoys. The Pott children overhear this and manage to warn the shop owner, Monsieur Bon-Bon. Chitty arrives in time to prevent the gangsters from fleeing. The police arrive and the gangsters are taken away. As a reward Madame Bon-Bon shares the secret recipe of her world-famous fudge with the Potts, and the two families become good friends. Chitty flies the family away to parts unknown, and the book implies that the car has yet more secrets.|$|E
5|$|Writing in {{the journal}} Social Problems, Jessica Fields {{characterized}} Not in Front of <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>as</b> a significant monograph which effectively criticized the rhetoric of protection of the sexual purity of youths {{as a form of}} ideology. Cynthia A. McDaniel wrote in a piece for the journal Counterpoints assessing that Heins had put forth a thesis that attempting to shield youths from events led to negative unintended consequences. McDaniel emphasized that rationale debate is key to a functional society which values freedom of choice. She wrote that debate and introspection were critical to growth in this area, {{in order to determine the}} need to modify behavior patterns.|$|E
5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E
40|$|Views of {{children}} and childhood vary historically, culturally and individually. While historic views positioned <b>children</b> <b>as</b> either evil (products of their parents' intimacy) or innocent (passive {{and in need of}} nurturing) (Branscombe, Castle, Dorsey, Surbeck & Taylor, 2000), a number of other images of childhood have emerged. In 2005, taking a reconceptualist perspective and examining written and visual documents and emergent data, Sorin and Galloway developed a Typology of ten Constructs of Childhood, These are: <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> innocent, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> evil, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> miniature adult, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> adult-in-training, <b>the</b> noble/saviour <b>child,</b> <b>the</b> commodified <b>child,</b> <b>the</b> snowballing <b>child,</b> <b>the</b> out-of-control <b>child,</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> victim and <b>the</b> agentic <b>child.</b> This paper uses the typology to examine data collected through parent and child interviews in Canada and in Australia...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} examine {{the ways in which}} the idea of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> high {{vulnerable}} to risk is constituting new pedagogical subjects, ie, the teacher/caregiver as a professional risk-manager, and <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> a risk-management ‘case’. It does so by indicating how an expanded notion of the duty of care has reconstituted <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> a work-in-progress case rather than 'the concrete subject of [educational] intervention' (Castel, 1991 : 288). It examines how the new teacher as a risk-conscious professional caregiver both needs and comes to acquire a new intimacy with <b>the</b> <b>child</b> not <b>as</b> a fleshly body but as a case of risk minimisation...|$|R

5|$|In January 2013, it was {{announced}} that a contest would determine the mascot of the games. Children under the age of 16 had until March 8, 2013 to submit their ideas. 4,000 ideas and drawings were submitted to the organizing committee during this time frame. In April 2013, a shortlist of six mascot designs (which were produced by professional graphic designers, with the sketches by <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> models) were released, including a raccoon, beaver, moose, two pixie creature twins, porcupine and an owl. The final six were selected based on originality, how well they represent Canadian culture and the branding of the Games, and the appeal they had amongst adults and children. On April 22, 2013, the general public was allowed to vote for the mascot they felt was the best. Voting was open until May 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Journal The Library Quarterly {{published}} an article by Eliza T. Dresang which classed Not in Front of <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>as</b> an effective treatise on the harmful to minors doctrine. Dresang wrote that Heins had successfully shown that this doctrine, which served as the core basis for legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), was demonstrably impossible to prove. She concluded that Heins concisely argued censorship of works from the reach of children can have negative impacts on their level of innovation, healthy mental growth, and adaptive abilities. Writing in English Journal, Tonya Perry discussed the work and emphasized that if the motivation behind children's education was to produce independent critical thinkers, {{it was necessary to}} extend the limits of censorship.|$|E
5|$|Many Flemish {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} eastern England during the 12th century, {{and they were}} persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154; {{a large number of}} them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of Flemish fullers existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes, the children would have presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by green sickness, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and the one most widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken by <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> being Flemish.|$|E

5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating <b>the</b> <b>children.</b> <b>As</b> they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

25|$|Narcissistic parents demand certain {{behavior}} {{from their children}} because they see <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> extensions of themselves, and need the children to represent them {{in the world in}} ways that meet the parents' emotional needs.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{highlight}} how <b>children</b> are created <b>as</b> subjects when their behaviour puzzles, worries or challenges staff in preschool, and how scope for, or limitations to, the children's opportunities to be, know or act differently thereby emerge. An additional purpose is {{to shed light on}} how suggestions for ways of managing and, in Foucault’s sense, governing <b>the</b> <b>children</b> and their behaviour are formulated as a discursive practice in special education contexts at preschool. The study is primarily based on meetings between staff and special educators, as well as texts produced in relation to such meetings. The analysis shows how the discursive practice constructs images of what is considered as special, based on what has appeared as significant in the gaze of <b>the</b> staff. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> is constructed <b>as</b> a multiple subject, grouped in five main topics. These are: <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> growing and developmental, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> regulated, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> transparent and measurable, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> confident and routinized, and <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> deficient. <b>The</b> results give an understanding of how preschool offers or assigns children different identities in relation to the normalizing practice, where both homogeneity and heterogeneity are of significance. The preschool works with governing techniques, such as time and routines, space and materials, body and play. A clear desire for <b>the</b> <b>child</b> to be able to regulate itself is also seen. The observed discursive practice creates some latitude for children in preschool to be, know and act differently, as long as the variation doesn’t become too pronounced, permanent, or extensive in relation to age, or violate too many of the preschool routines and rules...|$|R
