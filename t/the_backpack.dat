Failure to restore the gauge by eating has detrimental effects on gameplay, such as decreasing Snake's ability to aim his weapon and being heard by the enemy due to Snake's loud stomach grumbles.

However, some types of food rot over time, and consuming rotten foods may result in Snake developing a stomach ache, causing the stamina gauge to deplete faster.|$|E

The work focuses and analyses {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the destination through the lens of a backpacker. The empirical material is taken from intensive interviews conducted in Ecuador. A discussion reviews <b>the</b> <b>backpacking</b> identity, how and why backpackers travel; and the backpacker’s opinion about sustainable tourism in South America. In addition, the thesis concentrates on the travellers’ finances and how they prepare for an extended journey...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> suspended-load <b>backpack</b> {{is found}} to improve the energy {{efficiency}} of walking with a load in some scenarios. The objective {{of this study is}} to (i) analyze the dynamic load of <b>the</b> suspended-load <b>backpack</b> over a range of walking speeds and pack masses, and (ii) determine the optimal design parameters for <b>the</b> suspended-load <b>backpack</b> to minimize <b>the</b> effect of dynamic load on the efficiency of walking. A simple spring, damper and mass system is used to model the performance of <b>the</b> suspended-load <b>backpack</b> as well as the typical hiking pack. The oscillating load and phase angle are calculated over a range of loading and spring stiffness values to determine the system resonance and optimal spring stiffness design range for the suspended-load back-pack. Our results reveal that the stiffness for <b>the</b> suspended-load <b>backpack</b> should be designed below one half of the resonance stiffness to minimize dynamic loads at a given walking speed. The location and magnitude of the maximum phase angle is also calculated. A performance comparison between <b>the</b> suspended-load <b>backpack</b> and a typical hiking pack demonstrates the beneficial range for <b>the</b> suspended-load <b>backpack.</b> <b>The</b> suspended-load <b>backpack</b> {{is found to}} provide significant reductions in <b>the</b> peak <b>backpack</b> load, compared with a typical hiking pack, while carrying large loads at fast walking speeds. <b>The</b> suspended-load <b>backpack</b> performs poorly for low pack loads due to in-phase oscillations between the pack and the walking person...|$|R

The devices were described as pipe bombs constructed with Christmas lights and tied together, combined with a remote controlled car that was switched on. The poorly constructed devices failed to explode. Authorities believe that the pipe bombs were meant to target the emergency personnel responding to the scene. The device was hidden inside a canvas bag, and its build was similar to schematics published in Al Qaeda's Inspire magazine. Coworkers noticed the bag before the attack occurred, but thought that Farook would return for it and therefore did not investigate it.|$|E
25|$|The cooling units {{could only}} {{work in a}} vacuum. Water from a tank in <b>the</b> <b>backpack</b> flowed out through tiny pores in a metal sublimator plate where it quickly vaporized into space. The loss of the heat of {{vaporization}} froze the remaining water, forming a layer of ice {{on the outside of}} the plate that also sublimated into space (turning from a solid directly into a gas). A separate water loop flowed through the LCG (Liquid Cooling Garment) worn by the astronaut, carrying his metabolic waste heat through the sublimator plate where it was cooled and returned to the LCG. Twelve pounds (5.4kg) of feedwater gave about eight hours of cooling; because of its bulk, it was often the limiting consumable on the length of an EVA.|$|E

40|$|By {{adopting}} an ontological {{stance of}} becoming, this study traces qualitatively the journeys of contemporary backpacker tourists using the theoretical construct of the 'Hero's Journey' as a conceptual vehicle. This process {{allows for the}} development of a cyclical model of experience that illustrates the backpacker's experience in three stages of departure, initiation and return. This approach reveals the role that former backpackers play through the sharing of knowledge and the invaluable support they offer to novice backpackers through a network of support that is available to contemporary backpackers who choose to follow established backpacking trails. This never ending cycle of journeys becomes instrumental into the shaping of what this paper see as the common, collective consciousness of <b>the</b> <b>backpacking</b> experience and <b>the</b> evolution of <b>the</b> <b>backpacking</b> experience market...|$|R

40|$|Several {{authors have}} done {{research}} on <b>the</b> institutionalized Israeli <b>backpacking</b> trip, but <b>the</b> period {{of military service}} preceding the trip {{has not yet been}} given sufficient analytical attention in this body of work. Therefore this piece investigates the relationship between <b>the</b> military and <b>backpacking</b> as a sociocultural institution in Israel. Ethnographic fieldwork for this study was carried out during a 5. 5 month period, beginning in Israel and following the travelers along the Israeli backpacker trail in India. 	In this thesis the complex interaction between the military and <b>the</b> institutionalized <b>backpacking</b> is seen to take place largely within two domains. Firstly, in the Israeli military-cultural complex the army is related to <b>the</b> institutionalized <b>backpacking</b> trip in several ways. Within this complex, the military as a social structure affects the habitus and subjective dispositions of those who serve. In relation to <b>the</b> <b>backpacking</b> trip, <b>the</b> army transmits a disposition towards siege mentality, and strengthens national solidarity, leading Israelis to form more cohesive groups in India. In the second domain, the army is analyzed as an experience which alters the period of coming of age in Israel. In current theorizing on the subject, the period of emerging adulthood is seen to consist of a number of characteristics. These elements are fragmented in the army. During the liminal phase in India Israelis attempt to rebalance this transition by incorporating those elements of emerging adulthood they feel to have missed out on. These results indicate that the period of emerging adulthood manifested in <b>the</b> <b>backpacking</b> trip is not only culturally specific, but has an adaptive quality. Future research could focus on the growing status of backpacking as a rite of passage in industrialized societies, as well as the negative subjective effects of military service and living in a warzone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{study is}} a {{detailed}} investigation into <b>the</b> <b>backpacking</b> sector of Gauteng. The findings of both a backpacker consumer survey and a backpacker enterprise survey are drawn upon in revealing the current trends and key shaping issues within Gauteng’s <b>backpacking</b> sector. As <b>the</b> province in which South Africa’s major international airport is situated, Gauteng {{plays a key role}} as the starting and concluding point for backpacker travel in South Africa. As such, the form and function of <b>the</b> <b>backpacking</b> industry of Gauteng has evolved to suit this somewhat narrow, yet crucial, role played by the province. Within the limited role that Gauteng plays in <b>the</b> South African <b>backpacking</b> economy, a number of obstacles to the growth and socio-economic impacts of Gauteng’s backpacking sector are identified. Several strategic recommendations are put forward in order to address these challenges. These recommendations aim to broaden the role that Gauteng plays within the budget tourism industry, and remove the barriers to growth, so as to ensure that the sector plays a part in the wider national goals of empowerment and redistributive growth...|$|R
