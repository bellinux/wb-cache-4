30|$|<b>The</b> <b>footstep</b> length {{may also}} be {{estimated}} from the IMU data. If the sensor is mounted on the foot, {{it is possible to}} detect when the foot is motionless and then integrate <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> length from <b>the</b> IMU data [5]. If the IMU is handheld, this method cannot be used, but <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> length can be inferred from the IMU data also by other methods, see for example [6, 7]. A PDR system can greatly improve the positioning locally as the position estimate may be updated at every <b>footstep,</b> but because <b>the</b> errors accumulate over time, PDR is often combined with other sensors that can, at least occasionally, provide absolute position information.|$|R

He received Catholic confirmation in early 1961, and in September of that year he began his studies at the Monsignor McClancy Memorial High School in East Elmhurst.

40|$|The brain organizes sound into {{coherent}} sequences, termed audi-tory streams. We {{asked whether}} task-irrelevant sounds would be detected as separate auditory streams {{in a natural}} listening envir-onment that included three simultaneously active sound sources. Participants watched a movie with sound while street-noise and sequences of naturally varying footstep sounds were presented in the background. Occasional deviations in <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> sequences elicited <b>the</b> mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential. The elicitation of MMN showed that the regular features of <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> sequences had been registered and their violations detected, which could only occur if <b>the</b> <b>footstep</b> sequence had been detected as a separate auditory stream. Our results demonstrate that sounds are organized into auditory streams irrespective of their relevance to ongoing behavior. NeuroRepor...|$|R

5|$|Emmy's father, Max Noether, was {{descended from}} a family of {{wholesale}} traders in Germany. At 14, he had been paralyzed by polio. He regained mobility, but one leg remained affected. Largely self-taught, he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Heidelberg in 1868.

Max Noether's mathematical contributions were to algebraic geometry mainly, following in <b>the</b> <b>footsteps</b> of Alfred Clebsch. His best known results are the Brill–Noether theorem and the residue, or AF+BG theorem; several other theorems are associated with him; see Max Noether's theorem.|$|E

McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E
