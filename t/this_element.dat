The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 7.6seconds, although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may have a longer half-life of 67seconds.

5|$|Spielberg first {{contacted}} screenwriter David Self {{to adapt}} the story into a feature film. Self wrote an initial draft that remained close to the source material and retained most of its dialogue. The screenplay was then rewritten by uncredited writers, distancing the script from the graphic novel and leaving the core elements of the story. Some of the harsher aspects of the story were toned down as the script became more streamlined; for example, in some early drafts of the screenplay, Sullivan became an alcoholic, but <b>this</b> <b>element</b> was ultimately absent from the final version.|$|E

Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E
