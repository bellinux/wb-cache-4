5|$|After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, {{many people}} {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} cars across the country without <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended disinfecting private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from the severe flooding. Many people {{took advantage of the}} flood victims, including fraudulent contractors and suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six {{disaster}} recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. The National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500people. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses. After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. By six months after the storm, around 120,000 Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05billion (2001USD, $1.36billion 2012USD).|$|E

He <b>tells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bee <b>of</b> Osmotar and <b>the</b> honey he brings. He <b>tells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grand wooden barrels with copper bands used to store the feisty beer. Louhi then resolves to make beer, and places it in wooden barrels with copper hoops.|$|R
50|$|Friel's play <b>tells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{struggle}} between England and Ireland during this turbulent time.

5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, {{as a pair}} of {{gay male}} ambassador-spies attempt to {{infiltrate}} and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.|$|E
5|$|The {{allied forces}} of Olaf and Constantine met {{the forces of}} Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh, at a site which {{is the subject of}} much debate, {{although}} current scholarly consensus identifies the site as Bromborough in Cheshire. Olaf and Constantine commanded the Viking troops while Æthelstan alongside his brother Edmund led the English troops into the battle. Contemporary accounts indicate both sides suffered many casualties but the result was a decisive English victory. Olaf and Constantine survived the battle and returned to Ireland and Scotland respectively, however one of Constantine's sons died. The battle is well-attested, with references in Irish chronicles, and a poetic <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The numerous references to it in various chronicles throughout the British Isles testify to its perceived importance at the time.|$|E
5|$|Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz is a Broadway musical {{with music}} and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman. It {{is based on the}} 1995 Gregory Maguire novel , an {{alternative}} <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The musical is told {{from the perspective of the}} witches of the Land of Oz; its plot begins before and continues after Dorothy's arrival in Oz from Kansas, and it includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. Wicked tells the story of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) and Galinda (whose name later changes to Glinda the Good Witch), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the Wizard's corrupt government and, ultimately, Elphaba's public fall from grace.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} form {{of visual}} narration {{is the so-called}} Stations of the Cross cycle, <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Passion (trial and execution) of Jesus.

The Stations of the Cross usually take the form of oil paintings, moulded and painted plaster or carved wood set into frames and suspended on the aisle walls so that the sequence may be easily followed.|$|E
25|$|While {{there had}} been several Swedish {{immigrant}} colonies earlier in American history, notably the short-lived colony at New Sweden in Delaware, the Janssonist emigrants were an early group of Swedish immigrants that triggered a larger wave of immigration {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century. Letters home from Janssonists to their friends and family, <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fertile agricultural land in the interior of North America, stimulated substantial migration for several decades and the formation of a distinct Swedish-American ethnic community of the American Midwest.|$|E

25|$|The {{next major}} {{expedition}} into Wisconsin {{was that of}} Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet in 1673. After hearing rumors from Indians <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence of the Mississippi River, Marquette and Joliet set out from St. Ignace, {{in what is now}} Michigan, and entered the Fox River at Green Bay. They canoed up the Fox until they reached the river's westernmost point, and then portaged, or carried their boats, to the nearby Wisconsin River, where they resumed canoeing downstream to the Mississippi River. Marquette and Joliet reached the Mississippi near what is now Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin in June, 1673.|$|E

It would go into the castle and torment Mitsushige every night. Mitsushige's loyal retainer Komori Hanzaemon finally killed it and saved the Nabeshima family.|$|E

25|$|They {{discovered}} {{that in the}} 1940s, her father and his brothers had decided against continued <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hemings-Jefferson story to their children, out of fear the younger people would be discriminated against. The family's new knowledge of their history enabled DNA researchers in 1998 to locate Jean's cousin, John Weeks Jefferson, a male descendant of Eston Hemings Jefferson, for testing. His Y-chromosome matched the rare haplotype of the Thomas Jefferson male line. The Carr male line did not match, conclusively refuting the oral history of Thomas Jefferson Randolph that Peter Carr {{was the father of}} Sally Hemings' children.|$|E
25|$|Storytelling in {{indigenous}} cultures {{is sometimes}} passed on by oral means {{in a quiet}} and relaxing environment, which usually coincides with family or tribal community gatherings and official events such as family occasions, rituals, or ceremonial practices. During the <b>telling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story, children may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story. Furthermore, stories are not often told {{in the same manner}} twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.|$|E
25|$|Thanks {{to family}} {{influence}} Harvey gained a prime commission in January 1795, serving aboard his uncle's flagship the second-rate HMS Prince of Wales as captain.
