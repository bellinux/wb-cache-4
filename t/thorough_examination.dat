5|$|When {{the first}} <b>thorough</b> <b>examination</b> of Opabinia in 1975 {{revealed}} its unusual features, {{it was thought}} to be unrelated to any known phylum, although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms. However other finds, most notably Anomalocaris, suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members.|$|E
5|$|Explorer and {{archaeologist}} Alfred Maudslay visited Quiriguá {{for three}} days in 1881; {{they were the first}} pre-Columbian ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology. He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very <b>thorough</b> <b>examination</b> and made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor excavations, made paper and plaster molds of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures; these molds were then shipped to the Victoria and Albert Museum, with casts being transferred to the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more <b>thorough</b> <b>examination.</b> He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.|$|E

25|$|Yang {{noted that}} Mao {{implemented}} a quota for the executions {{in accordance with}} local populations. Mao argued that hardline counterrevolutionaries counted for less than 1 {{percent of the population}} in all regions, and that roughly 0.1 per cent of the population would have to be executed in order {{to get rid of the}} worst counterrevolutionary elements, while avoiding killing innocents. However, in reality, many provinces did not have enough counterrevolutionaries to meet the quota, and lacked the facilities to implement the mass arrests. As a result, many people were arrested recklessly based on assumptions, and many cases were decided without <b>thorough</b> <b>examination.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1991 Newman was proclaimed venerable by Pope John Paul II, after a <b>thorough</b> <b>examination</b> of {{his life}} and work by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.

The miracle was investigated and confirmed by the Vatican. Newman was beatified on 19 September 2010 by Pope Benedict XVI on a visit to the United Kingdom. A second miracle is necessary for his canonisation.|$|E

25|$|The vagina, {{including}} the vaginal opening, may be altered {{as a result}} of genital modification during vaginoplasty or labiaplasty. Those who undergo vaginoplasty are usually older and have given birth to one or more children. A <b>thorough</b> <b>examination</b> of the vagina before a vaginoplasty is standard, as well as being referred to a urogynecologist for possible vaginal disorders. With regard to labiaplasty, reduction of the labia minora is quick without hindrance, and any complications are rare and can be corrected. The complications are minor enough that those with them may still be satisfied with the procedure. Any scarring from the procedure is minimal, and long-term chronic problems have not been identified. There is no evidence that such surgery improves psychological or relationship problems; however, the surgery has a risk of damaging blood vessels and nerves.|$|E
25|$|The patient lies on his/her {{left side}} with the head resting comfortably on a pillow. A mouth-guard is placed between the teeth to prevent the patient from biting on the {{endoscope}}. The endoscope is then passed over the tongue and into the oropharynx. This is the most uncomfortable stage for the patient. Quick and gentle manipulation under vision guides the endoscope into the esophagus. The endoscope is gradually advanced down the esophagus making note of any pathology. Excessive insufflation of the stomach is avoided at this stage. The endoscope is quickly passed through the stomach and through the pylorus to examine {{the first and second}} parts of the duodenum. Once this has been completed, the endoscope is withdrawn into the stomach and a more <b>thorough</b> <b>examination</b> is performed including a J-maneuver. This involves retroflexing the tip of the scope so it resembles a 'J' shape in order to examine the fundus and gastroesophageal junction. Any additional procedures are performed at this stage. The air in the stomach is aspirated before removing the endoscope. Still photographs can be made during the procedure and later shown to the patient to help explain any findings.|$|E

40|$|Intussusception {{in adult}} is rare. The {{etiology}} {{is different from}} that of childhood. The most common cause of intussusception in adult is known as malignancy. When dealing with adult intussusception, surgical resection is usually warranted for correct diagnosis and proper treatment. This is a case report of cecocolic intussusception caused by an acute appendicitis in adult. The causes of cecocolic intussusception were reported as appendiceal adenocarcinoma, appendiceal mucocele, appendiceal adenoma, or idiopathic. Although this patient underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy under suspicion of malignancy at cecum base, final pathologic diagnosis revealed only acute appendicitis. Thus, the present case emphasizes the importance of prior <b>thorough</b> <b>examinations</b> including colonoscopy when we encounter this rare kind of intussusception in adult...|$|R
500|$|Some reviewers {{commented that}} Stephenson seems to carry his {{understanding}} of the period a little too far at times, delving into too much detail.

[...] Despite the <b>thorough</b> <b>examination</b> of the period, however, Stephenson does take liberty in depicting the Enlightenment. Both main and secondary fictional characters become prominent members of society who advise the most important figures of the period and affect everything from politics to economics and science.
