40|$|The 1000 BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet {{standard}} {{offers an}} easy upgrade path for today's 10 BASE-T and 100 BASE-TX networks. Most office networks uses these two standards and therefore 1000 BASE-T {{is designed to}} be able to use the same Category 5 unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling system. By transmitting and receiving 5 -level symbols on all four twisted wire pairs simultaneously the transfer rate of 1000 Mbps is reached. Two bits are encoded into one symbol and four symbols are transmitted simultaneously, one on each wire pair. The 1000 BASE-T physical layer device has to be able to deal with the characteristics of the UTP cable. For example the UTP cable introduces crosstalk due to induced currents between the wire pairs and also echo due to impedance mismatches between the cable and the device. To ensure that the 1000 BASE-T physical layer devices are compliant with the IEEE 802. 3 ab Gigabit Ethernet standard their electrical characteristics have to be evaluated. The IEEE 802. 3 ab standard provides a set of tests that are required to prove IEEE compliancy. This report provides a detailed description of all the tests needed, including <b>test</b> <b>setups,</b> <b>test</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> post processing code needed for the transmitter tests. ...|$|R
40|$|In concentrating {{photovoltaic}} {{and thermal}} (CPVT) systems, direct sunlight {{is focused on}} a combined central receiver in order to generate heat and electricity at the same time. For a thorough scientific analysis and characterization of CPVT systems, an outdoor <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> has been installed at Fraunhofer ISE. The setup allows temperature dependent measurements of IV characteristics as well as MPP tracking for maximum electric energy output in continuous operation. A thermal cycle enables measurement of the thermal efficiency curve for temperatures up to 120 °C. In order to access an overall energetic assessment of CPVT systems, the energetic losses have been modeled. In this paper the <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> <b>and</b> its measurement <b>equipment</b> is presented. In addition results of a characterization of the used paraboloidal solar dish using the fringe reflection method are shown. First electric and thermal measurements have been performed.

40|$|Whenever an EMC {{measurement}} is made, {{there are}} numerous uncertainties {{in different parts of}} the measurement system and even in the EMC performance of the equipment under test (EUT) which is being measured. It is important to be able to estimate the overall uncertainty, in particular, the <b>test</b> <b>setup</b> <b>and</b> measurement <b>equipment</b> uncertainty. However, making repetitive measurements can reduce the measurement uncertainty, but often economics of time do not permit that. Therefore, a practical process, which is used to evaluate uncertainty in EMC measurement a, according to the principle of uncertainty and conditions in EMC measurement is presented. In this study, an efficient analysis of uncertainty for both radiated and conducted emissions tests is performed. The uncertainty of each contributor had been calculated and evaluating the reported expanded uncertainty of measurement is stated as the standard uncertainty of measurement. This standard uncertainty is multiplied by the coverage factor k= 2, which for a normal distribution corresponds to a coverage probability of approximately 95 %. The result of calculating the uncertainty for both conducted and radiated emission tests showed that the overall uncertainty of the system is high and it must be lowered by reducing the expanded uncertainty for the dominant contributors for both tests. In addition, the result of applying the concept of CISPR uncertainty for both conducted and radiated emission tests showed that non-compliance is deemed to occur for both EUT of both tests. This is due to the result that the measured disturbances increased by (Ulab - UCISPR), above the disturbance limit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This {{document}} {{reports on}} our preliminary {{study of the}} power consumption of typical household networking equipment under different operational modes. Three ADSL modems are studied: Cisco 837, Linksys AG 041 and Linksys WAG 54 G. We consider each modem’s power consumption when it is being in the Minimum Load (powered on with no physical ADSL/Ethernet connections), Idle (powered on with ADSL/Ethernet connection but no user-ininitated traffic) and Loaded (with a high packet per second link load and loaded NAT table). For the ADSL/Wireless Linksys WAG 54 G modem, we also consider its power consumption when receiving and transmitting packets. In the Minimum Load, the Linksys AG 041 consumes the most power, followed by the Cisco 837. The Linksys WAG 54 G consumes the least power. A loaded link tends to increase the power consumption of the Cisco 837 modem, and reduce that of the two Linksys modems compared to the Idle state. Loaded NAT tables increase the power consumption of the two Linksys modems, yet slightly reduce that of the Cisco 837. Transmitting using the wireless interface of the Linksys WAG 54 G with a high bit rate consumes significantly greater power than receiving traffic. Also in this document, our <b>test</b> methodologies, <b>testbed</b> <b>setup,</b> <b>equipment</b> specifications <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> calibration are described. I...|$|R
40|$|The Riverside Energy Efficiency Laboratory at Texas A&M University conducts {{sound quality}} testing for the Home Ventilating Institute. When the Home Ventilating Institute {{initially}} established their sound quality test, the semi-reverberant sound chamber {{to conduct the}} sound quality tests was built at the Riverside Energy Efficiency Laboratory. The Home Ventilating Institute created a standard to specify the procedure for sound quality testing. This standard contained high consideration for performance, reliability, and accuracy. The standard was based on several ANSI standards for sound <b>testing</b> procedures, sound <b>setup</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> standards, <b>and</b> sound rating calculations. The Riverside Energy Efficiency Laboratory presently continues sound quality testing for the Home Ventilating Institute using the semi-reverberant sound chamber. The standard has been revised and updated due to developments for better sound quality test result representation. Resourceful data to assist with further developments comes from the semi-reverberant sound chamber's characteristics. This thesis's purpose was to conduct {{an analysis of the}} performance for the semi-reverberant sound chamber. The sound chamber's sound transmission loss was determined using a fan source with known sound power across the 24 tested 1 / 3 octave frequency bands, 50 Hz - 10, 000 Hz. The sound pressure was recorded inside the chamber and outside the chamber at the sound source. The sound source was placed at three different locations around the sound chamber. In addition, the sound pressure was measured in real time to study the amount of sound pressure fluctuation and maximum amplitude. The background noise was measured inside the sound chamber for these tests. The sound transmission loss profiles were identical for each location. The lowest two 1 / 3 octave bands, 50 Hz and 63 Hz, have low transmission losses. The profile jumps up at the following 1 / 3 octave band and increases with a peak around 1600 Hz before slightly decreasing. The profile of the sound pressure in the time domain showed similar results. The most fluctuation with the greatest peaks was present in the lower 1 / 3 octave frequency bands, and diminished the higher the 1 / 3 octave frequency band. Sound sources around the sound chamber can be evaluated to determine whether an impact is possible on the sound quality tests from these results. The impact of modifications to the sound chamber can use the transmission loss values to help determine the expected performance increase...|$|R
