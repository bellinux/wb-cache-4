5|$|The {{third round}} {{consists}} of <b>two</b> <b>questions.</b> In season 1, the first required {{the team to}} rank three answers in a stated order and started with a value of $15,000. The second had an opening value of $25,000 and {{any or all of}} the answers could have been correct; the contestants had select all correct answers, and only the correct answers in order to get credit. Starting in season 2, the $15,000 question has two or all three answers being correct, and the team must select all of the correct answers, and only the correct answers; the $25,000 question requires the team to rank the three answers in the correct order.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} citizens' attitudes {{conducted}} in May 2006 included <b>two</b> <b>questions</b> {{on the issue}} of the Parliament's seat. On average, 32% people from all member states supported the two-location policy while 68 were against. Support for one location was higher among men than women, and among people over 35 than under. Support for both locations was one percentage point lower in the 10 countries which joined in 2004 than in the 15 earlier members; No group have more than 40 percent support to two locations. Of those against two seats, 76% supported Brussels and 24% supported Strasbourg. In this case support for Brussels was 6 percentage points higher in the 10 new members with women and the under 35 year-olds. The group with the highest support for Strasbourg was the over 35-year-olds with 28 percent support. The citizens of Strasbourg are of course strong supporter's of the Parliament being based in Strasbourg with each session being worth four million euro to the city's economy. In September 2008, Strasbourg's government passed a motion demanding all of Parliament's activities be relocated to the city.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented <b>two</b> <b>questions.</b> First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E

5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first <b>two</b> <b>questions.</b> For the remainder, they may wager any or all of their points. The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, and a chance to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E

Nuzman {{clarified}} doubts by Arne Ljungqvist about doping legislation; Osório and Cabral answered <b>two</b> <b>questions</b> by Prince Albert of Monaco about accommodation and the project's legacy, respectively; and the President of Brazil himself {{responded to a}} question by Austin Sealy about organization risks. Following the presentations by the four Candidate cities, Nawal El Moutawakel presented {{the report of the}} Evaluation Commission to the Session. From a total of 106 eligible IOC members, 95 were available to vote in the first round. Members from the four bidding countries were not allowed to vote until their city was eliminated. Alpha Ibrahim Diallo, Kun Hee Lee, Saku Koivu and the IOC president were eligible members who did not vote. Chicago fell in the first round with 18 votes, while Tokyo received 22, Rio 26, and Madrid 28. In the second round, Tokyo was eliminated with 20 votes, while Madrid received 29 and Rio 46. Rio de Janeiro was elected in the final round with 66 votes over 32 for Madrid. The winning city was revealed by Jacques Rogge at 6:30 (CEST) during an announcement ceremony hosted by Lillian Gjerulf Kretz and Jonathan Edwards. Nearly 100,000 people celebrated the victory on Copacabana beach while watching the live broadcast. Following the announcement, Richard Carrión, Rogge, Nuzman and Paes signed the Host City Contract and officialized Rio de Janeiro as the host of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} how, in {{different}} dialects of Dutch, questions are formed in which a question word crosses a clause boundary. Many dialects allow doubling constructions in which <b>two</b> <b>question</b> words appear, rather than one. Some dialects have identical doubling (with <b>two</b> identical <b>question</b> words) whereas other dialects have non-identical doubling (with <b>two</b> distinct-looking <b>question</b> words). We argue that the variation basically follows from the copy theory of movement, in which both full and partial copying are allowed. If correct, the proposal has consequences for the nature and structure of pronouns. Question pronouns, we argue, spell out different phrasal projections that can be independently motivated. The advantages of our approach to alternative proposals are made explicit...|$|R

5000|$|Since the amended Random {{answers in}} a truly random manner, neither True nor False can predict whether Random would answer ja or da to the {{question}} of whether Dushanbe is in Kirghizia. Given this ignorance they will be unable to tell the truth or lie - they will therefore remain silent. Random, however, who spouts random nonsense, will have no problem spouting off either ja or da. Uzquiano (2010) exploits this asymmetry to provide a <b>two</b> <b>question</b> solution to the modified puzzle. Yet, one might assume that the gods have an [...] "oracular ability to predict Random's answers even before the coin flip in Random’s brain?" [...] In this case, a <b>two</b> <b>question</b> solution is still available by using self-referential questions of the style employed in Rabern and Rabern (2008).|$|R

25|$|<b>Two</b> <b>questions</b> {{were put}} to vote in 1926. First, the voters {{approved}} Union Station instead of elevated railways by 61.3 to 38.7 percent margin. Second, the electorate {{voted in favor of}} the Los Angeles Plaza as the site of the new station but by a much smaller 51.1 to 48.9 percent margin. Union Station would eventually be built {{across the street from the}} Plaza in Chinatown, largely due to the efforts of Preservationist Christine Sterling and Los Angeles Times Publisher Harry Chandler to preserve the Plaza neighborhood.|$|E

Following this, he received objections, {{and two of them}} he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self.|$|E

25|$|The matrix in the {{following}} table shows how Brasel and colleagues found that the teachers combined these four questions to learn about two dimensions of teaching: student thinking and instruction. The authors found that while the most productive collaborative discussions—that allowed the teachers {{to learn more about}} mathematics content, students and pedagogy—focused more on why and how, the teachers tended to address only the first <b>two</b> <b>questions,</b> what and to whom. While these conversations were helpful in identifying students in need of remediation, they did little in the way to improve instruction in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Because of KMT {{strategy}} of having people boycott the referendum, one major controversy, like in 2004 was {{the format of}} the polling, specifically as whether the referendum questions would be on the same or different ballots as the Presidency. While in 2004 the Central Electoral Commission allowed U shaped line in which people would first cast a ballot for President and then cast a separate ballot for each of the <b>two</b> <b>questions,</b> the Commission ordered voters to cast all votes at once on separate ballots. Voters who choose not to cast a referendum ballot simply declined to pick up the extra two ballots.|$|E
25|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to the 1973–79 version, {{featuring}} two full games, each with two new contestants. Each game is self-contained, with <b>two</b> <b>questions</b> per contestant; the winner advances to the Super Match. If the score is tied after two rounds, a sudden-death tiebreaker is played. Values for the Audience Match portion of the bonus game are $5,000, $3,000, and $2,000, with $1,000 awarded for not matching any of the top three answers. The contestant then selects a celebrity for the Head-to-Head Match, which multiplies the Audience Match winnings by five if successful, for a potential top prize of $25,000.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} round, the contestants {{attempted}} {{to match the}} celebrities whom they had not matched in the first round. On the CBS version, the challenger always began the second round (unless that contestant had matched all six stars; in this situation, the champion selected from the <b>two</b> <b>questions</b> available). This meant that a champion who had only answered one question could be ahead of a challenger who had played both questions, rendering the final question moot. On the syndicated versions, the leader after a round played first in the next round. In case of a tie score, the contestant who had not selected their own question in the previous round made the selection in the tie-breaker round.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} <b>two</b> <b>questions</b> about geographical names {{is whether a}} name should be written in one word, with hyphens, or in separate words, and which elements should be written uppercase and lowercase. Different written forms may refer to different entities, e.g. Sáros-patak lit. ‘muddy river’ refers to a river, but Sárospatak refers to a city (because rivers’ names are written with a hyphen, but city names are written as one word). This field {{is considered one of}} the most complex parts of Hungarian orthography, so a separate volume was published about it, and a separate board (Földrajzinév-bizottság) working in the Ministry of Agriculture is entitled to give statements. It consists of experts in linguistics, education, transportation, hidrology, natural protection, public administration, ethnic minorities, foreign relations, and other fields.|$|E
25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found <b>two</b> <b>questions</b> that females always scored higher on than their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E
