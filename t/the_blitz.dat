5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the raid, Hitler postponed Operation Sea Lion. Having been defeated in daylight, the Luftwaffe turned its attention to <b>The</b> <b>Blitz</b> night campaign which lasted until May 1941.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Blitz</b> was {{a period}} of {{sustained}} strategic bombing of the United Kingdom by Germany during the Second World War. Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, sixteen British cities were hit by major aerial raids. Beginning on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. Overall, more than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged during <b>the</b> <b>Blitz,</b> and more than 40,000 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} damaged {{several times during}} <b>the</b> <b>Blitz</b> in 1940. Part of the Great Hall's roof was destroyed, and a bomb landed between {{platforms}} 2 and 3, destroying offices {{and part of the}} hotel.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>blitzed</b> {{area was}} redeveloped, and Castle Park was also created.|$|R
50|$|Defensive {{coordinator}} Chuck Drulis {{is widely}} credited with inventing <b>the</b> safety <b>blitz.</b> Bill Arnsparger is the likely creator of <b>the</b> zone <b>blitz.</b>|$|R

5|$|Carlsen {{played in}} the Paris leg of the 2017 Grand Chess Tour, which was held from 21–25 June. He {{finished}} first in the rapid portion of the tournament with 14/18 (+5–0=4; two points for a win) and fifth in <b>the</b> <b>blitz</b> portion with 10/18 (+8–6=4) to place joint first overall with Vachier-Lagrave. Carlsen then defeated Vachier-Lagrave in the playoff to win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|During 1934 the cricket {{pavilion}} {{had been}} demolished {{to make way}} for the new North Stand, which was built on the rugby union ground, costing around £20,000. However, in 1941 the new North Stand and part of the west terracing had been badly damaged in <b>the</b> <b>Blitz</b> by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|From 26 to 30 December, Carlsen {{played in}} the World Rapid and Blitz Championships held in Doha, Qatar. He scored 11/15 in the rapid tournament, {{finishing}} third on tiebreak behind Ivanchuk and Grischuk. In <b>the</b> <b>blitz</b> tournament, he scored 16½/21, finishing second on tiebreak behind Karjakin, and 2 points clear {{of the rest of}} the field.|$|E
50|$|A hot {{route is}} a {{variation}} on the regular running route for a running back. It results usually from an audible called by a quarterback, and is based on a read of a <b>blitzing</b> defense. If <b>the</b> defense does not <b>blitz,</b> <b>the</b> running back runs the regular route. If <b>the</b> defense does <b>blitz,</b> <b>the</b> running back will, instead of blocking <b>the</b> <b>blitzing</b> defensive player, run a short route, such as a bubble screen, and catch the ball which the quarterback dumps off quickly.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} received {{slight damage}} during <b>the</b> Coventry <b>Blitz.</b> <b>The</b> interior was completely restored from 1980-1982.|$|R
5000|$|... 1943 - the {{decision}} was made to build the estate, as extensive plans for the rebuilding of <b>the</b> <b>blitzed</b> city and its decimated housing stock were being made.|$|R
5|$|St Mary le Strand was {{designed}} by James Gibbs and completed in 1717, to replace a previous church demolished {{to make way for}} Somerset House. It was the first building to be designed by Gibbs, who was influenced by Wren and Michelangelo. The column on top of the church was originally designed to support a statue of Queen Anne, but was replaced with a spire following Anne's death in 1714. It survived <b>the</b> <b>Blitz</b> but was in poor shape until John Betjeman led a campaign to restore it in the 1970s. Essex Street Chapel, the birthplace of British Unitarianism, abuts onto the Strand. The original chapel was built in 1774, but damaged in <b>the</b> <b>Blitz.</b> It was restored after the war, and now serves as the denominational headquarters of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Blitz</b> class avisos {{were the}} first step toward {{creating}} the modern, steel-hulled light cruiser, which would ultimately come to fruition in the , built a decade later. The Blitz-class ships were also the first steel-hulled ships of any type built by the German Navy. At the time of their completion, they were among the earliest torpedo cruisers in the world.|$|E
5|$|The tube station {{became one}} of the {{principal}} shelters during <b>the</b> <b>Blitz.</b> Following heavy raids on the East End on 7 September 1940, many sought refuge underground, and staff opened the gates to everyone at Liverpool Street without asking for tickets. Though technically illegal, it remained the most practical and safe shelter for local residents.|$|E
50|$|Known as {{the famous}} {{showcase}} of extraordinary talent, USGS hosts its annual {{day in a}} very prosperous and celebrative way, naming it <b>the</b> <b>Blitzing.</b> <b>The</b> proud USGSites display their talent in an innovative way, on the school's playground. This enhances the school's ability to produce entrepreneurs and all-rounders.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{injuries}} to Redskins offensive linemen Joe Jacoby and Russ Grimm, the Washington offensive line {{was able to}} pick up <b>the</b> Bears patented <b>blitzes.</b> Washington quarterback Jay Schroeder was sacked only twice. He was also able to use <b>the</b> <b>blitzes</b> to his advantage, completing passes while being chased out of the pocket.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> Hull <b>Blitz</b> <b>the</b> {{station was}} hit by bombs three times, with the station's stables set on fire on one occasion.|$|R
5|$|Through August and September 1940 the Luftwaffe met the Dowding {{system in}} the Battle of Britain, {{and in spite of}} great effort, failed to defeat Fighter Command. Tizard's letter of 1936 proved prophetic; with their loss during the day, the Luftwaffe moved to a night campaign. <b>The</b> <b>Blitz</b> began in earnest in September.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other London termini, Marylebone {{saw little}} direct damage during <b>the</b> <b>Blitz.</b> It was closed between 5 October and 26 November 1940 after the {{approach}} tunnels were breached, and the goods depot was bombed on 16 April 1941.|$|E
5|$|Airborne Interception radar, Mark IV, or AI Mk. IV for short, was the world's first {{operational}} air-to-air radar system. Early Mk. III units {{appeared in}} July 1940 on converted Bristol Blenheim light bombers, while the definitive Mk. IV reached widespread availability on the Bristol Beaufighter heavy fighter by early 1941. On the Beaufighter, the Mk. IV arguably {{played a role}} in ending <b>the</b> <b>Blitz,</b> the Luftwaffe's night bombing campaign of late 1940 and early 1941.|$|E
50|$|During <b>the</b> Hull <b>Blitz</b> <b>the</b> {{area was}} badly damaged by bombing, {{possibly}} {{due to its}} proximity to Reckitt & Sons' Dansom Lane works.|$|R
50|$|Sheffield’s Date With Hitler was {{published}} in 2010 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of <b>the</b> Sheffield <b>Blitz.</b> <b>The</b> book {{formed the basis of}} BBC1’s Sheffield <b>The</b> Forgotten <b>Blitz</b> documentary and followed over a year of research and attempts to explain why the city’s munitions works were largely missed by the Luftwaffe on December 12 and 15, 1940.|$|R
25|$|The night raids {{continued}} into the following Spring, during which period {{the city and its}} docks along the Mersey became the most heavily bombed area of Britain outside London. The campaign became known as <b>the</b> Liverpool <b>Blitz,</b> with particularly heavy attacks in December 1940 (<b>the</b> Christmas <b>Blitz)</b> when <b>the</b> regiment's ammunition expenditure rose to almost 3800 rounds per night; in April 1941; and again the following month (<b>the</b> May <b>Blitz).</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{only one}} bomb {{fell on the}} Tower of London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in the moat), the Second World War left a greater mark. On 23 September 1940, during <b>the</b> <b>Blitz,</b> high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, {{destroying}} several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public.|$|E
5|$|At the 74th Tata Steel Chess Tournament held on 14–29 January in Wijk aan Zee, Carlsen {{finished}} in a shared second place with 8/13, behind Aronian, and equal with Radjabov and Caruana. Carlsen defeated Gashimov, Aronian, Gelfand, and Topalov, but lost against Karjakin. At <b>the</b> <b>blitz</b> chess tournament at Tal Memorial, held in Moscow on 7 June, Carlsen shared first place with Morozevich. In {{the main event}} (a category 22 ten-player round robin), he won two games and drew seven. He {{finished in}} first place, ahead of Radjabov and Caruana.|$|E
5|$|Besides similar fonts, many {{signs and}} objects made in Britain {{during the period}} of Gill Sans' dominance, such as the famous Keep Calm and Carry On poster, {{received}} hand-painted or custom lettering similar to Gill Sans. Fighter Command during the war used a standard set of letters similar to it. Matthew Carter, later a prominent font designer, recalled in 2005 that when his mother cut linoleum block letters for him to play with during <b>the</b> <b>Blitz</b> they were based on it.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> London <b>Blitz,</b> <b>the</b> fire service was nationalised in 1941 by {{the powers of the}} Fire Services (Emergency Provisions) Bill.|$|R
50|$|Blitz {{was married}} to pianist Flora Briggs on January 24, 1921, and died in Dallas on July 17, 1951. <b>The</b> <b>Blitzes</b> had one child, Edouard Marquis <b>Blitz,</b> who became <b>the</b> {{assistant}} principal cellist of the Dallas Symphony.|$|R
50|$|A bomb hit {{the church}} in September 1940 during <b>the</b> London <b>Blitz.</b> <b>The</b> {{greatest}} damage was to the dome. W. Godfrey Allen repaired the church between 1948-1953.|$|R
5|$|Carlsen {{obtained}} {{his second}} GM norm at the Moscow Aeroflot Open in February. On 17 March, in a blitz chess tournament in Reykjavík, Iceland, Carlsen defeated former World Champion Anatoly Karpov. <b>The</b> <b>blitz</b> tournament was a preliminary event {{leading up to}} a rapid knockout tournament beginning the next day. In that event, Carlsen was paired with Garry Kasparov, then the top-rated player in the world. Carlsen achieved a draw in their first game but lost the second, and was thus knocked out of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Murray evaded <b>the</b> <b>Blitz</b> of London {{by moving}} to Cambridge, where she volunteered {{for a group}} (probably the Army Bureau of Current Affairs or The British Way and Purpose) who educated {{military}} personnel {{to prepare them for}} post-war life. Based in the city, she embarked on research into the town's Early Modern history, examining documents stored in local parish churches, Downing College, and Ely Cathedral; she never published her findings.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the launch}} of Halo Wars 2, a demo, {{featuring}} the campaign's opening mission and <b>the</b> <b>Blitz</b> Firefight mode, was released on the Xbox One and Windows. 343 Industries and Creative Assembly supported Halo Wars 2 post-release with additional content and updates. A multiplayer ranking system was withheld from the game at launch as the development team wanted to ensure that gameplay was as balanced as possible before its release. The post-release DLC included a campaign expansion, new units, new leaders, and new cards for <b>the</b> <b>Blitz</b> mode. The content was distributed {{on a monthly basis}} beginning in March 2017. On June 12, 2017, a campaign expansion titled Awakening the Nightmare was revealed. Players take control of the Banished as they come into conflict with parasitic alien life forms collectively known as the Flood. The expansion features new leaders, maps, and a new cooperative mode. It was released on September 26, 2017. In late October 2017, Halo Wars 2 received a number of visual enhancements for the Xbox One X. Additionally, cross-platform play between console and PC was enabled.|$|E
50|$|The livery {{hall of the}} Broderers, Broderers' Hall, {{stood on}} Gutter Lane from 1515 until its {{destruction}} in <b>the</b> London <b>blitz.</b> <b>The</b> Broderers now dine in Mercers' Hall.|$|R

25|$|During <b>the</b> Bath <b>Blitz</b> of 25/26 April 1942, one of <b>the</b> Baedeker <b>Blitz</b> retaliatory {{raids on}} England {{following}} the RAF's raid on Lübeck, a bomb {{fell into the}} Circus, demolishing several of the houses. These have since been reconstructed in the original style.|$|R
