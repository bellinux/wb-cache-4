50|$|The <b>Thynnidae</b> (also {{known as}} flower wasps) are {{a family of}} large solitary wasps whose larvae are almost universally parasitoids of various beetle larvae, {{especially}} those in the superfamily Scarabaeoidea. Until recently, the constituents of this family were classified in the family Tiphiidae, but multiple studies have independently confirmed that thynnids are a separate lineage..|$|E
50|$|The Tiphiidae (also {{known as}} the tiphiid wasps) are a family of large solitary wasps whose larvae are parasitoids of various beetle larvae, {{especially}} those in the superfamily Scarabaeoidea. Until recently, this family contained several additional subfamilies, but multiple studies have independently confirmed that these comprise a separate lineage, and are now classified in the family <b>Thynnidae.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{labellum}} of elbow orchids mimics wingless female thynnid wasps of the Superfamily Vespoidea, Family <b>Thynnidae.</b> In {{its attempt}} to fly off with the dummy female, the insect is thrust head-first against the column where the hooked wings hold the insect in place {{long enough for the}} pollinia to stick to its back. If it is carrying pollinia from another flower, the pollinia are crushed against the stigma. For three species of elbow orchid, a single species of wasp from the genus Arthrothynnus has been identified. In the case of some tropical species, the wasps struggle so violently with the labellum that the organ is often torn off. Some other orchids similarly employ thynnid wasps as pollinators but only Arthrochilus flowers have restraining hooks on the labellum.|$|E
50|$|Many orchid {{species have}} structures, or produce scents that mimic female insects and are {{attractive}} to males. Hammer orchids are {{unique in that}} they are pollinated by a species of male thynnid wasp (Superfamily Vespoidea, Family <b>Thynnidae).</b> Thynnid wasps are unique in that the females are flightless. When male wasps emerge from the ground, they search for females. When the flightless female wasps emerge, they climb a blade of grass, rub their legs together, release a pheromone and wait for males. When a male detects the pheromone, it flies in a zig-zag pattern upwind until the female is located. The male grasps the female and flies away with her to a food source. Copulation occurs in flight and the male feeds his mate through his abdomen. She is then left to return to the ground, lay her eggs in beetle larvae and die.|$|E
50|$|The {{exoskeleton}} of all velvet ants {{is unusually}} tough (to {{the point that}} some entomologists have reported difficulty piercing them with steel pins when attempting to mount them for display in cabinets). This characteristic allows them to successfully invade the nests of their prey and also helps them retain moisture. Mutillids exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism. Like some related families in the Vespoidea, males have wings, but females are wingless. The males and females are distinct enough in their morphology, that it is often very hard {{to determine whether a}} given male and female belong to the same species, unless they are captured while mating. In some species, the male carries the smaller female aloft while mating, which is also seen in the related family <b>Thynnidae.</b> As is the case for all Aculeates, only female mutillids are capable of inflicting a sting. The stinger is a modified female organ called an ovipositor; which is unusually long and maneuverable in mutillids. In both sexes, a structure called a stridulitrum on the metasoma is used to produce a squeaking or chirping sound when alarmed. Both sexes of mutillids also bear hair-lined grooves {{on the side of the}} metasoma called felt lines. Only two other vespoid families, (Bradynobaenidae and Chyphotidae) have felt lines, but the females of these families have a distinctive pronotum. Members of the family Myrmosidae, formerly classified as a subfamily of mutillids, also have a distinctive pronotum in females, but lack felt lines in both sexes.|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} {{abundance}} {{and diversity of}} Hymenoptera was conducted in Hutan Simpan UiTM Jengka Kem Sri Gading to determine the relationship of diversity of Hymenoptera with the environmental gradient. The samplings were conducted from November 2013 to April 2014 using Malaise traps. Three malaise traps were installed at the forest fringe and another tree were placed at the inner forest. A total of 286 Hymenopteran comprising of 15 subfamilies and 63 species (morphospecies) were collected. The families identified were Icheneumonidae, Sphecidae, Braconidae, Formicidae, Vespidae, Pompilidae, Apidae, Tiphiidae, Bethylidae, Ampolicidae, <b>Thynnidae,</b> Evaniidae, Gasteruptiidae, Pelecinidae and Rhopalosomatidae. Overall result showed that Ichneumonidae was the most abundant family with 56 individuals while family Gasteruptiidae was the least abundant family with only one individual recorded. Inner forest had the most individual collected with 191 individuals that comprise of 12 families and 48 morphospecies. On the other hand, forest fringe recorded only 95 individuals (11 families and 28 morphospecies). Shannon Weiner Diversity Index (H’) showed that each studied plots did not differs significantly (P> 0. 05) with inner forest having the highest diversity value for Hymenoptera with H’= 2. 13 while forest fringe recorded H’= 2. 09. Evenness index for both study sites recorded the same value of E’= 0. 88. For the Margalef index, inner forest recorded R’= 2. 09 slight lower than forest fringe with R’= 2. 19. As a conclusion, {{this study suggests that}} diversity and abundance of Hymenoptera was higher at inner forest compared to forest fringe. Overall study showed that the diversity and abundance of Hymenoptera in both study sites were low since the value of H’ were less than 3. 50...|$|E
