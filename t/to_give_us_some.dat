500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly laudatory {{reviews from}} television critics, particularly for its unusual {{departure from the}} standard Mad Men episode structure and {{is considered to be}} one of the best in the series. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix exalted the episode and the [...] "more formally experimental" [...] season, admitting, [...] "I'm still not sure I understood 100% of it. But I know I liked it. A lot." [...] Sepinwall characterized [...] "Far Away Places" [...] as [...] "an episode that gave the feel of dropping acid even when everyone on camera was stone sober. Matt Weiner, co-writer Semi Chellas, director Scott Hornbacher, and the actors combined <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> of the most memorable moments the show has ever done." [...] Todd VanderWerff of The A.V. Club gave it an A grade, compared it to previous [...] "structurally daring" [...] episodes like [...] "Seven Twenty Three" [...] and [...] "The Jet Set", and praised the director for the [...] "beautifully shot" [...] episode and the [...] "gorgeous image of [...] and Jane lying, heads touching, on the floor, admitting their marriage just isn’t working", while noting that the enemy of the season is [...] "the passage of time itself".|$|E
2500|$|Notwithstanding {{the changes}} brought {{about in the}} course of time, Vespers still remains the great and {{important}} Office of the evening. As already pointed out, it recalls the sacrificium vespertinum of the Old Law. In the same manner as the night is consecrated to God by the Office of the Vigil, so also {{is the end of the}} day by Vespers. It terminates, as Matins formerly terminated, and Lauds at present terminates, by a lection, or reading, from the Gospel, or canticum evangelii, which, for Vespers, is always the [...] "Magnificat". This is one of the characteristic traits of Vespers, one of the liturgical elements which this particular Office has retained in almost all regions and at all times. There are, however, a few exceptions, as in some liturgies the [...] "Magnificat" [...] is sung at Lauds (cf. Cabrol in [...] "Dict. d'arch. et de liturgie", s.v. Cantiques évangéliques). This place of honour accorded so persistently to the canticle of Mary from such remote antiquity is but one of the many, and of the least striking, proofs of the devotion which has always been paid to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Church. The psalms used at Vespers have been selected, from time immemorial, from Pss. cix to cxlvii, with the exception of Ps. cxviii, which on account of its unusual length does not square with the others, and is consequently ordinarily divided up into parts and recited at the little hours. Pss. i to cviii are consecrated to Matins and Lauds, whilst the three last psalms, cxlviii to cl, belong invariably to Lauds. The series of hymns consecrated to Vespers in the Roman Breviary also form a class apart and help <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> hints as to the symbolism of this hour. The hymns are very ancient, dating probably, for the most part, from the 6th century. They have this particular characteristic—they are all devoted to the praise of one of the days of the Creation, according to the day of the week, thus: the first, [...] "Lucis Creator optime", on Sunday, to the creation of light; the second, on Monday, to the separation of the earth and the waters; the third, on Tuesday, to the creation of the plants; the fourth, on Wednesday, to the creation of the sun and moon; the fifth, on Thursday, to the creation of the fish; the sixth, on Friday, to the creation of the beasts of the earth; Saturday is an exception, the hymn on that day being in honour of the Blessed Trinity, because of the Office of Sunday then commencing.|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{quantitative}} research <b>to</b> date <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>some</b> {{indication of the}} prevalence at which knife-carrying occurs among young British men, {{there have been few}} explanations for why it occurs, and for what the relationship might be between broader social issues of control and power and the behaviours of young men themselves. Drawing on interviews with 16 young white British men, the present paper explores {{the ways in which the}} sample accounted for knife-carrying. Two interpretative repertoires were identified: (1) attributions of blame to authorities for a lack of protection and a subsequent justification of knife-carrying, and (2) discussions of masculinity in relation to knife-carrying. The findings suggest that what is required are policy and practice responses that take into account the symbolic functions of knives for young white men, and which recognise the dilemmatic bind that such men are caught in when they attempt to negotiate competing demands of protection and control...|$|R

40|$|The Malaysian poet Ee Tiang Hong {{was troubled}} by the {{fundamental}} changes being introduced by the leaders to ensure that Malaysia (which Ee always referred to as Malaya) became centrally a Malay nation.

While this struggle was in process, the tragedy of May 13 (1969) struck: here was a blatant illustration {{of the extent to which}} greed and power could bring people into conflict, with the dominant ethnic group claiming victory over misplaced emphasis of national values. Unable to accept the new order, Ee migrated to Australia in 1975, forever lamenting the breach which thus occurred. Throughout his poetry are powerful reminders of what happens when a sensitive poetic mind is traumatised by prejudice writ large.
