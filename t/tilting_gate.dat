5000|$|The Colt-Burgess rifle {{is similar}} in design to Winchester's lever-action rifles, such as the Winchester Model 1873. It was {{produced}} in two versions chambered for the [...]44-40 Winchester cartridge: a rifle version with a 25+1/2 in barrel, and a carbine with a 20 in barrel. [...] The rifle features either a full octagon, half-octagon, or round barrel, with the full octagon barrels being the most numerously produced among rifle variants. [...] A tubular magazine is located under the barrel in similar fashion to other lever-action rifles with a capacity of 15 rounds in the rifle version or 12 rounds in the carbine version. The receiver on the Burgess rifle is smaller than the Winchester 1873's, providing for a lighter firearm. The rifle's action, though similar to the Winchester 1873's, {{is considered to be}} a stronger design. The action utilizes a toggle-joint system to lock the breechblock. The extension of the loading lever is the lower part of the toggle-joint; the upper part of the toggle-joint is linked to the breechblock. Located on the receiver is a sliding loading gate from which cartridges are fed into the magazine; the sliding gate design is in contrast to Winchester's <b>tilting</b> <b>gate.</b> Burgess rifles are finished with either a blued or browned barrel featuring walnut stock and case hardened receiver, hammer, and lever.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} WG (Working Group) was {{to conduct}} a {{comprehensive}} review (state-of-the-art) of the modern technologies, design tools and recent research used to design and build structures controlling water level and flow in rivers, waterways and ports (for navigation & flood protection). The WG considered regulatory structures such as: -	Gates controlling water level and flow in rivers (even non navigable) and waterways (lifting gate, <b>tilting</b> <b>gate,</b> radial gate, sector, etc.; designed in one piece or with an upper flap). These {{are referred to as}} WEIRS. -	Gates controlling water level and flow in estuaries with regards to high tides and storms (lifting gate, articulated, tilting, rolling, floating, sliding, etc.). These structures are referred to as BARRIERS. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{reversible}} two- and three-input logic gates, among which we mention the universal Toffoli gate, {{can be implemented}} with three <b>tilted</b> <b>gating</b> electrodes patterned on a monolayer graphene flake. These low-dissipation gates {{are based on the}} unique properties of ballistic charge carriers in graphene, which induce the appearance of bandgaps in transmission for properly potential barriers. The enhanced architectures for reversible logic gate implementations proposed in this paper offer a remarkable design simplification in comparison to standard approaches based on field-effect transistor circuits and a potential high-frequency operation...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} theory for {{understanding}} the exchange interaction between electron spins in neighboring quantum dots, either by changing the detuning of the two quantum dots or independently tuning the tunneling barrier between quantum dots. The Hubbard model and a more realistic confining-potential model are used to investigate how the tilting and barrier control affect the effective exchange coupling and thus the gate fidelity in both the detuning and symmetric regimes. We show that the exchange coupling is less sensitive to the charge noise through tunnel barrier control (while allowing for exchange coupling operations on a sweet spot where the exchange interaction has zero derivative {{with respect to the}} detuning). Both GaAs and Si quantum dots are considered and we compare our results with experimental data showing qualitative agreements. Our results answer the open question of why barrier gates are preferable to <b>tilt</b> <b>gates</b> for exchange-base gate operations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work {{describes}} a new fabrication process for SiC Static Induction Transistors. Only 5 lithography steps are used, {{due to the}} self-aligned process for mesa formation, ohmic contacts and gates. The processing parts thoroughly examined are the Inductively Coupled Plasma etching and the tilted Reactive Ion Beam Etching. The ICP etch mask for the mesa is also used as source contacts. The mesa fingers then works as a shadow mask in a <b>tilted</b> etching <b>gate</b> process with RIBE, protecting the trenches and walls. Since the process is scalable, the use of electron beam lithography can make the dimensions and performance better. With optical lithography, mesa widths of 2, 3, 4 and 5 µm are processed.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} mechanosensitive channel MscL is the best-studied mechanosensor, thus {{serving as}} a paradigm of how a protein senses and responds to mechanical force. Models for the transition of Escherichia coli MscL from closed to open states propose a tilting of the transmembrane domains in {{the plane of the}} membrane, suggesting dynamic protein-lipid interactions. Here, we used a rapid in vivo assay to assess the function of channels that were post-translationally modified at several different sites in a region just distal to the cytoplasmic end of the second transmembrane helix. We utilized multiple probes with various affinities for the membrane environment. The in vivo functional data, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, single-channel analyses, and tryptophan fluorescence measurements, confirmed that lipid interactions within this region are critical for MscL gating. The data suggest a model in which this region acts as an anchor for the transmembrane domain <b>tilting</b> during <b>gating.</b> Furthermore, the conservation of analogous motifs among many other channels suggests a conserved protein-lipid dynamic mechanism. —Iscla, I., Wray, R., Blount, P.

50|$|The drain was {{upgraded}} in 1972, {{as part of}} a £1.4 million {{scheme to}} construct a flood relief channel for the River Parrett. The 7.5 mi embanked channel, called the Sowy River, runs from Monks Leaze Clyse below Langport to the King's Sedgemoor Drain near Westonzoyland Airfield. Improvements to the drain included the relocation and rebuilding of the clyse at Dunball, to create a fresh water seal which prevents salt water from entering the drain where it joins the River Parrett. A further scheme for improvements to the Greylake Sluice was completed at a cost of £2.95 million in 2006, and resulted in the engineering contractor winning the 2006 Environment Agency Project Excellence Awards, for the health and safety and environmental risk aspects of the project. The main features of the new design were two <b>tilting</b> sluice <b>gates,</b> each 13 by 10 ft contained in a structure which was only half as high as the previous structure, which allow water level management to be controlled in a more flexible manner.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{variation}} of electron transmission through Au-S-benzene-S-Au junctions and related systems {{as a function}} of the structure of the Au:S contacts. For junctions with semi-infinite flat Au(111) electrodes, the highly coordinated in-hollow and bridge positions are connected with broad transmission peaks around the Fermi level, due to a broad range of transmission angles from transverse motion, resulting in high conductivity and weak dependence on geometrical variations. In contrast, for (unstable) S adsorption on-top of an Au atom, or in the hollow of a 3 -Au-atom island, the transmission peaks narrow up due to suppression of large transmission angles. Such more one-dimensional situations may describe more common types of contacts and junctions, resulting in large variations in conductivity and sensitivity to bonding sites, <b>tilting,</b> and <b>gating.</b> In particular, if S is adsorbed in an Au vacancy, sharp spectral features appear near the Fermi level due to essential changes of the level structure and hybridization in the contacts, admitting order-of-magnitude variations of the conductivity. Possibly such a system, can it be fabricated, will show extremely strong nonlinear effects and might work as uni- or bi-directional voltage-controlled two-terminal switches and nonlinear mixing elements. Finally, density-functional theory based transport calculations seem relevant, being capable of describing a wide range of transmission peak structures and conductivities. Prediction and interpretation of experimental results probably require more precise modeling of realistic experimental situations...|$|R
40|$|Despite much {{interest}} in engineering new topological surface (edge) states using structural defects, such topological surface states have not been observed yet. We show that recently imaged <b>tilt</b> boundaries in <b>gated</b> multilayer graphene should support topologically protected gapless edge states. We approach the problem from two perspectives: the microscopic perspective of a tight-binding model and an ab initio calculation on a bilayer, and the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state perspective for a general multilayer. Hence, we establish the tilt-boundary edge states as the first concrete example of the edge states of symmetry-protected Z-type SPT, protected by no-valley mixing, electron-number conservation, and time-reversal T symmetries. Further, we discuss possible phase transitions between distinct SPTs upon symmetry changes. Combined with a recently imaged tilt-boundary network, our findings may explain the long-standing puzzle of subgap conductance in gated bilayer graphene. This proposal can be tested through future transport experiments on tilt boundaries. In particular, the tilt boundaries offer {{an opportunity for the}} in situ imaging of topological edge transport...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{significant}} {{progress has been}} achieved in developing sensory augmentation methods to improve standing balance, attempts to extend this research to locomotion have been quite limited in scope. The goal {{of this study was}} to characterize the effects of two real-time feedback displays on locomotor performance during four gait-based tasks ranging in difficulty. Methods Seven subjects with vestibular deficits used a trunk-based vibrotactile feedback system that provided real-time feedback regarding their medial-lateral (M/L) trunk tilt when they exceeded a subject-specific predefined tilt threshold during slow and self-paced walking, walking along a narrow walkway, and walking on a foam surface. Two feedback display configurations were evaluated: the continuous display provided real-time continuous feedback of trunk <b>tilt,</b> and the <b>gated</b> display provided feedback for 200 ms during the period immediately following heel strike. The root-mean-square (RMS) trunk tilt and percentage of time below the tilt thresholds were calculated for all locomotor tasks. Results Use of continuous feedback resulted in significant decreases in M/L trunk tilt and increases in percentage times below the tilt thresholds during narrow and foam trials. The gated display produced generally smaller changes. Conclusions This preliminary study demonstrated that use of continuous vibrotactile feedback during challenging locomotor tasks allowed subjects with vestibular deficits to significantly decrease M/L RMS trunk tilt.

40|$|The {{search for}} new {{realization}} of topologically protected edge states is an active area of research. We show that a <b>tilt</b> boundary in <b>gated</b> multi-layer graphene supports topologically protected gapless kink states, associated with quantum valley Hall insulator (QVH). We investigate such kink states from two perspectives: the microscopic perspective of a tight-binding model and an ab-initio calculation on bilayer, and the perspective of symmetry protected topological (SPT) states for general multi-layer. We show that a AB-BA bilayer tilt boundary supports gapless kink states that are undeterred by strain concentrated at the boundary. Further, we establish the kink states as concrete examples of edge states of time-reversal symmetric Z-type SPT, protected by no valley mixing, electron number conservation, and time reversal T symmetries. This allows us to discuss possible phase transitions upon symmetry changes from the SPT perspective. Recent experimental observations {{of a network of}} such tilt boundaries suggest that transport through these novel topological kink states might explain the long standing puzzle of sub-gap conductance. Further, recent observation of gap closing and re-opening in gated bi-layer might be the first example of a transition between two distinct SPT's: QVH and LAF. Comment: Improved a discussion of the structural aspects of the tilt boundary. Included a discussion of boundary condition dependence. Added new section on connection to experiment...|$|R

30|$|Effective proton {{transfer}} {{across the}} membrane {{does not necessarily}} translate into efficient energy usage. For example, slippage in energy coupling might result in futile energy dissipation in theoretical models (Hill 1989). Thus, for an effective AcrB-like transporter, a mechanism of transducing the PMF energy into mechanical rearrangements in the porter layer likely exists. Similar {{to the case of}} PMF-driven MSF transporters (Zhang et al. 2015), the protonation at D 407 –D 408 pair is likely to exert an extra inward force to the NTM-subdomain relative to the abovementioned reference state, causing a movement of the NTM-subdomain towards the cytosolic direction. The strength of the electrostatic force is of an order of 5 pN, if the electrostatic field of the membrane potential is uniformly distributed across the 30 -Å thickness of the membrane (Zhang et al. 2015). A force of such a magnitude is sufficiently large to conduct many molecular biology events, such as moving of a motor protein along microtubules, separating of a dsDNA helix, or packaging a DNA molecule into a phage shell (Schnitzer et al. 2000; Cocco et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2014). Furthermore, embedding a proton-transfer wire into the membrane is equivalent to applying a focused membrane potential across the membrane, and thus the effective membrane thickness is reduced. Therefore, the extra electrostatic force upon protonation may be significantly larger than 5 pN. This extra electrostatic force may further be transduced from the TM domain to the porter domain via routes additional to the signaling motif, e.g., the structural connection between TM 2 and PN 2. Consequently, the corresponding subdomains in the porter domain are likely to move also in an inward direction. Such a movement will result in further conformational rearrangement necessary for the B-E transition, including a <b>tilting</b> of the <b>gate</b> helix in PN 1 to block the exit cleft of the neighboring porter domain (Seeger et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{interactions between}} haemodynamic and autonomic neural oscillations during passive upright tilt, to gain better insight into human autonomic regulatory mechanisms. We recorded the electrocardiogram, finger photoplethysmographic arterial pressure, respiration and peroneal nerve muscle sympathetic activity in nine healthy young adults. Subjects breathed {{in time with}} a metronome at 12 breaths min− 1 (0. 2 Hz) for 5 min each, in supine, and 20, 40, 60, 70 and 80 deg head-up positions. We performed fast Fourier transform (and autoregressive) power spectral analyses and integrated low-frequency (0. 05 - 0. 15 Hz) and respiratory-frequency (0. 15 - 0. 5 Hz) spectral powers. Integrated areas of muscle sympathetic bursts and their low- and respiratory-frequency spectral powers increased directly and significantly with the tilt angle. The centre frequency of low-frequency sympathetic oscillations was constant before and during tilt. Sympathetic bursts occurred more commonly during expiration than inspiration at low tilt angles, but occurred equally in expiration and inspiration at high tilt angles. Systolic and diastolic pressures and their low- and respiratory-frequency spectral powers increased, and R-R intervals and their respiratory-frequency spectral power decreased progressively with the tilt angle. Low-frequency R-R interval spectral power did not change. The cross-spectral phase angle between systolic pressures and R-R intervals remained constant and consistently negative at the low frequency, but shifted progressively from positive to negative at the respiratory frequency during tilt. The arterial baroreflex modulus, calculated from low-frequency cross-spectra, decreased at high tilt angles. Our results document changes of baroreflex responses during upright tilt, which may reflect leftward movement of subjects on their arterial pressure sympathetic and vagal response relations. The intensity, but not the centre frequency of low-frequency cardiovascular rhythms, is modulated by the level of arterial baroreceptor input. <b>Tilt</b> reduces respiratory <b>gating</b> of sympathetic and vagal motoneurone responsiveness to stimulatory inputs for different reasons; during tilt, sympathetic stimulation increases to a level that overwhelms the respiratory gate, and vagal stimulation decreases to a level below that necessary for maximal respiratory gating to occur...|$|R
