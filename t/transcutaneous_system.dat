40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Accurate and {{reliable}} measurement of gas exchange during exercise has traditionally involved arterial cannulation. Non-invasive devices to estimate arterial oxygen (O 2) {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) tensions are now available. A method has been devised and evaluated for measuring gas exchange during exercise with a combined transcutaneous O 2 and CO 2 electrode. METHODS [...] Symptom limited exercise tests were carried out in 24 patients reporting effort intolerance and breathlessness. Exercise testing was performed by bicycle ergometry with a specifically designed protocol involving gradual two minute workload increments. Arterial O 2 and CO 2 tensions were measured at rest and during exercise by direct blood sampling from an indwelling arterial cannula and a combined transcutaneous electrode heated to 45 degrees C. The <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>system</b> was calibrated against values obtained by direct arterial sampling before each test. RESULTS [...] In all tests the trend of gas exchange measured by the <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>system</b> was true to the trend measured from direct arterial sampling. In the 140 measurements the mean difference between the O 2 tensions estimated by direct sampling and the transcutaneous method was 0. 08 kPa (0. 62 mm Hg, limits of agreement 4. 42 and - 3. 38 mm Hg). The mean difference between the methods for CO 2 was 0. 02 kPa (0. 22 mm Hg, limits of agreement 2. 20 and - 1. 70 mm Hg). There was no morbidity {{associated with the use}} of the transcutaneous electrode heated to 45 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS [...] A combined transcutaneous O 2 and CO 2 electrode heated to 45 degrees C can be used to provide a reliable estimate of gas exchange during gradual incremental exercise in adults...|$|E
40|$|Tamoxifen is the {{hormonal}} {{treatment of}} choice in women who have hormone-dependent breast cancer and its efficacy in those women considered {{to have a high}} risk of developing breast cancer, has also been established. Gamma linolenic acid (GLA) has been shown to decrease the invasion of breast cancer and recent studies have demonstrated that GLA can enhance the oestrogen receptor down-regulation induced by tamoxifen. However, tamoxifen is associated with serious side-effects due mainly to systemic delivery, and targeted delivery of both tamoxifen and GLA would be highly beneficial. This work was a preliminary study {{for the development of a}} <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>system</b> to simultaneously deliver both tamoxifen and GLA directly to the breast. Full thickness human skin was dosed with 500 microl saturated solution of tamoxifen in borage oil (25 % GLA) and the simultaneous permeation of the two actives determined. There was rapid flux with minimal lag time, the cumulative permeation at 24 h was 764. 3 +/- 94. 2 microg cm(- 2) for GLA and 5. 44 +/- 0. 67 microg cm(- 2) for tamoxifen: the latter being comparable to the amount of tamoxifen associated with cancerous breast tissue from a 20 mg oral dose. The ratio of GLA/tamoxifen permeated at different timepoints was quite consistent, both in terms of mass (mean 138, S. D. 15. 1) and mols (mean 184, S. D. 20. 3). It was determined that 2. 5 molecules of GLA were associated with each molecule of tamoxifen in the permeation process, equating to a solvation cage of three molecules of triacylglycerol. This study has demonstrated the feasibility of administering simultaneously tamoxifen and GLA using borage oil as vehicle, which warrants further investigation as a novel topical two-component system in relation to or prophylaxis of those perceived at high risk of developing breast cancer. The study also provides further evidence of the permeation of solvated complexes across skin, rather than discrete penetrant molecules...|$|E
40|$|Wireless energy {{transfer}} {{is a broad}} research area that has recently become applicable to implantable medical devices. Wireless powering of and communication with implanted devices is possible through wireless transcutaneous {{energy transfer}}. However, designing wireless <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>systems</b> is complicated due to the variability of the environment. The focus of this review is on strategies to sense and adapt to environmental variations in wireless <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>systems.</b> Adaptive systems provide the ability to maintain performance {{in the face of}} both unpredictability (variation from expected parameters) and variability (changes over time). Current strategies in adaptive (or tunable) systems include sensing relevant metrics to evaluate the function of the system in its environment and adjusting control parameters according to sensed values through the use of tunable components. Some challenges of applying adaptive designs to implantable devices are challenges common to all implantable devices, including size and power reduction on the implant, efficiency of power transfer and safety related to energy absorption in tissue. Challenges specifically associated with adaptation include choosing relevant and accessible parameters to sense and adjust, minimizing the tuning time and complexity of control, utilizing feedback from the implanted device and coordinating adaptation at the transmitter and receiver...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of a}} novel kind of immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs) on human skin penetration of model compounds in vitro to evaluate their potential as a delivery <b>system,</b> ultimately for <b>transcutaneous</b> vaccination. Special focus was on elucidating the mechanisms of penetration. Preparation of ISCOMs was done by dialysis and subsequent purification in a sucrose density gradient. The penetration pathways of acridine-labeled ISCOMs were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate the ultrastructural changes in the skin after application of the ISCOMs with or without hydration. Transcutaneous permeation of the model compound, methyl nicotinate, was evaluated in diffusion cells. The prepared ISCOMs were 42 – 52  nm in diameter as evaluated by dynamic light scattering with zeta potentials of − 33 to − 26. 1  mV. TEM investigations verified the presence of ISCOM structures. Penetration of acridine into skin was greatly increased by incorporation into ISCOMs as visualized by CLSM. Permeation of methyl nicotinate was enhanced in the presence of ISCOMs. Ultrastructural changes of the intercellular space in the stratum corneum after exposure of ISCOMs were observed on micrographs, especially for hydrated skin. In conclusion, cutaneous application of ISCOMs leads to increased penetration of hydrophobic model compounds through human stratum corneum and thus shows potential as a <b>transcutaneous</b> delivery <b>system.</b> The increased penetration seems to be reflected by a change in the intercellular space between the corneocytes, and the effect is most likely caused by the components of the ISCOMs rather than intact ISCOMs...|$|R

The wireless multiband link for IMDs achieves power transmission via a pair of coils designed for maximum coupling efficiency. The data link is able to handle large communication bandwidth with minimum interference from the power-carrier thanks to its optimized geometry. Wireless data and power links have promising prospects for use in biomedical devices such as biosensors, neural recording, and neural stimulation devices. The EnerCage system includes a stationary unit with an array of coils for inductive power transmission and three-dimensional magnetic sensors for non-line-of-sight tracking of animal subjects. It aims to energize novel biological data-acquisition and stimulation instruments for long-term experiments, without interruption, on freely behaving small animal subjects in large experimental arenas. The EnerCage system has been tested in one-hour in vivo experiment for wireless power and data communication, and the results show the feasibility of this system.

The device was powered either pneumatically (n = 1) or with a <b>transcutaneous</b> energy transmission <b>system</b> (n = 3). Hemodynamic evaluation (cardiac output and right and left ventricular and pulmonary and carotid artery pressures) was carried out at baseline and during all hemodynamically stressed states. Atrial pacing and ventricular pacing to a heart rate of 140 beats/min resulted in no significant change in right or left heart filling pressures or cardiac output. Preload reduction with nitro-prusside or transient inferior vena cava balloon occlusion resulted in a marked decrease in left ventricular pressure with preservation of mean arterial pressure. Phenylephrine administration resulted in a marked rise in mean arterial pressure with no change in cardiac output or filling pressure. Induction of ventricular fibrillation resulted in a decrease of mean left ventricular pressure to 11 ± 8 mm Hg, but mean arterial pressure was maintained at ≥ 50 mm Hg.

A more dishomogeneous echo structure of the plaque is also more often associated with clinically complicated carotid plaques. To date, however, the assessment of plaque density and homogeneity by transcutaneous B-mode imaging remains subjective and qualitative. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether plaque echodensity and homogeneity might be established on a more objective and quantitative basis by description of the spatial distribution of echo amplitude (referred to as tissue texture) applied to digitized images, obtained with commercially available B-mode <b>transcutaneous</b> imaging <b>systems.</b> A total of 47 B-mode images derived from echotomographic studies in 10 patients were digitized off line. For each region of interest, a set of first-order (mean gray level, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis: mathematical descriptors of the shape of the frequency distribution of gray-level histogram) and of second-order (entropy, angular moment: mathematical descriptors of the spatial distribution of gray levels within the region of interest) textural parameters were evaluated. The visual, concordant reading by two independent, experienced observers assigned the plaques on the basis of qualitatively assessed echodensity to three groups: ''soft'' (n = 18), ''fibrotic'' (n = 20), ''calcific'' (n = 9). Regarding spatial gray-level distribution, 46 plaques would be separated into ''homogeneous'' (n = 17) and ''dishomogeneous'' (n = 29). On digitized images, the normalized mean gray level was the most effective first-order textural parameter for distinguishing soft (24. 2 +/- 12. 4 arbitrary units in a zero to 255 scale) from fibrotic (64. 5 +/- 16. 4) and calcific plaques (125. 3 +/- 24. 5), P < 0. 01 for all intergroup differences. ''Homogeneous'' plaques were separated from ''heterogeneous'' ones on the basis of entropy (5 +/- 1 vs 7. 9 +/- 9. 7; P < 0. 01), whereas the values of angular second moment overlapped (1. 542 E- 3 + 1. 334 E- 3 vs 5. 181 E- 4 +/- 2. 5615 E- 4, P = ns).

Beginning in the 1970 s, there has been a continuous rise in the debt acquired from chiropractic school, from an average of $ 25, 000 to an average of $ 143, 750 in the 2000 s. The average amount of money that the sample needed to begin their private practice was $ 135, 000. To cover their monthly expenses, the sample needed to earn an average of $ 4, 200. The sample overwhelmingly agreed that the three most important attributes to a private practice chiropractor's success were receptionists/office managers, billing and collection specialists, and massage therapists. The sample also felt that for a new chiropractor to succeed, he or she must purchase a chiropractic table, diagnostic instruments, an x-ray <b>system,</b> <b>transcutaneous</b> electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit, ultrasound unit, and a heat/cold therapy unit. The most successful advertisement mediums for recruiting new patients were patients' referrals and general word-of-mouth information. The overwhelming majority of the sample accepted some form of managed healthcare plan. On average, the sample was able to establish a self-sustaining private practice in three years. These findings will enable a new private practice chiropractor to make sound financial decisions...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common female {{malignancy}} in the western world. Currently, tamoxifen remains the gold standard anti-hormone for ER+ breast cancer. However de novo resistance to tamoxifen is a huge clinical problem. What is more, as many as 50 % of initial responders develop acquired resistance to tamoxifen and relapse. Aberrant growth factor signalling has been linked to the resistant phenotype, in particular EGFR and IGF-IR signalling and often gives a more aggressive disease type and poorer patient outlook. There is a substantial clinical need for new anti-breast cancer therapeutics that target the resistant phenotype or prevent this from occurring. One hypothesis is to combine both anti-hormonal therapies with anti-EGFR therapies, in hope of preventing resistant growth. Many downstream pathways of EGFR have been targeted to develop novel therapeutics against however, these compounds are almost certain to give severe adverse reactions, furthermore a complex tablet regime or IV injections {{have a negative effect on}} patient compliance. A novel <b>transcutaneous</b> delivery <b>system</b> would give a more patient friendly alternative, with patients re-applying a patch or cream once a day, with rapid termination of dosing in the event of adverse event This would also go some way to prevent endometrial complications associated with tamoxifen use. The in vitro simultaneous delivery of 4 -hydroxytamoxifen and signal transduction inhibitors LY 294002 and PD 98059 along with EPA determined that all compounds were capable of permeating porcine skin and nipple. Masses able to permeate were 5. 14 0. 93, 6. 97 0. 99, 5. 06 0. 93 and 1121. 6 143 μgcm 2 across skin respectively and 21. 14 2. 75, 18. 2 2. 55, 25. 1 6. 89 and 3081. 2 252. 7 μgcm 2 across porcine nipple. These compounds were formulated with 2. 5 % v/v DMSO and ethanol and 4 % w/v Cab-o-sil. Fish oil was shown to be a skin friendly vehicle. Ki- 67 assays confirmed that incubation with fish oil maintained skin viability and H & E staining confirmed no obvious histological effects. Growth Studies were performed on MCF- 7 and TamR cells and showed that the combination of these compounds was able to reduce cell growth to 4. 04 0. 15 and 2. 47 1. 4 % of control growth when incubated at 25 μM PD 98059 μM LY 294002 x 10 7 M 4 -hydroytamoxifen and 1 μLmL - 1 fish oil. This combination of compounds, without 4 -hydroxytamoxifen, was able to reduce the migratory capacity of TamR cells (P = < 0. 005). Results confirmed that the simultaneous transcutaneous delivery of multiple anti-breast cancer agents is possible and that these show promising anti- tumorogenic actions post skin.

40|$|Background: Treatment of {{peripheral}} arterial diseases may {{be distinguished}} into conservative and interventional management; {{the latter is}} divided into surgical and endovascular procedures. Management of peripheral artery stenosis and occlusion with vascular stents {{is associated with the}} risk of late complications such as restenosis, stent fracture or dislocation. Case Report: A 62 -year-old woman with generalized atherosclerosis, particularly extensive in lower limb arteries, was admitted to the Department of Angiology 11 months after having an endovascular procedure performed due to critical ischemia of left lower limb. Because of stent occlusion, a decision to perform angiographic examination of lower limb arteries was made. Examination revealed occlusion of the superficial femoral artery along its entire length, including previously implanted stents. Distal stent was fractured with slight dislocation of the proximal segment. A decision was made to perform mechanical thrombectomy using a Rotarex system followed by a stent-in-stent placement procedure. Follow-up angiography and ultrasound scan performed 24 hours after the procedure revealed a patent vessel with satisfactory blood flow. Discussion: Nowadays, imaging diagnostics of peripheral artery stenosis involves non-invasive examinations such as ultrasound, minimally invasive examinations such as angio-MRI and MDCT, or invasive examinations such as DSA and IVUS. DSA examinations are used to confirm significant stenosis or occlusion of a vessel, particularly when qualifying a patient for endovascular treatment. Due to their anatomic location, the superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery are subject to various forces e. g. those exerted by the working muscles. Mechanical thrombectomy and atherectomy are efficient methods of arterial recanalization used in the treatment of acute, subacute or even chronic occlusions or stenosis of peripheral vessels. Conclusions: Frequency of angioplasty and vascular stent implantation procedures is increased in patients with peripheral arterial disease, thus increasing the incidence of reported early and late complications such as acute stent thrombosis, restenosis and stent fractures. The Rotarex <b>transcutaneous</b> mechanical thrombectomy <b>system</b> is an efficient method of treating occlusions in arterial stents. It is also safe when performed by experienced operators...|$|R
40|$|Chronic atrial {{fibrillation}} affects {{millions of people}} worldwide. Its surgical treatment often fails to restore the transport function of the atrium. This study first introduces {{the concept of an}} atrial assist device (AAD) to restore the pump function of the atrium. The AAD is developed to be totally implantable in the human body with a <b>transcutaneous</b> energy transfer <b>system</b> to recharge the implanted battery. The ADD consists of a motorless pump based on artificial muscle technology, positioned on the external surface of the atrium to compress it and restore its muscular activity. A bench model reproduces the function of a fibrillating atrium to assess the circulatory support that this pump can provide. Atripump (Nanopowers SA, Switzerland) is a dome-shaped silicone-coated nitinol actuator 5 mm high, sutured on the external surface of the atrium. A pacemaker-like control unit drives the actuator that compresses the atrium, providing the mechanical support to the blood circulation. Electrical characteristics: the system is composed of one actuator that needs a minimal tension of 15 V and has a maximum current of 1. 5 A with a 50 % duty cycle. The implantable rechargeable battery is made of a cell having the following specifications: nominal tension of a cell: 4. 1 V, tension after 90 % of discharge: 3. 5 V, nominal capacity of a cell: 163 mA h. The bench model consists of an open circuit made of latex bladder 60 mm in diameter filled with water. The bladder is connected to a vertically positioned tube that is filled to different levels, reproducing changes in cardiac preload. The Atripump is placed on the outer surface of the bladder. Pressure, volume and temperature changes were recorded. The contraction rate was 1 Hz with a power supply of 12 V, 400 mA for 200 ms. Preload ranged from 15 to 21 cm H(2) O. Maximal silicone membrane temperature was 55 degrees C and maximal temperature of the liquid environment was 35 degrees C. The pump produced a maximal work of 16 x 10 (- 3) J. Maximal volume pumped was 492 ml min(- 1). This artificial muscle pump is compact, follows the Starling law and reproduces the hemodynamic performances of a normal atrium. It could represent a new tool to restore the atrial kick in persistent {{atrial fibrillation}}...|$|R
40|$|Cochlear implants, or bionic ears, restore {{hearing to}} the profoundly deaf by {{bypassing}} missing inner-ear hair {{cells in the}} cochlea and electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. For miniaturized cochlear implants, including behind-the-ear (BTE) models, power consumption is the chief factor in determining cost and patient convenience. This thesis reports {{on the design of}} a low-power bionic ear system by addressing three critical signal and power processing subsystems in low-cost CMOS ICs. First, the design of a low-power current-mode front-end for subminiature microphones demonstrates 78 dB dynamic range performance with attention to RF noise and supply immunity. Second, hearing-impaired patients need strategies that decide intelligently between listening conditions in speech or noise. This work describes an automatic gain control (AGC) design which uses programmable hybrid analog-digital current-mode feedback to implement a dual-loop strategy, a well-known algorithm for speech in noisy environments. The AGC exhibits level-invariant. stability, programmable time constants and consumes less than 36 pW. Third, a feedback-loop technique is explored for analyzing and designing RF power links for <b>transcutaneous</b> bionic ear <b>systems.</b> (cont.) Using feedback tools to minimize algebraic manipulations, this work demonstrates conditions for optimal voltage and power transfer functions. This theory is applied to a bionic implant system designed for load power consumptions in the 1 mW - 10 mW range, a low-power regime not significantly explored in prior designs. Link efficiencies of 74 % and 54 % at 1 -mm and 10 -mm coil separations, respectively, are measured, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. A full cochlear implant system with signal and power processing is explored incorporating the front-end, AGC, and RF power link, as well as analog signal processing channels. This design uses channel data to feedforward program the just-needed electrode power level. My implant system consumes 3 mW of power for all audio processing and a stimulation power of 1 mW. A fixed-power version of this system dissipates 2. 2 mW for 1 mW of internal stimulation power. As many commercial systems with similar specifications consume 40 mW - 80 mW, this effort promises a significant reduction in cochlear implant power consumption and cost. by Michael W. Baker.

40|$|Current implantable brain-machine {{interfaces}} are recording multi-neuron {{activity by}} utilising multi-channel, multi-electrode micro-electrodes. With the {{rapid increase in}} recording capability has come more stringent constraints on implantable system power consumption and size. This is even more so with the increasing demand for wireless systems {{to increase the number}} of channels being monitored whilst overcoming the communication bottleneck (in transmitting raw data) via <b>transcutaneous</b> bio-telemetries. For <b>systems</b> observing unit activity, real-time spike sorting within an implantable device offers a unique solution to this problem. However, achieving such data compression prior to transmission via an on-node spike sorting system has several challenges. The inherent complexity of the spike sorting problem arising from various factors (such as signal variability, local field potentials, background and multi-unit activity) have required computationally intensive algorithms (e. g. PCA, wavelet transform, superparamagnetic clustering). Hence spike sorting systems have traditionally been implemented off-line, usually run on work-stations. Owing to their complexity and not-so-well scalability, these algorithms cannot be simply transformed into a resource efficient hardware. On the contrary, although there have been several attempts in implantable hardware, an implementation to match comparable accuracy to off-line within the required power and area requirements for future BMIs have yet to be proposed. Within this context, this research aims to fill in the gaps in the design towards a resource efficient implantable real-time spike sorter which achieves performance comparable to off-line methods. The research covered in this thesis target: 1) Identifying and quantifying the trade-offs on subsequent signal processing performance and hardware resource utilisation of the parameters associated with analogue-front-end. Following the development of a behavioural model of the analogue-front-end and an optimisation tool, the sensitivity of the spike sorting accuracy to different front-end parameters are quantified. 2) Identifying and quantifying the trade-offs associated with a two-stage hybrid solution to realising real-time on-node spike sorting. Initial part of the work focuses from the perspective of template matching only, while the second part of the work considers these parameters from the point of whole system including detection, sorting, and off-line training (template building). A set of minimum requirements are established which ensure robust, accurate and resource efficient operation. 3) Developing new feature extraction and spike sorting algorithms towards highly scalable systems. Based on waveform dynamics of the observed action potentials, a derivative based feature extraction and a spike sorting algorithm are proposed. These are compared with most commonly used methods of spike sorting under varying noise levels using realistic datasets to confirm their merits. The latter is implemented and demonstrated in real-time through an MCU based platform. Open Acces...|$|R
