40|$|Abstract:  Javanese {{has been}} studied from many {{different}} perspectives. However, no one discusses how Javanese respond <b>to</b> <b>compliments</b> politely. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the politeness strategies as applied <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>compliments</b> by the Javanese people in Jember, East Java. The notion of politeness plays crucial role in the realization of speech acts (utterances and verbal communication) in Javanese, such as responding to compliements. As utterances and verbal communications should be interpreted based on the sosio-cultural background, the politeness strategies in responding <b>to</b> <b>compliments</b> in Javanese cannot be separated from the concepts of the Javanese culture, such as: andhap-asor (lowering oneself, while exalting the others) and tanggap ing sasmita (understanding the hidden meaning). First, as a Javanese, one must be able to apply the concept of andhap-asor in responding <b>to</b> <b>compliments</b> by denigrating himself. Second, a good Javanese should also have a sense of tanggap ing sasmita while responding <b>to</b> <b>compliments.</b> Consequently, failure <b>to</b> apply one of the cultural factors can be detrimental to the speaker, reducing the harmony of the conversation. This paper examines how politeness is manifested and conveyed within the major framework of the Javanese culture. This study is about socio-cultural pragmatics in which utterances are discussed in relation to their situations, and the cultural background which support them. The data are in the form of dialogues among students-teachers, and students-students which show the different social status among the interlocutors. The data of this research were collected by recording, and by note taking (for the parts in which recording is not possible). The data are aimed to generate the strategies used by the Javanese (in Jember, Indonesia) to build politeness strategies in responding <b>to</b> <b>compliments.</b> Finally, the data of this research are examined both from the general theory of politeness, and the Javanese cultural concepts (andhap-asor and tanggap ing sasmita). This study provides important findings which reveal that responding <b>to</b> <b>compliments</b> in Javanese can be achieved in five strategies: (1) disagreeing and denigrating, (2) disagreing and raising a question, (3) accepting and turning back, (4) accepting and giving explanation, and (5) accepting only, or accepting and offering...|$|R
40|$|Complimenting {{is a very}} {{interesting}} speech act to look at because different cultures draw different assumptions when it comes to giving and receiving compliments. Studies such as Yu’s (2005) and Chiang and Pochtrager’s (1993) have shown that people from different cultures give and respond <b>to</b> <b>compliments</b> differently. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to find out how the giving and receiving of compliments are done among English speaking Malaysians. The method used for this research was the recording of naturally occurring casual conversations which was then transcribed and broken into individual tokens. Results show that although other Asian cultures have the tendency <b>to</b> reject the <b>compliment,</b> English speaking Malaysians mostly accept the compliment given, {{but at the same time}} they also shift or erode the force of the <b>compliment</b> <b>to</b> avoid self-praise. The implication of this research is that there are many ways <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>compliments</b> and still be polite. By teaching the ways <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>compliments,</b> teachers can expose the students to ways and means of using language beyond achieving the typical communicative goals...|$|R

5|$|The 49ers in the 1950s {{used the}} T formation, {{sometimes}} referred to as a full house backfield, which deployed a quarterback, fullback, and two halfbacks. Such a formation was common at the time at both the college and professional levels, as teams sought to emulate the success the Chicago Bears had with the formation over the previous decade. The Million Dollar Backfield began its construction in 1948 with the team's signing of speedy fullback Joe Perry. In 1951 the 49ers drafted quarterback Y. A. Tittle. Tittle had played the previous three seasons with the Baltimore Colts, and became available in that year's draft after the Colts folded. The next year the 49ers drafted halfback Hugh McElhenny in the first round. McElhenny proved to be an explosive play-maker and was recognized as the NFL's rookie of the year in 1952. All three were invited to play in the Pro Bowl for 1953, comprising the starting offensive backfield for the West. The final piece came in 1954, when John Henry Johnson joined the team. Johnson became known for his powerful running and his blocking, which served <b>to</b> <b>compliment</b> the finesse of Perry and McElhenny.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} a timber frame house that was {{originally}} constructed {{on the west side}} of Pine Street, but its original form is not known for sure due the extent of its expansion and remodeling. The NRHP nomination states that it could have been a -story gabled roof cottage with a cross-gable in the center, a style popular during the mid-century in Pawtucket. This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards. A two-story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases, one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902. Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time. The additions include a bay window on the facade and openwork on the porch sides. The later alterations to the building worked <b>to</b> <b>compliment</b> the distinctive bargeboards of the cottage with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} the social variable of education on the use of compliments and compliment responses in Persian. To this end, a Discourse Completion Task (DCT) was administered to 200 native Persian speakers from different educational backgrounds. In general, the results revealed that participants tended to use explicit unbound semantic formula as well as non-compliment strategies <b>to</b> give <b>compliments</b> the most. However, they used future reference, contrast, request, and 'other' strategies the least. Furthermore, they followed accept, reject, and evade trend when replying <b>to</b> <b>compliments.</b> Surprisingly, the most common subcategory of compliment response strategy used by participants was downgrade. Return and appreciation tokens were the second and third most frequently used strategies. However, they never used reassignment and topic shift <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>compliments.</b> In particular, the results suggested the effect of education on determining compliments and compliment responses patterns. While lower educated people preferred non-compliment strategies, higher educated people preferred explicit semantic formula strategies <b>to</b> give <b>compliments</b> the most. In replying <b>to</b> <b>compliments,</b> downgrade occurred most frequently across different educational levels except PhD/MD level. PhD/MD holders used appreciation token the most. The second most frequently used compliment response strategy by all educational levels was return. However, despite minor differences, no marked difference was found among educational levels regarding the least frequent compliments and compliment responses. The findings can provide valuable insight into the cultural and socio-cultural factors affecting the way people compliment, perceive the <b>compliments,</b> and respond <b>to</b> the <b>compliments</b> made on them...|$|R

40|$|Strategies used in {{responding}} <b>to</b> <b>compliments</b> {{play an important}} role for a person who receives a compliment since he or she is expected to say something in response <b>to</b> the <b>compliments</b> given. Misunderstanding may occur between people from different cultural background, in this study Americans and Indonesians because these Americans and Indonesians have different norms {{in responding}} <b>to</b> the <b>compliments.</b> Concerning this, the writer conducted this study in order to find whether there are any differences in responding <b>to</b> <b>compliments</b> on appearance and ability between male and female Americans and Indonesians and to find whether sex of the respondents play a role in determining the type of compliment response strategies used. Furthermore, it also tries to see the dominant types of compliment responses which are often used by each group of respondents. In conducting the research, the writer used two sets of role-plays consisting of two situations made {{as close as possible to}} the real-life situations. The first set is for the American respondents and another set is for the Indonesian respondents. The writer, then, asked her respondents to respond to the situations by writing in what they said in order to be analyzed latter. The analysis is made based on Herbert's theory which distinguishes 12 types of compliment responses. They are Appreciation Token, Comment Acceptance, Praise Upgrade, Comment History, Reassignment, Return, Scale Down, Question, Disagreement, Qualification, No Acknowledgement, and Request Interpretation. The writer finds that Indonesian and American have indeed some differences in responding <b>to</b> <b>compliments.</b> For the Americans, Appreciation Token has the highest frequency while for the Indonesians, it is the Question type who has the highest frequency. Besides, the findings show that sex is a determining factor in choosing particular compliment responses for both among Americans and Indonesians...|$|R
