50|$|A further {{modification}} {{produced a}} guideway {{that looked like}} a rightside-up T, although the vertical section was a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>girder</b> almost as wide as the top of the T. The reaction plate for the LIM was moved to the underside of the horizontal portion of the T on one side, extending vertically down, while the other side contained the electrical conductors that provided power. In such an arrangement, rain, snow and debris would simply fall off the plates. The new guideway design was simulated at the Atlas Computer Laboratory.

40|$|Trapezoidal steel box girders are {{becoming}} increasingly popular as a bridge system due to their torsional efficiency and aesthetic appearance. These bridge systems utilize one or more trapezoidal steel girders with a cast-in-place composite concrete roadway. The critical design stage occurs during pouring of the bridge deck, when the steel superstructure must support {{the weight of the}} fresh concrete. Top-lateral bracing systems are used to provide both strength and stiffness during construction. A method for the design of top-lateral bracing systems was developed through field and laboratory experiments conducted on fullscale trapezoidal steel box-girders. The top-lateral bracing systems investigated included traditional single-diagonal truss systems and stay-in-place metal deck forms used during deck casting. Results include torsional girder stiffnesses, brace forces, and loaddeflection responses. Design issues, limitations, and guidelines for truss, metal-deck, and combined top-lateral systems are presented. 17.

40|$|Abstract: Traditionally, bridge {{bearings}} supporting steel <b>trapezoidal</b> box <b>girder</b> (a. k. a. tub girder) superstructures {{consist of}} fabricator designed mechanical devices, such as pot or disk bearings (a. k. a. high load, multi-rotational bearings), {{that may be}} guided or unguided and are typically expensive to fabricate and place. The performance of these bearings has been mixed, with some being maintenance free and others requiring significant maintenance, repair and/or replacement. In Texas, bridge bearings supporting concrete and steel superstructure types are typically steel-laminated elastomeric bearings that are tapered or have a constant thickness. Recently the Texas Department of Transportation has moved toward {{the use of these}} structurally engineered elastomeric bearings for steel <b>trapezoidal</b> box <b>girders</b> in place of mechanically engineered pot or disk bearings. This paper presents a discussion of the rationale for the use of elastomeric bearings for steel <b>trapezoidal</b> box <b>girders,</b> a historical overview of bridge bearing systems in Texas, and the design procedure for the elastomeric bearings of the steel <b>trapezoidal</b> box <b>girders</b> of the US 290 & IH 35 Interchange built in Austin in the late 1990 s and place in service in 2001...|$|R
40|$|In steel <b>trapezoidal</b> box <b>girder</b> bridge systems, the U-shaped {{steel girder}} is {{designed}} to act compositely with the concrete deck to form a closed box for live loading. During the construction stage, however, the behavior is not well understood. The usual practice of assuming the system to be non-composite during construction requires substantial top flange bracing to form a quasi-closed box section. Field studies have Composite box girders with live loading, and girders during construction, have to be evaluated during the design of curved steel <b>trapezoidal</b> box <b>girder</b> bridges. Considering both cases, the design for construction loading is the least understood and is the most important. Stresses due to construction loading can reach up to 60 - 70 {{percent of the total}} design stress for a given cross section. A three-phase study was undertaken to investigate the behavior of curved <b>trapezoidal</b> box <b>girders</b> during construction. In the first phase, laboratory tests were performed to investigate the shear transfer between the concrete deck and steel girder at early concrete ages (hours, not weeks). In the second phase, an easy-to-use finite element program, UTrAp, was developed for the analysis of these systems under construction loads and is documented in CTR Report 1898 - 3 (October 2002). The program has the capability of modeling the effects of semi-cured concrete. Th...|$|R
2500|$|Its {{age and the}} two-lane {{undivided}} roadway and lift-span led to {{a replacement}} bridge, built to the north. This bridge opened in October 1982 as a four-lane, high-level structure. The structure was re-striped to accommodate six lanes on October 18, 1989 {{in response to the}} temporary closing of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge due to the Loma Prieta earthquake, and the permanent widening of the approaches was completed by July 2003.

40|$|In this study, the {{torsional}} and distortional {{performance of}} a three triangular cell <b>trapezoidal</b> box <b>girder</b> section was studied using Vlasov’s theory of thin walled structures. The potential energy of a system under equilibrium was used to obtain the governing differential equations of equilibrium for torsionl-distortional analysis of the box structure. The strain modes diagrams representing torsional and distortional interactions of the box girder structure were obtained {{as well as the}} distortional bending moment diagram for the box girder structure. These were used to compute Vlasov’s coefficients contained in the differential equations of equilibrium. The fourth order differential equations obtained were solved using method of trigonometric series with accelerated convergence to obtain the distortional and torsional deformations which were compared with torsional and distortional deformations of a single cell mono symmetric box girder section of similar overall dimensions and plates thicknesses.

40|$|Abstract: The {{prediction}} of the flutter velocity {{as well as}} the response to turbulent wind has become a more and more important issue for flexible long-span bridges. For this reason flutter derivatives have to be measured in the wind tunnel with great accuracy and their dependence on the mean angle of attack, which is sometimes very strong, has to be considered. In addition, if a common free-vibration set-up is adopted, the mean flow incidence may vary with the wind speed, due to the static rotation of the model, thus strongly limiting the generality of the identified aerodynamic coefficients. In this paper a method to determine flutter derivatives at constant angle of attack using Neural Network approximating functions is proposed and an application {{in the case of a}} <b>trapezoidal</b> single-box <b>girder</b> deck section model is shown. Moreover, the strange static and dynamic behavior of this bridge cross section for small negative angles of attack has been investigated through the Particle Image Velocimetry technique. It has been found that for these flow incidences the width of the wake is significantly larger than for higher or lower angles of attack, probably due to the fact that separation occurs at the upstream lower corner instead of the downstream one. The physical explanation for this local instability of the flow field has not been found yet. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} Long Span Bridges {{involves}} complex {{analysis of the}} interaction between fluid and bluff body (Fluid Structure Interaction). In the past, the aerodynamic characteristics needed for the design of long span bridge deck sections have been obtained via wind tunnel tests. Recent advances in turbulence modeling, computational fluid dynamics and the increasing affordability of computers have made numerical modeling of these complex studies possible. Much research has been carried out on the applicability of CFD in the study of bluff body aerodynamics, and less relating to long span bridges. Unfortunately, due to computational costs and sometimes lack of complete details from the wind tunnel test results, these studies have been limited in scope; usually the work is 2 -dimensional and often limited to the basic section without the parapets and equipment {{that are part of the}} super structure. Also, some experimental work has been done on shaped bluff body sections, such as rectangular cylinders, which has provided useful but limited application to a bridge deck section. The work described in this theses consist of modeling and simulation of the sectional wind tunnel test of the Carquinez Strait bridge in California, a real long span bridge deck section. The modeling incorporates the often ignored but important details such as parapets, barriers and most importantly, the effects of the shape of different edge details on aerodynamic characteristics such as lift, drag and moment coefficients, as well as the flow pattern created by the different edge details in the shedding of vortices in their wakes. The simulations were carried out using the kappa-o based Shear Stress Transport RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes) turbulence model at an average wind velocity of 3. 2 m/s with angles of attack of +/- 10 °. The basic deck section of the Carquinez Strait Bridge is of <b>trapezoidal</b> box <b>girder</b> with sharp edge detail type, this cross section was modified by modifying the edge detail and replacing it with three different types of details; a round edge detail, an oval and a triangular shaped edge type. Additional studies include the removal of the barrier, parapet and equipment to see their effect and the roles played by them in the aerodynamic static force response and the flow physics. Two grid types were explored to determine the most accurate; tetrahedral and hexahedral dominated meshes. Next, determining the appropriate RANS turbulence model, from the matrix of grid and turbulence model emerges the numerical simulation. Once the wind tunnel test results were corrected for errors, the results from numerical modeling compares very well with the static wind tunnel test, thereby validating the choice of turbulence model and grid type, and demonstrating the viability of CFD in long span bridge design. The results of the fluid flow around the differently modified edge details shows how the mechanics of vortex induced vibration develops off of the recirculating air underside the exterior web at the trailing edge, because of the variation in the velocity of air in this region due to the different edge details, it is reasonable to make deductions on stability. In the simulations where the parapets, barriers and equipments are removed off of the deck sections, the response are markedly different, revealing that they are critical and as important as the edge detail chosen during the preliminary design...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of motor vehicles, especially in cities, cause transport problems of traffic congestion, vehicle accidents, {{air pollution and}} a lack of public spaces. The increasing number of motor vehicles consumes huge amounts of finite petrol energy and emits large amounts of gases that are harmful to the atmosphere and the natural environment. Therefore, the current road transport network is not a sustainable form of public transport for the future. In order to seek a suitable transportation mode, the Infrastructure and Engineering Business Unit of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (NMBM) did some feasibility studies about light rail transit (LRT) from 1984 to 1988. The NMBM-report (1988 : 8) concluded that a LRT system would provide the most suitable and primary mode to serve Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB). Although LRT was regarded as the most suitable primary mode of transport at that time (1988), further studies that were reported in 2006 recommended an alternative public transportation system. This research refers to these studies done for the NMB area and other studies and reports for other areas, but focus on the identification of the most suitable civil engineering components for a conceptual elevated light rail transit (ELRT) model. Electrical driven LRT systems have advantages over internal-combustion driven vehicles in terms of environmental protection. Traditional LRT systems are at ground level and are integrated with the existing road network. Some successful LRT systems indicate that the success of LRT systems is mainly dependent on integration with the existing road network. However, the integration of road transport systems with LRT systems cause increased congestion and accidents. An ELRT system can solve these problems. Bangkok has already built an ELRT system to solve its severe traffic congestion. 4 In order to develop a conceptual ELRT model, this research aimed to determine the most suitable civil engineering components for a conceptual ELRT model, including: (i) the most suitable type of bridge foundation; (ii) the most suitable type bridge girder; (iii) the most suitable type of sleeper; and (iv) whether the track should be a ballasted or non-ballasted type. The grounded theory approach was adopted to build up sets of data from which the most suitable components could be selected. In addition, design analyses were done of the various types of components to determine their suitability for a conceptual ELRT model. Experienced engineers and experts were also consulted to identify the most suitable components. After analyses and selection of the most suitable components, outstanding experts were approached to evaluate the components that showed up as the most suitable through the research. The research results indicated that bored and cast-in-place piles, a double-cell <b>trapezoidal</b> segmental box <b>girder,</b> and twin-block sleepers on a non-ballasted sleeper bed are the most suitable civil engineering component...|$|R
