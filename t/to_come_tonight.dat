Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you think he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: As in wild earth a Grecian vase. Did he? I hope you'll be able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>tonight.</b> Malachi Mulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear Miss Mitchell's joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn's wild oats? Awfully clever, isn't it? They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Our national epic {{has yet to be}} written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O'Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches.

Avis, I'm trying to be a better chap--more the sort of man you'd have me be. I've given the old set the go-by--I'm trying to live up to your standard. It would be easier if you were here to help me. When I was a kid it was always easier to be good for awhile after I'd talked things over with you. I've got the best mother a fellow ever had, but you and I were such chums, weren't we, Avis? I thought I'd just break down in there tonight and put a damper on everything by crying like a baby. If anybody had spoken about you, I should have. Hello!" ...|$|R

40|$|I {{thought it}} would be {{appropriate}} to make a few comments tonight since this week is the third anniversary of this program. I was pretty new with ARPA and these two guys by the name of Don Thompson and this guy he had gotten to, Hike Buckley from the Air Force Materials Laboratory, came in with blazing six guns. They painted such a picture that I was putty in their hands. So we started this program. I went out on thin ice for it with a pretty sizeable sum of money. I have found that 1 t has been worth it over these three years. There have been, however, over these three years so ambivalent feelings on my part. How do you measure success? What am I going to say to myself 10 - 20 years from now; was this program successful or not? I see some signs of success, but I wonder if these successes would have occurred had not ARPA put an investment into the area. I like to feel they wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t have been accomplished, but it remains for posterity to show that. Ill! have been fairly successful in getting things implemented into certain services. We have asked Mr. Willoughby <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here <b>tonight</b> from the Navy because the Navy has not been the most successful of the three services. They 2 ̆ 7 re not coming in first or second in my book as far as NDE is concerned, but I think when you hear Mr. Willoughby, you 2 ̆ 7 re going to hear that Mr. Willoughby has some interesting thoughts on this and I 2 ̆ 7 m convinced if anyone can have an effect, he has a good shot at it...|$|R

And now a last word, dearest and best of friends! The cause of the late change in you, which I have seen with so much pain and sorrow, and have sometimes referred to my old apprehension--at other times to lingering suppositions nearer to the truth--has been made clear tonight; and by an accident I have also <b>come</b> <b>to</b> know, <b>tonight,</b> the full measure of your noble trust in me, even under that mistake. I do not hope that any love and duty I may render in return, will ever make me worthy of your priceless confidence; but with all this knowledge fresh upon me, I can lift my eyes to this dear face, revered as a father's, loved as a husband's, sacred {{to me in my}} childhood as a friend's, and solemnly declare that in my lightest thought I have never wronged you; never wavered in the love and the fidelity I owe you!' ...|$|R
40|$|Our task {{today is}} to celebrate, inaugurate, and educate. Lawyers demanded the {{education}} part of the talk because they love double counting whenever possible.

That 2 ̆ 7 s just one illustration of how to think like a lawyer [...] kill as many birds with as few stones as possible. Lawyers are often accused of talking in an arcane language {{that no one else}} can understand. Labor-relations people are sometimes thought to be either pie-in-the-sky optimists or Marxist-inspired anarchists. Human-relations professionals are sometimes said to be hypocrites giving a fake smile to employees while looking solely at the bottom line. But these are just insults. I <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you <b>tonight</b> as someone who has been through a joint degree program myself. At times it is frustrating. At the very least, it teaches one how to deal with university bureaucracy. But at its best, someone who has advanced professional training in both law and in labor and human relations gets something better than what either can teach alone...|$|R
