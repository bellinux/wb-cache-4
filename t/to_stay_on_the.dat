5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show would be able <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Butlin had nurtured {{the idea of}} a holiday camp. He had seen the way landladies in seaside resorts would, {{sometimes}} literally, push families out of the lodgings between meals, regardless of the weather.

5|$|In September 1939, Britain and France {{declared}} war on Germany following the German invasion of Poland. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defensive along the border, relying on the Maginot Line in helping counter an anticipated German offensive across the German-French border. As neither side made any offensive moves, a Dr√¥le de Guerre (Phoney War) developed as both sides stood-off along the border.|$|E

5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> key for an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from {{staying in the}} key {{for more than three}} seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E

5|$|Isle Verde, where {{approximately}} 2,300people were killed, {{was declared}} uninhabitable by officials; however, residents still {{returned to the}} area due to a need for land. Eventually, signs that used to warn people not <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there. A resettlement community was constructed months later, with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families {{that needed to be}} moved from the area. Those that were not moved were left on Isle Verde despite orders not to stay there. Another resettlement project for 700families was planned at the cost of $1million.|$|E

Kinkaid convinced the captain to allow homeless families of crew members <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship, and erected tarpaulins on the quayside to create family areas.

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous and {{successful}} apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg, who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Dejima outside Nagasaki, so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus' death.|$|E

Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her, restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there {{is likely to be}} more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E

Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet proves to be habitable by humans, and around {{a quarter of the}} ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again.

5|$|After {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} western Atlantic, the Miami U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm {{warnings}} for the North Carolina coastline from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras; the region was warned to prepare for strong winds. The agency also issued a small craft advisory southward through Charleston, South Carolina. Offshore, the storm produced winds of up to 85mph (140km/h), as well as waves up to 35feet (10m) in height. The combination of the winds and rough waves drove a freighter ashore along Portsmouth Island in the Outer Banks, after the engine was damaged when water entered the fuel line. The 26person crew initially planned to evacuate, but they later decided <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> freighter as the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist. The seas damaged {{a portion of the}} ship, but the entire crew was rescued without any injuries. The storm later brushed New England, bringing rain, fog, warmer temperatures, and gusty winds. The combination resulted in downed power poles and tree limbs, leaving 10,000houses without electricity.|$|E
