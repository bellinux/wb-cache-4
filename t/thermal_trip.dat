40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{revolves around}} a time dependent <b>thermal</b> overload <b>trip</b> unit inside automated switching mechanisms. The first part addresses {{the principle of}} the function of a <b>thermal</b> overcurrent <b>trip</b> unit and the possible construction solutions. The biggest emphasis is given to bimetal as a base construction feature of the <b>thermal</b> overcurrent <b>trip</b> unit. Besides the materials that are most suitable for the creation of bimetal, various bimetal parameters that are needed for its design are also analyzed. The next subject of the thesis is an introduction to the elemental calculations for the bimetal component and the summary of mathematical relations for the calculation of the most commonly used solutions. A predominant part of this thesis revolves around the theoretical calculation of the <b>thermal</b> overload <b>trip</b> in a previously estabilished circuit breaker for a specific type of the bimetal and a specific required tripping characteristic. The previously estabilished calculation is then verified by measuring. The measuring itself consists of the measurement of the free bending of the bimetal in dependence on heat. The last part of this thesis includes the assessment of the results calculated from the theoretical standpoint, compared with the results given by the measurement...|$|R
30|$|Circuit {{breakers}} {{are the key}} {{equipment in}} DC systems; however these current devices cannot totally and perfectly satisfy the protection requirements. Traditional molded-case circuit breakers (MCCB) {{are the most common}} protection devices in current DC systems. The tripping device of the MCCB could either be thermal-magnetic or electronic so that the ratings are quite different. The magnetic tripping devices detect the instantaneous values while the <b>thermal</b> <b>tripping</b> devices sense the RMS values of the current. In order to achieve sufficient voltage blocking capacity, the contactors could be connected in a series in both cases [26]. However, the discharge current of the filter capacitor after the short circuit are of high magnitude which lasts for a very short time. Therefore, the case may exist that the current force is unable to open the contacts of the MCCBs.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of thermal {{overload}} relay. In one type, a bi-metallic strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the <b>thermal</b> overload <b>tripping.</b> <b>Thermal</b> overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|R
40|$|Comment: The {{question}} {{asks for}} the APRM Upscale <b>Thermal</b> Power <b>Trip</b> Setpoint {{based on a}} given set of plant conditions. The question is recommended for deletion {{since there is no}} correct answer. It has been determined that the equation used to arrive at Answer B (104. 6 %) used the RPS APRM Upscale Thermal Power Allowable Value equation (0. 628 W+ 63. 8 %) instead of the RPS APRM Upscale <b>Thermal</b> Power <b>Trip</b> Setpoint equation (0. 628 W+ 60. 9 %). The correct answer should have been 101. 6 %. The reference source that contains the correct equation is attached for review (PDB-ROO 01 Attachment 2, Table 1 - RPS Trip Setpoint Table). Therefore, per NUREG- 1021, ES- 403, Section D. 1. b, this question should be deleted. This particular question was discussed with NRC Examiner Mike Bielby {{during the course of the}} Written Examination. Based on our discussion, I elected not to make this change to the Master Examinations and answer keys during the post-exam grading process and instead submit a formal comment within the five-day comment period. As the exam author and proctor, this comment is being submitted separately from the comments made by the applicant's after the Written Examination...|$|R

40|$|Electron-positron {{colliders}} {{have been}} {{operating in a}} topup-and-coast fashion with a cycle time depending on the beam life time, typically one or more hours. Each top-up involves ramping detector systems {{in addition to the}} actual filling time. The loss in accumulated luminosity may be 20 - 50 %. During the last year, both B-Factories have commissioned a continuous-injection mode of operation in which beam is injected without ramping the detector, thus raising luminosity integration by always operating at peak luminosity. Constant beam currents also reduce <b>thermal</b> drift and <b>trips</b> caused by change in beam loading. To achieve this level of operation, special efforts were made to reduce the injection losses and also to implement gating procedures in the detectors, minimizing dead time. Beam collimation can reduce injection noise but also cause an increase in background rates. A challenge can be determining beam lifetime, important to maintain tuning of the beams...|$|R
40|$|Concentrated {{purchasing}} {{patterns of}} plug-in vehicles {{may result in}} localized distribution transformer overload scenarios. Prolonged periods of transformer overloading causes service life decrements, and in worst-case scenarios, results in <b>tripped</b> <b>thermal</b> relays and residential service outages. This analysis will review distribution transformer load models developed in the IEC 60076 standard, and apply the model to a neighborhood with plug-in hybrids. Residential distribution transformers are sized such that night-time cooling provides thermal recovery from heavy load conditions during the daytime utility peak. It is expected that PHEVs will primarily be charged at night in a residential setting. If not managed properly, some distribution transformers could become overloaded, leading {{to a reduction in}} transformer life expectancy, thus increasing costs to utilities and consumers. A Monte-Carlo scheme simulated each day of the year, evaluating 100 load scenarios as it swept through the following variables: number of vehicle per transformer, transformer size, and charging rate. A general method for determining expected transformer aging rate will be developed, based on the energy needs of plug-in vehicles loading a residential transformer...|$|R
30|$|With the {{vigorous}} exploitation of wind power generation, stability {{problems associated with}} wind farms have increased [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], among which sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) is a prominent example. SSO was initially defined as an electric power system condition where the electric network exchanges significant energy with a turbine generator at {{one or more of}} the natural frequencies of the combined system below the synchronous frequency of the system [6]. With deepening research, the concept of SSO has expanded to systems with wind generators. In October 2009, a series of offline wind generators and cracked crowbar circuits were found in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas event [3]. In December 2012, a wind farm in North China reported that a part of their generators were shut down and that a sub-synchronous current was sent out to the main grid during the accident [4, 5]. In July 2015, several <b>thermal</b> generators were <b>tripped</b> off by shaft torsional vibration relay in a thermal power plant in Hami, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. This event led to the emergent power reduction of a nearby high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission line and caused sharp fluctuation in the frequency of the grid. Analysis of the records of the phasor measurement units after the accident revealed that the sub-synchronous current that aroused the torsional vibration came from wind farms north of the region [7].|$|R
5000|$|The {{annealing}} process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region {{for a set}} period of time. During that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater purity. The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed into martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition. By controlling the amount of martensite in the steel, {{as well as the}} degree of temper, the strength level can be controlled. Depending on processing and chemistry, the strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa. [...] TRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain small amounts of Austen and bainite in a ferrite matrix. <b>Thermal</b> processing for <b>TRIP</b> steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region {{for a period of time}} sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse into austenite. The steel is then quenched to a point above the martensite start temperature and held there. This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product. While at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the retained austenite. This, in turn, lowers the martensite start temperature to below room temperature. Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of decomposed austenite). This combination of micro-structures has the added benefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming. This offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels. Essentially, as the TRIP steel is being formed, it becomes much stronger. Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa. Martensitic steels are also high in C and Mn. These are fully quenched to martensite during processing. The martensite structure is then tempered back to the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel. Tensile strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa.|$|R
