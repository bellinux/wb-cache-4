40|$|Abstract. On <b>the</b> {{foundation}} <b>of</b> taking {{equipment and}} production technology into consideration,we present {{a set of}} combined setting technology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strip suit to cold reduction mill of roll four and framework five. Then <b>the</b> parameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strip was controlled combined and coordinated of framework 1 - 5. On the one hand,it ensures <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bending roll not cancel out mutually,and enhances <b>the</b> controlled effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bending roll in the strip,on the other hand, {{there will not be}} new extra and partial shape wave under <b>the</b> complex effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bending roll. Meanwhile there will not be <b>the</b> problem that <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bending roll in some parts get too high even overall loading while the other parts get get too low in the setting procedure. While improving <b>the</b> lifespan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluid cylinder, <b>the</b> adjusting rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bending roll get increased.

40|$|A {{diagnostic}} study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ferrel cell by eddy fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere is carried out. The quasi-geostrophic omega equation, and Oort and Rasmusson's (1971) data set, are used. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> condensation {{associated with the}} large scale motions are introduced to the omega equation by using the quasi-geostrophic moisture conservation equation. Thus, the dry static stability {{is replaced by a}} moist static stability, and <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ferrel cell by eddy latent heat fluxes as well as sensible heat and momentum fluxes is included.

5|$|Composite bows {{can be used}} without {{difficulty}} by infantry. The infantry archers of classical Greece and the Roman Empire used composite bows. The military of the Han Dynasty (220 BCE–206 CE) utilized composite crossbows, often in infantry square formations, in their many engagements against the Xiongnu. Until 1571 archers with composite bows were a main component of <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire, but in the Battle of Lepanto in that year they lost most of these troops and never replaced them.|$|E
