5|$|The alleged {{death of}} Moreno González was {{considered}} one of the most significant government victories since the start of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> in 2006. La Familia Michoacana was the focus of the government because their stronghold, Michoacán state, is approximately four hours away from the country's capital, Mexico City. In addition, Michoacán is the homestate of former President Felipe Calderón, who made it a top priority to pacify it.|$|E
25|$|His {{presidency}} {{was marked by}} the ignition of the Mexican Drug War, which began almost immediately after he took office. He sanctioned Operation Michoacán, the first large-scale deployment of federal troops against the drug cartels. By {{the end of his}} administration, the official number of deaths related to <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> was at least 60,000. The murder rate skyrocketed during his presidency parallel to that of the ignition of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>war,</b> with the murder rate peaking in 2010 and decreasing during {{the last two years of}} his term.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> has {{resulted}} in an appallingly high death toll of 135, 000 as of October 2013. <b>The</b> U. S. <b>Drug</b> Enforcement Administration identifies the situation in Mexico as a problem with organized crime, thereby making it a criminal justice issue, despite <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>war???s</b> striking resemblance to an armed conflict. Most notable about the conflict is the combined ability of multiple heavily-armed drug trafficking organizations to wage and sustain armed resistance against the state. This study takes the position that <b>the</b> Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> is a civil war. In order to prove this position, the study will analyze multiple scholarly definitions of armed conflict and civil war to verify that <b>the</b> ongoing <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> satisfies <b>the</b> requirements for civil war. Next, brief case studies of six accepted civil wars will be compared with <b>the</b> Mexican <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> in order to highlight similarities. The wars incorporated into the case studies are the civil wars in Angola, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq, Colombia, and the Mexican Revolution...|$|R

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the impact of <b>the</b> 2003 <b>war</b> on <b>drugs</b> policy on imprisonment and the prison social world in Thailand. While most studies on <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>war</b> have focused mainly on the quantitative increase in the prison population in the penal systems as the policy’s main impact, this research further examined the social shifts in Thai prisons driven by <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>war.</b> <b>The</b> data were qualitatively collected and analysed through documentary analysis, observations and in-depth interviews with forty-six participants: the former Director Generals of The Corrections Department, prison inmates, prison officers, and prison directors from Bangkwang Central Prison, Klongprem Central Prison, The Central Correctional Institution for Drug-addicts and The Women’s Correctional Institution for Drug-addicts. Although the Thai government declared a victory in <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>war</b> by claiming that <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> business had almost been eradicated due to the decrease in the size of the prison population and in <b>the</b> number of <b>drug</b> case arrests, in reality some changes caused by <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>war</b> within <b>the</b> prison world have been overlooked. The findings of this thesis reveal that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> on <b>drugs</b> produced significant effects upon various spheres of imprisonment. By dividing the framework into several levels for analysis focusing on prison inmates, prison officers and the social relationships behind bars, the lives and experiences of prisoners and prison officers are shown to have been effected in a negative and tougher way. Besides, there have been changes in social relations among prisoners and between inmates and prison officers. Crucially, the key factor leading to the policy impact was the replacement by <b>the</b> more powerful <b>drug</b> dealers in Thai prisons for drug users, due to the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act B. E. 2545 (2002), which was a significant feature of <b>the</b> 2003 <b>drugs</b> <b>war...</b>|$|R

25|$|Ethnic prejudices {{have also}} emerged in <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>war,</b> and poor and {{helpless}} indigenous communities have been {{targeted by the}} police, military, drug traffickers and the justice system. According to the National Human Rights Commission (Mexico) (Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos-CNDH), nearly one-third of the indigenous prisoners in Mexico in 2001 were in prison for federal crimes, which are mostly drug-related.|$|E
25|$|During peak {{years of}} violent crime in the city, gun battles between rival cartels, and between cartels and the police, erupted in public. In April 2008, police found 1,500 shell casings on various streets after one battle left 13 {{suspected}} drug traffickers dead.

Alternative crop programs were also being resisted by coca farmers who depended on the coca trade for their livelihood. At a meeting of the 19-member Rio group in May 2003, Toledo proposed developing a joint strategy to deal with drug trafficking, but pressure from Washington, which preferred bilateral efforts, helped kill the notion.|$|E

25|$|Per {{a defense}} {{ministry}} report written by General Guillermo Galván Galván, the Army has 259,770 active duty soldiers, about 0.16 per {{cent of the}} population. Its 1989 budget was 0.7 per cent of the country's Gross National Product (GNP). In 1999, Mexico's military budget increased to 0.9 per cent of its GDP, to US$4.0 billion. Since the year 2000, however, with the economic boost {{that the country has}} experienced, the defense budget was decreased to 0.5 per cent of the GDP, and in 2007 had an annual expenditure of US$4 billion. Since President Calderón assumed office in December 2006, he has submitted legislation increasing the budget, in order to fight <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> against the narcotics cartels, and narcotic drug trafficking in general, that have extended their violent business to each corner of the country.

The resulting struggle to fill the recently vacated position is one that threatens the existence of many lives in the cartel. Typically, many junior-level cartel members then fight amongst one another, creating more and more chaos. The drug cartels are more aggressive and forceful now {{than they were in the}} past and at this point, the cartels hold much of the power in Mexico. Calderón relies heavily on the military to defend and fight against cartel activity. Calderón’s military forces have yet to yield significant results in dealing with the violent cartels due in part to the fact that many of the law enforcement officials working for the Mexican government are suspected of being corrupt. There is suspicion that cartels have corrupted and infiltrated the military at a high level, influencing many high-ranking generals and officers. Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission has received nearly 5,800 complaints regarding military abuse since the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> <b>war</b> in 2006.

Few series in the history of television have explored the plight of inner-city African Americans and none—not one—has done it as well." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety wrote at the time, [...] "When television history is written, little else will rival 'The Wire.'" [...] The New York Times called the fourth season of The Wire [...] "its best season yet." [...] Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times was more reserved in his praise, calling it the [...] "most ambitious" [...] show on television, but faulting it for its complexity and the slow development of the plotline. The Los Angeles Times took the rare step of devoting an editorial to the show, stating that [...] "even in what is generally acknowledged to be something of a golden era for thoughtful and entertaining dramas—both on cable channels and on network TV—The Wire stands out." [...] TIME magazine especially praised the fourth season, stating that [...] "no other TV show has ever loved a city so well, damned it so passionately, or sung it so searingly." [...] The website Metacritic, which gathers reviews from news sources and translates them into a percentage score, assigned The Wires fourth season a weighted average score of 98%, the second highest score for any television season in Metacritic history (with the fifth season of Breaking Bad being the first).|$|E
