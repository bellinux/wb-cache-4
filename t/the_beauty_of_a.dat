500|$|A {{number of}} critics {{have found the}} {{character}} of Mercutio to have unacknowledged homoerotic desire for Romeo. Jonathan Goldberg examined the sexuality of Mercutio and Romeo utilising [...] "queer theory" [...] in Queering the Renaissance, comparing their friendship with sexual love. Mercutio, in friendly conversation, mentions Romeo's phallus, suggesting traces of homoeroticism. An example is his joking wish [...] "To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle ... letting it there stand / Till she had laid it and conjured it down." [...] Romeo's homoeroticism {{can also be found}} in his attitude to Rosaline, a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Shakespeare's procreation sonnets describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who may be seen as being a homosexual. Goldberg believes that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says [...] "...that which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man and <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman.|$|E
500|$|Gender studies {{critics have}} argued that Rosaline's name {{suggests}} that Romeo never really forgets her but rather replaces her with Juliet. [...] Thus, when Juliet cries [...] "What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet," [...] she is ironically expressing Romeo's own view {{of her as a}} substitute for Rosaline. [...] That is to say, Rosaline, replaced in name only by Juliet, is just as sweet to Romeo. Gender critics also note that the arguments used to dissuade Romeo from pursuing Rosaline are similar to the themes of Shakespeare's procreation sonnets. In these sonnets Shakespeare urges the man (who can be equated with Romeo) to find a woman with whom to procreate—a duty he owes to society. [...] Rosaline, it seems, is distant and unavailable except in the mind, similarly bringing no hope of offspring. [...] As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. [...] Rosaline reveals similarities to the subject of the sonnets when she refuses to break her vow of chastity. [...] Her name may be referred to in the first sonnet when the young man is described as [...] "beauties Rose." [...] This line ties the young man to both Rosaline and Romeo in Juliet's [...] "What's in a name?" [...] soliloquy. [...] When Juliet says [...] "...that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man and <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman.|$|E

In 1984, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg confronted Bacon with a reproduction of the centre panel during the filming of a South Bank Show documentary, and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth. Bacon replied, [...] "I had always thought that I {{would be able to}} make the mouth with all <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so."

[...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved.

500|$|The show's only main {{character}} {{to have been}} spared harsh criticism, Clair has garnered very positive reviews from critics, by whom she continues to be venerated frequently. Critics and journalists often celebrate the character's [...] "outspoken, womanist views". Blake Green of The Baltimore Sun described the character as [...] "the perfect wife and mother of five who also practiced law and dressed to the nines." [...] Jezebel's Hillary Crosley Coker hailed Clair as a [...] "career-driven matriarch that kicked ass {{at home and at}} work." [...] Writing for Complex, Nikeita Hoyte described Clair as [...] "A hard-ass mom who radiates <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> goddess", while the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "Clair was one big beacon of gorgeous in the Huxtable household." [...] Daisy Dumas of the Daily Mail dubbed Clair an [...] "Indomitable matriarch". AfterEllen.com's Jill Guccini called Clair [...] "divine". Including her on her list of [...] "Diverse TV Ladies That Can Help Young Girls Learn How to Kick Ass", she hailed her relationship with Cliff as [...] "something that young girls—gay or straight—really need to see", while praising her occasional use of Spanish. In a retrospective review of The Cosby Show in 2014, Daily Life writer Ruby Hamad highlighted Clair as the [...] "one thing about the show that is as good now as it was then". In terms of the character's best episodes, Joe Reid of The Atlantic cited Clair's unimpressed reaction to her husband allegedly confusing a cherished memory of her with that of an old love interest in the sixth season episode [...] "Isn't It Romantic?" [...] as a personal favorite, specifically lauding Rashad's pronunciation of [...] "tacky barrette" [...] and [...] "her hairpin turn when Cliff's real gift is revealed that shows that next dimension that always pushed Clair {{to the top of the}} heap." [...] Meanwhile, Kevin O'Keefe, writing for the same publication, selected Clair's enraged monologue to Vanessa in season six's [...] "Off to See the Wretched", followed by the character's dismay upon learning that Sondra has decided not to return to law school, as his favorites, enjoying the way in which Clair adopts an [...] "attack mode" [...] in both circumstances. Reviewing the character's conversation about pregnancy and marriage with Denise in season three's [...] "The Shower", Slates Aisha Harris wrote [...] "written realistically and delivered beautifully by Rashad, the moment attains a level of artistry that spot-on TV lessons rarely reach." [...] When the show aired, both middle and upper-class working women responded well to Clair. However, some few reviewers have occasionally accused the character of being too perfect and one-dimensional, while others found her to be too aggressive, outspoken, lacking in maternity and overly controlling towards both her children and husband. Additionally, some feminist critics did not appreciate the fact that Clair rarely struggles with everyday situations that working mothers typically encounter in real life.|$|E

2500|$|Philip C. Kolin of the University of Southern Mississippi interprets several {{lines from}} the first two quatrains of Sonnet 20 as written by a {{homosexual}} figure.

[...] In other words, the young man possesses all the positive qualities of a woman, without all of her negative qualities. The narrator seems to believe that the young man is as beautiful as any woman, but is also more faithful and less fickle. Kolin also argues that, [...] "numerous, though overlooked, sexual puns run throughout this indelicate panegyric to Shakespeare's youthful friend." [...] He suggests the reference to the youth's eyes, which gild the objects upon which they gaze, may also be a pun on [...] "gelding…The feminine beauty of this masculine paragon not only enhances those in his sight but, with the sexual meaning before us, gelds those male admirers who temporarily fall under the sway of the feminine grace and pulchritude housed in his manly frame." ...|$|E

[...] Bestselling author of The Book Thief, Markus Zusak, describes it as [...] "a novel of life and death and the people caught in between" [...] and [...] "John Green at his best". Pertaining to Green's writing throughout the book, E.

2500|$|The Nican mopohua {{which has}} been {{described}} as [...] "A Jewel of Nahuatl literature, whose beauty and depth of thought make it worthy of renown the world over" [...] relies on the beauty of the dialogues between the Holy Virgin and Juan Diego to express the most tender feelings to be found in world literature. [...] Her promise to grant the wishes of the locals who beseech her is prominent, as is her demand for a temple on the very spot. The Nican Mopohua section by Valeriano of Lasso de la Vega's account is related in a poetic style, typical of the most elegant formal classical Nahuatl in its full beauty. [...] The other parts are clearly different and with greater Spanish influence. The Nican Mopohua is unique for presenting a blending between the deepest Nahuatl thought with the Christian message. [...] Scholar Richard Nebel insists that the Nican Mopohua is not necessarily a historical account, but a document designed to convert the Nahua and [...] "bring about a state of harmony between different peoples, cultures, and religions, in order that, during a period of radical change, new possibilities of coexistence could be envisaged". It is precisely on this point that an abysmal difference exists with other Dialogues which invoke elements of the dramatic writings (called autos), many of which were used for the purposes of proselytization during the Spanish colonization of Mexico. [...] The autos reflect only Spanish Christian thinking, while the main characteristic of the Nican Mopohua is the exceptional blending of the best of two cultures. [...] Leon-Portilla suggests, [...] "That there is in [...] an exposition of key ideas in Christian thinking, wrapped up in the language and form conceived from the world of the Nahua. It is without a doubt that this narrative seeks to demonstrate who God and the Virgin Mary are and that their relations are of kindness and protection for human beings." [...] The emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> miraculous event as given by the Nican Mopohua can be contrasted with the account of Sánchez, which focuses primarily on the agreements between Indian accounts of the apparition and Biblical prophecy (most notably [...] and [...] ).|$|E
