40|$|Abstract: Headed {{reinforcement}} is {{a relatively}} new product and has not been used in many applications. Headed reinforcing bars have been extensively used in the construction of offshore oil platforms where hooked bars have traditionally been used to anchor longitudinal reinforcement or bars bent for ties and transverse reinforcement. Hooks and bent-bar ties create a large amount of congestion in the reinforcing cage which leads to difficulties during construction. Using headed reinforcement removes the tail extensions of hooks and allows fewer larger bars to be used, greatly reducing the congestion of the reinforcing cage. It has been found that the use of headed reinforcement can greatly decrease the time needed to erect the reinforcement resulting in large cost savings. Headed reinforcement has also been used in a few projects for strengthening and repairing footings of highway structures. A total 81 Pullout test were performed to the study of Bond behavior of Headed reinforcement bar in concrete with different Embedment length with various diameters of bars, various grade of concrete and various sizes of cubes. In this research project, it is proposed to execute experimental work by using headed reinforcement bars. The effect of different parameters like embedment length, head shapes and concrete grades, <b>threaded</b> <b>headed</b> reinforcement bars can be study. The results will be used to develop design recommendations for the application of headed reinforcement bars...|$|R

40|$|Six column specimens, {{representing}} the boundary elements {{at the ends}} of walls, were constructed and tested under pure axial load. This series included: a specimen without any confinement; a specimen with closed ties; a specimen with seismic hoops and crossties; a specimen with closed hoops and headed bars replacing the crossties; and two specimens that had all of the transverse reinforcement replaced by headed bars at two different spacings. Two additional specimens were tested to investigate the effectiveness of headed bars used to retrofit specimens that had no transverse reinforcement. In the retrofit procedure the first step involved drilling horizontal holes through the specimens. Headed bars with one end having a fixed head and the other end having a <b>threaded</b> <b>head</b> were then placed in the holes. After seating the heads on a thin layer of epoxy, the headed bars were slightly prestressed using the turn-of-the-nut method. Using small access holes drilled {{at the end of each}} headed bar, the horizontal holes were filled with structural epoxy. Behavioural comparisons were made for the boundary elements utilizing conventional reinforcement and those with headed bars. It was found that headed bars not only provided a viable solution when used as crossties, but they also offer improved confinement compared to the seismic hoops and crossties used in seismic design. It was also found that headed bars can be used to replace entirely the hoops and crossties with improved confinement. The retrofit procedure using added headed bars resulted in significant improvement to the confinement of the boundary elements...|$|R

The goal of the research reported herein was to characterize the withdrawal strength of ring-shank nails embedded in Southern Pine lumber. Three sizes ofgalvanized and ungalvanized (bright) ring-shank nails from two manufacturers were studied. Ring-shank nails had approximately twice the withdrawal resistance of smooth-shank nails of the same diameter. Galvanizing slightly reduced withdrawal strength (approximately 8 %) due to partial filling of the <b>threads.</b> Nail <b>head</b> pull-through was studied as a possible failure mode.

40|$|The mining {{industry}} is a major consumer of rock bolts in the United States. Due to the high humidity in the underground mining environment, the rock bolts corrode and loose their load bearing capacity which in turn reduces the life expectancy of the ground support and, thus, creates operational difficulties and number of safety concerns [1]. Research on rock anchor corrosion has not been adequately extensive {{in the past and}} the effects of several factors in the mine atmosphere and waters are not clearly understood. One of the probable reasons for this lack of research may be attributed to the time required for gathering meaningful data that makes the study of corrosion quite challenging. In this particular work underground water samples from different mines in the Illinois coal basin were collected and the major chemical content was analyzed and used for the laboratory testing. The corrosion performance of the different commercial rock anchors was investigated by techniques such as laboratory immersion tests in five different corrosion chambers, and potentiodynamic polarization tests in simulated ground waters based on the Illinois coal basin. The experiments were conducted with simulate underground mining conditions (corrosive). The tensile strengths were measured for the selected rock anchors taken every 3 months from the salt spray corrosion chambers maintained at different pH values and temperatures. The corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current (Icorr) and the corresponding corrosion rates (CR) of the selected commercial rock bolts: # 5, # 6, # 6 epoxy coated and # 7 forged head rebar steels, # 6 and # 7 <b>threaded</b> <b>head</b> rebar steels were measured at the solution pH values of 5 and 8 at room temperature. The open circuit potential (OCP) values of the different rock anchors were recorded in 3 selected underground coal mines (A, B 2 ̆ 6 C) in the Illinois coal basin and the data compared with the laboratory electrochemical tests for analyzing the life of the rock anchors installed in the mines with respect to corrosion potential and corrosion current measured. The results of this research were statistically validated. This research will have direct consequence to the rock related safety. The results of this research indicate that certain corrosive conditions are commonly found in mines but uniform corrosion (around 0. 01 - 0. 03 mm loss per year across the diameter) is generally not considered a serious issue. From this study, longer term research for long-term excavation support is recommended that could quantify the problem depending on the rock anchor used and specific strata conditions...|$|R

The stability of this fixation is mainly dependent on anchorage of the screw in the bone. During initial stabilization, poor bone quality, such as that observed in osteoporosis, disuse osteopenia or hidden fissure lines, screw overtightening and excessive mechanical demand may cause inadequate screw anchorage, leading to less stable bone fixation and subsequent osteosynthesis failure. The result of this may be residual pain, delayed union or nonunion and bone misalignment. The development of locking plates (LP) has provided a suitable alternative to standard compression plates.

40|$|Nuclear factor kappa B (NF- K B) {{is a key}} {{mediator}} of innate {{and adaptive}} immuneresponse. lncorrect regulation of NF- K B pathway {{has been linked to}} immune andinflammatory disease as well as cancers. TAX 1 -binding protein 1 (TAX 1 BP 1) is anegative regulator of TNF-alpha- and IL- 1 β-induced NF- K B activation. TAX 1 BP 1 comprises two C-terminal zinc finger domains that bind to mono- and polyubiquitin,which are needed for TRAF 6 (TNF-associated factor- 6) or RIP 1 (receptor interactingprotein- 1) association followed by recruitment of A 20 deubiquitinase (DUB), resulting inNF- K B inhibition. TAX 1 BP 1 acts as an adaptor protein, facilitating the process of de-ubiquitination of target protein, resulting in the down regulation of the NF- K B pathway. ln order to acquire {{a better understanding of the}} molecular interaction between theubiquitin zinc finger binding (UBZ) domain and ubiquitin, TAX 1 BP 1 UBZ domaininteraction with mono-ubiquitin and different polyubiquitin chains were investigated inthis study. TAX 1 BP 1 UBZ domain showed remarkable difference in terms of bindingaffinities to monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains, as data reveals that there is asignificantly higher binding affinity to polyubiquitin (linear, lysine 63 and lysine 48 linked diubiquitin) chains over monoubiquitin. The crystal structure of the C-terminal UBZ domains of TAX 1 BP 1 in fusion with greenFluorescence Protein (GFP) was solved at 2. 8 Å resolution. The crystal structure showstwo tandem zinc fingers of the classical type C 2 H 2, owing to the zinc coordinatingatoms, both having a β-β-α fold. Other members of the same C 2 H 2 UBZ family areproposed to bind ubiquitin exclusively through the α-helix in a manner similar to theinverted ubiquitin-interacting motif (IUIM). Superposition of the α-helix of the UBZdomain of TAX 1 BP 1 to existing structural models indicates similar conformation of theubiquitin binding surface. However, through biochemical experiments, a model ofmonoubiquitin/diubiquitin UBZ domain complex is proposed, indicating a new mode ofinteraction between ubiquitin and UBZ domain of TAX 1 BP 1, giving an insight to themechanism of ubiquitin recognition by TAX 1 BP 1, and its function in the NF- K Bpathway. Ubiquitin can be assembled in chains; the topology and signaling characteristics of these chains vary depending on the type of the linkage, adding an extra level of complexity in signaling. "Linear" polyubiquitin chain is a type of polyubiquitin assembly found recently, where ubiquitin moieties are <b>threaded</b> <b>head</b> to tail, and not like the classical lysine linked polyubiquitin chains. Linear polyubiquitin plays an indispensible role in the NF- K B pathway. The crystal structure of linear diubiquitin was solved at 1. 9 Å resolution,giving a closer understanding of the mechanism of interactions. It is shown that linear diubiquitin can acquire more than one conformation in solution to meet the surface and chemical complementarities of the cognate domains, and also emphasizing the importance of the linker region, between the two ubiquitin moieties which plays a pivotal role in the process of specific recognition...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Calculation of {{a railway}} track on the {{strength}} {{is one of the}} sections of the overall complex research problems of interaction track and rolling stock. This paper describes the experimental study of horizontal transverse stiffness of railway rails with various strands of rail fasteners. Materials of this article should be relevant and will make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using the correct and corrected performance of horizontal transverse stiffness of rail threads. Methodology. Determination of horizontal transverse rigidity of rail yarns with different designs of rail fasteners was conducted by measuring the quantities of transverse displacement of rails calculation points – namely the head and sole. For research the specialist equipment was created, made up of lineside jack DC- 20, equipped with a hydraulic pressure gauge to measure pressure and rigid rod for horizontal rail stop in the thread, the opposite of the jack. Lateral movement of the head and sole of the track were recorded, and measured with indicators of clock type within a few hundredths of a millimeter. The horizontal lateral load on the rail jack was created by the injection pressure in the cylinder which was fixed with manometer into the jack. Load of rails was conducted over 2 tons of degrees ranging from 0 to 8 tons. To obtain reliable measurement results of lateral movement of the head and the base rails, its movement was conducted for each type fasteners not less than in 3 sections. Measurements were carried out without the creation of vertical load. Findings. With the developed method was found transverse displacement magnitude of rails calculation points at different designs of rail fasteners. Originality. The experimental studies were first found the mentioned horizontal transverse stiffness of rail <b>threads</b> in the <b>head</b> and sole of modern designs for different rail fasteners.
