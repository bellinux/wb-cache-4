In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> story they were watching.|$|E

25|$|In general, fMRI studies acquire both many {{functional}} {{images with}} fMRI and a structural image with MRI. The structural image is usually {{of a higher}} resolution and depends on a different signal, the T1 magnetic field decay after excitation.

Even when whole-brain analysis is done, to interpret the final results, that is <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> regions the active voxels fall in, one has to align the functional image to the structural one. This is done with a coregistration algorithm that works similar to the motion-correction one, except that here the resolutions are different, and the intensity values cannot be directly compared since the generating signal is different.|$|E

25|$|In California, the {{influence}} of Italian immigrants in {{the early history of}} the state's wine industry introduced Nebbiolo to the United States in the 19th century. As Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot increased in popularity in the 20th century, Nebbiolo (as well as other Italian grape varieties) steadily decreased in plantings. Today there are scattered plantings of Nebbiolo throughout the state with the majority located in the jug wine producing region of the Central Valley. As California wine producers aim for producing higher quality wines, there has been difficulties in locating ideally suited sites for Nebbiolo and the progress in producing world class California Nebbiolo is considerably behind that of other Italian varietals like Sangiovese, Primitivo and even Barbera and Dolcetto. In Washington State, Nebbiolo was first planted in the Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1985 with the first varietal release in 1987. As in California, Washington producers are still trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> sites are best suited to grow Nebbiolo. While the wine is mainly produced as a varietal, some producers make blends with Dolcetto and Syrah added in.|$|E

"The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> country the foreign exchange student should come from when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of a good name for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E

Assessment costs are the costs associated in obtaining and processing information. [...] There is a long understanding in the academic community that when transaction costs are high a liability rule will help substitute for bargaining. Judges, however, may have a difficult time in obtaining and processing information in order to assess damages. There are two ways to assess damages. An objective method uses the market price. The market price, however, can underestimate the truth of the matter. A subjective method of calculation is the alternative. Under the subjective method, the amount of damages is the minimum price the entitlement holder would accept in a bilateral exchange. Unfortunately, the objective method does not capture the correct amount of damages, and the subjective method would be difficult for a judge to implement ...|$|R

40|$|Much of the world's {{rapidly growing}} urban {{population}} relies upon water distribution systems to provide treated water through networks of pipes. Rather than continuously supplying water to users, {{many of these}} distribution systems operate intermittently, with parts of the network frequently losing pressure or emptying altogether. Such intermittent water supply deleteriously impacts water availability, infrastructure, and water quality for {{hundreds of millions of}} people around the world. In this work I introduce the problem of intermittent water supply through the lens of applied mathematics. I first introduce a simple descriptive mathematical model that captures some hydraulic features of intermittency not accounted for by existing water distribution system software packages. I then consider the potential uses of such a model in a variety of optimization examples motivated by real-world applications. In simple test networks, I show how to reduce pressure gradients while the network fills by changing either the inflow patterns or the elevation profile. I also show test examples of using measured data to potentially recover unknown information such as initial conditions or boundary outflows. I then use sensitivity analysis to better understand how various parameters control model output, with an eye <b>to</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> parameters are worth measuring most carefully in field applications, and also which parameters may be useful in an optimization setting. I lastly demonstrate some progress in descriptively modeling a real network, both through the introduced mathematical model and through a fluid-mechanics-based method for identifying data where the model is most useful...|$|R

30|$|One current {{limitation}} {{is that the}} whole image given to the program must have a similar crystal structure. For example, a perovskite heterostructure shown in Figs. 4, 5, and 6 works fine, due to the structures being sufficiently similar. A perovskite oxide film grown on Si would, however, not work. Similarly, {{if there are any}} amorphous parts in the image, local bright features could be identified as atomic positions by the peak finding function. One simple solution is to crop the images, so only the same crystal structure is within the image given to the program. This could probably be automated, which would allow for automatic determination of regions with different structures. For example, in an aluminum alloy, one would be able <b>to</b> automatically <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>which</b> regions are aluminum matrix and which are precipitates.|$|R

In this paper we explain why the IDD is fundamental in networks, allowing the discovery of applications that belong to layers other than the one the requested application is on. Moreover, there are two phases of the IDD function: first, finding the requested application and then, creating a DIF that supports the communication. We describe the actions taken in each phase.
