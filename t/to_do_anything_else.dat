25|$|Of the {{remaining}} {{five members of}} the fleet, one (Warrior) was destroyed by a broadside from USS Brooklyn. Resolute was run ashore and abandoned by her crew. Ten men from CSS McRae boarded her but were unable to get her off, so they burned her. General Breckinridge and General Lovell were abandoned and burned by their crews. Only Defiance escaped unharmed; she fled to New Orleans, where her crew left her and her captain turned her over to Commander Mitchell. Unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> Mitchell ordered her to be burned in the general destruction of Confederate property when the city fell.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{admitted}} cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting {{when he has}} to. Though he dodges danger {{as much as he}} can, {{and runs}} away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and he holds up long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides {{all the way to the}} Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.|$|E

5000|$|Reggie and Alf: Two Cockney {{insects that}} wander around bickering {{and looking for}} cricket matches.

60|$|I {{am afraid}} {{the whole of}} the ensuing week tried his patience. It was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry {{domestic}} dissipation. The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night. They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> St. John <b>did</b> not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.|$|R
25|$|Scouts are {{masters in}} the art of moving unseen. The scout’s primary weapons are two daggers, and {{he has the ability to}} become {{temporarily}} invisible and assassinate units instantly from behind with a sneak attack. As a secondary attack, he carries satchel bombs filled with blasting powder as a ranged attack. The scout can also block melee attacks. Finally, Mages serve as the magic class. A mage's primary attack is a bolt of lightning, which can be charged up for a more powerful attack that can also damage other enemies in close proximity to the target. He also wields a “firewall” attack, which creates an expanding circle of flames that will heavily damage if not kill enemies who are within the circle. For close range attacks, they have a shockwave attack, which knocks enemies back and allows the mage to finish them off with his staff. Mages can also heal allies. For defensive purposes, a mage can create a magical shield around himself to protect anyone inside from ranged attacks of any sort, provided the attacker is outside of the shield, which allows people to walk through. While the shield ability is active, the mage is unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> and is therefore highly vulnerable to melee attacks.|$|E
500|$|Though the Constitution was {{ambiguous}} as to {{the exact}} {{balance of power between}} national and state governments, Hamilton consistently took the side of greater federal power {{at the expense of the}} states. [...] As Secretary of the Treasury, he established—against the intense opposition of Secretary of State Jefferson—the country's first national bank. Hamilton justified the creation of this bank, and other increased federal powers, under Congress's constitutional powers to issue currency, to regulate interstate commerce, and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that would be [...] "necessary and proper" [...] to enact the provisions of the Constitution.|$|E
500|$|In Liber II: The Message of the Master Therion, the Law of Thelema is {{summarized}} succinctly as [...] "Do what thou wilt—then {{do nothing}} else." [...] Crowley describes {{the pursuit of}} Will as not only with detachment from possible results, but with tireless energy. [...] It is Nirvana but in a dynamic rather than static form. [...] The True Will is described as the individual's orbit, and if they seek <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> they will encounter obstacles, as doing {{anything other than the}} will is a hindrance to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And we can bite," [...] I said haughtily, though {{how we were}} <b>to</b> bite or <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> effectual {{with nothing}} but a Union Jack, I did {{not in the least}} know.|$|R

500|$|Kings {{and priests}} in the Old Testament were {{forbidden}} to partake of wine at various times. John the Baptist was a Nazarite from birth. Nazarite vows excluded not only wine, but also vinegar, grapes, and raisins. (Jesus evidently did not take such a vow during the three years of ministry depicted in the gospels, but in fact was even accused by the Pharisees of eating and drinking with sinners. St. Paul further instructs Christians regarding their duty toward immature Christians: [...] "It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that will cause your brother to fall." [...] Jewish priests cannot bless a congregation after consuming alcohol.|$|E
500|$|Spin {{magazine}} {{described the}} Pixies' musical style as [...] "Surf music-meets-Stooges spikiness and oft-imitated stop/start and quiet/loud dynamics". Their music {{has also been}} pictured as [...] "an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock, ... characterized by Black's bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Kim Deal's whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago's fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering's drums." [...] The band's music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts; Francis explained in 1991, [...] "Those are the two basic components of rock music... the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't know how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> We can play loud or quiet—that's it".|$|E
500|$|According to an {{anonymous}} {{veteran of the}} unit, it mostly comprised recently discharged servicemen from the French forces who were having trouble adapting to civilian life. [...] "They didn't know how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> only how to jump with a parachute and obey orders," [...] he explained, [...] "and they liked that kind of thing." [...] Others, he said, {{were members of the}} political far right who had joined up [...] "to kill commies and blacks", and some were criminals hoping to escape the attention of the French police. Each signed on for two years. The French-speaking unit was placed in the Rhodesia Regiment (RR) as an [...] "independent company". The RR already had six of these (made up of Rhodesians), so the Frenchmen became 7 Independent Company.|$|E
50|$|Galilee {{agrees to}} reveal how {{everything}} came about to Rachel. After encountering Holt and Nickleberry, Galilee traveled {{with them and}} was nearly killed by a mob, being saved by Nickleberry. The three of them arrive at L'Enfant but wear out their welcome. Holt kills himself while Galilee and Nickleberry depart. Galilee, feeling indebted to Nickleberry agrees to help make him rich. Nickleberry steals {{the identity of a}} dead soldier named Geary and with Galilee doing nefarious deeds for him becomes rich and powerful. He eventually marries a woman named Bedelia but is unable to satisfy her so Galilee assists. Galilee eventually runs away with Bedelia and she gives birth to Niolopua, but she eventually returns. On her death bed, years later, she makes the two of them agree that Galilee will always be there to comfort the Geary women at his house in Hawaii and he will no longer be bound <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> for the Gearys. Wanting to make Rachel immortal, Galilee brings her to L'Enfant where and they see Cesaria, who forgives Galilee. Maddox meanwhile, having finished his book leaves L'Enfant to see the world.|$|R

500|$|Justice Stevens, {{joined by}} Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist, concurring in part and dissenting in {{part in the}} judgment, found it {{unnecessary}} {{to determine whether a}} racial preference was ever allowed under the Constitution. [...] A narrow finding that the university had discriminated against Bakke, violating Title VI, was sufficient, and the court was correct to admit him. [...] "It is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an issue in this case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate." [...] According to Stevens, [...] "he meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from a federally funded program". He concluded, [...] "I concur in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirms the judgment of the Supreme Court of California. To the extent that it purports <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> I respectfully dissent." ...|$|E
500|$|Those with fitting names give differing {{accounts}} {{of the effect of}} their name on their career choices. Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding [...] "I'm absolutely convinced in my case it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." [...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force. Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms, was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said [...] "That had never occurred to me." [...] Church of England vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers {{had anything to do with}} him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases [...] "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".|$|E
500|$|Bleed Like Me {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 56, based on 18 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair rated the album a B+, complimenting the [...] "humongous hooks", and Kerrang! gave Bleed Like Me 4 out of 5, describing {{it as the}} [...] "most exciting, touching, and most painfully human material they’ve put out in years". Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke awarded the album {{three and a half}} stars out of five, writing that [...] "the first two-thirds of Bleed Like Me is easily the best sustained run of studio Garbage since the opening half of their 1995 debut", but that the final tracks had [...] "a samenessa feeling of roaring in circles". Sal Cinquemani of Slant also awarded it three and a half stars out of five; he praised the new sound and wrote that [...] "a few of the songs ("Run Baby Run" [...] and [...] "Right Between the Eyes" [...] in particular) have all the right ingredients but lack the venom present on the group's first two releases". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave Bleed Like Me three stars out of five, writing that the album was enjoyable if outdated in its musical approach [...] "as if the band doesn't quite know how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> but sound like it's the heyday of post-grunge alt-rock." [...] This opinion was shared by Yahoo! Music's Sharon O’Connell, who wrote that despite the intelligent songs with expertise in [...] "muscly, alt. rock lick or the bubblegum pop hook", Bleed Like Me [...] "strikes a depressingly dated note".|$|E
5000|$|Film4 {{called it}} a [...] "patchy drama which owes more to its {{gorgeous}} scenery and musical numbers than it <b>does</b> <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> [...] [...] [...] The plot doesn't convince, but Monroe, {{at the peak of}} her career, is more than easy on the eye [...] [...] [...] Despite some pretty locations and occasional tension, there's little going on. A shallow river indeed." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I don't {{even know}} her. The real reason I didn't {{want to make}} the picture is because, at long last, John Ford is getting ready to produce The Last Hurrah, the life of James Michael Curley, and I waited so long to get John and <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this story, which I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more than <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> So, I couldn't run the risk of {{starting}} one picture and losing John Ford." ...|$|R

2500|$|Chambers {{dreamed of}} having a career in {{mainstream}} films and believed her celebrity as the star of Behind the Green Door and the Ivory Snow girl would be a stepping stone to other endeavors. [...] "The paradox was that, {{as a result of}} Green Door, Hollywood blackballed me," [...] she said later. [...] " [...] became a very high-grossing film...But, to a lot of people, it was still a dirty movie; for me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> as an actress, was totally out of the question. I became known as a porno star, and that type of labeling really hurt me. It hurt my chances of doing anything else".|$|E
2500|$|Another topic he {{discussed}} during this interview was education. He expressed {{his belief that}} education is important and should be free for everyone. He mentioned that Cuba is able to provide free education for all those living in Cuba despite being a small country and that he doesn't understand how the United States being such a powerful nation {{was not able to}} do the same. He then expressed frustration at the fact that one can enroll in the armed forces in the United States and [...] "learn to kill" [...] for free, but had to pay to learn <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> He suggested that this is a sign that the United States is afraid of its future.|$|E
5000|$|That year, {{the trio}} {{went back on}} tour {{together}} which carried through the spring of 2009.

6000|$|Of old, the one duty of {{the painter}} had been to exhibit the virtues of this life, and hopes of the life to come. Holbein had to show the vices of this life, and to obscure {{the hope of the}} future. [...] "Yes, we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, and fear all evil, for Thou art not with us, and Thy rod and Thy staff comfort us not." [...] He does not choose this task. It is thrust upon him,--just as fatally as the burial of the dead is in a plague-struck city. These are the things he sees, and must speak. He will not become a better artist thereby; no drawing of supreme beauty, or {{beautiful}} things, will be possible to him. Yet we cannot say he ought <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> nor can we praise him specially in doing this. It is his fate; the fate of all the bravest in that day.|$|R
60|$|Marble had imbibed {{a sincere}} respect for my late guardian, equally {{from what he}} had heard me say in his favour {{and what he had}} seen himself, of his benevolent {{feelings}} kind-hearted morality, and excellent sense. Nevertheless, it was not an easy matter to teach a being like Marble the lesson that he was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> good <b>to</b> those who used him despitefully; and just at that moment he was in a frame of mind <b>to</b> <b>do</b> almost <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> sooner than pardon Van Tassel. All this I could see, understanding the man so well and, in order to prevent a useless discussion that might disturb my sister, I managed to change the discourse before it was too late; I say too late, because {{it is not easy to}} shake off two moralists who sustain their doctrines as strongly as Mr. Hardinge and my mate.|$|R
2500|$|All was {{not going}} well at this point. Mathieu said [...] "I was managed to such mimicry of my idol that I thought I was not able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> It was {{instantly}} {{one of the biggest}} disappointments of my life." [...] Stark then abandoned the Piaf direction he was taking her. The Olympia performance convinced a skeptical Paul Mauriat to work with Mireille, and songwriter André Pascal joined forces to develop her into a successful act. Together they wrote new modern material for her: Mon crédo, Viens dans ma rue, La première étoile and many other hit songs. Her first album En Direct de L'Olympia, on the Barclay label, was released in 1966. Highly acclaimed, along with the singles and EP's from it, the album made her a star outside France.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Hattie Collins, editor of RWD Magazine gave Our Version of Events a positive review stating, [...] "This is an album that deserves all the success it {{will no doubt}} receive." [...] BBC said that they expected the album to be very poppy as she has written for pop acts, Sugababes, Leona Lewis and Alesha Dixon. However, they pointed out that this does not arrive as they said; [...] "we do have a charming and occasionally moving record full of care and polish, effort and grace." [...] They {{also pointed out that}} the album reflects Stevie Wonder, Mary J. Blige and George Michael. Digital Spy said that the album gives off a passion, desire and an overcoming-the-odds messages in Our Version of Events. They said; [...] "it's hard to imagine Sandé was destined <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in life. Better yet, it sounds like she's only just got started." [...] The Boston Globe gave it a positive review.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch {{television}} provided {{coverage of}} the marriage and Irene's family were among those who watched the ceremonies, although fate conspired {{in the form of}} a power failure which made them unable to see the last part of the rite. The Dutch royal family gathered at the home of Prince Bernhard's mother, Princess Armgard, for the television coverage. Princess Armgard had also converted to Roman Catholicism like her granddaughter, but decided against attending the wedding. Irene and her mother spoke on the telephone before she left for the Basilica. Governmental fears that the attendance of the wedding by the Dutch royal family might be construed as becoming too close to the politics of Spain made it impossible for the family <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> [...] The Dutch government had also vetoed the possibility of the wedding being held in the Netherlands. While it is said that Pope Paul VI had been asked to officiate at the wedding and declined, he did send the couple his special blessing before the ceremony. He received the newlyweds at a private Vatican audience after their wedding. Because she had failed to obtain the approval of the States-General to marry, Irene lost her right of succession to the Dutch throne. She agreed that she would live outside of the Netherlands. In an effort to maintain there was no conflict between the royal family and the government, Queen Juliana invited Premier Marijnen to her birthday celebration at the palace the day after Irene's wedding.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the mind {{has been one of}} the major concerns of our philosophical tradition and it still is a dominant subject in modern philosophy as well as in science. Many philosophers in the scientific tradition want to solve the "puzzles of the mind". But many philosophers in the very same tradition do regard these puzzles as puzzles of the brain. So, whilst the former think of the mental as something of its own kind, the latter deny that philosophy of mind has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> but the brain. And then there are those who think that reduction is the way to go: maybe the mental is brain-dependent and hence reducible to the physical, in some way. This volume collects contributions comprising all those points of view, including articles by William Bechtel, Jerry Fodor, Jaegwon Kim, Joëlle Proust and Patrick Suppes...|$|R
60|$|That {{his very}} last day had come Grandfather Frog was sure. He didn't {{have the least}} doubt about it. Here {{he was at the}} mercy of Bowser the Hound out on the Green Meadows far from the dear, safe Smiling Pool. Every time he moved, Bowser flipped him over on his back and danced around him, barking with joy. Every minute Grandfather Frog {{expected}} to feel Bowser's terrible teeth, and he grew cold at the thought. When he found that he couldn't get away, he just lay still.

Rosamund, white to the lips, {{continued}} to look on, whilst Lionel, overcome, covered {{his face with his}} hands in sheer horror. One and all of them expected to see some ghastly deed of blood performed there, coldly and callously as the wringing of a capon's neck. But no such thing took place. The corsairs merely turned Sir John upon his face, dragged his wrists behind him to make them fast, and having performed that duty with a speedy, silent dexterity they abandoned him.|$|R
