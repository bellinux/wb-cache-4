30|$|A TA signal {{does not}} always mean taking actions; for instance, a buy signal for <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> {{which is in the}} {{portfolio}} does not necessarily imply increasing its share in the portfolio.

This is similar for a sell signal that recommends not keeping <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> and selling it completely. As a matter of fact, if the investor does not have <b>the</b> <b>stock,</b> a selling signal implies to do nothing. Hence, t uninterrupted buy (sell) signals tell the investor to (not to) have <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> in his/her portfolio for the t-day period.
