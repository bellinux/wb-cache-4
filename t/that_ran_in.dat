The first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those <b>that</b> <b>ran</b> <b>in</b> passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum brakes) still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised {{to become a part of}} British Railways.|$|E

The strip was extremely popular with Glaswegians and it merged the adventurous style of the silent era western movies with traditional Glasgow stage humour, particularly pantomime. The outrageous puns and surrealistic drawings have endured over time and now attract a cult following.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, many {{streetcar}} {{lines in}} Queens {{and the rest}} of the city began to be replaced by buses, particularly after the unification of city's three primary transit companies in June 1940. Many local civic organizations had been campaigning for a bus route along the Flushing–Jamaica Line, and the removal of the trolley route <b>that</b> <b>ran</b> <b>in</b> close proximity to private houses. The administration of Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia and Robert Moses also desired to use the right-of-way to build the planned Grand Central Parkway (this highway would instead be built along the western end of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park). The College Point trolley, meanwhile, was cited for noise disturbances.|$|E
25|$|The mobile army {{immediately}} started {{to invest the}} fortress. Work was begun on a line of field works <b>that</b> <b>ran</b> <b>in</b> front of the fortress, with its endpoints on the Sambre river, cutting the fortress off from overland access. Two batteries {{were placed on the}} main approaches to the town, and work on a second, countervailing, system of trenches was prepared. The Hereditary Prince made the chateau of Bousies his headquarters, and the Austrian auxiliaries (Hungarians, Serbs and Croats), destined to do the spadework for the entrenchments, built a camp in the forest of Mormal. After 20 April the preparations for the intended bombardment progressed slowly as the mobile army had to provide troops for the operations of the other Coalition forces that were needed to deflect French attempts at relief of the fortress (8,000 men on 22 April alone). Those attempts at relief were defeated by the Coalition in the Battles of Villers-en-Cauchies and Beaumont-en-Cambresis. Sorties by the garrison also hindered the preparations.|$|E
