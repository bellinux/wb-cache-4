5|$|The Volksdeutsche of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> were an {{important}} part of the economies of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories,</b> and by 1941, they were entirely in the thrall of the Nazi Party. Relations between the occupation authorities and the Volksdeutsche were strained by the killing of ethnic Germans during the invasion, to the extent that Adolf Hitler became aware of the issue. The Volksdeutsche were not active in the Hungarian military or civil administration, but were represented in the Hungarian Parliament, and from 1942 were permitted to conscript their members into the Wehrmacht. The official organisation of the Volksdeutsche in Hungary, the Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn (National League of Germans in Hungary), was essentially autonomous during the war, including within <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories.</b>|$|E

5|$|In March 1944, when Hungary {{realised}} {{that it was}} on {{the losing}} side in the war and began to negotiate with the Allies, Germany took control of the country, including the annexed territories, during Operation Margarethe I. This was followed by the collection and transport of the remaining Jews in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> to extermination camps, resulting in the deaths of 85 per cent of the Jews in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories.</b> Prior to their withdrawal from the Balkans {{in the face of the}} advance of the Soviet Red Army, the Germans evacuated 60,000–70,000 Volksdeutsche from Bačka and Baranja to Austria. Bačka and Baranja were restored to Yugoslav control when the Germans were pushed out of the region by the Red Army in late 1944. Međimurje and Prekmurje remained occupied until the last weeks of the war.|$|E

5|$|Commando raids {{were made}} by the Western Allies during much of the Second World War against the Atlantic Wall.

All the operations took place between the Arctic Circle in Norway to the French border with Spain, along what was known as the Atlantic Wall.|$|E
5|$|German {{citizens}} (despite much of {{the later}} denial) had access to information about what was happening, as soldiers returning from <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> would report on what they had seen and done.

5|$|There were 19 British Army Commandos {{formed in}} the United Kingdom and the Middle East. The No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando was formed from volunteers from <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> and enemy aliens. In February 1942 the Royal Marines were asked to organise {{commando}} units of their own; 6,000 men volunteered, forming nine commandos. In 1943 the Royal Naval Commandos and the Royal Air Force Commandos were formed from volunteers from the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories,</b> and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS knew what was going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to NSFK-Obergruppenführer, Neuhausen was {{initially}} appointed by Göring as plenipotentiary general for economic affairs (Generalbevollmächtigte für die Wirtschaft) in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, but his role soon expanded to encompass plenipotentiary {{responsibility for the}} Four Year Plan in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory.</b> On 9 December 1942, Neuhausen was also appointed to {{the important role of}} plenipotentiary for metal ore production in south-east Europe, which {{was initially}} limited to <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory</b> and <b>the</b> areas of Yugoslavia annexed by Bulgaria, and he was also empowered as plenipotentiary for labour in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory.</b> Soon after <b>the</b> military administration began, Neuhausen appointed commissioners through whom he controlled the Serbian National Bank and other key economic and financial enterprises. In March 1943 Neuhausen's responsibilities for metals ore production were extended to German-occupied Greece, and after the Italian surrender that September, to the previously Italian-occupied parts of Greece and Albania. In October 1943, the Germans simplified their military administration, and on 18 October 1943 his existing roles were combined with the key role of Chief of the Military Administration (Militärverwaltungschef). He remained the chairman of the Bor mining company, which in July 1943 brought in 6,200 Jewish forced labourers from Hungary and <b>territories</b> it had <b>occupied</b> to alleviate <b>the</b> shortage of manpower to work the mine. At the mines the labourers were {{under the supervision of the}} SS and worked in knee-deep water for 12-hour shifts. Neuhausen was also chair of the German banking corporation Bankverein für Serbien in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory,</b> as well as several other important companies. Economically, <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory</b> was very important to the Germans as a source of metals, minerals, coal and food. Neuhausen was a powerful figure who had complete control of the economy and state finances of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory,</b> and successfully exploited them to make a significant contribution to the German war effort.|$|R

5|$|From {{the time}} of the invasion, {{significant}} numbers of Belgian men had attempted to flee <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> to join the Belgian army on the Yser front, via the Netherlands which were neutral. In order to stop this, the Germans began work on a barbed wire and electric fence across the length of the border. The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In a third {{trial in}} early 1946, the National Court of Hungary in Budapest found Szombathelyi, Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, Deák, and Zöldi guilty of {{involvement}} in the massacres in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories,</b> and in carrying out the deportation of Jews to extermination camps. In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement, the Hungarian authorities then extradited them to Yugoslavia, where they underwent a fourth trial in Novi Sad in October 1946. They were all sentenced to death and executed the following month.|$|E

Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E

5|$|The Dominican Republic had {{its second}} war for {{independence}} in 1844, which {{was successful in}} obtaining independence from Haiti. Spain reannexed {{the country at the}} request of its then-dictator, Gen. Pedro Santana (who attempted to benefit personally from the event), in 1861. A third revolt, the War of Restoration, sought independence from the Spanish in 1863. Its leaders used Haiti as a guerrilla base, since the Haitian government feared a Spanish takeover and the restoration of slavery in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories,</b> and was thus sympathetic to their cause. Their stronghold, however, was the Cibao valley in the northeastern part of Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|The Jews of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> were {{subjected}} to forced labour by the Hungarian authorities, with about 4,000 Bačka and Baranja Jews being sent to hard labour camps within Hungary, 1,500 Bačka Jews being among the 10,000 Hungarian Jews sent to perform labour tasks for the Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front in September 1942, and about 600 Bačka Jews sent {{to work in the}} Bor copper mine in the German-occupied territory of Serbia in July 1943.

5|$|As {{part of this}} scheme, in 1283 Edward {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of new castles and walled towns across <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories,</b> in part to encourage substantial migration to the region from England. Amongst these were the future World Heritage sites of Caernarfon Castle and its walled town, overlooking the River Seiont; Conwy Castle and its walled town, controlling a crossing point over the River Conwy; and Harlech Castle, protecting a sea port and newly established English town. Plans were probably made to establish a castle and walled settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey – the future Beaumaris – but were postponed due to the costs of the other projects.|$|E
500|$|During May, {{the earlier}} {{proclamation}} of the German High Command {{was followed by}} orders issued by Förster, requiring the registration of printing presses and restrictions on the press within <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory.</b> Orders were also issued regarding the operation of theatres and other places of entertainment, and imposing German criminal law in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory.</b> Förster also ordered the resumption of production, disestablished the National Bank of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and established the Serbian National Bank to replace it. From the outset, the Aćimović government lacked any semblance of power. It was effectively a low-grade and basic instrument of the German military occupation regime, which performed administrative duties within <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory</b> {{on behalf of the}} Germans. The three main tasks of the Aćimović administration were to secure the acquiescence of the population to the German occupation, help restore services, and [...] "identify and remove undesirables from public services". It was capable of handling routine administrative tasks and maintaining law and order in a peacetime situation only, and was controlled by Turner and Neuhausen. Neuhausen was effectively an economic dictator, and had complete control over the economy of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory</b> and finances of the Commissioner Government, to one end – maximising the contribution they made to the German war effort.|$|R
40|$|The {{interplay between}} public and private actors in the {{exploitation}} of natural resources in an <b>occupied</b> <b>territory</b> makes <b>the</b> regime of state and individual responsibility particularly complex in cases of exploitation by private actors that result in a breach of international humanitarian law. <b>The</b> <b>Occupying</b> Power has <b>the</b> duty not to deplete the natural resources of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory</b> and, according to the case law of the International Court of Justice, it must also ensure that private actors do not exploit the natural resources of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory</b> in violation of international humanitarian law. This paper explores the legal basis of this duty of vigilance and the consequences of <b>the</b> <b>Occupying</b> Power’s responsibility for the acts of private actors...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the occupation troops directly commanded by Schröder, in June the Wehrmacht deployed {{the headquarters of the}} LXV Corps zbV to Belgrade to command four poorly-equipped occupation divisions, under the control of General der Artillerie Paul Bader. Three divisions were deployed in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory,</b> and <b>the</b> fourth was deployed in the adjacent parts of the NDH. The three divisions had been transported to <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory</b> between 7 and 24 May, and were initially tasked with guarding the key railway lines to Bulgaria and Greece. By late June, Bader's headquarters had been established in Belgrade, and the three divisions in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territory</b> were deployed with headquarters at Valjevo in the west, Topola roughly in the centre of the territory, and Niš in the south. The status of Bader's command was that Schröder could order him to undertake operations against rebels, but he could not otherwise act as Bader's superior.|$|R
5|$|Despite some protests, on 18 September 1773, the Committee {{formally}} {{signed the}} treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories.</b> The Sejm on 30 September 1773 accepted the partition treaty. By the first partition the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 211,000km² (30% of its territory, amounting {{at that time to}} about 733,000km²), with a population of over four to five million people (about a third of its population of 14 million before the partitions). The treaty was a major success for Frederick II of Prussia: Prussia's share might have been the smallest, but it was also significantly developed and strategically important. Russia received the largest, but economically least-important area, in the northeast.|$|E
5|$|The Committee {{also played}} an {{important}} political role. By providing an alternative supply of food, the CNSA prevented the German administration of Belgium {{from being able to}} use food as a bargaining tool to force Belgians to work in war industries and contributed to the passive resistance movement within occupied Belgium. However, the CNSA and CRB's activities meant that the Germans benefitted from having seven million Belgians and two million Frenchmen in their territory fed and consequently did not face major food riots or other disruption that might have arisen if the Germans had had to feed the population of <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories.</b> The Germans also exploited their deal agreeing to give impunity to CNSA food shipments by seizing food produced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} had passed anti-Semitic laws in 1939, {{and these were}} applied to the occupied and annexed territories. Initially the laws were applied selectively due to {{the transfer of the}} territories from military to civilian administration. Some Jews that had settled in <b>the</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>territories</b> were sent to the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were placed in the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade and subsequently killed. Others were expelled to the NDH where they met the same fate, but it is unknown how many deported Jews died in this way. After the violence of the initial occupation, no further massacres of Jews occurred during the remainder of 1941.|$|E
