When there is a delay or when the task is complex recall declines. In a study conducted to measure whether visual memory in older adults with age-related visual decline was caused by memory performance or visual functioning, the following were examined: relationships among age, visual activity, and visual and verbal memory in 89 community dwelling volunteers aged 60–87 years. The findings were {{that the effect of}} vision was not specific to visual memory. Therefore vision was found to be correlated with general memory function in older adults and is not modality specific.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a new technique}} for reducing the com-plexity of algorithms, such as those used in digital signal processing ~ using a genetic algorithm (GA). The method, referred to as expansive coding, is a representation methodology which makes complicated combinato-rim optimisation tasks easier to solve for a. GA. Using this technique, the representation, operators and fitness function used by the GA be-come more complicated, but the search space becomes less epistatic, and therefore easier for the GA to tackle. This reduction in epistasis (inter-action between parameters) is essential if the difficult <b>task</b> of <b>complexity</b> reduction is to be successfully achieved. Expansive coding spreads the <b>task's</b> <b>complexity</b> more evenly among the operators, fitness function and search space. We demonstrate how this technique {{can be applied to}} two cases of reduction of complexity of algorithms: a multiplier for quater-nion numbers, and a Walsh transform computation. We suggest why the technique is more successful on the former task than the latter. ...|$|R
