25|$|The Botswana Employment Act Cap 47:01 Chapter VII {{regulates the}} aspect of {{protection}} of wages in the contracts of employment. The minimum and maximum wage payment period {{with the exception of}} casual employees should not be less than one week or more than a month, and where not expressly stipulated a month is the default wage period per section 75 of the Act payable before the third working day after the wage period. The wages are to be paid during working hours at the place of employment, or in any other way, such as through a bank account with the consent of the employee. Salaries should be made in legal tender, however, part payment in kind is not prohibited provided it is appropriate for the personal use and benefit of employee and his family, and the value attributable to such payment in kind is fair and reasonable. The payment in kind should not exceed forty per cent of the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> <b>paid</b> out to the employee.|$|E
500|$|As {{defined in}} the {{proposed}} legislation, the tax rate is 23% for the first year. [...] This percentage {{is based on the}} <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> <b>paid</b> including the tax ($23 out of every $100 spent in total). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. sales tax ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total). The rate would automatically adjust annually based on federal receipts in the previous fiscal year. With the rebate taken into consideration, the FairTax would be progressive on consumption, but would also be regressive on income at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income). [...] Opponents argue this would accordingly decrease the tax burden on high-income earners and increase it on the middle class. Supporters contend that the plan would effectively tax wealth, increase purchasing power and decrease tax burdens by broadening the tax base.|$|E
