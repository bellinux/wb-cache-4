40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{identify}} a set of indicators for describing <b>the</b> online <b>reputation</b> of public actors. The method used was content analysis. Five indicators and a sixth constructed indicator (<b>the</b> online <b>reputation</b> score) were identified for a comprehensive description of <b>the</b> online <b>reputation.</b> <b>The</b> model was tested on a sample formed by <b>the</b> online <b>reputation</b> profiles (data obtained via Google search) of the elected Romanian members in the European Parliament. The results showed {{that two of the}} indicators, online control and online visibility, have no significant correlation (or a modest correlation, respectively) with <b>the</b> online <b>reputation</b> score. At <b>the</b> same time, an external variable, the level of trust of the associated group, exerts an influence to <b>the</b> online <b>reputation</b> score of <b>the</b> individual public actors. Thus, the present research opens new topics of discussion in studying <b>the</b> online <b>reputation...</b>|$|R

5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin.

Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has <b>the</b> <b>reputation</b> of being a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not received nearly {{as much attention as}} Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E
