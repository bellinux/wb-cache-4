5|$|Continuing Navy's {{drive from}} the {{previous}} quarter, Polanco and Eckel continued to run up the middle and {{the right side of}} New Mexico's defense for small gains. Polanco attempted two passes, the first of which was incomplete and the second to slotback Marco Nelson for a first down at the Midshipmen 44-yard line. After 12 plays and over six minutes of game time, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> reached midfield. After six more rushing plays from Polanco, Eckel, and slotback Eric Roberts, the team reached the Lobos' 28-yard line. Needing three yards to achieve a fourth down conversion, Navy coach Paul Johnson called a time-out. On the next play, Frank Divis threw his second halfback option pass of the day to Polanco, gaining six yards to keep <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> alive. Eckel, Divis, and Roberts rushed for six more plays before <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> came to a halt at the Lobos' 5-yard line. On the final play of <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> Midshipman kicker Geoff Blumenfeld kicked a 22-yard field goal to make the score 34–19 with 2:07 left in the game.|$|E

5|$|Needing {{to score}} quickly, Virginia Tech's {{subsequent}} drive consisted primarily of pass plays. Marcus Vick quarterbacked {{the first play}} of <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> but his pass fell incomplete and he was replaced by Bryan Randall on subsequent plays. Randall completed his first three passes of <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> for 46yards, pushing the Hokies into California territory. Kevin Jones picked up another first down on two rushes, then Randall completed a 28-yard pass to Chris Shreve for a touchdown that cut California's lead to 49–42. <b>The</b> <b>drive</b> took just two minutes off the clock, leaving 4:26remaining in the game. California received the post-touchdown kickoff and went three and out, leaving {{plenty of time for}} a potential game-tying Virginia Tech drive.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user data from a drive.

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} moderate deviations for the Durbin-Watson statistic associated with the stable first-order autoregressive process where <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> noise is also given by a first-order autoregressive process. We first establish a moderate deviation principle for both the least squares estimator of the unknown parameter of the autoregressive process as well as for the serial correlation estimator associated with <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> noise. It enables us to provide a moderate deviation principle for the Durbin-Watson statistic in the easy case where <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> noise is normally distributed and in the more general case where <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> noise satisfies a less restrictive Chen-Ledoux type condition...|$|R

5|$|After {{the first}} quarter ended in a {{scoreless}} tie, Georgia scored their first touchdown {{early in the second}} quarter. The 19-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Murray to Jay Rome was set up by a fake punt earlier in <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> that gave the Bulldogs a 7–0 lead. After each team again traded punts, Alabama drove the ball to the Bulldogs' one-yard line. However, Eddie Lacy fumbled on second down and then McCarron threw an interception in the endzone to Sanders Commings to end <b>the</b> <b>drive.</b> The Crimson Tide forced another punt on the next Bulldogs possession and Alabama responded on <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> that ensued with their first touchdown of the game on a 41-yard Lacy run that tied the game 7–7. On the next drive, Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix intercepted a Murray pass and returned it to the Georgia 47-yard line with just over 1:00 left in the half. Five plays later, Jeremy Shelley connected on a 22-yard field goal as time expired and gave the Crimson Tide a 10–7 halftime lead.|$|E
5|$|After {{the opening}} kickoff, Michigan drove 80 {{yards for a}} {{touchdown}} on a 2-yard run by quarterback Denard Robinson. On its second possession, Michigan drove the ball 88 yards and took a 14–0 lead on a 47-yard run by Robinson. Michigan began its third possession at its own 9-yard line. Robinson ran 46 yards on the first play of <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> but he injured his knee and did not return to the game. Devin Gardner substituted for Robinson and concluded <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Jeremy Gallon. Michigan led 21–0 {{at the end of the}} first quarter, but Bowling Green scored 14 unanswered points in the second quarter on a 1-yard run by Jordan Hopgood and a 71-yard reception by Tyrone Pronty. With Michigan's lead cut to 7 points, Tate Forcier entered the game late in the second quarter. Forcier completed all 6 of his passes in leading the team on 69-yard touchdown drive to give Michigan a 28–14 lead at halftime.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} coin toss, Alabama elected {{to receive the}} ball to open the first half. Marquis Maze fielded the James Hairston kickoff and {{returned}} it to the Alabama 30-yard line where the offense began its first series. Alabama opened {{with a pair of}} gains by Trent Richardson on an 18-yard run and on a 22-yard pass reception from AJ McCarron to reach the LSU 30-yard line. However, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> stalled on the next three plays, and on fourth down Cade Foster missed a 44-yard field goal wide right and the game remained tied at zero. The Tigers began their first offensive series with Jarrett Lee at quarterback from their own 27-yard line. After LSU gained a pair of first downs on runs by Spencer Ware and short passes from Lee, <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> faltered, and Brad Wing punted the ball out-of-bounds at the Alabama five.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} Kibble-Zurek scaling {{describes the}} scaling behavior in <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> dynamics across a single critical region. In this paper, we study <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> dynamics across an overlapping critical region, {{in which a}} critical region (Region-A) is overlaid by another critical region (Region-B). We develop a hybridized Kibble-Zurek scaling (HKZS) to characterize the scaling behavior in <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> process. According to <b>the</b> HKZS, <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> dynamics in <b>the</b> overlapping region can be described by the critical theories for both Region-A and Region-B simultaneously. This results in a constraint on the scaling function in the overlapping critical region. We take the quantum Ising chain in an imaginary longitudinal-field as an example. In this model, the critical region of the Yang-Lee edge singularity and the critical region of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition point overlap with each other. We numerically confirm the HKZS by simulating <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> dynamics in this overlapping region. The HKZSs in other models are also discussed.

5|$|As {{the fifth}} book begins, the setting shifts briefly to North America. Following the Ural War, the Japanese had led an Asian {{occupation}} of western North America. The local populations, inspired by Native American beliefs and mythologies, react by leaving the cities for the wilderness and destroying the food factories and cities, eventually driving out the Asian occupation. In America and then globally people begin leaving cities {{in favor of}} the wild. Shamanism and the belief in ghosts reemerge amongst the populace, as does an oral tradition of story-telling. The draining of the cities grows into a settler movement: egalitarian communities that live in nature, characterized by gender equality and sexual liberation. In response to the threat this movement poses to the ruling Senates, political leaders in London hatch a plan to colonize Greenland, thereby channeling both <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> for technological innovation and <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> to settle new land.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Tennessee {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. After a short return, Tennessee's offense started the half from its 30-yard line. Crompton completed passes of 11 and 8 yards, then Virginia Tech's defense halted the Tennessee advance and forced a punt. Virginia Tech's offense began its first drive {{of the second half}} at its 26-yard line, with 13:02 remaining in the quarter. From the 26, Tech began an eight-play drive that saw Ryan Williams carry the ball on seven consecutive plays. Only the final play of <b>the</b> <b>drive,</b> a one-yard touchdown run by Tyrod Taylor, didn't feature the Tech running back. Williams opened <b>the</b> <b>drive</b> with a 21-yard sprint and had a 32-yard run during the possession that ended with Taylor's touchdown at the 8:42 mark in the quarter. The touchdown and extra point extended Tech's lead to 24-14.|$|E
