5|$|The synagogue's {{fortunes}} {{improved in}} the 1940s, but in 1946, its bank threatened to foreclose on its buildings, {{in anticipation of}} their sale to the local Catholic diocese, as the congregation had not paid the mortgage in many years. The congregation succeeded in convincing <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> re-negotiate its mortgage, and reduce the outstanding loan, and Max Koeppel led a drive to pay it off completely.|$|E
5|$|A loyal clubman, Trumble {{served on}} the {{committee}} of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) from 1900–01 to 1910–11 and was made a life member in 1904. In 1911 he resigned from <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> become MCC club secretary; a position he held for 27years until his death. In this role, he played a leading part in reconciling the club and the Victorian Cricket Association {{after a period of}} some friction between the two bodies. He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including Bert Ironmonger, whom Trumble saw play on a visit to Queensland. During his term as secretary, the Melbourne Cricket Ground was expanded to a capacity of over 70,000spectators.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> the north of the ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests {{that the purpose of the}} earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E

Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, has speculated that the more powerful of the family may {{have chosen not to}} use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, and they may have considered him an embarrassment, not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to its losses, UBS announced a CHF 15billion rights offering {{to raise the}} additional funds need to shore up its depleted reserves of capital. UBS cut its dividend {{in order to protect}} its traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio, seen by investors as a key to its credibility as the world's largest wealth management company. Marcel Ospel, who had been the architect of the merger that created UBS in 1998, also announced that he would step down as a chairman of <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> be replaced by Peter Kurer, the bank's general counsel with virtually no banking experience.

An intentionally cramped and crowded composition, it shows a huge {{group of people in}} various states of undress, gathering on <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> watch the ship's arrival. Although not universally admired in the press, the painting was an immediate success, making Etty famous almost overnight. Buoyed by its reception, Etty devoted much of the next decade to creating further history paintings containing nude figures, becoming renowned for his combination of nudity and moral messages.|$|E

5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1894 season, MacLaren {{resigned}} from <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> play a whole season of cricket. Lancashire {{at the time}} were undergoing a period of transition, and the captaincy was unsettled: three men captained the county {{in the first part of}} the season. In the absence of other amateurs with county experience who could play regularly, MacLaren was appointed captain. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack observed that MacLaren was young for the position, and largely unproven in cricket, but it supported the decision. After losing his first match in charge, the team improved in the latter part of the season to finish fourth in the Championship. MacLaren finished sixth in the Lancashire averages, and in total scored 1,105 runs at 25.69, but his batting had made little progress since his debut. However, his successful leadership of Lancashire led some press critics to suggest him as a future England captain. At the end of the season, he was a last-minute selection to tour Australia with a team led by Andrew Stoddart.|$|E

Olivia finds the bank that Joshua has targeted and discovers his device in a subway tunnel, but he knocks her out before she can investigate further. As he energizes the molecular destabilizer, Fringe Division detects the event and converges on the bank. Matthew eventually finds Joshua, again trying to warn him off, but quickly realizes Joshua has purposely entered <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> be trapped in the amber.

5|$|Deregulation in the 1980s, {{culminating}} in the Big Bang in 1986, also encouraged <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> enter the securities business. County Bank, its merchant banking subsidiary formed in 1965, acquired various stockbroking and jobbing firms to create the investment banking arm County NatWest. National Westminster Home Loans was established in 1980 and other initiatives included {{the launch of the}} Piggy Account for children in 1983, the Credit Zone, a flexible overdraft facility on which customers only pay interest (now commonplace, this so-called pink debt was innovative when launched) and the development of the Mondex electronic purse (later sold to MasterCard Worldwide) in 1990. The Action Bank advertising campaign spearheaded a new marketing-led approach to business development. Under the direction of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, later Lord Kingsdown, who became chairman in 1977, the bank also expanded internationally, forming National Westminster Bancorp in the United States of America with a network of 340 branches across two states, National Westminster Bank of Canada and NatWest Australia Bank; and opening branches on the European continent and in the Far East. In 1982, the Frankfurt office of International Westminster Bank merged with Global Bank AG to form Deutsche Westminster Bank. In 1985, Banco NatWest España was formed and National Westminster Bank SA was incorporated in 1988, taking over the bank's six branches in France and Monaco. In 1989, International Westminster Bank was merged into National Westminster Bank by Act of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Structurally, National Westminster Bank was {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group until January 2003, when {{ownership of the}} bank's entire issued ordinary share capital was transferred to The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, as holding company.

At that time the entire issued share capital of Lombard North Central Plc was transferred by <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> the holding company. Ownership of National Westminster Home Loans Limited was passed to the holding company in December 2005; the mortgage portfolio and related funding were transferred back to NatWest in October 2012.

5|$|The French, German and Hungarian co-production of {{the film}} was fraught with {{difficulty}} and obstacles.

As the original financing of the film collapsed, the remaining producers managed to secure stop-gap funding which allowed them to shoot nine days of footage on the expensive Corsican sets, until they were shut down through legal action by the local subcontractor. After many expressions of support from European film organisations, production companies and government bodies, a new co-production contract was signed in July 2005 with a revised budget and shooting schedule. It then emerged that all rights to the film had been ceded to a French bank under the original production agreement, and only after further changes in the film's backers was a deal struck with <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> allow shooting to resume in March 2006, over a year later than had been originally envisaged.|$|E
