5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E

5|$|The {{computational}} {{efficiency of}} Euclid's algorithm {{has been studied}} thoroughly. This efficiency can be described {{by the number of}} division steps the algorithm requires, multiplied by the computational expense of each step. The first known analysis of Euclid's algorithm is due to A. A. L. Reynaud in 1811, who showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> division steps on input (u, v) is bounded by v; later he improved this to v/2 +2. Later, in 1841, P. J. E. Finck showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> division steps is at most 2log2v+1, and hence Euclid's algorithm runs in time polynomial {{in the size of the}} input. Émile Léger, in 1837, studied the worst case, which is when the inputs are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Finck's analysis was refined by Gabriel Lamé in 1844, who showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> steps required for completion is never more than five times the number h of base-10 digits of the smaller numberb.|$|E
