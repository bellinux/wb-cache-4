5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most {{able to do this}} of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E
25|$|Defensive midfielders {{are central}} midfield players that {{focus more on}} defence than attack. They need {{strength}} to make strong tackles and <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> stamina and some degree of passing skill as they need to support other midfielders.|$|E
25|$|Golden Retrievers require regular {{grooming}} {{and occasional}} baths. Their coats shed somewhat during the year, but {{are known to}} shed profusely twice a year. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to have their ears cleaned regularly, or ear infections might occur. While shedding is unavoidable, frequent grooming (daily to weekly) lessens the amount of hair shed by the animal. Severe shedding resulting in bald patches can be indicative of stress or sickness.|$|E
50|$|To {{prepare for}} the experiment, the {{researchers}} procured and installed a 2.25 MW generator and connected it to the substation. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> access to a programmable digital relay or another device that controls the breaker. That access could have been through a mechanical or digital interface.|$|R
50|$|Before this match Bahrain {{needed to}} score nine goals {{in order to}} pass Qatar and {{to move on to}} the next round in qualifying. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> Qatar to lose their next match against Iran but due to an 83rd-minute {{equalizer}} the game finished 2-2 and thus Qatar progressed instead of Bahrain.|$|R
50|$|This {{large number}} of people needed places to stay. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> false {{identity}} papers and food coupons. Food, clothes, and many other things had been placed under a tight distribution system. Special fighting squads would attack the distribution offices, in order to steal those food coupons. All tis required tight organisation.|$|R
25|$|In general, it is {{the psychosocial}} model rather than, or in {{addition}} to, the dominant medical model, that is the underlying rationale for mental health social work. This may include a focus on social causation, labeling, critical theory and social constructivism. Many argue social workers {{need to work with}} medical and health colleagues to provide an effective service but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to be at the forefront of processes that include and empower service users.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{form the}} base of the food chain, and need {{sunlight}} and nutrients to grow. In the ocean, these plants are mainly microscopic phytoplankton which drift in the water column. They need sunlight for photosynthesis, which powers carbon fixation, so they are found only relatively near the surface. But <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> nutrients. Phytoplankton rapidly use nutrients in the surface waters, and in the tropics, these nutrients are not usually replaced because of the thermocline.|$|E
25|$|Counter attackers are any attacking {{player that}} uses their pace to beat {{defenders}} and cause unexpected scoring opportunities at any time. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> {{some degree of}} shooting skill. Counter attacking opportunities occur when the opposition are themselves attacking a team with most of their players forward. A counterattack happens when the ball is won back and is quickly played into space for a counterattacking player to run onto or where a player takes the ball themselves and runs with pace into a sparsely defended opposition half.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{international}} duties in 2009, the Malaysia national U-21 team {{was needed to}} participate in the 2010 AFC U-19 Championship qualification. But <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> {{to participate in the}} Premier League Malaysia and the Malaysia FA Cup 2009. This cause a major schedule conflict that posed a great problem for the Football Association of Malaysia.|$|R
25|$|Berthold Kepplinger, head of {{the clinic}} where Elisabeth and her {{children}} were being treated, said that Elisabeth and the three children held captive in the cellar required further therapy to help them adjust to the light after years in semi-darkness. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> treatment to help them cope with all the extra space that they now had in which to move about.|$|R
50|$|Throughout history, the Kuchi {{people needed}} their dogs to be {{extremely}} vigilant in guarding their livestock and belongings. They trusted their dogs to safeguard their camps and caravans on their seasonal journeys. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> their dogs {{to be extremely}} tough, {{not only in the}} face of danger, but also for braving the rough environmental conditions that required incredible ability to adapt.|$|R
25|$|How can we {{solve these}} problems? How {{can we make}} sure that {{both males and females}} in Ivory Coast have the same level of education? First of all, we can make sure that the parents of these {{children}} keep them in school until their preferred level (college, university, etc.). <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to teach/lead the mindsets of the children about how education is important and how child labor should not be their only main focus, but education should be too. More people should do this, while still focusing on their finances.|$|E
25|$|Defensive midfielders require good {{positional}} sense, work rate, tackling ability, and anticipation (of {{player and}} ball movement) to excel. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to possess good passing skills and close control {{to hold the}} ball in midfield under sustained pressure. Most importantly, defensive midfielders require great stamina as they are the outfield players who cover the greatest distance during a professional match. In top football clubs, a midfielder may cover up to 12 kilometres for a full 90-minute game. Deep-lying playmakers typically require a good first touch under opposition pressure {{and the ability to}} play long crossfield passes to attacking players further upfield.|$|E
25|$|B. petiolata eat solid food {{as well as}} drink nectar as a food source. They prey on grubs {{and other}} small insects. Often they chew the food and regurgitate it back up to feed others and the young brood. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> water to survive. Queens always receive more food. They get 43.7% of liquid loads and 47.8% of solid food loads. They only fed 63.3% of this solid food to larvae and kept the rest for themselves. A lapse in solid food can cause a colony to decline. In late summer, {{there is often a}} {{reduction}} in the amount of available prey, so many wasps switch to just foraging for nectar, using this as its primary food source. Poor rainfall is often the cause for a decrease in prey abundance. Wasps are fed and enjoy mealworms when they are in captivity.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Stevens and six-year-old Margie {{were in a}} less forlorn {{condition}} as to garments; but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> a new outfit sadly, and nearly every day young Dick told them confidentially that he would attend to the matter immediately after arriving at Willow Point, even if it became necessary for him to sell his rifle, the only article of value he owned.|$|R
50|$|On 19 October 2007 FAM {{decided to}} include Malaysia U-21 {{as one of}} the team in Malaysia Premier League 2007-08 and will be known as Harimau Muda (Young Tigers). Due to {{international}} duties, The Malaysia national U-21 team were needed to participate in the 2010 AFC U-19 Championship qualification. But <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to participate in the Premier League Malaysia and the Malaysia FA Cup 2009.|$|R
5000|$|The {{government}} then {{announced that}} the formal negotiations with the FARC would begin on July 7. But a day before, both parties postponed the peace talks until July 19 alleging that three of FARC's negotiatiors could not arrive on time to the meeting, the FARC argued that <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> more time to organize their positions regarding the International Commission, as agreed between [...] "Tirofijo" [...] and President Pastrana.http://www.elmundo.es/1999/07/19/internacional/19N0081.html ...|$|R
25|$|Simulated {{patients}} are often {{recruited from the}} local amateur and professional acting community, through advertisements in local newspapers, or by word of mouth. Actual patients who take an active and self-taught role in their own healthcare may also be recruited. Graduate students in nearby universities may also agree to take up these roles. Patients and medical students working as a SP can be paid upwards of $100/hour for their services. SPs need to draw on their own personal experiences with physicians, conversations with healthcare professionals, talking to specific patient populations etc. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to be trained to accurately and reliably simulate particular clinical scenarios. Frequent quality assessment {{may be needed to}} ensure consistency in the portrayal of the patient role; especially since SPs may absorb a significant amount of clinical knowledge from their interactions with healthcare professionals.|$|E
25|$|The group {{decides to}} {{fight their way}} to the local marina, and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan. They begin {{reinforcing}} two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape. However, <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to pick up Andy, who is starving. They strap food and a walkie-talkie onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips gets into Andy's store safely but a zombie follows through the dog door, ultimately biting Andy. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers and kill Andy, rescuing Nicole. They grab ammunition {{and go back to the}} mall. Along the way, Tucker breaks his legs and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} major {{divergent}} paths in the game's ending, {{depending on how}} the player resolves encounters with monsters: the Neutral run, the Pacifist run, and the Genocide run. The default Neutral run occurs if the player has killed some but not all of the monsters, or has not killed any monsters. The Neutral run has over twelve variations depending on which monsters were killed. In general, in the Neutral run ending, the human arrives at Asgore's castle and learns that <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> a monster's soul to cross the barrier, forcing them to fight Asgore. Sans stops the human before their confrontation, revealing that the human's [...] "LOVE" [...] is an acronym for [...] "Level Of ViolencE" [...] and [...] "EXP" [...] for [...] "EXecution Points." [...] Sans judges the human based on the combined resolution of the encounters. The human fights and defeats Asgore. However, Flowey sneaks in, kills Asgore, steals the human souls, and becomes a monstrous abomination. By calling out to the six souls for help, the human defeats Flowey, falls unconscious, and awakens on the human side of the barrier; they receive a phone call from Sans, explaining the state of the Underground after the human's departure.|$|E
50|$|Characters {{can also}} grab opponents, climb walls, or pick and throw items. <b>They</b> may <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to destroy objects to clear {{alternative}} paths through an area.|$|R
50|$|Entering {{the final}} game of the season at 7-10 against the Ottawa Redblacks, the Argos needed to win to keep their playoff hopes alive, which <b>they</b> did. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> Hamilton to lose to Montreal for the Argos to finish second and make the playoffs ahead of the {{crossover}} team, the BC Lions. However, the Ti-Cats won that game, eliminating the Argos from the playoffs {{on the last day of}} the regular season.|$|R
50|$|The {{campsite}} opened from 1pm on Thursday the 5th of July. From 6pm {{the campers}} could attend the Wakestock pre-party {{if they had}} purchased a Thursday night arena pass for £10. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to be {{in possession of a}} weekend camping, single day camping or vip weekend camping ticket. Nitro hosted the Thursday night pre-party with DJ’s Jaguar Skills, Nitro resident Jigsaw and Plastic Thumbs in the East Arena, doors opened from 6pm-12am.|$|R
2500|$|Sustainable {{sanitation}}is a sanitation {{system designed}} to succeed on a continuing basis. The Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) definition includes five criteria. Systems need to be economically and socially acceptable. [...] <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to be technically and institutionally appropriate and protect the environment and natural resources.|$|E
2500|$|The pyramid {{itself is}} cleaned by special {{maintenance}} personnel who abseil {{from the light}} beacon opening {{at the very top}} of the roof. [...] Not only do they have to deal with the height, as well as the winds that interfere with their ropes, but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to inspect the steel roof.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{full-size}} sawmill, the blades are mounted on wheels with a diameter large {{enough not to}} cause metal fatigue due to flexing when the blade repeatedly changes from a circular to a straight profile. It is stretched very tight (with fatigue strength of the saw metal being the limiting factor). Bandsaws of this size {{need to have a}} deformation worked into them that counteracts the forces and heating of operation. [...] This is called [...] "benching". <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to be removed and serviced at regular intervals. Sawfilers or sawdoctors are the craftsmen responsible for this work.|$|E
5000|$|At the National Astronomical Observatory, {{teams had}} to memorise the astrological {{signs of the}} Zodiac. Once {{they think they have}} {{memorised}} the symbols, they may proceed to the observatory were they would need to match the symbols with the name of the Zodiac to receive their next clue. For Vinh & Terje's Handicap, they not only had to memorise the symbols but <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> to know the names and their correct sequencing.|$|R
50|$|Several minor rule changes {{took effect}} during the 2013 season. These changes were {{approved}} by MLB owners; unless otherwise noted, <b>they</b> will <b>also</b> <b>need</b> {{the approval of the}} players' union.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1920s, the Polish Armed Forces {{felt that}} <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> a new tank model. The Military Institute of Engineering Research (Wojskowy Instytut Badań Inżynierii, WIBI) sent Captain Ruciński to the United States to legally acquire a Christie M1928 tank, its {{blueprint}} and license. The tank was {{to be used as a}} base for a new Polish light tank. The Poles however never received the machine and Christie fearing legal charges, refunded the purchase.|$|R
2500|$|Their central {{position}} {{enables them}} to have an all-round view of the match. [...] Since most of the action takes place in and around their area of the pitch, midfielders often exert the greatest degree of control over how a match is played. It is often said that a match is won or lost in midfield, meaning that whichever team dominates the middle area of the pitch is able to dictate the game. A central midfielder {{is expected to have}} good vision, be adept at long and short passing and have great stamina because of the ground they cover in a game. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to be good at tackling to win the ball back.|$|E
2500|$|Touring {{sound systems}} {{have to be}} {{powerful}} and versatile enough to cover many different halls and venues, and they are available many different sizes and shapes. Touring systems range from mid-sized systems for bands playing nightclub and other mid-sized venues to large systems for groups playing stadiums, arenas and outdoor festivals. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to use [...] "field-replaceable" [...] components such as speakers, horns, and fuses, which are easily accessible for repairs during a tour. Tour sound systems are often designed with substantial redundancy features, {{so that in the}} event of equipment failure or amplifier overheating, the system will continue to function. [...] Touring systems for bands performing for crowds of a few thousand people and up are typically set up and operated by a team of technicians and engineers who travel with the performers to every show.|$|E
2500|$|Heinz Kohut thought {{similarly}} to Freud's idea of transference. He used narcissism {{as a model}} of how people develop their sense of self. Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of one self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one's low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut {{had a significant impact on}} the field by extending Freud's theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally [...] "sink into" [...] and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> to have their self-worth mirrored by these people. These experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self.|$|E
50|$|The Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) is {{a device}} {{designed}} to grow three-dimensional cell clusters in microgravity. In the early 1990s, NASA researchers began developing hardware {{that would let}} them study the cell tissues of mammals—including humans—in microgravity. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> it to protect the fragile cultures from the turbulence of Space Shuttle launch and landing. The resulting device enables the growth of tissue, cancer tumors and virus cultures outside the body, both in space and on Earth.|$|R
50|$|Spacecraft {{are often}} {{protected}} from temperature fluctuations with insulation. Some spacecraft use mirrors and sunshades for additional protection from solar heating. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> often <b>need</b> shielding from micrometeoroids and orbital debris.|$|R
