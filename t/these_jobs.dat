5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although <b>these</b> <b>jobs</b> may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. <b>These</b> <b>jobs</b> were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E

Certain abilities learned under one class may be equipped and used by other classes. The Job System (a post-launch addition) builds upon the Armoury System for Disciples of War and Magic. In exchange for restricting the range of equippable abilities from other classes, players gain access to powerful skills, magic, weapons, and armor exclusive to the Job corresponding to that class. <b>These</b> <b>Jobs,</b> based on classic Final Fantasy character jobs, are more suited to party-based combat.|$|E

We first model this decision and predict complementarity between <b>these</b> <b>job</b> attributes: multitasking, discretion, skills, and interdependence of tasks. We argue that characteristics of the firm and industry (e. g., product and technology, organizational change) can explain observed patterns and trends in job design. We then use novel data on <b>these</b> <b>job</b> attributes to examine these issues. As predicted, job designs tend to be ?coherent? across these characteristics within the same job. Job designs also tend to follow similar patterns across jobs in the same firm, and especially in the same establishment: when one job is optimized ex ante, others {{are more likely to be}} also. There is some evidence that firms may segregate different types of job designs across different establishments...|$|R

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{reforms to}} the UK's main active labour market {{policy for the}} {{long-term}} unemployed aged over 25 : the so-called New Deal 25 Plus.

It is argued that <b>these</b> <b>job</b> seekers face a combination of personal and circumstantial barriers to work, best characterised as an "employability gap". It is acknowledged that following recent reforms to the New Deal 25 Plus, the programme is better equipped to address some aspects of the employability gap faced by many long-term unemployed people. However, it is argued that a stronger commitment to training within a "real work" environment and a more flexible approach to the administration of some social security benefits is required if the long-term detachment from the labour market experienced by <b>these</b> <b>job</b> seekers is to be overcome...|$|R
