5|$|Following the club's 4–0 home defeat, United {{returned}} to Open Cup play, where they took on New England Revolution in the MLS qualification semifinals. Hosted at Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds, the Revolution quickly {{got off to}} a 2–0 lead, thanks to a pair of goals from Revolution midfielder Kheli Dube. Dube scored in 37th and 47th minutes of play. Twenty minutes following Dube's second goal, Virginia-native Alan Koger gave the Revs a 3–0 lead. Shortly thereafter, United's Branko Bošković scored his first two goals of 2011 <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> lead down to one goal. The late rally, however, proved to be too little, too late as the Revolution defeated United 3–2. Consequently, {{it was the first time}} since 2002 that United did not qualify into the main tournament propers of the Open Cup.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{disbanding}} of The Revolution, Prince {{was working}} on two separate projects, The Revolution album Dream Factory and a solo effort, Camille. Unlike the three previous band albums, Dream Factory included input from the band members and featured songs with lead vocals by Wendy & Lisa. The Camille project saw Prince create a new androgynous persona primarily singing in a sped-up, female-sounding voice. With the dismissal of The Revolution, Prince consolidated material from both shelved albums, along with some new songs, into a three-LP album to be titled Crystal Ball. Warner Bros. forced Prince <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> triple album to a double album, and Sign o' the Times was released on March 31, 1987.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a change}} of {{government}} in October 1993, the incoming Liberal Party ordered the immediate cancellation of the order, forcing the payment of C$500 million of cancellation fees. By not purchasing the helicopters and slashing the DND budget, the government aimed <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> deficit and be more fiscally responsible. As a negative, the Liberal government left itself with little maneuvering room as the Sea King fleet continued to age and its systems become obsolete; a replacement was needed but no alternative or contingency plan had been made. Some commentators observed that cancelling the NSA contract was not a fiscally responsible move. During one debate, Chrétien famously retorted that the President of the United States still flew in a Sea King, thus the helicopter was also good enough for Canada.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage IV {{is powered}} by two SNECMA Atar turbojets, fed by two air intakes {{on either side of}} the {{fuselage}} that had intake half-cone shock diffusers, known as souris ("mice"), which were moved forward as speed increased <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> inlet for the shock wave angle. It can reach high supersonic speeds: the aircraft is redlined at Mach 2.2 at altitude because of airframe temperature restrictions, although it is capable of higher speeds. While broadly similar to the model used on the Mirage III, the Atar engine had a greater airflow and an elevated overspeed limit from 8,400 rpm to 8700 rpm for greater thrust during high altitude supersonic flight. While the first Mirage IV prototype was fitted with double-eyelid engine nozzles, production aircraft featured a complicated variable geometry nozzle that automatically varied in response to the descent rate and airspeed.|$|E

25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle {{is part of a}} head mounted {{to the end of the}} robot arm. The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place. The robotic router trimming process then follows a programmed path for router cutting to create a part from a blank or more commonly- <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> flashing from a molded part to complete the finishing process that in the past, was a manual process.|$|E
25|$|Louisville {{jumped out}} to a 28–7 lead in the third quarter, behind two {{touchdown}} passes by Heisman-candidate Teddy Bridgewater. Late in the third quarter, however, UCF staged a rally that ties the greatest comeback in school history (21). Storm Johnson scored a 1-yard touchdown run <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> deficit to 28–14. On the next possession, Cardinals running back Senorise Perry fumbled the ball and it was recovered by UCF. One play later, quarterback Blake Bortles completed a short pass to Storm Johnson, who then scrambled across the field for a 30-yard touchdown pass. The score tightened to 28–21. On the next drive, the Knights were able to pin Louisville at their own 15, and eventually forced a punt. On their next possession, UCF went 56 yards in only three plays, scoring yet another touchdown as time was winding down in the third quarter. The Knights scored 21 points in 4:20.|$|E
25|$|The Shulchan Aruch quotes the Talmud {{that because}} {{scissors}} have two blades, it would therefore be permitted <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> beard by using them, since the cutting action {{would come from}} contact between two blades and not from that between blade and skin. In Germany and Italy, {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century, Jews started removing beards with the aid of pumice stones and chemical depilatories, which would leave the face smooth, as if it had been shaven. These are non-razor shaves which are not prohibited. Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (Tzemach Tzedek) argued that shaving a beard would fall under the biblical regulation against males resembling a female (he also extended the prohibition for wanton destruction to destroying the hair of the beard); the Shulchan Aruch interpreted this regulation in a different way, arguing that it forbade men from removing hair from areas where women were accustomed to remove hair, such as underarm hair and pubic hair.|$|E

25|$|The Patriots' {{second drive}} {{of the game}} went for 59 yards on 12 plays, but a Morris run for no gain and two incompletions from the Jets' 13-yard line set up a 31-yard Gostkowski field <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> Jets' lead to 10–6. Taking the ensuing kickoff from the Jets' 8-yard line, Washington went 92 yards for the touchdown, opening the Jets' lead to 17–6. The Patriots punted on their next possession, giving the Jets the ball at their own 13-yard line. Favre began the drive with an 18-yard pass to wide {{receiver}} Jerricho Cotchery, and then two plays later, a 46-yard Cotchery catch put the Jets on the Patriots' 16-yard line; Favre hit Cotchery yet again two plays later, this time for a 15-yard touchdown reception that gave the Jets a 24–6 lead. On the Patriots' next possession, a 43-yard Sam Aiken catch on a screen pass put the Patriots in Jets territory; a 9-yard Cassel scramble set up 3rd-and-1. A Heath Evans run was stopped for a loss of two yards, and Cassel was sacked by C. J. Mosley on fourth down to turn the ball over on downs for the Patriots at the Jets' 30-yard line. The Jets then went three-and-out {{for the first time}} in the game, giving the Patriots, with one timeout remaining, the ball at their own 32-yard line with 1:44 remaining in the first half. The Patriots did not call their final timeout until multiple completed Cassel passes, a 19-yard scramble, and a successful quarterback sneak to convert on fourth down gave the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 19-yard line with 31 seconds left in the first half. After two incomplete passes, Cassel threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Gaffney to cut the Jets' lead to 24–13 heading into halftime.|$|E
25|$|The Ducks–Sharks Conference Quarterfinals {{was only}} the second series in NHL history to pit two Californian teams against one another; the first took place in 1968–69 between the Los Angeles Kings and the Oakland Seals. The Ducks stunned the Sharks by winning {{the first two games}} in San Jose 2–0 and 3–2. Jonas Hiller took over the {{starting}} job from Giguere and recorded his first NHL playoff shutout. Back at home for Game 3, the game was tied at three in the third period when Corey Perry took a hooking penalty and Patrick Marleau scored on the ensuing power play to win the game. Game 4 was completely dominated by the Ducks, prevailing 4–0. The first chance for the Ducks to eliminate the Sharks came in Game 5 at San Jose which went into overtime where once again Marleau was the hero after scoring the game-winner. In Game 6, the Ducks received goals from Perry, Selanne, Beauchemin and Getzlaf to win the game 4–1 and the series four games to two. The Ducks became just the fourth team to beat the Presidents' Trophy winner in the playoffs' first round. In the Conference Semifinals, the Ducks faced a familiar foe in the Detroit Red Wings. In Game 1, Nicklas Lidstrom scored in the final minute to win it for Detroit, 3–2. In Game 2, Todd Marchant scored in triple overtime to even the series at one game apiece. It was the first playoff game to go at least three overtimes for the Ducks since game one of the 2003 Conference Semifinals against Dallas. (That game had ended after five overtime periods.) The Ducks won Game 3 on a controversial goal scored by Marian Hossa. The referee claimed to have blown the whistle before the puck went in. Game 4 was all Detroit by a final score of 6–3. Hiller was pulled in the third period after giving up five goals. A pivotal Game 5 was won by the Red Wings, 4–1. However, the Ducks evened the series at three with a 2–1 win the game six. In the Ducks' first Game 7 since the 2006 Conference Quarterfinals against Calgary, Detroit got out to a 2–0 lead. Selanne then scored a power play goal to cut the lead, but Detroit scored again to make it 3–1. Perry scored next <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> lead to 3–2 and in the third period, Ryan scored to tie the game at 3–3. Detroit's Daniel Cleary, however, scored with three minutes left in regulation to end the Ducks' season.|$|E
25|$|The Lakers then {{faced the}} Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference Finals. In game 1, the Lakers {{blew out the}} Suns 128-107 led by Bryant's 40 points {{including}} 23 in the third quarter. Odom came off the bench to tally 19 points, 19 rebounds, and three assists. In game 2 Bryant {{played the role of}} facilitator, putting up 13 assists, while Gasol recorded 29 points, 9 rebounds, and five assists. The teams were tied at 90-90 heading into the fourth quarter, but Bryant and Gasol led the fourth quarter rally and the Lakers won the game 124-112. Game 3 was played in Phoenix, where the Suns used their big men and physical play to win the game. Amar'e Stoudemire scored 42 points and grabbed 11 rebounds while Robin Lopez 20 points. Odom and Bynum, however, both picked up fouls early and were ineffective for the Lakers for most of the game. The Lakers only scored 15 points in the second quarter and were down 86-84 in after three quarters. The Lakers were able to take the lead 90-89 with 8:47 to play, but the Suns rallied back to win 118-109. After battling each other in game 4 and slugging out a 23-23 first quarter, the Suns erupted for a 41 points in the second quarter, shooting 74%. Early in the 4th quarter the Lakers led 87-85. However, the Suns reserve players (who outscored the Lakers reserves 54-20) produced and 18-3 run in the 4th which the Lakers never recovered from despite Bryant's 38 points and 10 assists. In game 5, the Lakers surged to a 16-point lead in the first half including a 21-4 run and led by 18 points by half time. Steve Nash, who had 29 points and 11 assists in the game, led the Suns to a 16-4 rally in the third quarter <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>the</b> lead to six {{by the end of the}} period and one with 2:52 left in the game. Jason Richardson made a three pointer with 3.5 seconds left in the game to tie the score 101-101. On the next possession, Bryant, who had 30 points and 11 assists in the game, air-balled a three, but Artest offensively rebounded and made a game winning layup as time expired. In game 6 in Phoenix, the Lakers had the lead for most of the game. Los Angeles outscored the Suns 23-10 over the last eight minutes of the second quarter to lead 65-53 at the break and were up by 17 entering the fourth. However the Suns went on a 16-4 run and cut the Lakers lead to 95-90 with 6:09 remaining in the game. Artest scored 25 in the game and Bryant had a 37-point performance including nine points in the final two minutes to win the game 111-103 and clinch the series 4-2.|$|E
