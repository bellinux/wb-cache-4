5|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod {{is longer}} than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour {{illustrations}} {{and a series of}} 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, Oatmeal Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. Tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of muntin and plank construction (interlocking thick and thin vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A <b>tea</b> <b>caddy,</b> a silver salt, and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies. Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of the battle between Tod and Brock.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{legacy of}} the Temeraire {{was the use of}} the timber taken from her as she was broken up. A gong stand made from Temeraire timber was a wedding present to the future King George V on the occasion of his marriage to Mary of Teck, and is held at Balmoral Castle. A barometer, gavel, and some miscellaneous timber are in the collections of the National Maritime Museum, and chairs made from Temeraire oak are in the possession of the Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth, Lloyd's Register, London and the Whanganui Regional Museum, Whanganui. An altar, communion rail and two bishop's chairs survive in St. Mary's Church, Rotherhithe. [...] A ship model of the Temeraire made by prisoners of war uses a stand made from wood taken from her, and is currently in the Watermen's Hall in London. Other relics of the Temeraire known to exist or have existed are a <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> made for her signal midshipman at Trafalgar, James Eaton, and sold at auction in 2000, the frame for an oil painting by Sir Edwin Landseer titled Neptune, and a mantelpiece made for Beatson's office, supported by figures of Atlas supposedly taken from Temeraires stern gallery. The mantelpiece can no longer be traced, nor can a plaque once fixed to Temeraires deck commemorating Nelson's signal at Trafalgar, nor a wooden leg made for a Trafalgar veteran from Temeraires wood. John Ruskin foreshadowed the fate of the Temeraires wood in an essay which claimed that [...] "Perhaps, where the low gate opens to some cottage garden, the tired traveller may ask, idly, why the moss grows so green on its rugged wood, and even the sailor's child may not answer nor know that the night dew lies deep in the war rents of the wood of the old Temeraire." ...|$|E
2500|$|While in the U.S., Michael {{travels to}} New York {{to visit the}} Jewish woman who was a witness at the trial, and who wrote the book about the winter death march from Auschwitz. She can see his terrible {{conflict}} of emotions and he finally tells of his youthful relationship with Hanna. The unspoken damage she left to the people around her hangs in the air. He reveals his short, cold marriage, and his distant relationship with his daughter. The woman understands, but nonetheless refuses to take the savings Hanna had asked Michael to convey to her, saying, [...] "Using it {{for something to do}} with the Holocaust would really seem like an absolution to me, and that is something I neither wish nor care to grant." [...] She asks that he donate it as he sees fit; he chooses a Jewish charity for combating illiteracy, in Hanna's name. Having had a caddy stolen from her when she was a child in the camp, the woman does take the old <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> in which Hanna had kept her money and mementos. Returning to Germany, and with a letter of thanks for the donation made in Hanna's name, Michael visits Hanna's grave for the first and only time.|$|E

6000|$|... "And a {{good job}} too," [...] cried the housekeeper, with a toss of her head. [...] "It's about time {{that some of his}} own folk took a turn at it, for I've had enough of it. There you are, young woman! In you go and make {{yourself}} at home. There's <b>tea</b> in the <b>caddy</b> and bacon on the dresser, and the old man will be about you if you don't fetch him his breakfast. I'll send for my things in the evenin'." [...] With a nod she strolled off with her attendant gossips {{in the direction of the}} public house.|$|R
6000|$|JUDITH. No, only-- (someone knocks at the door. With a start which betrays her intense nervousness, she {{retreats to}} the further {{end of the}} table with the <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> and spoon, in her hands, exclaiming) Who's that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Got it in {{the back}} for a moment. Going to be a change of weather I suppose," [...] said Uncle Pentstemon. [...] "I brought 'er a nice present, too, what I got in this passel. Vallyble old <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> that uset' be my mother's. What I kep' my baccy in for years and years--till the hinge at the back got broke.

Come in. (Richard comes in carelessly and stands at the table, looking round the room with a slight pucker of his nose at the mezzotinted divine on the wall. Judith keeps her eyes on the <b>tea</b> <b>caddy.)</b> Is it still raining? (He shuts the door.) ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were three}} bound volumes of early issues of Chambers' Journal, {{a copy of}} Punch's Pocket Book for 1875, Sturm's Reflections, {{an early version of}} Gill's Geography (slightly torn), an {{illustrated}} work on Spinal Curvature, an early edition of Kirke's Human Physiology, The Scottish Chiefs and a little volume on the Language of Flowers. There was a fine steel engraving, oak-framed and with some rusty spots, done in the Colossal style and representing the Handwriting on the Wall. There were also a copper kettle, a pair of candle snuffers, a brass shoehorn, a <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> to lock, two decanters (one stoppered) and what was probably a portion of an eighteenth century child's rattle.|$|E

50|$|After Roderick died, {{the trust}} sold several items {{from inside the}} house {{including}} a George III sycamore <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> and ivory and horn-veneered miniature chess table.|$|E
50|$|Tea scoop (茶杓, chashaku). Tea scoops {{generally}} are carved {{from a single}} piece of bamboo, although they may also be made of ivory or wood. They are used to scoop tea from the <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> into the tea bowl. Bamboo tea scoops in the most casual style have a nodule in the approximate center. Larger scoops are used to transfer tea into the <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> in the mizuya (preparation area), but these are not seen by guests. Different styles and colours are used in various tea traditions.|$|E

50|$|If the sieved matcha is to {{be served}} at a Japanese tea ceremony, {{then it will be}} placed into a small <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> known as a chaki. Otherwise, it can be scooped {{directly}} from the sieve into a tea bowl.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, the natsume {{has given}} {{its name to}} a style of <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> used in the Japanese tea ceremony, due to the similar shape, and also to nightlights (ナツメ球), again due to the {{similarity}} between {{the shape of the}} bulb and the fruit.|$|E
50|$|It {{was while}} Vasegaard {{was working at}} Bing & Grøndahl that she {{developed}} an interest in Chinese ceramics. Combining her knowledge of traditional Danish designs with those of China, she created a cup without a handle and a teapot with a flat, inwardly-curved lid and cane handle, both inspired by Chinese models. She also produced a <b>tea</b> <b>caddy,</b> uncommon in Denmark {{but part of the}} Chinese tradition, and a milk jug, based on English requirements.|$|E
50|$|After all {{the guests}} have taken tea, the host cleans the {{utensils}} {{in preparation for}} putting them away. The guest of honour will request that the host allow the guests to examine some of the utensils, and each guest in turn examines each item, including the <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> and the tea scoop. The items are treated with extreme care and reverence {{as they may be}} priceless, irreplaceable, handmade antiques, and guests often use a special brocaded cloth to handle them.|$|E
50|$|The Halle vases made in 1931 in {{collaboration}} with Burg Giebichenstein Art School are true to the ideal of Bauhaus. Inspired by basic geometric shapes like ellipse and cone ceramic artist Friedlaender created seven harmoniously proportioned vases. The clear form of the square-shaped CADRE vase reflects {{one of the main}} requirements of the New Objectivity style that form should follow function. The 1967 design by Trude Petri is based on the <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> she created in 1930 for the URBINO service.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> is a box, jar, canister, {{or other}} {{receptacle}} used to store tea. When first introduced to Europe, tea was extremely expensive, and kept under {{the eye of}} the mistress of the house, often under lock and key. The containers used were therefore often expensive and decorative, to fit in with the rest of a drawing-room or other reception room. Hot water was carried up from the kitchen, and the tea made by the mistress of the house, or under her supervision.|$|E
50|$|As they {{master the}} basics, {{students}} will be instructed on how to prepare the powdered tea for use, how to fill the <b>tea</b> <b>caddy,</b> and finally, how to measure the tea and water and whisk it to the proper consistency. Once these basic steps have been mastered, students begin to practice the simplest temae, typically beginning with O-bon temae (see above). Only when the first ceremony has been mastered will students move on. Study is through observation and hands on practice; students do not often take notes, and many teachers discourage the practice of note-taking.|$|E
5000|$|... (Chabako temae) is {{so called}} because the {{equipment}} is removed from and then replaced into a special box known as a [...] (lit. [...] "tea box"). Chabako developed as a convenient way to prepare the necessary equipment for making tea outdoors. The basic equipment contained in the chabako are the tea bowl, tea whisk (kept in a special container), tea scoop and <b>tea</b> <b>caddy,</b> and linen wiping cloth in a special container, {{as well as a}} container for little candy-like sweets. Many of the items are smaller than usual, to fit in the box. This ceremony takes approximately 35-40 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|... (Obon temae), [...] (bon temae), or [...] (bonryaku temae) is {{a simple}} {{procedure}} for making usucha (thin tea). The tea bowl, tea whisk, tea scoop, chakin and <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> are placed on a tray, and the hot water is prepared in a kettle called a tetsubin, which is heated on a brazier. This is usually the first temae learned, and is the easiest to perform, requiring neither much specialized equipment nor {{a lot of time}} to complete. It may easily be done sitting at a table, or outdoors, using a thermos pot in place of the tetsubin and portable hearth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> {{illustrated}} shows many of {{the characteristics}} of blue and white porcelain produced during the Kangxi period. The translucent body showing through the clear glaze is of great whiteness and the cobalt decoration, applied in many layers, has a fine blue hue. The decoration, a sage in a landscape of lakes and mountains with blazed rocks is typical of the period. The piece would have been fired in a saggar (a lidded ceramic box intended to protect the piece from kiln debris, smoke and cinders during firing) in a reducing atmosphere in a wood-burning egg-shaped kiln, at a temperature approaching 1350 C.|$|E
50|$|The {{underground}} “Palace” {{is now a}} museum, {{and contains}} some other relics. One of the best preserved is a gilt silver tea set, said {{to be one of}} the earliest royal tea sets ever discovered. It includes a <b>tea</b> <b>caddy</b> woven out of metallic yarn, a gilt silver tortoise-shaped tea box, a tea roller-grinder, and a silver stove for brewing the tea. As a part of the set, a kind of container for mixing tea, called a Tiao Da Zi, was used for tea mixing and drinking, since in ancient China the tea drinking ceremony was treated to some extent just like a meal. First, tea was put into the container and spices added. Some boiled water was used to mix the tea into paste, and them more hot water was added to make it into drinkable tea.|$|E
50|$|Fukusa (帛紗). A {{double layer}} silk cloth {{approximately}} 30 cm {{or a little}} less than 12 inches square, with fold on one edge and the other three edges sewn together so the stitching is invisible. It is used for the symbolic cleansing of the tea scoop and <b>tea</b> <b>caddy,</b> and (usually by women) to handle hot kettle or pot lids. The host and assistants at a tea gathering wear the fukusa tucked into the obi. By tradition, the host of a formal tea ceremony uses a new, previously unused fukusa. Fukusa are most often monochromatic and unpatterned, but variations exist. There are different colours for men (usually purple) and women (orange or red), for people of different ages or skill levels, for different ceremonies and for different schools. The size and way of making fukusa was purportedly established by Sen Sōon, Sen Rikyū's second wife.|$|E
5000|$|Chabako (茶箱, {{literally}} [...] "tea boxes"). Special lidded boxes containing tea bowl, <b>tea</b> <b>caddy,</b> tea scoop {{and other}} equipment. They constitute portable tea-making sets for travel and making tea outdoors, {{and are available}} in many styles. The [...] "Rikyū model" [...] is of plain paulownia wood and comes in a large size and a small size. The interior dimensions of the large version are slightly smaller than 19 cm in length, 13 cm in width, and 11.5 cm in height. It has a shelf inside. Originally there were no rules for the tea-making procedure (temae). However, the 11th-generation head of the Urasenke school of tea created certain types of procedures. For the procedures, the box is carried into {{the place where the}} tea is to be made, sometimes on a tray, and the ceremony proceeds with each item being removed from, and finally returned to, the box.|$|E
50|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod {{is longer}} than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour {{illustrations}} {{and a series of}} 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, Oatmeal Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. Tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of muntin and plank construction (interlocking thick and thin vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A <b>tea</b> <b>caddy,</b> a silver salt, and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies. Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of the battle between Tod and Brock.|$|E
