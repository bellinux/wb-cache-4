5|$|Haifa's {{development}} owed much to British {{plans to}} make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization. The State-run Palestine Railways also built its main workshops in Haifa.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Hurricane Betsy made {{landfall}} {{just south}} of New Orleans, causing widespread flooding in <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, a system of levees was authorized by Congress to handle future storm events. However, the protection given by this system was limited to hurricanes up to Category3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|E

5|$|Muldoon {{returned}} to Seattle and {{became involved in}} efforts to bring a professional team back to <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new arena was constructed in 1928.

5|$|On {{the east}} end of the roof, the church had a cupola which was topped with a large {{concrete}} pineapple. Pineapples were a feature of several buildings in Southampton as a symbol of welcome, an idea that originated in the Caribbean and which possibly reached <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the slave trade in the 16th century.

5|$|The KKK had {{a revival}} {{for a decade}} after 1915, {{especially}} in industrial cities and the Midwest. In 1921, Trotter was successful in shutting down new screenings of The Birth of a Nation in Boston; he allied with Roman Catholic organizations, who objected to the KKK's anti-Catholic stance of the 20th century, and were strong in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of extensive Irish and Italian immigration.|$|E

5|$|The {{center of}} the city {{contained}} several reinforced concrete buildings and lighter structures. Outside the center, the area was congested by a dense collection of small timber-made workshops set among Japanese houses. A few larger industrial plants lay near the outskirts of the city. The houses were constructed of timber with tile roofs, and many of the industrial buildings were also built around timber frames. <b>The</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole was highly susceptible to fire damage.|$|E
5|$|The final {{was highly}} anticipated, {{particularly}} as Armagh and Tyrone are neighbouring counties. Police Service of Northern Ireland Deputy Chief Constable Paul Leighton estimated that 40,000 fans would travel from Northern Ireland to Dublin, despite each competing county only being allocated approximately 10,000 match tickets. Declan Martin, policy director for Dublin Chamber of Commerce, expected the revenue generated in <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of the}} final to double because two sides from Ulster were involved.|$|E

5|$|To the south, {{the ward}} of Barton {{is the third}} most densely {{populated}} in Salford with little population change between 1991and2001. It has proportionally more over-85-year-olds than <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, with low adult and primary school education standards, but significant improvements in GCSE results of late. Some parts of Barton are amongst the worst20% of areas {{in the country for}} child poverty, with below-city-average childcare provision. Unemployment is higher than average for Salford. Almost half the homes in the ward are terraced housing, with an extra 300 properties built between 1994and2004.|$|E
5|$|As {{chair of}} Bloomington Conservation Project, Horch and the Master Institute of United Arts led {{an effort to}} improve {{deteriorated}} housing by converting single-family brownstone buildings into rent-subsidized apartments. Efforts like those of this project ameliorated conditions to some extent, but the Bloomingdale area {{did not return to}} prosperity until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole experienced an economic rebound. As high-paying white-collar employment in financial institutions and other service industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in the industrial sector, real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them.|$|E
5|$|As {{reported}} by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, the Arab attack was methodical: in 672–673 Arab fleets secured bases along the coasts of Asia Minor, and then proceeded to install a loose blockade around Constantinople. They used the peninsula of Cyzicus near <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base to spend the winter, and returned every spring to launch attacks against the city's fortifications. Finally, the Byzantines, under Emperor Constantine IV, managed to destroy the Arab navy using a new invention, the liquid incendiary substance known as Greek fire. The Arab land army in Asia Minor was also defeated by the Byzantines, forcing the Arabs to lift the siege. The Byzantine victory was of major importance {{for the survival of}} the Byzantine state, as the Arab threat receded for a time. A peace treaty was signed soon after, and following the outbreak of another Muslim civil war, the Byzantines even experienced a period of ascendancy over the Caliphate.|$|E

50|$|Intelligent urbanism views <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} system. Yet {{these opportunities}} are not equally distributed.

5|$|At that point, a {{group of}} aristocrats persuaded the Despot Andronikos to seek the {{assistance}} of the Republic of Venice, an initiative probably taken without consulting Constantinople. In spring 1423, via the Venetian colony of Negroponte, he informed the Venetians of his intention. The only conditions Andronikos attached to his offer were that the property, customs and privileges of the city's inhabitants, their right to trade and come and go freely, and the position of the city's Orthodox Church, were respected, and that Venice would pledge to defend the city against the Ottomans. Pseudo-Sphrantzes claims that Andronikos sold the city for 50,000 ducats, and this statement was often accepted by more recent scholars until the mid-20th century. However, this is not mentioned by any other source, nor is it found in the original documents pertaining to the affair, as shown by the scholars Konstantinos Mertzios and Paul Lemerle. On the other hand, the Venetian envoys appointed to oversee the handover were authorised to provide a sum of between 20,000 and 40,000 aspers from the revenue of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> yearly subsidy to Andronikos, should he request it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting the economic problems of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E
