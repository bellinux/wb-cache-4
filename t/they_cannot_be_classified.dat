In 1948 he saw what had escaped Dale in 1906. “The adrenotropic receptors have been {{considered}} to be of two classes, those whose action results in excitation and those whose action results in inhibition of the effector cells. Experiments described in this paper indicate that although {{there are two kinds of}} adrenotropic receptors <b>they</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> simply as excitatory or inhibitory since each kind of receptor may have either action depending on where it is found.” Ahlquist chose six agonists, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, α-methylnoradrenaline and isoprenaline, and examined their effects on several organs. He found that the six substances possessed two – and only two – rank orders of potency in these organs. For example, the rank order of potency was ″adrenaline > noradrenaline > α-methylnoradrenaline > isoprenaline″ in promoting contraction of blood vessels, but ″isoprenaline > adrenaline > α-methylnoradrenaline > noradrenaline″ in stimulating the heart. The receptor with the first rank order (for example for blood vessel contraction) he called alpha adrenotropic receptor (now α-adrenoceptor or α-adrenergic receptor), while the receptor with the second rank order (for instance for stimulation of the heart, but also for bronchodilation) he called beta adrenotropic receptor (now β-adrenoceptor or β-adrenergic receptor). ″This concept of two fundamental types of receptors is directly opposed to the concept of two mediator substances (sympathin E and sympathin I) as propounded by Cannon and Rosenblueth and now widely quoted as ‘law’ of physiology. … There is only one adrenergic neuro-hormone, or sympathin, and that sympathin is identical with epinephrine.” ...|$|E

If we take a distance from this apparent chaos we perceive individuals who try to emerge, bodies that are changing of form, beings in process.

This is the dimension of what semiologist Julia Kristeva calls semiotics itself. Maybe the rhythms relate to the mother and her symbols. Thus, through his work, Vernazza creates what could be called mother art. The figures still have the initial warmth. But they permit to perceive a ballerina, a couple of lovers, a life that announces itself.Theoretical discourse is against the rhythms. It analyzes them. But they evade it. Decodified, the rhythms stop existing. <b>They</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>classified</b> or defined. They are before representation. They are only analogous to music. Some are gray. This is the symbolical color of humanity. Neither Light nor darkness. Or they have multiple colours.

Sometimes it is a being still united to its mother, sometimes it is an orgy, sometimes it is a wheel. Sometimes there are bodies that are making their ascent, breaking their limits suggesting infinity.Sitting up high on his stool, his arms stretched out to paint a huge rhythm, Eduardo Vernazza died on 26 May 1991.

5000|$|Several gasteroid fungi - {{such as the}} stinkhorn, Phallus impudicus L. - were {{formally}} {{described by}} Linnaeus in his original Species Plantarum of 1753, but the first critical treatment of the group was by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in his Synopsis methodica fungorum of 1801.

Although the starting point was subsequently put back to 1753, names of gasteroid fungi used in Persoon's book are still sanctioned and cannot be replaced by earlier names. Elias Magnus Fries introduced the name Gasteromycetes for a class of fungi in his Systema Mycologicum of 1821, although (not using a microscope) he included many species of the Ascomycota (such as truffles) within the class.

In this paper, we focus on two challenges of image classification and propose a method to address both of them simultaneously.

These atypical strains, which autolyze {{at the end}} of the stationary phase of growth, contain highly divergent lytA alleles (pairwise evolutionary distances of about 20 %) compared to the lytA alleles of typical pneumococci. The atypical LytA amidases exhibit a peculiar deletion of two amino acids responsible for cell wall anchoring in the carboxy-terminal domain and have a reduced specific activity. These enzymes were inhibited by 1 % deoxycholate but were activated by 1 % Triton X- 100, a detergent that could be used as an alternative diagnostic test for this kind of strain. Preparation of functional chimeric enzymes, PCR mutagenesis, and gene replacements demonstrated that the characteristic bile insolubility of these atypical strains was due to their peculiar carboxy-terminal domain and that the 2 -amino-acid deletion was responsible for the inhibitory effect of deoxycholate. However, the deletion alone did not affect the specific activity of LytA. A detailed characterization of the genes encoding the 16 S rRNA and SodA together with multilocus sequence typing indicated that the strains studied here are not a single clone and, although <b>they</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> strictly <b>classified</b> as typical pneumococci, they represent a quite diverse pool of organisms closely related to S. pneumoniae.

40|$|AbstractElectrocardiogram (ECG) {{analysis}} is the method for cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis. Cardiac arrhythmia {{is a group}} of diseases in which the heart beat shows irregularities. The classification of the correct type of Arrhythmia is a necessary and critical issue which becomes difficult in certain cases. In certain cases the Atrial Electrical Activity(AEA) signals are hidden in some other waves and <b>they</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> detected and <b>classified</b> easily from surface. This paper presents a method by which classification of cardiac arrhythmia is done by processing the ECG. The procedure is done by identifying the QRS complex and thus its position in the preprocessed digitised ECG. The AEA signals in the ECG is identified using a semi-automatic method called Separation Using Maximum Energy Ratio (SUMER), which is found efficient in identifying the hidden waves. In SUMER, an energy ratio based cost function is created and maximized using the gradient ascent method. After identifying the first AEA, the precise positions of all the AEA waves are identified. The ratio between the QRS complex and the AEA waves is calculated and based on the ratio the arrhythmia type is identified. The proposed method would help in better and easy classification of arrhythmia at its early stage...|$|R
40|$|From {{pharmaceutical}} to mining or traveling desert dunes to earthquakes, granular {{materials are}} at the heart of many industries and natural phenomena. Improving the efficiency of the machines handling them or, constructing safer buildings requires a critical understanding of their behavior. However, this is not a straightforward task as opposed to what one might think due to the abundance of particulate matter. From a fundamental point of view, it has been only recently realized that <b>they</b> <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> easily <b>classified</b> as a solid or liquid or even a gas as they are able to mimic all of these states under slightly different conditions. The challenge of the scientific research today, is to establish the link between the collective behavior and properties of individual particles composing granular materials. Such a relation would enable to characterize them with only a few parameters in contrast to billions of particles typically found in practice. In the first part of this thesis, we study the mechanical behavior of idealized sphere packings with discrete element simulations. The polydispersity and coefficient of friction of the particles are varied systematically to characterize their influence on the macroscopic stress strain response. In isotropically deformed packings, the critical volume fraction marking the transition from a solid to fluid like state increases with polydispersity, whereas it decreases with the coefficient of friction. The coordination number, i. e. average number of contact per particle, is discontinuous at this density. During decompression it drops from its isostatic value to zero and obeys a power law at higher volume fractions. The effect of polydispersity on the pressure is determined by the ratio of critical volume fraction and the contact density which is equal to the trace of the fabric times a correction factor that depends only on the moments of the particle size distribution. Using the micromechanical definition of the stress tensor, we derive an incremental constitutive model for the pressure which includes changes of fabric. With one fit parameter the linear regime of lower pressure is described, while with two parameters, the model captures well the non-linear pressure evolution in isotropically deformed polydisperse, frictionless and frictional packings. Anisotropic deformations are studied with triaxial test simulations. The shear strength of the packings is measured by the deviatoric stress ratio which first increases then saturates with increasing particle coefficient of friction. Volumetric strain also depends on the particle friction albeit in a non monotonic way. The maximum compaction after which packings start to dilate, is achieved at a relatively small coefficient of friction. The stress strain response depends indirectly on the polydispersity which determines initial packing conditions. When initially the volume fraction is fixed, the pressure as well as the shear strength decrease with polydispersity. The opposite is observed when the initial pressure is imposed, although the effect of polydispersity on the stress-strain behavior is less significant in this case. Finally, a hypoplastic constitutive model is calibrated with simulation results and the resulting material coefficients are related to particle properties. Most granular materials are amorphous and disordered as realized up to now. However,crystal structures can be built by placing uniform particles on a regular lattice. The second part of the thesis is about pattern transformation in two-dimensional granular crystals composed of bi-disperse soft and hard cylindrical particles. We show with experiments and simulations that upon uniaxial compression the particles undergo structural rearrangements from an initial square to hexagon-like lattice. It is found that the characteristics of the transformation strongly depend on the size ratio of the particles rather than their material properties. If the ratio is small enough the transformation is homogeneous and practically reversible. The band structure of the granular crystal changes due to the pattern transformation. Using a linearized contact force model, we compute the dispersion relation at different levels of deformation and show that band gaps open and close as the structure of the crystal changes. This could find applications in tunable acoustic devices such as filters or vibration isolators. In short, this thesis concerns the mechanics of granular materials subject to different modes of deformation. The constitutive behavior of disordered sphere packings and pattern transformation in regular arrays of cylinders have been studied. Chemical EngineeringApplied Science...|$|R
