In view of recent records of Mediterranean Monk Seal in The Gambia, for example a juvenile off the Bijol Islands on November 3 rd 1997 (Van Waerebeek et al. 2001), during the interview we also asked about seals. Mr Jammeh was presented with images of all of our target species and asked whether he was familiar with each and whether they could be seen around Ginak. Great care was taken not to “lead” Mr Jammeh. Once he had confirmed the presence of any species, he was questioned about the natural history of each to confirm that he was genuinely familiar with each and not simply telling the interviewer what he wanted to hear...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{reconsider the}} problem of specialising the vanilla meta <b>interpreter</b> <b>through</b> fully {{automatic}} and completely general partial deduction techniques. In particular, we study how the homeomorphic embedding relation guides specialisation of the <b>interpreter.</b> <b>We</b> focus on the so-called parsing problem, i. e. removing all parsing overhead from the program, and demonstrate that further refinements in the control of general partial deduction are necessary to properly deal with it. In particular, we modify local control {{on the basis of}} information imported from the global level. The resulting control strategy, while remaining fully general, leads to excellent specialisation of vanilla like meta programs. Parsing is always specialised, but [...] appropriately, as we will show [...] not always completely removed. As a concrete application, we subject an extended vanilla meta interpreter capable of dealing with compositions of programs to our techniques, showing we equal or surpass results obtained through a more ad hoc approach. ...|$|R
