2500|$|De Angelis was {{replaced}} at Lotus by Scotland's Johnny Dumfries after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers {{at the same}} time. Senna allegedly pushed for his former flatmate and fellow Brazilian Maurício Gugelmin to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team's major sponsor John Player & Sons (JPS) insisted on a British driver {{which led to the}} signing of Dumfries. Senna later admitted [...] "It was bad, bad. Until <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good relationship with Derek." [...] Senna started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races. However, poor reliability, particularly {{in the second half of}} the season, saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet, as well as defending and eventual champion, Alain Prost. Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the Detroit Grand Prix, thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points.|$|E
2500|$|Adele {{performed}} [...] "Someone like You" [...] for {{the first}} time in November 2010 on the BBC music show. Later, with Jools Holland before the release of the album. As the performance finished, there was a notable stunned silence from the audience, before bursting into applause. Adele has since described this performance as a career defining moment. [...] Later, she performed the song at the 2011 BRIT Awards held at The O2 Arena in London on 15 February 2011. She appeared on stage backed just by her pianist while [...] "special effects were limited to a shower of glitter and Adele's own tears, as she almost broke down delivering her lovelorn plea to an ex-boyfriend" [...] as stated by Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph. Speaking on the ITV2 after show, Adele explained why she had cried at the end of the performance saying, [...] "I was really emotional by the end because I'm quite overwhelmed by everything anyway, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> vision of my ex, of him watching me at home and he's going to be laughing at me because he knows I'm crying because of him, with him thinking, 'Yep, she's still wrapped around my finger'. Then everyone stood up, so I was overwhelmed." [...] A writer of Daily Mirror said that [...] "Adele stole the show [...] with her praised performance of Someone Like You." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph chose the song as a highlight on the show saying that Adele knocked [...] "everyone for six with no bells and whistles, just a piano, her gorgeous voice and a monster song, Someone Like You." [...] Later, the song was performed during a VH1 special called [...] "Unplugged". Adele also performed the song at Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 24 February 2011. The same day she performed [...] "Someone like You" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.|$|E
