5|$|In May 2013, <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> {{lighting}} of the restored U-Drop Inn was damaged by a hailstorm; the damaged elements {{were replaced by}} LEDs in February 2014. The café will serve fountain drinks, coffee and floats in 2014 after many years with no food or beverage service.|$|E
5|$|The company {{adapted the}} old {{gas station and}} café to act as the community's chamber of {{commerce}} and visitor center while preserving the building's architectural features and historical authenticity. Old photographs and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details. They peeled away decades of paint layers and fabric to find the original interior and exterior colors. One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> accents. While historical photographs showed where neon existed, {{they had all been}} taken during the daytime when <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> lights were off, making it difficult to determine what color the lights originally were.|$|E
50|$|For 2000, <b>the</b> new <b>Neon</b> became <b>the</b> Chrysler <b>Neon.</b> <b>The</b> Chrysler Cirrus and Mitsubishi-built Dodge Avenger were dropped.

In Australia and Canada, <b>the</b> Chrysler <b>Neon</b> was {{discontinued}} in 2002.In 2002, the front clip was changed slightly to match the R/T and ACR front clip {{with the exception of}} missing a lower lip. This was done by making the grille smaller.|$|R
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Vidor High School in 1986, Walker began {{working at a}} Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company plant. At nineteen, he also began touring as a musician, playing various local clubs and {{eventually}} finding work as the house singer at a bar in Beaumont called <b>the</b> <b>Neon</b> Armadillo. In November 1992, he was discovered by James Stroud, a record producer who was also the president of Warner Music Group subsidiary Giant Records. Walker signed to Giant late in the year.|$|E
5|$|Most 16O is {{synthesized}} {{at the end}} of the helium fusion {{process in}} massive stars but some is made in <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> burning process. 17O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars. Most 18O is produced when 14N (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a 4He nucleus, making 18O common in the helium-rich zones of evolved, massive stars.|$|E
5|$|Similar to xenon, neon content {{observed}} in samples of volcanic gases is enriched in 20Ne, {{as well as}} nucleogenic 21Ne, relative to 22Ne content. <b>The</b> <b>neon</b> isotopic content of these mantle-derived samples represents a non-atmospheric source of neon. The 20Ne-enriched components are attributed to exotic primordial rare gas components in the Earth, possibly representing solar neon. Elevated 20Ne abundances are found in diamonds, further suggesting a solar neon reservoir in the Earth.|$|E
50|$|The Las Vegas Club {{opened in}} 1930. It {{installed}} <b>the</b> first <b>neon</b> sign on a hotel gambling establishment in 1931. It was only <b>the</b> second <b>neon</b> casino {{sign in the}} city.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> Reto <b>Neon</b> {{ceased to}} exist in 2004, when the Desafío Corona series was founded. OCESA, the {{promoter}} of the new series included <b>the</b> Dodge <b>Neon</b> cars {{as one of their}} three categories, with the stock car series (now NASCAR Mexico Corona Series) being the premier series. <b>The</b> Reto <b>Neon</b> became <b>the</b> T4 Series. In 2005 it was known as Lotto T4 Series, after the Italian sportswear firm decided to sponsor the series for that year.|$|R
5|$|That same year, J.J. Thomson {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which he channeled a stream of neon ions through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was because some of <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later {{be explained by the}} discovery of neutrons in 1932.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{was present}} in the behind-the-scenes video, showing an exhausted Madonna leaving the party with a male model, as well as aftermath scenes of the party which were released in the first teaser trailer. The parting shot showed Madonna running {{around the room and}} posing in front of the windows overlooking New York. Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting in the hallways, plunging towards <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song with the little girls {{from the beginning of the}} video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.|$|E
5|$|As {{they move}} around {{the city in the}} van, they pick up {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E

5|$|InFamous {{is set in}} Empire City, {{a fictional}} {{metropolis}} based on New York City, consisting of <b>the</b> <b>Neon</b> District, where most of Empire City's businesses are concentrated, the Warren, a slum dependent on international shipping activity, and the Historic District, {{the location of the}} city government. Each district has an elevated train system and a separate power grid. The premise of the game is built around the partial destruction of the Historic District by a mysterious explosion, followed by a viral epidemic that forces federal authorities to seal the only bridge leading to the mainland. A rise in violent crime overwhelms the police, resulting in societal collapse.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the basic {{understanding}} of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|Neon's {{abundance}} {{in the universe}} is about 1 part in 750; in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found {{that even in the}} upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the abundance of neon is reduced (depleted) by about a factor of 10, to a level of 1 part in 6,000 by mass. This may indicate that even the ice-planetesimals which brought neon into Jupiter from the outer solar system, formed in a region which was too warm to retain <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times that found in the Sun).|$|E
40|$|The six-phase Lee model code {{is used to}} fit the {{computed}} current waveform to {{the measured}} current waveform of INTI plasma focus (PF; 2. 2 kJ at 12 kV), a T 2 PF device, operated {{as a source of}} neon soft X-ray (SXR) with optimum yield around 2 torr of <b>neon.</b> <b>The</b> characteristic He-like and H-like neon line SXR pulse is measured using a pair of SXR detectors with selected filters that, by subtraction, has a photon energy window of 900 to 1550 eV covering the region of <b>the</b> characteristic <b>neon</b> SXR lines. From the analysis of the fitted current and the measured SXR pulses, <b>the</b> characteristic <b>neon</b> SXR pulses are correlated to the pinch dynamics, and the subsequent slightly harder SXR pulses are correlated to the anomalous resistance phase. <b>The</b> characteristic <b>neon</b> SXR yield is measured; the pulse has a duration of 25 ns. <b>The</b> characteristic <b>neon</b> SXR typically starts 10 ns before the pinch phase and continues {{through the end of the}} 10 -ns pinch phase, tailing into the anomalous resistance phase. Harder SXR pulses, probably Bremsstrahlung, are correlated to the anomalous resistance phase, with the main pulse occurring nearly 200 ns after <b>the</b> characteristic <b>neon</b> SXR pulse...|$|R

5|$|Arcade Fire {{began their}} tour {{in support of}} the album in January and February 2007, playing a series of concerts at churches and other small venues in Ottawa, Montreal, London and New York. This was {{followed}} by a 23 date European tour in March and early April, though the last 9 dates of this were cancelled due to illness. The first North American leg of the tour began April 26 in San Diego and April 28 at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and contained 26 dates. This leg contained openings by The National, St. Vincent, and Electrelane. The band then began an 11-date European leg at Glastonbury Festival on June 22 before returning to North America for 10 more LCD Soundsystem-supported dates beginning September 15 at Austin City Limits. <b>The</b> <b>Neon</b> Bible tour continued with 14 more dates in Europe between October 25 and November 19, and six dates beginning January 18, 2008 in Australia and New Zealand as part of the Big Day Out festival. The tour then ended after three more shows from February 7 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, however, one of <b>the</b> <b>neon</b> {{lights in}} the flame {{structure}} short-circuited and started a fire on the yellow cotton sack placed over the bugler statue, causing an actual fire on the Christmas Candle flame for a brief amount of time. The blaze caused only minor damage to the Christmas Candle, but the bugler statue was exposed and visible inside the flame {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this setback, the Christmas Candle was widely considered a success, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee signed a charter on December 17, 1951, tasking itself with organizing a yearly holiday program revolving around the Christmas Candle. The candle was assembled again every Christmas season until 1961, with ceremonies generally including holiday decorations, Christmas carols, refreshments, appearances by Santa Claus and other forms of entertainment. The Easton Area Christmas Committee was responsible for raising the funds and encouraging the civic interest necessary to keep the program active.|$|E
5|$|Empire City {{is built}} on three islands, and the player must work through main story {{missions}} on each island before being able to access the next one, though future missions may require the player to return to an earlier island. Each island is divided {{into a number of}} sectors, {{at the start of the}} game controlled by three different gangs, <b>the</b> <b>Neon</b> District being controlled by Sasha and her Reaper Gang, the Warren District being controlled by Alden and the Dust Men Gang, and the Historic District being controlled by Kessler and the First Sons. The player can undertake a side mission in each sector, once certain main story requirements have been met, to free that sector from gang control, reducing or eliminating the presence of the gang in that sector. Other side missions may also unlock medical stations where Cole will re-awaken should he die. Though Cole must travel on foot he eventually gains powers that allow him to grind along power cables and powered, elevated train rails and to hover for a short time. Scattered around the city are hundreds of 'Blast Shards' which Cole can collect to increase the amount of electricity he can store. There are 32 'Dead Drop' satellite transmitters that help to reveal more of the back-story in the game, all being narrated by John White, or being recordings of Kessler and his experiments.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> black <b>neon</b> tetra is an egg scatterer, laying {{adhesive}} (sticky) eggs over plants, etc. One female {{can produce}} several hundred eggs. The parents will eat their own eggs and babies, {{so it is}} normal to remove the parents after spawning. As with many fish, <b>The</b> black <b>neon</b> tetra often spawns in the early morning.Raising the fry can be more difficult because of their small size. The first food will normally be protozoa (infusoria). Very fine fry food can be used, graduating to slightly coarse fry food. At all ages, <b>the</b> black <b>neon</b> tetra benefits from suitably sized live food.|$|R
