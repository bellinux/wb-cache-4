500|$|Bell [...] "wanted {{the snake}} church people {{to end up}} being the good guys." [...] However, the trick would be to {{disguise}} the real bad guys in plain sight. According to Bell, [...] "The way the shows usually work out, Mulder is the one to figure out who the bad guys are. So I went into the story meeting with the idea of having Mulder being wrong. Because Mulder believes so strong it's <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy,</b> it helped hide the true identity of the bad guy from the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Osbourne {{initially}} {{set out to}} form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E
500|$|St. John was {{instructed}} by the show's directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth's performances of Todd {{because they wanted}} him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> did. That's his time." [...] St. John felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform Todd. [...] "I know that sounds very arrogant and overconfident," [...] he stated, [...] "but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody." ...|$|E

500|$|Homer sees a {{commercial}} for [...] "The Bout to Knock <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Guy</b> Out!", a much-anticipated boxing match in which Drederick Tatum will fight for the World Heavyweight Championship. Homer decides to have a party and invites all of his friends {{to come over and}} watch the fight. Lisa tries to boycott the party, so this results in Homer making her stay outside on the lawn. Homer’s conscience eventually bothers him, more in the form of his daughter's distress than a moral objection to stealing cable due to a hallucination that he goes to prison for stealing cable. He finally gives in to Lisa's protests, begrudgingly choosing not to watch the last minutes of the fight, and Marge and Maggie join them as well. Bart refuses to give in, but Homer drags him outside by force. The family sits the fight out and when everyone has left, Homer hesitantly cuts his cable hook-up while ignoring Bart's objection, but he accidentally ends up cutting the power to the whole neighborhood.|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just not getting it together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
500|$|The main talking {{point after}} the race was Hamilton's {{assertion}} {{that he would have}} preferred to go on a different strategy compared to his teammate to have a chance of passing him, an option denied by his team. Hamilton lobbied for his team to allow the drivers to take more risks, while his team principal, Toto Wolff, insisted that the team, not the drivers, were at liberty to make calls about strategy. Opinions on the matter were divided in the following days. [...] world champion Damon Hill shared Hamilton's frustration, saying: [...] "I have some sympathy with what Lewis was saying, the drivers should be allowed to call the shots - and if he wants to try something different and basically zag when <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> is zigging." [...] Daniel Johnson, writing for The Daily Telegraph, concurred: [...] "It was not just Hamilton's failure to win the Brazilian Grand Prix, following home an obdurate Nico Rosberg; it was the manner of it, lacking the killer move while obeying a Mercedes strategy which rendered the drivers more robots than racers." [...] Meanwhile, the Daily Mails Jonathan McEvoy agreed with Mercedes' call, saying that it was [...] "a no-brainer for Mercedes to keep their drivers comfortably first and second by the safest means".|$|E

500|$|Chamberlain {{joined a}} squad which {{featured}} Hall-of-Fame forward Elgin Baylor and Hall-of-Fame guard Jerry West, along with backup center Mel Counts, forwards Keith Erickson and Tom Hawkins and talented 5'11" [...] guard Johnny Egan. The {{lack of a}} second guard next to West (and thus, the lack of speed and quickness) concerned coach Butch Van Breda Kolff; after losing Clark and Gail Goodrich, who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 expansion draft, he said: [...] "Egan gets murdered on defense because of his [...] size...but if I don't play him, we look {{like a bunch of}} trucks." [...] In addition, Cherry observed that Chamberlain was neither a natural leader nor a loyal follower, which made him difficult to fit in. While he was on cordial terms with Jerry West, he often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor; regarding Baylor, he later explained: [...] "We were good friends, but... black culture... you never let <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> one-up you." [...] The greatest problem was his tense relationship with Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff: pejoratively calling the new recruit [...] "The Load", he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics. In return, the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as [...] "the dumbest and worst coach ever". Laker Keith Erickson observed that [...] "Butch catered to Elgin and Jerry...and that is not {{a good way to get}} on Wilt's side...that relationship was doomed from the start." ...|$|E
500|$|Moon {{displayed}} what {{he described}} as a humble and self-deprecating manner during the World Series of Poker, repeatedly acknowledging his lack of poker experience throughout the tournament, and often attributing his success to luck and a high number of strong cards, rather than talent. Moon adopted a phrase, [...] "If I win, I win. If I lose, I lose," [...] which reflected his casual approach to the game. Moon also said one of his philosophies was, [...] "Make <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>guy</b> pay to see the cards", a strategy attributed to many re-raises Moon made during the 2009 World Series of Poker despite weak hands. Moon had almost no experience in heads-up poker, which some commentators said factored into his loss against Cada in the final hours of the 2009 World Series. Many fans and commentators praised his working stiff style, with some dubbing him [...] "Darvin Gump", a reference to the underdog protagonist of the 1994 drama film, Forrest Gump. Moon has also been nicknamed the [...] "Luddite Logger" [...] because of his distaste for anything technological, including credit cards and online poker. Moon refused to sign a sponsorship deal with an Internet poker company during the 2009 tournament because {{he said he did not}} want to answer to anybody. Moon wore a New Orleans Saints hat throughout the tournament because, [...] "I like cheering for the underdog." [...] Moon was invited to guest at the Saints games for their entire playoff run in 2010, and watched them win Super Bowl XLIV against the Indianapolis Colts in Miami.|$|E
