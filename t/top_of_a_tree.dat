5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves {{at the end}} of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy. A sapling is a young tree.|$|E
5|$|Though the broad-billed parrot {{may have}} fed {{on the ground}} and been a weak flier, its tarsometatarsus was short and stout, {{implying}} some arboreal characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 Gelderland sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the alula appears large, a feature of slow-flying birds. Its sternal keel was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying Cyanoramphus parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless kakapo, with its vestigial keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> an improbable position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct Norfolk Island kaka.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{continued its}} descent through the 2040 feet step down altitude. The aircraft struck the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> continued for 634 feet, and then struck {{a group of}} aspen trees. Finally, the plane collided with two ridges and came to rest inverted and lying on its right side.|$|E
25|$|During {{breeding}} displays pairs sometimes {{fly into}} the air together and “literally loop and loop” (Burgess 1946, p.392) and a male may soar “singing, into the air from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> and suddenly drop(s), always turning over backward in its descent” (MacGillivray 1910). Males advertising territorial display will similarly, fly singing vertically into the air (Chapman, pers comm. 2014). Actions in the air appear similar to the black honeyeater (Burgess 1946) and flight is said to resemble that of the critically endangered regent honeyeater (Anthochaera phrygia) (North 1909).|$|E
25|$|O’Brien and {{his special}} effects crew also devised {{a way to}} use rear-projection in {{miniature}} sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected. A fan pumped cool air to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann in the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to a projected footage of Ann sitting.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes the rufous-tailed scrub robin {{is found}} in {{association}} with a woodchat shrike (Lanius senator), perhaps nesting in a neighbouring tree. The woodchat shrike perches near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> ever alert to sparrowhawks, buzzards and other aerial predators while the scrub robin perches on a bush or lower branch, scanning the ground for the approach of snakes, cats, weasels, foxes, genets, ocellated lizards and other predators. Both birds are adept at luring away predators by flying towards them to attract their attention and then flitting away from the nest site through the undergrowth. The rufous-tailed scrub robin can recognise the warning cries of other species of bird and take appropriate action.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Scuzzlebutt puts {{a star on}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> is a {{reference}} to a similar scene in the 1964 television special Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, in which the Abominable Snow Monster places a Christmas star atop a large tree. Mount Evanston, the fictional mountain in [...] "Volcano", was named after the real Mount Evans in the Front Range region of the Rocky Mountains in Clear Creek County, Colorado; Nichols Canyon in the episode was named after Kirt Nichols, a friend of Trey Parker. Jimbo blames the Democratic Party for passing overly restrictive laws on hunters and gun owners. Upon learning children are in danger due to the volcano, Mayor McDaniels seeks publicity for herself by contacting the television news programs Entertainment Tonight and Inside Edition.|$|E
2500|$|The song is a {{somewhat}} lark-like but often disjointed series of notes, sometimes clear and loud but {{at other times}} soft, and is sung from an elevated position near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> on a pole or on a wire. [...] It {{has been described as}} having a sad tone.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I never!" [...] exclaimed Sammy Jay, who {{had seen}} it all from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pine <b>tree.</b> [...] "Well, I never! I guess Farmer Brown's boy isn't so bad, after all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'You dirty creatures,' cried she, 'get away at once, or I {{will throw}} stones at you! And the doves spread their wings in a fright and flew {{up to the}} very <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree,</b> their bodies shaking with anger.|$|E

50|$|The Javan hawk-eagle is {{believed}} to be monogamous. The female usually lays one egg in a nest high on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forest <b>tree.</b> The diet consists mainly of birds, lizards, fruit bats and mammals.|$|R
60|$|He {{was awakened}} by the cackling of fowls and the bleating of calves and lambs. The sun was shining through the leafy <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> which lay almost against his window, and happy shadows were dancing like fairies on the coverlet of his bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was {{a narrow}} escape, and no fooling!" [...] he half muttered, {{as he looked}} about for some place where he might descend {{to the bottom of}} the gulch. A quarter of an hour later he had the deer bound on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> branch, and was {{dragging}} it toward the lake shore.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has already}} taken himself away," [...] {{suggested}} Hadden, while the audience tittered. [...] "No, King, do not touch it rashly; it is a repeating rifle.
