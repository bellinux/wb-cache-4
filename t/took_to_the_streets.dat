5|$|In 1930, {{a history}} of the Boston Transcript, the most resolutely anti-union of Boston's {{newspapers}} in 1919, perpetuated its original account of urban chaos during the strike's first nights. It described large crowds, including a number of sailors from docked naval ships, that <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> smashing windows, committing robbery and stoning bystanders and cars. It said that the northern, southern, and western areas of the city were all taken over by armed gangs.|$|E

5|$|The Houston riot of 1917 {{disturbed}} Du Bois {{and was a}} major setback {{to efforts}} to permit African Americans to become military officers. The riot began after Houston police arrested and beat two black soldiers; in response, over 100 black soldiers <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Houston and killed 16 whites. A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hung, and 67 others were imprisoned. In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.|$|E

5|$|After the December {{completion}} of the 2010 presidential election, Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% {{of the vote in}} elections. The runner-up opposition leader Andrei Sannikov received less than 3% of the vote; independent observers criticized the election as fraudulent. When opposition protesters <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> in Minsk, many people, including most rival presidential candidates, were beaten and arrested by the state militia. Many of the candidates, including Sannikov, were sentenced to prison or house arrest for terms which are mainly and typically over four years. Six months later amid an unprecedented economic crisis, activists utilized social networking to initiate a fresh round of protests characterized by wordless hand-clapping.|$|E
5|$|Anti-communist {{resistance}} in Poland was also bolstered, {{and a group}} of opposition leaders and cultural figures founded the Klub Krzywego Koła (Skewed Wheel Club) in Warsaw. It promoted discussions about Polish independence, questioned the efficiency of the state controlled economy, and government disdain and even persecution of veterans of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the Armia Krajowa resistance during World War II. While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with discussions and publications (bibuła), workers <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> The living conditions in Poland did not improve, contrary to government propaganda, and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party (nomenklatura).|$|E

5|$|Umar {{is said to}} have later regretted this decision. It is {{said that}} after the Hajj of 642, Umar had decided to re-appoint Khalid to the {{military}} services, apparently to command the Muslim conquest of Persia that was to begin shortly. But fate had decided otherwise, as when he reached Medina, news of Khalid's death reached him. The news of Khalid's death broke like a storm over Medina. The women <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> led by the women of the Banu Makhzum (Khalid's tribe), wailing and beating their chests. Though Umar, from the very first day had given orders {{that there would be no}} wailing for departed Muslims, as forbidden in Islam, in this one case he made an exception.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{relatively}} small mandate in terms of votes, some socialists <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> to free political prisoners, without waiting {{for the government to}} do so officially. There were claims of an imminent socialist or anarchist takeover. The right had firmly believed, at all levels, that they would win. Portela would, a year later, claim that Gil-Robles and General Francisco Franco had approached him within days to the election to propose a military takeover. Portela resigned, even before a new government could be formed. However, the Popular Front, which had proved an effective election tool, did not translate into a Popular Front government. Largo Caballero and other elements of the political left were not prepared to work with the republicans, although they did agree to support much of the proposed reforms. Manuel Azaña Díaz was called upon to form a government, but would shortly replace Zamora as president. The right began to conspire as to how to best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E

5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E
5|$|The libertines' {{downfall}} {{began with}} the February 1555 elections. By then, many of the French refugees had been granted citizenship and with their support, Calvin's partisans elected {{the majority of the}} syndics and the councillors. On 16 May the libertines <b>took</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> in a drunken protest and attempted to burn down a house that was supposedly full of Frenchmen. The syndic Henri Aulbert tried to intervene, carrying with him the baton of office that symbolised his power. Perrin seized the baton and waved it over the crowd, which gave the appearance that he was taking power and initiating a coup d'état. The insurrection was soon over when another syndic appeared and ordered Perrin to go with him to the town hall. Perrin and other leaders were forced to flee the city. With the approval of Calvin, the other plotters who remained in the city were found and executed. The opposition to Calvin's church polity came to an end.|$|E
