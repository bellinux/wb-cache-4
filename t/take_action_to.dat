5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} mimesis {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest.

The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E
