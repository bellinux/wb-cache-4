5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 {{grizzly bears}} {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more than half}} of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with grizzly bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, {{so that he would}} have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E

In August 2017, {{the state of}} Lower Saxony (German: Niedersachsen) banned the burqa along with the niqab in public schools.

They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again.

This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
25|$|With the {{disruption}} of Bryansk Front, 50th Army was reassigned to Western Front. Army Group Center's supplies had been barely adequate for the encirclement phases of Typhoon, and as the autumn rains turned the roads to mud, Guderian was forced to postpone his drive on Tula until Oct. 23. The town of Chern fell on the 25th, leaving another 95km to Tula. A battlegroup, forcing its way up the one available highway, got within 5km of the city on Oct. 29 and tried to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the march, but the defenders were prepared and drove the panzers off with strong antitank and antiaircraft fire. 50th Army was {{in a much better}} position for supplies, with munitions coming directly from Tula's factories.|$|E

500|$|The death-lay's {{version of}} the bishop's death was {{different}} from the vita. The bishop's killer was called Lalli. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food, cake from the oven and beer from the cellar, for himself and hay for his horse, and left nothing but ashes. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake Köyliönjärvi. There he killed him on the spot with an axe. Lalli then proceeded to steal the late holy man’s hat, called a mitre, and place it on his own head.

500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart or wherever stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E

Shortly after the auction, Hirst wrote to The Guardian citing some of Potter's limitations as a taxidermist, saying [...] "You can see he {{knew very little about}} anatomy and musculature, because some of the taxidermy is terrible—there's a kingfisher that looks nothing like a kingfisher" [...] He also showed appreciation for the displays: [...] "My own favourites are these tableaux: there's a kittens' wedding party, with all these kittens dressed up in costumes, even wearing jewellery. The kittens don't look much like kittens, but that's not the point. There's a rats' drinking party, too which puts a different construction on Wind in the Willows. And a group of hamsters playing cricket." [...] About the auction, Hirst said, [...] "I've offered £1m and to pay for the cost of the auctioneer's catalogue – just for them to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> the market and keep the collection intact – but apparently, the auction has to go ahead.
