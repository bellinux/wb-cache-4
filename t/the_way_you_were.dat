And he doesn't love me. He wasn't brought up <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country." [...] In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, [...] "Some people thought it was racist—I thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn't racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism." [...] White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani [...] "that it was a horrible thing to say", but said he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.|$|E

But when you used to be in your cave, Sibyl, and to be inspired, there was (and there remains still in some small measure), beyond the merely formative and sustaining power, another, which we painters call 'passion'--I don't know what the philosophers call it; we know it makes people red, or white; and therefore it must be something, itself; and perhaps it is the most truly 'poetic' or 'making' force of all, creating a world of its own out of a glance, or a sigh: and the want of passion is perhaps the truest death, or 'unmaking' of everything;--even of stones.

6000|$|To this Barnaby made no reply, but, {{what with}} wonder and the {{dizziness}} of his head, seated {{himself at the}} table over against his interlocutor, who pushed a bottle of rum towards him, together with a glass from the hanging rack.

But now everybody is gone--everybody--as they went away, each said, that perhaps my mother would be better, before we were quite deserted. But three days ago I went to Samuel Woods, who, on account of his new-born child, remained to the last; and there being a large family of them, I thought I could persuade them to wait a little longer for us; but I found the house deserted. I have not seen a soul since, till this good man came. --What will become of us? My mother does not know our state; she is so ill, that I have hidden it from her.|$|E

"I don't {{know what}} I had {{expected}} to see, but I was never more surprised than when, getting there, I {{found that it was}} a trunk, and that in it, sitting up, was a child about eighteen months old. That was you, Harry. In the bottom of the trunk were a locket with a woman's likeness in it, a curious Indian bangle, and a few other articles of jewelry. How you got there we never knew, but the supposition was that when the pirate was overhauling the merchantman, and her true nature was ascertained, some mother, knowing the fate that awaited all on board, had put you in an open trunk, had thrown in what ornaments she had about her, and had dropped the trunk overboard, in hopes that it might drift away and be picked up by some passing ship. It was a wild venture, with a thousand to one against its success, but the Lord had watched over it, and there you were as snug and comfortable as if you had been laying in your own cot, though, by <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> squalling as loud as a litter of kittens, and I expect had missed your breakfast considerably. You were sitting up, and it was lucky that you were backward of your age, for, although by your size we guessed you to be eighteen months, you were still unable to walk. If you had been as active as some chaps of that age you would have scrambled onto your feet, and no doubt capsized your boat.|$|E
6000|$|MRS WARREN. I {{mean that}} youre {{throwing}} away all your chances for nothing. You {{think that people}} are what they pretend to be: that <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> taught at school and college to think right and proper is the way things really are. But it's not: it's all only a pretence, to keep the cowardly slavish common run of people quiet. Do you want to find that out, like other women, at forty, when you've thrown yourself away and lost your chances; or won't you take it in good time now from your own mother, that loves you and swears to you that it's truth: gospel truth? [Urgently] Vivie: the big people, the clever people, the managing people, all know it. They do as I do, and think what I think. I know plenty of them. I know them to speak to, to introduce you to, to make friends of for you. I don't mean anything wrong: thats what you don't understand: your head is full of ignorant ideas about me. What do the people that taught you know about life or about people like me? When did they ever meet me, or speak to me, or let anyone tell them about me? the fools! Would they ever have done anything for you if I hadn't paid them? Havn't I told you that I want you to be respectable? Havn't I brought you up to be respectable? And how can you keep it up without my money and my influence and Lizzie's friends? Can't you see that youre cutting your own throat as well as breaking my heart in turning your back on me? ...|$|E

5000|$|Commenting on her {{affinity}} with Wharton, Robinson notes, “Wharton and I come from similar backgrounds. I {{grew up with}} the rules that governed her: emotions were to be strictly controlled, pain was not to be acknowledged, and the rules of decorum were to be obeyed. I’ve always been fascinated by her unblinking exegesis of all this, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> when someone breaks <b>the</b> rules, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> when <b>you</b> read something and think, “What? Are you allowed to write about this?” Wharton wrote about her world {{in a way that made}} it possible for me - and for all of us who come after her - to go into our own worlds still further, and to tease out the innermost reaches of pain and passion from the decorous woven fabric of our lives.” ...|$|R
