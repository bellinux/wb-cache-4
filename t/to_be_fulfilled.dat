5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose.

His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fulfilled</b> and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E
