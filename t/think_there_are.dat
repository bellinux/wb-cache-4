25|$|I {{sometimes}} <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two Wagners in our culture, almost unrecognizably {{different from}} one another: the Wagner possessed by those who know his work, and the Wagner imagined by {{those who know him}} only by name and reputation.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are,</b> which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.|$|E
25|$|The {{mark of a}} great cabinetmaker is his {{combination}} of design and execution. It's how well they resolve the challenges of designing a piece coupled with their craftsmanship and technique. Pabst was the most distinguished cabinetmaker in Philadelphia {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century. Clearly, the quality of his carving and cabinetmaking is of the highest order, and Philadelphia has a tradition of producing superior furniture since the 18th century, overshadowing Boston and New York.Daniel Pabst really did develop a unique and identifiable decorative vocabulary. He tended to envelop the object's architecture with a fine scale pattern; it was an invention of his own. He wasn't aping the European antecedent. While I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> masterpieces of Pabst's not from Furness's pen, he certainly benefitted from his close association with the architect.Pabst's Modern Gothic work presents the very germ of the modern movement. Like Christopher Dresser and Bruce Talbert, he conventionalized design, departing from the realistic motifs of the mid-19th century. You can see where this reductivity evolves into the Craftsman style.— Andrew Van Styn, furniture scholar & dealer.|$|E
5000|$|Memories of the 1960s {{shaped the}} {{political}} landscape for the next half-century. As Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton explained in 1990, [...] "If {{you look back on}} the Sixties and <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more good than bad, you're probably a Democrat. If you <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more harm than good, you're probably a Republican." ...|$|R

500|$|In November 2014, Johnson affirmed his {{intention}} {{to run for the}} 2016 Libertarian nomination. In July 2015, Johnson reiterated {{his intention}}s for a presidential campaign but stated he was not announcing anything imminently: [...] "I just <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more downsides than upsides to announcing at this point, and, look, I don't have any delusions about the process. In retrospect, 90 percent of the time I spent [...] ended up to be wasted time." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{promoting}} {{her first}} international album in the United States, she was reportedly offered {{a role as}} a Bond Girl in The World Is Not Enough, {{as well as in}} High Fidelity. Anggun refused being an actress and said:"I was born a singer. I won't go into another profession, because I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> still many people out there who were born to be movie stars or models. My calling is music." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} were outspokenly {{critical}} of peer-to-peer file sharing networks, {{due to the}} negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with NY Rock in 2000, Keenan stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{a lot of other}} industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, {{people who are trying to}} write songs." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{promoting}} 2014's The Endless River, Nick Mason named A Saucerful of Secrets as his favourite of Pink Floyd's studio albums. “I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> ideas contained {{there that}} we have continued to use {{all the way through}} our career,” he says. “I think [...] was a quite good way of marking Syd ’s departure and Dave ’s arrival. It’s rather nice to have it on one record, where you get both things. It’s a cross-fade rather than a cut.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{in charge of}} the Phoenix VA facility, who had been on administrative leave for almost seven months, was fired. While on administrative leave, she was paid over $90,000. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz, said that the payments were [...] "a completely unacceptable use of taxpayer dollars that should instead go to providing care for veterans." [...] Dr. Sam Foote said that the firing was [...] "a good first step" [...] and that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a lot of others who need to follow her out the door." ...|$|E
500|$|... "For me, it's {{really easy}} to write {{depressive}} songs and that's why I never do that. I {{try to do}} songs that are a bit happier and a bit more complicated. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> too many songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, and I find it really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit}} of melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 1824, Irving {{published}} {{the collection of}} essays Tales of a Traveller—including the short story [...] "The Devil and Tom Walker"—under his Geoffrey Crayon persona. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> in it {{some of the best}} things I have ever written", Irving told his sister. But while the book sold respectably, Traveller was dismissed by critics, who panned both Traveller and its author. [...] "The public have been led to expect better things", wrote the United States Literary Gazette, while the New-York Mirror pronounced Irving [...] "overrated". Hurt and depressed by the book's reception, Irving retreated to Paris where he spent the next year worrying about finances and scribbling down ideas for projects that never materialized.|$|E
500|$|In April 2011, Favreau and Roberto Orci {{appeared}} at WonderCon in San Francisco, where they presented nine minutes of film footage and answered {{questions about the}} film. Favreau explained that marketing would show [...] "only a brief glimpse of the aliens of the title" [...] before the film is released. He explained the withholding of certain elements, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> enough visionary people involved with this film {{that there is an}} understanding that there is a personality that the marketing campaign can take on as well as the film itself [...] [...] [...] I {{want to make sure that}} if the audience goes to see , there is going to be a lot of surprises in it that they haven't seen in the marketing materials." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2001, Tool {{announced}} a new album, Systema Encéphale, along with a 12-song track list containing titles such as [...] "Riverchrist", [...] "Numbereft", [...] "Encephatalis", [...] "Musick", and [...] "Coeliacus". File-sharing networks such as Napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names. At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to their impact on artists that are dependent on record sales to continue their careers. Keenan said during an interview with NY Rock in 2000, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{a lot of other}} industries out there that might deserve being destroyed.

I would take one gold medal over five bronze medals any day." [...] Hunt also announced that the BOA would conduct a strategic review of funding and may support the channeling of more funds towards realistic medal hopes.|$|R
500|$|He was not {{a typical}} movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was {{grateful}} for his appearance as it made him believable {{in a wide range}} of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> other people who are interested in what I do." ...|$|E

I want the joy that I {{used to get}} seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> guys in the tank… What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ultra Jump Egg, Urobuchi gave insight into his writing philosophy, stating that he believed the overarching plot of a story {{was more important than}} the characters within it. He indicated that he would first determine the actions and the ultimate fate of a character before even assigning it a name, and contrasted this with other writing methods which first focused on developing the characters and then creating a storyline for them to follow. He again defended his decision to have Mami die, claiming that this could actually have the converse effect of making her character even more memorable, saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> quite many characters who became immortal exactly because they died, like Caesar Zeppeli in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or Raoh in Fist of the North Star. Precisely {{because of the way they}} died, they were able to live forever." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I {{think that a lot}} of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E
500|$|Sunset Studies {{critical}} reception, however, {{was very}} positive; Noel Mengel of The Courier-Mail {{said that on}} the album, [...] "songs of quiet reflection, starkly beautiful melodies and intimate poetry collide on the canvas without a thought to sales graphs or what radio program directors might think", while Allmusic's Jack Rabid told American readers [...] "it's worth the effort to track down , particularly for those who <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no more musical craftsmen out there". The album's production earned it the 2001 ARIA Award for Engineer of the Year, as well as nominations for [...] "Producer of the Year", [...] "Breakthrough Artist - Album" [...] and [...] "Best Cover Art". Of the album's six engineers, Paul McKercher, Chris Thompson, Richard Pleasance, and Chris Dickie were credited with the ARIA Award for best engineer. McKercher and Pleasance, {{as well as the}} band, were named producers. Of the singles released from the album, [...] "There Is No Such Place" [...] was the most popular, charting at number 47 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2001.|$|E
