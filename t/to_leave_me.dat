25|$|I saw in {{his hand}} a long spear of gold, and at the point {{there seemed to be}} a little fire. He {{appeared}} to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...|$|E

500|$|Brad Renfro stars {{alongside}} McKellen as Todd Bowden, a 16-year-old who discovers Denker's criminal past. Singer auditioned {{a couple}} hundred young men and chose 14-year-old Renfro, saying of him, [...] "Brad was the brightest, the most intense and the most real. Not only could he have the intensity when we wanted, there was a hollowness that he could convey, {{and by the end}} of the picture he had to become this empty vessel." [...] Portraying a manipulative character temporarily influenced Renfro, who said that people around him were worried about his state of mind. Renfro said of his performance, [...] "It's a trip I have to take. People just kind of have <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> alone when I'm doing it. It's my job." [...] Singer described his impression of the character: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{genesis of}} Edward Scissorhands {{came from a}} drawing by then-teenaged {{director}} Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. [...] "I get the feeling people just got this urge to want <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> alone for some reason, I don't know exactly why." [...] During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was [...] "about an abortion that came back to life". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands. [...] "Every detail {{was so important to}} Tim because it was so personal", Thompson remarked. She wrote Scissorhands as a [...] "love poem" [...] to Burton, calling him [...] "the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together".|$|E
2500|$|Barrington made six 50s in {{his first}} ten innings for Surrey, but then had a string of low scores and was made tweflth man for the First Test against South Africa. This hit him deeply and he told Micky Stewart [...] "They'll never be able <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> out again, I am going to see to that". Even Wisden noted that being dropped [...] "seemed to weight on him and his disdained the {{slightest}} risk" [...] He made 126, 63 and 62 in his next three matches and {{was back in the}} team for the Second Test at Lord's, famous for the South African bowler Geoff Griffin taking a hat-trick and being no-balled out of Test cricket. Barrington made only 24 in England's innings victory, top-scored with 80 in the Third Test and hit the winning run after being missed in the slips before scoring. He top-scored in both innings in the Fourth Test with 76 and 35 and was dismissed by Trevor Goddard for the fourth time in a row. He failed in the Fifth Test, but England won 3–0 and Barrington ended with 227 runs (37.83). There was no tour that winter, so he went to Rhodesia and South Africa with the International Cavaliers, under Richie Benaud, who taught him the flipper, and he became friends with Bobby Simpson.|$|E
2500|$|By mid-September 1939, Freud's {{cancer of}} the jaw was causing him {{increasingly}} severe pain and had been declared to be inoperable. The last book he read, Balzac's La Peau de chagrin, prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty {{and a few days}} later he turned to his doctor, friend and fellow refugee, Max Schur, reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness: [...] "Schur, you remember our 'contract' not <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> in the lurch when the time had come. Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense." [...] When Schur replied that he had not forgotten, Freud said, [...] "I thank you," [...] and then [...] "Talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it's right, then make an end of it." [...] Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father's death, but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud's death around 3am on 23 September 1939. However, discrepancies in the various accounts Schur gave of his role in Freud's final hours, which have in turn led to inconsistencies between Freud's main biographers, has led to further research and a revised account. This proposes that Schur was absent from Freud's deathbed when a third and final dose of morphine was administered by Dr Josephine Stross, a colleague of Anna Freud's, leading to Freud's death around midnight on 23 September 1939.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1950, Sal gets the itch to travel again while Dean is working as a parking lot {{attendant}} in Manhattan, living with his girlfriend Inez. Sal notices {{that he has been}} reduced to simple pleasures—listening to basketball games and looking at erotic playing cards. By bus Sal takes to the road again, passing Washington, D.C., Ashland, Cincinnati, and St. Louis, and eventually reaching Denver. There he meets Stan Shephard, and the two plan to go to Mexico City when they learn that Dean has bought a car and is on the way to join them. In a rickety '37 Ford sedan the three set off across Texas to Laredo, where they cross the border. They are ecstatic, having left [...] "everything behind us and entering a new and unknown phase of things." [...] Their money buys more (10 cents for a beer), police are laid back, cannabis is readily available, and people are curious and friendly. The landscape is magnificent. In Gregoria, they meet Victor, a local kid, who leads them to a bordello where they have their last grand party, dancing to mambo, drinking, and having fun with prostitutes. In Mexico City Sal becomes ill from dysentery and is [...] "delirious and unconscious." [...] Dean leaves him, and Sal later reflects that [...] "when I got better I realized what a rat he was, but then I had to understand the impossible complexity of his life, how he had <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> there, sick, to get on with his wives and woes." ...|$|E
