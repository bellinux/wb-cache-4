Building work across the Scilly Isles continued, expanding to include the neighbouring island of St Mary's, and at least 540 oak trees from South Wales were dispatched to the islands in early 1550, since the islands lacked suitable sources of timber of their own. Orders were given in 1551 to send bows, arrows and the ingredients required to make gunpowder to the islands, where construction teams were kept at work through to the end of 1552.|$|E

5|$|Following this {{successful}} demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially {{as a spy}} of the Army of the Rhine. Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, {{he was concerned about}} his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-4 {{is named}} for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA {{telescope}} tasked with finding Earth-like planets that transit their stars as seen from Earth. As the previous three planets that Kepler confirmed had already been confirmed by other finds, Kepler-4 and its planet {{were the first to}} be discovered by the Kepler team. The star and its system were announced in Washington, D.C. at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010, along with Kepler-5, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. Of the presented planets, Kepler-4b was the smallest, around the size of planet Neptune. The discovery of Kepler-4b and the other planets presented at the AAS meeting helped <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kepler spacecraft was indeed functional.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is centred on the Storkyrkan church, first mentioned in historical records in 1279 and gradually enlarged {{over the following}} centuries. In 1468–1496, {{during the reign of}} Sten Sture the Elder, its size was doubled — the chapels where transformed into aisles, while rounded windows and a taller roof allowed more light into the building. The building in the painting depicts the church as it must have appeared when Gustav Vasa became king — the buttresses added in the 1550s are not present in the painting, which seem <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 17th century copy was faithful to the original. The church still exists, although the present exterior is mostly a later Baroque design.|$|E
5|$|After initiation, {{the child}} {{regularly}} visits the hospital outpatient clinic where {{he or she}} is seen by the dietitian and neurologist, and various tests and examinations are performed. These are held every three months for the first year and then every six months thereafter. Infants under one year old are seen more frequently, with the initial visit held after just two to four weeks. A period of minor adjustments is necessary to ensure consistent ketosis is maintained and to better adapt the meal plans to the patient. This fine-tuning is typically done over the telephone with the hospital dietitian and includes changing the number of calories, altering the ketogenic ratio, or adding some MCT or coconut oils to a classic diet. Urinary ketone levels are checked daily to detect whether ketosis has been achieved and <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> patient is following the diet, though the level of ketones does not correlate with an anticonvulsant effect. This is performed using ketone test strips containing nitroprusside, which change colour from buff-pink to maroon in the presence of acetoacetate (one of the three ketone bodies).|$|E

5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers and mobile rolling barriers that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but}} to receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E

25|$|Peel's {{enthusiasm for}} music outside the {{mainstream}} occasionally brought him into conflict with the Radio 1 hierarchy. On one occasion, the then station controller Derek Chinnery contacted John Walters and asked him <b>to</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show was not playing any punk, which he (Chinnery) had read about {{in the press and}} of which he disapproved. Chinnery was evidently somewhat surprised by Walters' reply that in recent weeks they had been playing little else.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{clinical}} decision-making, a simple, minimally invasive, in-office procedure may be performed, the rotator cuff impingement test. A {{small amount of}} a local anesthetic and an injectable corticosteroid are injected into the subacromial space to block pain and to provide anti-inflammatory relief. If pain disappears and shoulder function remains good, no further testing is pursued.
