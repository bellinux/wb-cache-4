5|$|Later during World War II, with Germany {{suffering}} major defeat on all fronts, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and {{his fellow}} conspirators decided to eliminate Hitler and the Nazi leadership, establish a new government and save Germany from total destruction. Stauffenberg had his opportunity on 20 July 1944 at a military briefing at Hitler's East Prussian headquarters known as the Wolf's Lair (Wolfsschanze). He managed to get through security and plant a briefcase bomb under <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>table.</b> The bomb exploded, fatally wounding three officers and a stenographer who died shortly thereafter. Hitler survived with only minor injuries, as did everyone else who was shielded from the bomb blast by <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>table</b> leg.|$|E

25|$|Although the Johnson Administration ended {{under the}} cloud of the Vietnam War, Clifford {{concluded}} his short term as Secretary of Defense with his reputation actually enhanced. He got along well with the U.S. Congress, and this helped him to secure approval of {{at least some of}} his proposals. He settled into his duties quickly and efficiently, and capably managed the initial de-escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam; indeed, he apparently strongly influenced Johnson in favor of a de-escalation strategy. As he left office to return to his law practice in Washington, Clifford expressed the hope and expectation that international tensions would abate, citing the shift in the Vietnam confrontation from the battlefield to <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>table,</b> and the evident willingness of the Soviet Union to discuss limitations on strategic nuclear weapons.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{the justices}} hear oral {{arguments}} {{each morning and}} meet that afternoon for private deliberation of the cases heard that morning. The member designated to write the in a case opinion directs discussion of it by asking the justice seated at <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>table</b> to the right for comments. The justices then comment in turn with the member designated to write the opinion speaking last. This discussion and debate provide the opinion writer guidance to prepare an opinion reflecting the views {{of a majority of}} the justices. Once a justice has completed a draft of his opinion, copies are circulated to {{the other members of the}} court and the Court Reporter. The court meets again before the next session to review and revise the circulated drafts until they receive final approval. Opinions are made public on the last day of each session, usually the very next session after argument, and are published in the Virginia Reports.|$|E
25|$|Yeovil started September by {{extending}} their winning run to five consecutive matches, with further victories 2–0 against Farnborough, and 2–1 versus Northwich Victoria. Two away draws followed against Stevenage Borough and Hereford United. On 20 September, Yeovil beat Halifax Town 3–0 despite having two men sent off after a mass brawl saw Abdoulaye Demba and Terry Skiverton both dismissed for violent conduct. On 22 September, Stockport County signed defender Anthony Tonkin for £50,000, a transfer that saw manager Gary Johnson hit {{out at the}} power of agents alleging that Tonkin's representative advised the player to refuse to play against Halifax. Yeovil marked their return to their newly relaid Huish Park pitch with an emphatic 4–0 victory over Woking. On 28 September, a 4–2 victory away at Leigh RMI saw Yeovil hit the top of <b>the</b> <b>Conference</b> <b>table.</b> The {{end of the month}} saw the club bring in French-born Moroccan left sided player Abdou El-Kholti as a replacement for the departed Tonkin.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{comic book}} writer Stan Lee as himself. In John Ortved's book , Lee {{stated that he}} attended the episode's table read, and {{was impressed with the}} size and quality of the creative staff, who all sat around <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>table.</b> Lee recalled in 2009, [...] "Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife." [...] Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot. But hey one lives in hope." [...] The voice actor who plays Angry Dad in the episode was portrayed by Dan Castellaneta, who also does the voice for Homer among other characters in the series. The design of the character is also based on Castellaneta.|$|E

500|$|From 2004 to 2007, {{the number}} of people {{confined}} in the Hole increased from 40 to up to 100. They slept in cots or sleeping bags, squeezed into every available floor space or on desktops. Men would sleep around <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>table</b> while women slept in cubicles and small offices around the main conference room. They were so crowded that there was barely any room to move, according to one of those present: [...] "Everyone sleeping with only about six inches on either side. Above you. Below you. Getting {{up in the middle of}} the night, you'd disturb everyone." [...] They were only allowed to leave to attend Church events or to be taken to a shower in a nearby maintenance garage, to which they were taken two at a time under guard. Food was brought to them on golf carts from the Gold Base mess hall, as the executives were not allowed to eat with the rest of the staff, and they were only given ten to fifteen minutes to eat. According to one of the executives, the food was [...] "like leftovers, slop, bits of meat, soupy kind of leftovers thrown into a pot and cooked and barely edible." [...] The building was said to be infested with ants and on several occasions the electricity was turned off, causing the temperature inside to reach [...] due to the lack of air conditioning.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{plan for the}} operation, codenamed Gibraltar, was prepared {{as early as the}} 1950s; however it seemed appropriate to push this plan forward given the scenario. Backed by then foreign minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and others, the aim was an [...] "attack by infiltration" [...] by a specially trained irregular force of some 40,000 men, highly motivated and well armed. It was reasoned that the conflict could be confined only to Kashmir. In the words of retired Pakistani General Akhtar Hussain Malik, the aims were [...] "to defreeze the Kashmir problem, weaken Indian resolve, and bring India to <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>table</b> without provoking general war." [...] As a result, groundwork and intelligence gathering for execution of the plan was laid by launching [...] "Operation Nusrat", the purpose of which was to locate gaps in the Cease Fire Line (CFL) that were to serve as entry points for the mujahideen, and to gauge the response of the Indian army and the local population.|$|E

2500|$|A {{production}} {{which made}} much of its unedited status came in 1977, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, where Terry Hands presented all three Henry VI plays with Alan Howard as Henry and Helen Mirren as Margaret. Although the production was only moderately successful at the box office, it was critically lauded at the time for Alan Howard's unique portrayal of Henry. Howard adopted historical details concerning the real Henry's madness into his performance, presenting the character as constantly {{on the brink of}} a mental and emotional breakdown. Possibly as a reaction to a recent adaptation of the trilogy under the general title Wars of the Roses, which was strongly political, Hands attempted to ensure his own production was entirely apolitical; [...] "Wars of the Roses was a study in power politics: its central image was <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>table,</b> and Warwick, the scheming king-maker, was the central figure.

[...] Aside from Howard and Mirren, the production starred Alfred Lynch as Edward and Anton Lesser as Richard.|$|E

2500|$|On June–July 1932 Papen {{represented}} Germany at the Lausanne conference {{where on}} 9 July 1932 reparations were cancelled, which Papen followed up by [...] "repudiating" [...] Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (President Hindenburg had repudiated Article 231 in 1927, {{a speech that}} Papen appeared not to be aware of). Speaking at the Lausanne Conference, Papen blamed all of Germany's economic problems on the Treaty of Versailles, saying: [...] "The external debt of Germany, with its very heavy interest charges, is, for the most, attributable to the transfers of capital, and the withdrawals of credits which have been the consequence of {{the execution of the}} Treaty of Versailles and of the reparations agreements." [...] During the conference, Papen become famous for his unorthodox style of diplomacy, as he took to speaking frankly to the press about what was going during the conference, which greatly annoyed the other delegates who did not appreciate Papen leaking everything to the media. Papen's intention in leaking so much was to appeal to public opinion in France and Britain by portraying Germany as economically victimized by the Treaty of Versailles as a way of forcing concessions. Papen's tactics failed as he came across as believing that Germany was the only nation in the world suffering from the Great Depression, which did not appeal much to the British and French people who were also suffering. Papen expressed the viewpoint both at <b>the</b> <b>conference</b> <b>table</b> and to the media that Germany was a wronged nation and it was up to France and Britain to make all the concessions, and he should not have to make any compromises.|$|E
