30|$|A {{possible}} concern {{related to}} the econometric modelling is the existence of reverse causality, meaning {{that the level of}} income inequality in a society depends on the preferences for redistribution of its members. This will be true if the government genuinely aligns its policies with the redistributive preferences of the individuals and sets up a taxation system that will cancel out any increase in pre-tax and transfer income inequality. However, it is difficult to establish that a change in redistributive preferences leads to a change in the taxation system at least in the short-run. Recall that the analysis employs bi-annual survey waves collected between 2002 and 2012, so the period may be too short to expect a relation running from preferences to inequality. In any case, it has been detected that pre-tax and pre-transfer income inequality positively and significantly affects the preferences for redistribution. As pointed out by Karabarbounis (2011), the use of pre-tax and <b>transfer</b> <b>incomes</b> instead of net incomes to construct the measure of inequality relaxes somewhat the reverse causation because net incomes vary automatically with the fiscal system, whilst pre-tax and <b>transfer</b> <b>incomes</b> vary only through the endogenous response of labour supply or the general equilibrium effects on factor prices. The same author uses lags of gross income inequality and their averages to mitigate the effects of redistribution on inequality through labour supply and general equilibrium effects. In addition, the top 1 % income share is also computed with pre-tax and <b>transfer</b> <b>incomes</b> so that this indicator also has the same desirable features of Gini market. As reported in Table  6, the results are robust with lags (and averages of lags) of pre-tax and transfer income inequality and top income shares.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Michigan has {{undergone}} enormous labor market changes since the 1990 s affecting employment, income, and poverty. This paper examines changes in poverty among working {{families and their}} policy-related and socio-demographic determinants between 1998 / 1999 and 2007 / 2008 in Michigan. Findings suggest the rates of ‘poverty ’ and ‘near poverty ’ to be between five and 19 percent among working families, with slightly higher rates for the latter period. Public transfers combining taxes and means-tested supports, albeit making some impact among poor families with children, were unable to lower these rates. While the major sociodemographic characteristics of poverty and near poverty including large families with children and young, never married, single mother, and immigrant householders apply to working families, the roles of gender, race, marital status, and education manifest through many policyrelated variables such as work hours, wages, and <b>transfer</b> <b>incomes.</b> These findings {{have important implications for}} understanding working poverty in Michigan and beyond...|$|E
40|$|For the {{integration}} of unemployed persons into the first labour market, the reservation wage of the unemployed plays an important role. It is the wage level from which the unemployed person is prepared to accept a job offer. The paper examines the level and the determinants of reservation wages ascertained in the socio-economic panel (GSOEP 2000). Reservation wages in Germany are on average above wages before unemployment and very high in international comparison. It seems that unemployed take their last wage rate before unemployment as a guideline and reduce wage demands only slightly with longer unemployment. Unemployed people with low incomes before unemployment show a clearly higher relative reservation wage than unemployed people with a high former income - due to the small wage gap by the relatively high <b>transfer</b> <b>incomes.</b> Individual personal characteristics are most important, not macro-economic factors of influence.

We use a framework proposed by Ehrlich and Becker (1972) in the economics of insurance literature to first clarify the concepts and then take a “comprehensive ” approach to insurance and protection. Our approach starts with the choice problem of a representative individual facing risk, who chooses optimal levels of market insurance, self-insurance and self-protection. Market insurance and selfinsurance <b>transfer</b> <b>incomes</b> between good states and bad (without changing the probabilities) while self-protection lowers the probability of the bad state (without affecting any transfers across states). Prices and costs are crucial in determining the optimal allocation. We illustrate the usefulness of the framework by considering the example of unemployment insurance (as market insurance), precautionary saving (as selfinsurance) and investments in human capital (as self-protection).

40|$|ABSTRACT The poor {{economic}} {{position of}} single-mother households {{is a result}} of three factors: women's generally lower wages, lower economic support from men, and a relatively great need for income. This paper examines the relative importance of the last two of these factors. Data from the Luxembourg Income Study show that single-mother households in West Germany and the United States have high rates of poverty while their situation in Sweden is considerably better. The remainder of the analysis concentrates on the economic risks which would be faced by married parents if they were to separate tomorrow, and on the insurance <b>transfer</b> <b>incomes</b> provide against such risks. It is shown, first, that the costs of breaking one household into two are considerable, and that single-mother households will be worse off economically, unless a substantial increase in family income takes place. Second, that the economic dependence of married mothers places many in a 'high risk ' situation, where they will lose a high proportion of their economic resources if the support from a spouse disappears. Finally, the analysis shows that transfer income respresents a poor insurance against the risk resulting from women's economic dependence...|$|E

We hypothesized that pre-tax, pre-transfer income inequality would be determined by labor market institutions (union density, bargaining centralization), labor market conditions (unemployment), and economic structures (post-industrialism, third world imports). We hypothesized that the reduction in inequality would be determined by political configurations: directly by left government and indirectly via their effect on welfare state generosity by left government and Christian democratic government.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the relationship between social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> and the <b>income</b> security of the working poor. The specific {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the poverty reduction effect of social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> among the working poor from 1998 to 2005, during the pre NBLSA period (from 1998 to 2001) and the post NBLSA period (from 2002 to 2005). Particularly, this study compared the effect sizes of social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> and private <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> on poverty reduction. While the main target population of this study was the working poor, this study also examined poverty reduction of the non-working poor as well. ^ To achieve the study aim, this study used the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS), a nine-year panel dataset that includes 5, 000 households with 13, 300 individual cases. This study consists of cross-sectional macro-level analysis and longitudinal micro-level analysis. First, by employing a macro-level approach, this study examined the overall poverty reduction effectiveness of the current social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> among the working poor. Second, by employing a micro-level approach, this study also examined the impact of social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> and poverty reduction dynamics of individual households. ^ The results of the macro-level analysis supported most of the hypotheses. First of all, both social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> and private <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> have reduced the poverty rate and the aggregate poverty gap among the working poor as well as among the non-working poor over the nine-year period. The micro-level analysis identified elements affecting the poverty gap and the propensity to escape from poverty of individual households. ^ The empirical evidence indicates that the NBLSA has significantly improved the poverty reduction effect of social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> especially for the working poor. As such, it seems that the NBLSA has succeeded in accomplishing its intended goal, which was to expand the coverage of social welfare to the working poor. Another implication of the present study involves the family type and the effect of <b>income</b> <b>transfers.</b> As shown in micro-level analysis, while social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> more effectively reduce the poverty gap among no children families, they are relatively less effective among two-parent with children families. ...|$|R
