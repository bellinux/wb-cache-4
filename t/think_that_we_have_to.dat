5000|$|Kennedy {{delivered}} his first campaign speech on March 18 at Kansas State University, {{where he had}} previously agreed to give a lecture honoring former Kansas governor and Republican Alfred Landon. At Kansas State, Kennedy drew a [...] "record-setting crowd of 14,500 students" [...] for his Landon Lecture. In his speech, Kennedy apologized for early mistakes and attacked President Johnson's Vietnam policy saying, [...] "I was involved {{in many of the}} early decisions on Vietnam, decisions which helped set us on our present path." [...] He further acknowledged that [...] "past error is not excuse for its own perpetration." [...] Later that day at the University of Kansas Kennedy spoke to an audience of 19,000—one of the largest in the university's history. During that speech he said, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> shoot each other, to beat each other, to curse each other and criticize each other, I think that we can do better in this country. And that is why I run for President of the United States." [...] From Kansas, Kennedy went on to campaign in the Democratic primaries in Indiana, Washington, D.C., Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, and California.|$|E
5000|$|I {{believe that}} we {{probably}} have lost the culture war. That doesn't mean the war {{is not going to}} continue, and that it isn't going to be fought on other fronts. But in terms of society in general, we have lost. This is why, even when we win in politics, our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important.Therefore, what seems to me a legitimate strategy for us to follow is to look at ways to separate ourselves from the institutions that have been captured by the ideology of Political Correctness, or by other enemies of our traditional culture.What I mean by separation is, for example, what the homeschoolers have done. Faced with public school systems that no longer educate but instead 'condition' students with the attitudes demanded by Political Correctness, they have seceded. They have separated themselves from public schools and have created new institutions, new schools, in their homes.I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look at a whole series of possibilities for bypassing the institutions that are controlled by the enemy. If we expend our energies on fighting on the [...] "turf" [...] they already control, we will probably not accomplish what we hope, and we may spend ourselves to the point of exhaustion.|$|E

If I Can Dream was released in commemoration of Elvis' 80th birthday celebration throughout 2015. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla Presley, said the vision of the album was to keep Elvis relevant: [...] "Our culture and music has changed so drastically, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep Elvis right in line and do whatever we can to keep him current". Priscilla Presley also said the album is carrying the [...] "DNA of Elvis Presley and keeping him authentic". The album was named after Elvis's 1968 single of the same name. Presley continued: [...] "This would be a dream come true for Elvis. He would have loved to play with such a prestigious symphony orchestra. The music…the force that you feel with his voice and the orchestra is exactly what he would have done." ...|$|E
5000|$|On September 15, 2015, Pope Francis named Cupich to {{participate}} in the Synod of Bishops in Rome in October, adding him to those proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. There he supported proposals to provide a path for remarried persons {{to participate}} in communion and to respect the decisions that those who remarry or gays in relationships [...] "make about their spiritual lives". Cupich identified himself with those synod fathers who favored a pastoral approach that begins with encountering each person's specific circumstances and highlighted the importance of conscience. He said: I try to help people along the way. And people come to a decision in good conscience. Then our job with the church is to help them move forward and respect that. The conscience is inviolable. And we have to respect that when they make decisions and I've always done that. With respect to communion for those in same-sex relationships, he said: My role as a pastor is to help them to discern what the will of God is by looking at the objective moral teaching of the Church and yet, at the same time, helping them through a period of discernment to understand what God is calling them to at that point. It’s for everybody. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make sure that we don’t pigeonhole one group as though they {{are not part of the}} human family, as though there’s a different set of rules for them.

Even now, there are some crops which have not moved on in terms of productivity and quality, whereas in other developed countries the same crops have been continuously improved.

40|$|Social {{activities}} have been {{justified by the}} theory of rights. But with this approach, we can't figure out relationships with others that serve as a basis of rights. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reconsider the publicness of social activities built upon relationships with others. Briefly speaking, I'll propose to consider the publicness {{from the viewpoint of}} “relational approach”. / We must begin with examining H. Arendt's strict distinction between “ the public sphere” and “ the social”. By positioning “ otherness” in “ the public sphere”, she raised her original concept of “ action”. But her theory had two questions. First, is it true that “the public sphere” has no connection with “the social” ? Second, isn't it necessary to consider the issue on participation in “the public sphere” ? On the first point, I examined the “ the politics of need interpretation” raised by N. Fraser. With this concept, we can understand the connection between “ the public sphere” and “ the social ” through uninterrupted discussions about needs. On the second point, I examined A. Sen's concepts of liberty. His concepts implied imagination about others’ circumstances. / Through these arguments, we can connect the publicness neither with personal interests nor cooperativity, but with “otherness”. 論文/Thesi...|$|E
40|$|Valuations are ubiquitous. We {{may be for}} {{or against}} genetically {{modified}} food; we find some politicians irresponsible; we prefer Beethoven to rock ‘n ’ roll or vice versa; some enjoy bird-watching while others find it boring; and we may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tighten up on green-house gas emissions. Valuing is pervasive and often we are not even aware that we are valuing. However, many of our valuations are ill grounded and rationally defective. They are frequently based on misinformation, sloppy thinking, prejudice, and are biased in many ways as psychological research shows. For this reason there is widespread agreement among phi-losophers that we need an account of substantive valuational rationality, both for the theory of practical reasoning and for ethics as well. My main object in {{this paper is to}} outline such an account and to present a principle that allows a non-technical rational criticism of valuations. Key-words: Practical reasoning, practical rationality, rational valuation, rational desire, rational preference. Since philosophers are divided over the problem of rational valuations, it may not go amiss to consider first briefly whether valuations can be appraised as rational or not rational. In our day-to-day life we certainly do regard valuations as reasonable or not. If someone wants to becom...|$|E

40|$|Pur po se: To {{determine}} the tear osmolarity changes {{in patients who}} had undergone phacoemulsification surgery. Ma te ri al and Met hod: Tear osmolarity measurements were performed in 30 eyes of 30 patients who had undergone cataract surgery without any complication. Measurements were performed before surgery and consecutively at 1 st month, 3 rd month, and 6 th month after the surgery. TearLab osmometer (TearLab Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) device {{was used for the}} measurements and paired ttest was used for statistical analysis. Re sults: The mean age of the patients was 72. 3 ± 3. 7 (67 - 78) years. Thirteen patients were men and 17 patients were women. The mean osmolarity values were 305. 8 ± 6. 5 mOsm/L before the surgery and 312. 3 ± 6. 4 mOsm/L at 1 st month, 307. 5 ± 5. 1 mOsm/L at 3 rd month and 305. 1 ± 5. 7 at 6 th month after the surgery. The difference between the values before surgery and at 1 st month was found statistically significant (p= 0. 001). Dis cus si on: The tear osmolarity increases at the first month after surgery but decreases to the levels measured before surgery at the 3 rd month. The increase at the first month {{may be due to the}} corneal incisions and medication used after the surgery. We <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take into account this similarity increase in all cataract patients, especially in those who also have dry eye disease.
