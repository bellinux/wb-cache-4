6000|$|She {{accepted}} my assent; but, oddly enough, with {{a sudden}} qualification that showed her as still sharply disposed {{to make use of}} any loose scrap of her embarrassed acuteness.

50|$|The basic skill {{required}} {{is the ability}} to play precisely in the pocket with the metronome in a relaxed fashion.

60|$|MURRAY (frowning). No. I haven't {{been able}} to get down to it--somehow. There's so little <b>time</b> to <b>yourself</b> once you get to know people in New York.
