The <b>tree</b> <b>stratum</b> (circumference at breast height (CBH) &# 8805; 15 cm) was evaluated in 12 plots of 100 m², established in four blocks. The natural regeneration stratum (0. 3 m height to < 15 cm CBH) was evaluated in two subplots of 9 m², established in opposite vertexes of each plot. The <b>tree</b> <b>stratum</b> was composed by 26 species of 14 families and the natural regeneration stratum by 49 species of 23 families. The Shannon diversity index for species, considering all plots, was 2. 60 and 3. 06 to the tree and natural regeneration strata, respectively. The native species, Casearia sylvestris, Myrsine lorentziana and Zanthoxylum petiolare presented the larger importance value in the <b>tree</b> <b>stratum</b> and Faramea marginata, Myrsine lorentziana and Myrcia glabra the biggest density in the natural regeneration stratum. The ecological characteristics of the species found in several height strata indicated that the forest succession process is in evolution. The black-wattle did not regenerate in this area and the planted trees of this species are in the senescence phase. Only 100 tree/ha of black-wattle were found, which represents 4. 5 % of the original population. Thus, black-wattle is not an invasive species for this environment...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{discover}} a particular nature- and cultural {{area in the}} county of Vestfold, Mølen in Larvik municipality. A large part of this area is an old cultural landscape which also has worthy preservations values within cultural history, geology, ornithology and vegetation. Throughout field work the vegetation types of Mølen are mapped, and based on this data a vegetation map is constructed in GIS. In this way the vegetation type, their size and extensiveness are examined. Aerial photos, interview and field surveys are used to discover the vegetation dynamic and change in the human utilization in the time perspective between 1947 and 2012. Based on this data there is exposed {{that a lot of}} the vegetation has change from grasslands and low growing shrubs to tall growing shrubs, scattered trees and two separated forests. Mølen among other areas are included in a regulation plan, but the plan doesn't include this processes. Collected data also determine that the regulation plan is insufficient according to the national and international purposes for preserving cultural and natural values. A condition estimation is done on vegetation types that are characteristic for the area or occupy a great extensiveness. To expose a condition in these vegetation types, different estimates tools that's discover the processes which lead to a condition change are used. Used estimate tools are: area, utilization regime, forestation, vegetation reduction caused by mechanical erosion, regional important species, physical intervention, <b>tree</b> <b>strata</b> successional condition, density of <b>tree</b> <b>strata,</b> numbers of <b>tree</b> <b>strata,</b> and regeneration. By combing the results from the condition estimate, it has been clarified that Mølens vegetation types consist in different conditions. Other methods used to collect data under the fieldwork are mapping of vegetation types, GPS used to mark the vegetation and camera used to take photos. Five transect analyses are done transversely over footpaths and five transects are done for analyses of the change of vegetation types all over the field area. To comprehend earlier human activities interviews of local farmers is done. Through adobe illustrator and paint the data from vegetation types transects is presented...|$|R

40|$|The forest {{understory}} {{is made up}} of {{resident and}} transitory species and can be much richer than the canopy. With the purpose to describe the contribution of these groups to the woody understory, five Atlantic Forest fragments were selected and studied in Northeastern Brazil. In order to analyze the understory&# 8217;s structure, the sample included woody individuals with circumference at breast height (CBH) smaller than 15 cm and circumference at ground level (CGL) greater than 3 cm, regardless of height. The recorded species were quantified and classified into functional stratification categories (resident and transitory), and the floristic similarity between the understory and the <b>tree</b> <b>stratum</b> was calculated. Species&# 8217; importance in the understory was analyzed by height and total natural regeneration classes based on a regeneration index. The understory was richer in species (median= 63. 8, SD= 21. 72, n= 5 fragments) than the <b>tree</b> <b>stratum</b> (43. 8, 18. 14, 5), and the similarity between these components was relatively high (median= 0. 54, SD= 0. 09). The results also showed that the studied understory in the forest fragments was mainly composed by transitory species (median= 67. 01 %, SD= 3. 76), that were well distributed among height classes and had the highest densities, which may favor their future presence in the canopy&# 8217;s structure and composition. The typical understory species were grouped into two strata: the lower understory, made up of species that generally do not reach more than 4 m in height (mostly species from families Piperaceae, Rubiaceae and Melastomataceae); and the upper understory, with intermediate heights between the lower understory and the canopy, but with average heights that were not higher than 10 m (mainly of species from families Anonnaceae, Clusiaceae and Myrtaceae). These families&# 8217; richness was commonly used as an indicator of the vegetation&# 8217;s successional stage; however, such results must be seen with caution as they show that these families co-occurred and were highly important in different strata. Studying the understory is fundamental because it represents a floristically rich stratum with a unique structure, which promotes the natural regeneration of the <b>tree</b> <b>stratum.</b> El sotobosque forestal está compuesto por especies residentes y transitorias.

Regression analysis was applied to estimate parameter and to test the suitability level of the parabolic taper model. The results showed that parabolic taper model could be used to describe the stem curve of clear bole stem in state forest and the stem curve up to tree height with minimum diameter of ca. 10 cm. In the state forest, the parabolic taper model was fit to medium and large diameter classes or in the intermediate and dominant strata. For small diameter class or in suppressed stratum, the model was not sufficiently fit. On the other hand, the parabolic taper model was fit to all samples from community forests because the samples comprised the stem of best quality from the stand. The parabolic taper model was suitable to apply on high quality stems which were characterized with healthy, cylindrical, and straight stem, high clear bole, and straight grain...|$|R
40|$|The Queens Domain, Hobart, {{is an area}} of grassy {{woodland}} {{that has}} been surrounded by urban development for over 70 years. Floristic and structural data were collected from 70 quadrats in both 1974 and 1984 to test whether the relatively high fertility, large size and compact shape of the reserve allowed it to avoid the dramatic deterioration of native vegetation that has been recorded for less favoured reserves in other Australian cities. Over the decade an increased incidence and spread of fire was associated with increased quadrat species richness, increases in tree density, especially of Casuarina stricta, and a decrease in the density of the larger size classes. However, despite large increases in exotic species richness in two out of three communities defined for the Domain its nature conservation value did not decline, as many of the species that increased in frequency over the decade were native herbs that are now rare in Tasmania. A high fire frequency or the reintroduction of large native herbivores may be necessary to encourage these species and to help prevent a thickening of the <b>tree</b> <b>stratum...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{woodland}} manipulation on forage phytomass was studied in a Caatinga of Petrolina, PE, Brazil. There were five treatments: 1) Control of native vegetation; 2) Thinning 1 / 3 of shrub canopy cover; 3) Thining 2 / 3 of shrub cover; 4) Caatinga slashing; and 5) Treatment 4 + burning. Slashing and burning {{were carried out}} in September/ 84, and thinning done in January/ 85. Herbaceous mass in the control was 528 kg/ha, half grasses and half forbs, in the only evaluation made (May/ 85). The slashed area had a higher grass mass than the control (675 vs 251 kg/ha). Forb mass increased from treatment 1 to 5, but only these two were significantly different (1, 609 vs 277 kg/ha). Neoglaziovia variegata showed the opposite trend, decreasing from treatment 1 to 5 (1, 413 vs 25 kg/ha). Slashing was superior to the other treatments in shrub mass, including slashing and burning (706 vs 317 kg/ha), and caused {{an increase in the}} <b>tree</b> <b>stratum</b> forage mass over the other treatments (236 vs 50 - 78 kg/ha), due to coppicing...|$|E
40|$|Mediterranean Dehesas {{are one of}} the European {{natural habitat}} types of Community {{interest}} (43 / 92 /EEC Directive), associated to high diversity levels and producer of important goods and services. In this work, tree contribution and grazing influence over pasture alpha diversity in a Dehesa in Central Spain was studied. We analyzed Richness and Shannon-Wiener (SW) indexes on herbaceous layer under 16 holms oak trees (64 sampling units distributed in two directions and in two distances to the trunk) distributed in four different grazing management zones (depending on species and stocking rate). Floristic composition by species or morphospecies and species abundance were analyzed for each sample unit. Linear mixed models (LMM) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to study relationships between alpha diversity measures and independent factors. Edge crown influence showed the highest values of Richness and SW index. No {{significant differences were found between}} orientations under tree crown influence. Grazing management had a significant effect over Richness and SW measures, specially the grazing species (cattle or sheep). We preliminary quantify and analyze the interaction of <b>tree</b> <b>stratum</b> and grazing management over herbaceous diversity in a year of extreme climatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Caatinga, the {{predominant}} vegetation type of the semiarid region of northeastern Brazil, is composed by plants showing efficient mechanisms {{to keep them}} in the ecosystem. The herbaceous, bush and <b>tree</b> <b>strata</b> provide food for animals and several products for human use, and supply seedbank with propagules to assure plant recovery. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare seedbank density, composition and diversity of three sites with different vegetation physiognomies: craibeira plantation site (A 1), degraded site (A 2) and juremas + sabia plantation site (A 3), located at the Nupeárido Experimental Station/Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), Patos, PB state, Brazil. Five litterfal + soil samples were collected in each site and taken to the Forest Nursery of UFCG Campus in Patos and kept under a 50 % solar radiation reduction plastic screen and a daily manual irrigation regimen, where they were observed during 90 days for counting and identification of the emerging seedlings. Plantule density for each site was compared by the χ 2 test (P< 0. 05). Plant diversity and species richness were evaluated by Shannon-Wiener (H’) and Pielou Uniformity (e”) indexes, respectively. Herb species predominated in seedbank of all sites, and the number of seeds of tree species increased in the craibeira plantation site resulting from the prolonged presence of animals attracted by the thermal comfort under tree canopy...|$|R
50|$|Besides {{the range}} of animal bones, many human {{artifacts}} were also found at the site. Stratum 7 yielded twenty-seven lithic flakes, bits of coal, and oxidized sandstone, as well as tree products such as burned wood from ash and maple <b>trees.</b> Other <b>strata</b> yielded fish bones, more wood, a fishhook made of bone, and significantly larger amounts of coal. Although the extinct animal bones {{are found in the}} same context as the human artifacts, this {{is believed to have been}} the result of erosion and buildup by the stream; they are not believed to be contemporaneous.|$|R
40|$|Ecological species groups, {{consisting}} of assemblages of co-occurring plant species exhibiting similar environmental affinities, were developed for ground-flora and <b>tree</b> <b>strata</b> in late- successional forests on a 13, 000 ha southern Appalachian landscape. We distinguished 11 ground-flora groups that included 50 species and six tree groups comprised of 19 species. Ground-flora groups {{ranged from a}} xeric Vaccinium group (including Vaccinium pallidum, Euphorbia corollata, and Piptochaetium avenaceum) to a mesic Rhododendron group (typified by Rhododendron maximum, Mitchella repens, and Hexastylis heterophylla). Tree groups ranged from a Quercus coccinea group to a Tsuga canadensis group. Consistent with previous research, species groups exhibited a range of amplitudes from widely distributed Smilax and Vitis groups to a Sanguinaria group restricted to one ecosystem type. A given species group occupied {{a variety of different}} combinations of measured environmental variables, which apparently interacted to produce repeating environmental complexes across the landscape favorable for specific species groups. We also tested two multivariate methods for quanti- fying associations among species groups, and found that Mantel tests using traditional distance measures were inappropriate because of the double-zero problem of species absences, whereas canonical correlation modeled species group associations consistent with species distributions among sites. This study is among the first to develop ecological species groups in the southern United States, and the species group approach was useful for explaining vegetation-environment relationships, identifying groups of ground-flora and tree species that varied together across the landscape, and for determining the environmental gradients most strongly associated with species distributions...|$|R
