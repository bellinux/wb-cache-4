A separate, overlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves during <b>the</b> <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trees and continued for the first six centuries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun.
