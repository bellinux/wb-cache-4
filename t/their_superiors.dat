5|$|As {{the press}} conference had been {{broadcast}} live, within hours, thousands of people gathered at the Berlin Wall demanding that the guards open the gates. The border guards were unable to contact <b>their</b> <b>superiors</b> for instructions and, fearing a stampede, opened the gates. The iconic scenes that followed– people pouring into West Berlin, standing on the Wall and attacking it with pickaxes– were broadcast worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Quatermass II {{finished}} its run, comedian Bob Monkhouse {{included a}} spoof of the serial in {{an episode of}} his own BBC television series, which featured Monica Grey reprising her role as Paula Quatermass. Cartier and Kneale were greatly displeased with this, and complained to <b>their</b> <b>superiors</b> at the BBC about it.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} Western proposition on the communication preferences {{of male and female}} employees in a Malaysian organization. Based on the literature, Western scholars suggest that male employees prefer working communication with <b>their</b> <b>superior</b> {{that will allow them to}} accomplish their jobs. On the other hand, female employees prefer relationship communication with <b>their</b> <b>superior</b> in order to maintain and develop their relationship with <b>their</b> <b>superior.</b> Our findings show the combination's of working and relationship communication emerging from Malaysian male and female respondents. The consequences of these findings are discussed and elaborated...|$|R

The player is often aided by United Nations Space Command (UNSC) Marines, who offer ground support, such as manning gun turrets or riding shotgun while the player is driving a vehicle.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} of the Baths of Zeuxippus was very great among the citizens, despite the numerous number of baths that had been available for public access {{at the time in}} Constantinople, and therefore, the great competition that existed in that commercial area. Even the likes of clergy and monks were seen there, despite the insistence by <b>their</b> <b>superiors</b> that the baths were places of impious behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The scandal {{proved an}} embarrassment to the {{reputation}} of the Royal Navy, then still the world's largest, and it was satirised at home and abroad through editorials, cartoons, and even a comic jazz oratorio composed by Erwin Schulhoff. One consequence of the damaging affair was an undertaking from the Admiralty to review the means by which naval officers might bring complaints against the conduct of <b>their</b> <b>superiors.</b>|$|E
5|$|For the {{commanding}} officers stationed on the Aleutian Islands during the Aleutian Islands campaign, attacking the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians was a logical continuation to recapturing Attu and Kiska. However, these officers faced resistance from <b>their</b> <b>superiors</b> in Washington and their {{troops on the}} ground. Troop morale had sharply declined {{as a result of}} the island's dismal conditions, creating a condition that the troops called the 'Aleutian stare' amongst those who had been on the island for more than six months. An American assault of the Kuriles never materialised.|$|E
50|$|The working {{hypothesis}} {{of the scientists}} is that the Roman troops {{were on their way}} back from the North German Plain. They found the Harzhorn pass blocked by a large number of Germans, and had to fight their way through, using <b>their</b> <b>superior</b> Roman artillery. The finds indicate a Roman success, due to <b>their</b> <b>superior</b> military technology.|$|R

5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by {{complaining}} to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and <b>their</b> <b>superiors</b> spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{was also}} {{active in the}} Volunteer Force. It was common {{practice}} in the Volunteer Force for the men of a unit to elect their officers although they were sometimes directed by <b>their</b> <b>superiors</b> to vote for certain candidates. Hart was duly elected a lieutenant in the Carterton Rifle Volunteers. When the Volunteer Force was abolished in 1910 and replaced with the Territorial Force, which was organised more like a conventional military, he chose to continue his service. He was well regarded by his superiors and was promoted to captain in 1911. When {{he was promoted to}} major the following year, he was the youngest officer with that rank in his battalion. He was serving with the 1st Battalion of the 17th (Ruahine) Regiment when the First World War broke out.|$|E
5|$|In 1886 {{a colonel}} renowned {{for lack of}} {{discipline}} published newspaper articles criticizing the Minister of War, an act of insubordination forbidden by law. Instead of being punished, the colonel was supported by his commander, Field Marshal (nowadays Divisional General) Deodoro da Fonseca. The minister, {{as well as the}} conservative cabinet headed by João Maurício Wanderley, decided not to penalize the colonel in an attempt to quiet dissention. However, the cabinet went further and removed any constraint on military officers broadcasting their views. In consequence of this policy, subordinates were thenceforth able to publicly criticize <b>their</b> <b>superiors,</b> thus undermining both military and political authority, including that of the cabinet itself.|$|E

5|$|In December 1943, {{following}} official protests, the Japanese government {{issued a}} statement formally denying responsibility for the sinking of Centaur. Records provided by the Japanese following the war also did not acknowledge responsibility. Although Centaurs sinking was a war crime, no one was tried for sinking the hospital ship. Investigations into the attack were conducted between 1944 and 1948, and included the interrogation of the commanders of the submarines operating in Australian waters at the time, <b>their</b> <b>superiors,</b> plus junior officers and crewmen from the submarines who had survived the war. Several of the investigators suspected that Nakagawa and I-177 were most likely responsible, but {{they were unable to}} establish this beyond reasonable doubt, and the Centaur case file was closed on 14 December 1948 without any charges laid.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although <b>their</b> <b>superiors</b> sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E
5|$|The first dent to morale {{came after}} about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army. In {{the eyes of some}} of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks {{assigned}} appeared to have been chosen almost at random by <b>their</b> <b>superiors,</b> and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E

5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of <b>their</b> <b>superiors.</b> Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarine}} {{is ordered}} to destroy Atlantis but Bond insists on rescuing Amasova first. He confronts and kills Stromberg but again encounters Jaws, whom he drops into a shark tank. However, Jaws kills the shark and escapes. Bond and Amasova flee in an escape pod as Atlantis is sunk. Amasova reminds Bond {{that she has}} vowed to kill him as she picks up Bond's gun. Then, she admits to having forgiven him and the two embrace. The Royal Navy recovers the pod and the two spies are seen in an intimate embrace through its port window, much to the bemusement of <b>their</b> <b>superiors</b> on the ship.|$|E
5|$|Venetians, being Catholics, {{retained}} the privileges {{enjoyed by the}} Latin bishopric of the islands under the Count Palatine dynasties. The Catholics were not numerous, and during the Venetian period, they were mainly concentrated in Corfu and Cephalonia. Most of them were descendants of Italian settlers {{but there were some}} conversions by Greeks to Catholicism. According to the law, Greek Orthodox priests and monks had to accept the Catholics as <b>their</b> <b>superiors,</b> though the Venetians placed the interests of the Republic ahead of those of the Papacy. Mixed marriages between Catholic and Orthodox Christians were allowed. These two were the main factors in the decline of Roman Catholicism in the Islands.|$|E
