40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{which of}} 24 β-lactams used in susceptibility tests best discriminated between strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli <b>that</b> <b>produce</b> extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) from strains <b>that</b> <b>produce</b> older, more familiar, plasmid-mediated β-lactamases such as TEM- 1 and SHV- 1. MethodsSusceptibility to the 24 β-lactam agents {{was determined by}} agar dilution and disk diffusion methodologies, using 27 strains of K. pneumoniae and E. coli <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> 22 different older plasmid-mediated β-lactamases and 28 strains <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> 17 different ESBLs. ResultsIn general, strains <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> ESBLs were intermediate or resistant to cefpodoxime, whereas those <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> other β-lactamases were susceptible to this agent. The agar dilution test exhibited 96 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity in discriminating these two groups of organisms. The disk diffusion test exhibited 100 % sensitivity and 96 % specificity. All other β-lactam agents tested were inferior discriminators {{between the two groups}} of organisms. ConclusionsAgar dilution and disk diffusion tests with cefpodoxime can be used to discriminate strains of K. pneumoniae and E. coli <b>that</b> <b>produce</b> ESBLs from those <b>that</b> <b>produce</b> older, plasmid-mediated β-lactamases...|$|R
40|$|Sixty-one Burkholderia cepacia {{isolates}} {{from patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) and four plant isolates were screened for {{production of the}} siderophores salicylic acid (SA), pyochelin, cepabactin, and ornibactins and fingerprinted by a PCR-based randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method. Of the 24 RAPD types determined, 22 (92 %) were associated with isolates <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> SA, 21 (87 %) were associated with isolates <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> ornibactins, 15 (60 %) were associated with isolates <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> pyochelin, and 3 (12 %) were associated with isolates <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> cepabactin. Of the 24 RAPD types plus 2 phenotypic variants of types 1 and 9, 3 were associated with isolates <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> all four siderophores, 8 were associated with isolates <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> three siderophores, 12 were associated with isolates <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> two siderophores, and 3 were associated with isolates <b>that</b> <b>produced</b> only one siderophore. These {{results suggest that the}} numbers and types of siderophores produced by CF isolates of B. cepacia correlate with RAPD type and that SA and ornibactins are the most prevalent siderophores produced...|$|R

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object <b>that</b> <b>produces</b> sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
