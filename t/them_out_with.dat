5|$|A poor {{start to}} the 1966–67 season {{prevented}} another push for the title, and Leeds eventually finished in fourth place. They {{made it to the}} FA Cup semi-finals, before Chelsea knocked <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a 1–0 win. In Europe they beat DWS (Netherlands), Valencia (Spain), Bologna (Italy) and Kilmarnock (Scotland) to reach the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final against Dinamo Zagreb (Yugoslavia); Zagreb won 2–0 at the Stadion Maksimir and held Leeds to a 0–0 draw at Elland Road to leave Leeds with another second-place finish.|$|E
5|$|Toshack {{returned}} {{for the final}} county match against Sussex before the First Test. He did not take a wicket but pinned down the local batsmen as Lindwall blasted <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> match figures of 11/59. Eight of Lindwall's victims had their stumps knocked over. Toshack bowled 15 overs for 23 runs in the first innings as the hosts were skittled for 86. He did not bat as Australia made 5/549 and then returned in the second innings for 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots {{for a total of}} six runs. He finished the match with a total of 0/29 from 32 overs.|$|E
5|$|Outside of {{the main}} game, players can play an {{additional}} mode called Flick Rush, which can be played alone or with another player via wireless multiplayer. In this mode, players battle {{with a team of}} three Spirits and pit them against each other. Players fight against their opponent by flicking up cards from the touchscreen. Each card has a number value determining its attack strength, with multiple cards combining to increase the overall value. The player whose attack value is greater than their opponent's gets to attack with their Spirit. A slowly replenishing meter determines how many cards the player can send out at a time, and each Spirit has a limited amount of cards that can be replenished by swapping <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> another Spirit. The first player to eliminate all of their opponent's Spirits wins the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{victims are}} {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; {{one is in}} the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable to unlock the steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E

25|$|However, Shanahan {{suddenly}} reversed {{direction by}} naming veteran backup Rex Grossman {{to the starting}} position. In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 yards and two TD passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28-14, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. After beating the Cardinals in Week 2, the Redskins {{got off to a}} surprise 2-0 start. In Week 3, they played the Cowboys on MNF and lost a poorly played game where the latter edged <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> six field goals to win 18-16.|$|E

Luckily for Jim and Luke, the former Mrs. Grindtooth awakes as a Golden Dragon of Wisdom in China and can help <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> information and tells Jim how {{to find out about}} his origin. With the help of the Mandalanese emperor, Jim and Luke – and Princess Li Si as a stowaway – start their journey to meet the Wild 13 and rescue Molly. They encounter the pirates, who prove to be too much for them in battle. Molly is lost at sea, and all but Jim are captured and brought to the pirates' base, Castle Stormeye, a pinnacle of rock within the eye of a perpetual hurricane.|$|E

25|$|December 1984 saw {{the arrival}} of {{attacker}} Mick Harford from Birmingham City. 13 March 1985 saw an infamous riot by Millwall supporters before, during and after an FA Cup sixth-round tie, which caused noticeable damage {{to the ground and}} the surrounding area. The club reacted by imposing an unpopular ban on all away supporters from Kenilworth Road, as well as introducing a scheme that would require even home supporters to carry membership cards to be admitted to matches. Luton did manage to beat Millwall 1–0, to book a semi-final clash with Everton on 13 April at Villa Park. Everton were overwhelmingly expected to win the game, as they were in process of winning the league title by a comfortable margin and were also on their way to glory in the European Cup Winners' Cup, but Luton held their own against the Merseyside club, who needed extra time to edge <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a 2–1 win. On the league scene, Luton finished 13th in the First Division.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposed}} replacement {{train is}} being {{designed by the}} Stratford upon Avon-based rolling stock manufacturer Vivarail, which plans to market {{a new class of}} DMU called the D-Train. These units will be built out of upcycled London Underground D78 Stock, which had previously been in service on the District line. Conversion of the old Underground stock to heavy rail use will involve re-using the aluminium bodyshells, traction motors and bogies from the D78 units and fitting <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> new diesel engines and interiors. The D-Train units are undergoing acceptance testing in 2015 and Vivarail plans to pitch them to train operating companies (TOCs), especially those bidding for the Northern franchise, which was awarded in December 2015. However, the new operator, Arriva Rail North, has announced it will instead replace the Pacers with brand new Class 195 CAF Civitys. In October 2017, West Midlands Trains announced that it had ordered 3 D-Train units for the West Midlands franchise that it will take over in December 2017.|$|E
25|$|The AIF faced {{their last}} county {{opposition}} on Friday, 29 August in another two-day match, though they won this one. It was {{just down the}} road from Clifton at the Taunton County Ground where they defeated Somerset by 95 runs in a very low-scoring game: AIF 85 and 144 for four declared; Somerset 70 and 64. Only 363 runs in the entire game. The first day was impacted by rain and only 59 overs were bowled. The AIF were all out for 85 just before the scheduled close of play. They quickly dismissed Somerset for 70 in only 32 overs of the second morning. Seamer Charlie Winning and slow left armer Collins did all the bowling, Winning taking six for 30 and Collins four for 38. Collins followed up with 67* to give the Australians a useful lead of 159 going into {{the latter half of the}} last day. Somerset lasted only 28 overs as Collins wiped <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a career-best eight for 31.|$|E

25|$|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a first-person shooter video game. The {{player can}} perform several actions, {{including}} jump, sprint, crouch, lay prone, and aim down their gun's iron sights. When the player is shot by an enemy, blood will splatter their heads-up display (HUD), denoting {{that they have}} taken damage; if the player avoids gunfire by taking cover, then their health will recover. The HUD also displays other information, such as a compass, a mini-map, and the player's current ammunition count. The game features traditional guns, including assault rifles, shotguns, handguns, and sniper rifles. The player will be given specific guns {{at the beginning of}} each level, but may switch <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> another gun they find. Most guns have attachments, such as suppressors, and heartbeat sensors. The player can also use grenades and flashbangs when faced with a large group of enemies, as well as a knife for close quarters combat. In some levels, the player will be given special equipment, such as night vision goggles, or a laser designator.|$|E
25|$|Noss and Park {{would go}} on to score seven {{victories}} in August 1917, with an outstanding performance on the 17th. That was the day that Park went to the rescue of a Sopwith Camel being attacked by three German Albatros D.IIIs. In the process of driving the three Germans away, Noss and Park were assailed by two more of the enemy. Noss fired at the attacking pair; when they overran his fighter, Park took his turn and shot them both down. At that point, another trio of Germans attacked; Noss spun one of <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> machine gun fire. Park chased after the falling German; still another three Germans attacked, but they also overran the British crew. Park then saw a second Sopwith Camel under attack from a German, and pumped 100 rounds of machine gun ammunition into the German from 50 yards range. The German spun out, for the British crew's fourth win of the day. They would win the Military Cross for this action; the award was announced on 26 September 1917.|$|E
25|$|Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person view, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake is physically adept {{and is able to}} jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed and one two-handed – and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth to take them out, such as by sneaking up behind them to knock <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> one hit, or by pulling an unsuspecting foe over a ledge from which Drake is hanging. In most areas, if all of the foes patrolling are killed stealthily then other waves that would normally appear do not. Some areas of the game require the player to solve puzzles with the use of Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E

An investigation of the accident later revealed that the pilot Gruzin and copilot Kolesár were only able to communicate with each other in English, but Gruzin's ability to speak English was too limited to hold more than a basic conversation.|$|E
