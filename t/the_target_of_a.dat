5|$|In September 1992 {{the museum}} was <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions. Two {{incendiary}} devices were found in a basement gallery, but were extinguished by staff {{before the arrival of}} the fire brigade, and caused only minor damage.|$|E
5|$|One final {{consequence}} of the raid was that the Telecommunications Research Establishment, {{where much of the}} Bruneval equipment was analysed, and British radar systems were designed and tested, was moved further inland from Swanage on the southern coast of England to Malvern to ensure that it was not <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reprisal raid by German airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the castle}} could be completed, however, the French attacked. Admiral Claude d'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July, where the local {{authorities}} feared Sandown Castle might be <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> night attack. 2,000 French soldiers men landed on the Isle of Wight and attacked Sandown, where labourers were still present. Their advance soon stalled, however, and the French retreated back to their fleet, bringing the invasion threat to an end; the castle was finally completed after their departure.|$|E

5|$|In 1990 the {{situation}} was further complicated when MGM/UA was sold to Qintex, which wanted to then merge with Pathé Communications; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower-than-market value, without consulting Danjaq – who sued MGM/UA Communications, which was itself <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> failed takeover bid by Pathé. In August 1990 Albert Broccoli appointed his daughter Barbara Broccoli alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon, while he concentrated on matters at Danjaq. The dispute between Danjaq and MGM/UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17, but was finally settled in 1993.|$|E
5|$|In New Orleans, a {{homeless}} veteran named Douglas Binder (Chuck Pfarrer) is <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hunt. He {{is given a}} belt containing $10,000 and told that he must reach {{the other side of}} town where he would then win the money and his life. Pursuing him is the hunt organizer Emil Fouchon (Lance Henriksen), his lieutenant Pik Van Cleef (Arnold Vosloo), a businessman named Mr. Lopaki who has paid $500,000 for the opportunity to hunt a human, and mercenaries including Stephan (Sven-Ole Thorsen) and Peterson (Jules Sylvester). Binder fails to reach his destination and is shot by three crossbow bolts. Van Cleef retrieves the money belt.|$|E
5|$|In September 1998 Manchester United were <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{proposed}} takeover by British Sky Broadcasting, {{a subsidiary}} of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Negotiations between both sides had begun during the summer, but had stalled after disagreements over the asking price. The satellite group’s original bid of £575million – initially thought to be their final offer – was deemed too low by two members of United’s board (chairman Martin Edwards and Professor Sir Roland Smith), who pressed for a higher figure. Two days of talks followed and {{in an attempt to}} close the deal, BSkyB made a final bid of £623.4million.|$|E

The five senators – Alan Cranston (Democrat of California), Dennis DeConcini (Democrat of Arizona), John Glenn (Democrat of Ohio), John McCain (Republican of Arizona), and Donald W. Riegle, Jr. (Democrat of Michigan) – were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of Charles H.

5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|Besides the schism, the Western Church was riven by {{theological}} controversies, some {{of which}} turned into heresies. John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity {{should have access to}} the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to Church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite Church, although <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.|$|E

5|$|Having {{discovered}} a lost briefcase in a park, Tintin returns {{it to its}} owner, the sigillographer Professor Hector Alembick, who informs the reporter of his plans {{to travel to the}} Balkan nation of Syldavia. Tintin discovers secret agents spying on him and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant. An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin, but is found unconscious. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bomb attack; but survives the latter when police detectives Thomson and Thompson intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country. On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the sceptre of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current King Muskar XII before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|In 1843 Hogg became <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{blackmail}} {{attempt by}} John Edward Johnson, Jane's husband. Johnson provided journalist Barnard Gregory {{with the details}} of Jane's marital status. Gregory soon published a report on her in The Satirist, but made a crucial mistake. Gregory claimed that the wife of James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly, was legally married to another man, prompting James Hogg to initiate a libel suit against Gregory. Johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of the error. Gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence. Following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication, which could have threatened Hogg's legal position. Hogg appealed to Leigh Hunt, who convinced Gregory not to publish. John Edward Johnson died in 1840, ensuring that Jane would never be blackmailed because of her marital status. Although Hogg and Jane were now free to marry they chose not to, to avoid revealing their situation.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Charles Churchill & Co, {{the parent}} company, moved its offices from London to Birmingham and in 1955 {{increased}} its share capital to £1.26M.

Exports were up 26% {{and there were}} hopes of the sector eventually amounting to 40% of total output. Fixed assets had increased significantly: the business had taken over Newcast Foundries Ltd, Halifax-based heavy lathe manufacturer Denhams Engineering Co Ltd and Churchill-Milnes; it had spent £2M of its own resources building extensions and plant improvements to more than double its manufacturing capability compared to that in 1951. Information regarding Churchill-Milnes is lacking but a business called Henry Milnes manufactured lathes in the Bradford area {{for many years and}} it may be that this was <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> take-over.|$|E

5|$|James {{has been}} the {{recipient}} of numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies he does business with are Audemars Piguet, Coca-Cola, Dunkin' Brands, McDonald's, Nike, State Farm, and Samsung. Coming out of high school, he was <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas, eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million. His signature shoes have performed well for Nike. In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, {{and as part of}} the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool FC, who he has claimed his support for. As a result of James' endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes. In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.

James has stated that we would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.|$|E
5|$|On 4 August 1970, coincidentally Coast Guard Day, {{the pair}} of cutters set out on what {{would prove to be}} their last combat patrol. Each cutter had 25 Kit Carson Scouts {{embarked}} for a patrol of the Co Chien River. While following a narrow canal leading off the main channel, Point Marone was <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> command detonated mine. The blast killed two of the RVN sailors instantly; all five Coast Guardsmen were injured along with 10 Kit Carson Scouts. After the mine explosion, Point Marone listed to starboard but managed to get underway while Point Cypress laid down suppressing fire and escorted the damaged cutter back to base at Cat Lo. Point Marone suffered three shrapnel holes at the starboard waterline as well as extensive damage to the bridge windows and damage to the watertight door between the mess deck and the forward berthing space. The deck aft of the bridge was covered with three inches of mud. After patching and painting, Point Marone was prepared for a final Operational Readiness Inspection to check the RVN crew readiness for the pending turnover of both Point Marone and Point Cypress.|$|E
