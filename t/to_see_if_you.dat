500|$|I'm {{not ashamed}} of making {{mistakes}}. I've made a million mistakes and they're all in the diary. When we edit the diary – which is cut to around 10 percent – every mistake has to be printed because people look <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do. I would be ashamed if I thought I'd ever said anything I didn't believe to get on, but making mistakes is part of life, isn't it? ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart {{was almost}} universally {{described}} by his collaborators as a kind, soft-spoken {{man and a}} true professional. Joan Crawford praised the actor as an [...] "endearing perfectionist" [...] with [...] "a droll {{sense of humor and}} a shy way of watching you <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> react to that humor".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the book's publication, Timothy L. O'Brien was a {{reporter}} for The New York Times, and had reported on Donald Trump's businesses since 1990. O'Brien interviewed Trump for the book, and said that Trump enjoyed his presence, despite O'Brien's claim that Trump once referred to him as a [...] "total whack job." [...] Trump said that he cooperated with O'Brien because, [...] "It's almost like a competitive thing with me. I almost want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can get Trump." [...] O'Brien also interviewed contestants from Trump's reality television series, The Apprentice, as well as Trump's second wife, Marla Maples, casino owner Steve Wynn, and former New York City mayor Ed Koch.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{seem a bit}} {{sorry that}} I'm going," [...] she replied, a little breathlessly. [...] "You know I'd be glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were in rags." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Maybough pursued: [...] "We receive on Thursdays, {{but we have}} a {{few friends}} coming in to-morrow afternoon, and we should be very glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have nothing better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How can I come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't tell {{me where}} you are? [...] "Lady Georgina Fawley, Europe," [...] was the only address I knew. It strikes me as insufficient.' ...|$|R
2500|$|However, the film's director, Takashi Yamazaki, {{rejected}} {{these interpretations}} of the film, saying, [...] "The film depicts the war as a complete tragedy, {{so how can you}} say it glorifies war?... I really don't get it." [...] He eventually dismissed such criticism, saying that [...] "In the end, people see what they want <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> think from the start that 'this movie glorifies war' you're going to see it as a movie that glorifies war, no matter what." [...] Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that [...] "In my book Eternal Zero, I opposed suicide attacks with determination", [...] "I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light", and the theme of the book was [...] "not to allow our memories of war to fade away". The author also added in a tweet, [...] "I feel sorry for Eternal Zero. [...] On one side of the political spectrum, Japanese right-wing nationalists claimed the book was plagiarized and were indignant about its criticism of high-ranking Japanese government officials, while on the opposite [...] side, left-wingers criticized it as a glorification of war, Hayao Miyazaki rebukes it for fabrication [...] It is drawing fire literally from all directions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Performed by the Four Freshmen, [...] "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring" [...] (1961) was a {{particular}} favorite of the Beach Boys. Brian explained: [...] "My mom turned me on to them. She {{turned on the radio}} and goes, 'Hear that song? This is called 'Day By Day' by the Four Freshmen.' And I listened and I went 'Oh, I love it, Mommy! I love it!' ... We went in [...] and she said you can take records into these little booths and play them <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wanted to buy them. ... You know how you sit in a sauna bath and the sweat will come out? That's what that whole experience in that room started to be. I purged all kinds of bullshit and picked up the Freshmen. It was magic. Total magic." [...] By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Lambert notes, [...] "If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song." [...] Wilson continued: [...] "I learned them bar by bar. I'd go to my hi-fi set and I'd play a little bit. Then I'd stop and try to figure it out, back and forth, back and forth, until I figured the whole song out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets me bring out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'DEAR MISS GRAYE,--Miss Aldclyffe is ill, {{though not}} dangerously. She {{continually}} repeats your name, and now wishes very much <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> possibly can, {{come in the}} carriage.--Very sincerely yours, JOHN RAUNHAM.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{sister has}} been very ill, you know,--with scarlatina. But she has {{recovered}} with wonderful quickness, and is nearly well again now. She will be so glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will go over." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cecilia at once protested {{against this}} last assertion. [...] "She {{is trying to}} make mischief, Mr. Morris--don't believe her. I am sure they will be glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> join them in the garden." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I--I--came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> rested well," [...] {{answered}} the old man; [...] "and--if I {{could do anything}} to serve you, on any consideration." ...|$|E
60|$|WINIFRED. I want to {{introduce}} you to Gerald, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like him. He's good at the bottom, but he's very overbearing and definite.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} mind trusting {{yourself}} in the clutches of Doctor Faustus," [...] he said, with a gay smile, [...] "I shall be delighted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are ever {{in the neighborhood of}} Barkingham." ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{was very}} bad, {{and must be}} stopped, thought Florence. [...] "I suppose I shall be married by that time. I don't know where we may live, but I shall be happy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> call." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, Percinet!' {{cried the}} Princess, 'is it really you? I have so often heard {{of you and}} wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will indeed be my friend, I shall not be afraid of that wicked old Duchess any more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No. That's Mrs. Newberry's mother. It was Mrs. Newberry who comed in to {{you just}} by now, {{because she wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> was good-looking.' ...|$|E
60|$|I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{were really}} {{attached}} to me. You {{have given me}} a proof of esteem which I promise you I will never forget.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is it you}} mean, Dr Crofts? What is it you are saying? Why do {{you talk}} that nonsense, trying <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can provoke me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Colonel Askerton {{shoots a}} great deal. He has the {{shooting}} of Belton, you know. He'll be delighted, I'm sure, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are here some time in September. But you, coming from Norfolk, would not care for partridge-shooting in Somersetshire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Meader," [...] she said, [...] "I'm {{beginning}} to think it's dangerous {{for me to come}} here twice a week <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> talk this way. And I'm not a bit surprised that that woman didn't get the better of you." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{shall be}} delighted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{will come down}} on Saturday. Mr. Lemon may perhaps be here, with his wife, but no one else. And we {{can give you a}} bed that may be surpassed, with a welcome that {{certainly}} cannot be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that Ronnie? Yes, this is Lady Anselman. Your uncle {{told me to}} ring you up <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were in. He {{wants you}} to come round." ...|$|E
6000|$|Milt cut in abruptly, [...] "Pink! Shut up! Thanks, folks, but we'll go on. Just wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had got in safe. See you tomorrow, some place." ...|$|E
6000|$|Halleck met Atherton at {{the door}} of his room with his hat and coat on. [...] "Why, Halleck! I was just going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had come home!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray don't apologise, Mr Bold; {{my father}} will, I am sure, always be glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like <b>to</b> {{come to the}} house now as formerly; nothing has {{occurred}} to alter his feelings: of your own views you are, of course, the best judge." ...|$|R
60|$|After all becomes quiet, {{and roads}} become so bad up here {{that there is}} likely to be a week or two when nothing can be done, I will run down the coast <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> desire it, I will ask Mrs. Sherman to go with me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then, {{believe that}} I {{can be as}} stout as Fanny. But we need not quarrel. You will come and see baby, and have some lunch. I am afraid {{they will not be}} here till three or four, but they will be so glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will wait.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't sleep," [...] he explained, [...] "so I {{came along}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> couldn't. One gets bored by oneself on a tower. Don't {{you find it}} so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faraday told me {{all about}} what you had done to this paper," [...] he said. [...] "I came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would let me in on it. I want work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought as}} much," [...] she said severely, [...] "and that's why I told the maid <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had been called, which I daresay {{you forgot to}} arrange for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} happy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like <b>to</b> come, of course; that is, {{in the way}} of visiting, and that sort of thing. As for doctoring, if I want any I shall send for Fillgrave." [...] Such were his last words as the carriage, with a rush, went off from the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir. I {{was coming}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hadn't sent for me, {{to say that}} I wished {{to give up my}} stripes and return to the ranks.

6000|$|... "Yes, grandpapa," [...] {{the child}} said, close beside him now. [...] "I am Aggie Linthorne, and I have come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't think it's me, grampa said I {{was to give}} you this, and then you would know;" [...] and she held out a miniature, on ivory, of a boy some {{fourteen}} years old; and a watch and chain.|$|R
