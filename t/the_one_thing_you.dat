That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of my game. I know my limits. I am not the sort who gets the ball and is then going to beat five or six players and stick it in the top corner from God knows where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E

Everyone who has tried, over a thousand years of history has failed." [...] He also said the war was [...] "not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in." [...] In fact, War in Afghanistan was initiated by George W. Bush in October 2001 {{in retaliation for the}} September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington D.C.; Barack Obama has increased troop levels there since taking office.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Blasko co-composed the score, with Stefan Gregory (sound designer), for Bell Shakespeare's {{production}} of Hamlet, which ran from June to August. Diana Simmonds of Stage Noise was disappointed by {{an aspect of}} the opening night [...] "ess successful on opening night at least were the songs which open and then punctuate the action, composed and performed by [...] Her face mike and/or the sound balance muddied the lyrics and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> need in Shakespeare is to hear the words". Whereas Helen Barry of Australian Stage felt Blasko was [...] "truly sublime ... er musical accompaniments add a layer of melancholy rapture to the performance which {{goes to the heart of}} Hamlet's grief, anger and loss. Ingeniously, Blasko is incorporated into the production itself as one of the players, which creates a seamless quality to her musical interludes".|$|E

40|$|What's <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>you</b> {{can give}} to your {{children}} and you’ll never hear them say-"Thanks. I really needed that!"? The answer is limits. So what are limits and {{why are they so}} important? Children {{need to learn how to}} live in a social world – how to be safe and how to interact with others. Establishing boundaries and limits for children’s behavior is key! Early on, you set limits for your baby by using distraction. Your infant began to “get into things”, and so you took something away or gave something else to play with. You might have said, “No, don’t touch! ” or perhaps picked and moved your child. You were setting limits...|$|R

6000|$|... "But not you," [...] {{she replied}} quickly. [...] "I know you better than that, my dear Henry.

40|$|What’s <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>you</b> {{can give}} to your child and you will never hear them say — “Oh, thanks. I really needed that!”? The answer is limits. So what are limits and {{why are they so}} {{important}} in parenting? Let’s explore. Limits are specific behavioral expectations parents set for their children. Setting limits defines the boundaries for acceptable behavior. Parents show their love, concern, and willingness to parent children when they set and use reasonable limits. But there is something funny about limits — children will never say they want/need/like them. However, children need clear, reasonable limits just as much as they need food and shelter. Limits are at the foundation of parenting responsibility. There are two behaviors we see from children reared without limits. Some children will withdraw, too fright...|$|R
5000|$|Memphis Belle {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews, with Roger Ebert stating {{the film was}} [...] "entertaining" [...] yet filled with familiar wartime cliches. [...] "This human element {{in the experience of}} the Memphis Belle crew somehow compensates for a lack of human dimension in the characters. We can't really tell the crew members apart, and don't much care to, but we can identify with them." [...] UK film reviewer Andy Webb had similar reservations. [...] "Despite its good intentions to highlight the risks and heroics of the brave men who flew dangerous bombing missions deep into enemy soil during World War II, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> which <b>you</b> can't miss about [...] "Memphis Belle" [...] {{is that it is a}} cliche commercial production."

5000|$|In all of Dillinger's rides at all levels, he {{was only}} marked under 45 points twice. This is {{compared}} to 13 scores {{in which he was}} marked at 48 points or higher.

And 6 of those 7 qualified rides were scored in between 93.5 points to 96.5 points by judges. Lastly, his lone low score of 88.5 points was impressive when you consider that's when he broke his leg was while being rode for that out.

To a client on business terms it costs about three times as much. Until divorce is as cheap as marriage, marriage will remain indissoluble for all except the handful of people to whom 100 pounds is a procurable sum.
