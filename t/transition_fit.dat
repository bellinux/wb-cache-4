40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} to the problem of local logic transformation for reduction of power dissipa-tion in logic circuits. Based on the finite-state input <b>transition</b> (<b>FIT)</b> power dissipation model, we introduce a cost function which accounts for the effects of input capacitance, input slew rate, internal parasitic capacitance of logic gates, intercon-nect capacitance, as well as switching power. Our approach provides an efficient way of estimating the global effect of lo-cal logic transformations in logic circuits. In our approach, the FIT model for the transitive fanout cells of a locally trans-formed subcircuit can be reused to measure the global power dissipation by varying the input probabilities of the transitive fanout cells. Local logic transformation is carried out based on compatible sets of permissible functions (CSPF). Experi-mental results show that local logic transformation based on CSPF using our cost function can reduce power consumption by about 36 % on average without increase in the worst-case circuit delay. ...|$|E

40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are a major}} {{competitor}} {{to spline}} and keyed shafts for power transmission due to features as self-centering, lack of stress concentration area, and ease of assembly and disassembly. Past studies on polygonal profiles have focused on a single profile and comparisons based on nominal sizes of three and four lobe profiles. This research explores the loading strength of the standardized three and four lobe polygonal shafts and hubs manufactured from the same stock size, subjected to pure torsional and torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle at various fits. In absence of analytical solution, Finite element method has been used after verifying the results experimentally, theoretically, and DIN standard. From the finite element analysis, the hub was found to experience greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The clearance fit {{was found to be}} the most critical connection and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. The P 4 C connection had greater stress, especially in the hub, than the P 3 G connection. The difference between the P 4 C shaft and the P 3 G shaft was 4. 05 % in the interference fit and 60. 6 % in the clearance fit, suggesting P 4 C clearance fit to be less favorable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress, the P 4 C clearance fit has its use in low power transmission where sliding fit is a requirement. The reason for greater stress in P 4 C shaft and hub connection is due to the large pressure angle at the point of contact, which leads to a smaller contact area and greater contact pressure. The contact pressure was found to be triangular shaped in clearance and <b>transition</b> <b>fit</b> and with a large crest, followed by a trough and a small crest in interference fit for torsional bending load...|$|E
30|$|Hypothetically, {{there may}} be {{numerous}} ways for a substrate to affect the energy barrier (∆G ‡). Lowering ∆G ‡ of a uniporter does not consume extra energy input, including the chemical potential of the substrate. Instead, substrate binding per se {{plays a role in}} reducing ∆G ‡. The substrate binding-induced reduction of ∆G ‡ was termed as intrinsic binding energy (Klingenberg 2006). We would like to emphasize that this “driving” energy is gained from substrate binding {{in the first half of}} the transition but is immediately released in the second half of the same transition. Since the transition rate is mainly determined by the forward kinetic rate, the overall effect of the ∆G ‡ reduction at the rate-limiting step is acceleration of transport. It is well known that substrate binding may induce so-called occluded conformations, which have been captured in a number of reported crystal structures (Deng et al. 2015). Thus, the occluded conformations are likely to have higher affinity towards substrates than the Cin and Cout states (Quistgaard et al. 2016), at least under the in vitro conditions. In lipid bilayers where both mechanical membrane tension and electrostatic membrane potential may be present, such an occluded conformation may or may not be thermodynamically stable. However, as long as it is not over-stabilized relatively to the following substrate-releasing state, an occluded state would not prevent proceeding of the transport. The two-state model remains valid should the transient occluded state be merged with neighboring sub-steps of the transition. Furthermore, the transition-state functions as a mechanism for strong substrate selectivity. Analogously, stabilization of the transition state of an enzyme–substrate complex is a common mechanism in enzyme catalysis as well as selectivity. For transporters, such a mechanism has been specifically termed as induced <b>transition</b> <b>fit</b> (Klingenberg 2007). It should be stressed that reduction of ∆G ‡ is not driven by the chemical potential of the substrate, because during the transition- 1 the substrate has already bound to the transporter thus being irrelevant to the external concentration(s) of the substrate. Detailed structure studies of uniporters may provide information on the mechanism of substrate binding-mediated reduction of ∆G ‡, as exemplified in mechanistic discussion on GLUT 1 crystal structure (Deng et al. 2014). Similar mechanisms may also exist for secondary active transporters, for example for members of the MFS family (Quistgaard et al. 2016), where external energy provides an additional driving force to overcome ∆G ‡ (Zhang et al. 2015).|$|E

However, {{recent developments in}} conjugated polymers have diversified the backbones to become elaborate heterocylcic macromolecules.

In this work we resolve the electron-phonon interactions in the ground and doped state in a complex push-pull polymer. We focus on the polaronic transitions using in-situ spectroscopy to work out the differences between single-unit and push-pull systems to obtain the desired structural- electronic correlations in the doped state. We apply the classic 1 D-Froehlich model to generate optical model fits. Interestingly, we find the 1 D-approach in push-pull polarons in agreement to the model, pointing at the strong 1 D-character and plain electronic structure of the push-pull structure. In contrast, polarons in the single-unit polymer emerge to a multi-dimensional problem difficult to resolve due to their anisotropy. Thus, we report an enhancement of the 1 D-character by the push-pull concept in the doped state - an important view in light of the main purpose of push-pull polymers for photovoltaic devices...|$|R

This method is based on superposed electric quadrupole pair interactions and superposed quadrupole induced dipole moments of pairs in the hcp crystal. Accordingly, the approximate formalism uses zero-order H₂ pair wave functions. Symmetry effects of the hcp crystal require preference of rotational pair transitions. The interaction potential of the pairs is confined to the electric quadrupole–quadrupole interaction. Zero-phonon emission bands of H₂ pair <b>transitions</b> <b>fitted</b> to the spectrum contain at least one delocalized j = 2 state initially and/or finally because of their significantly enhanced emission rates.

The frequency positions of the seven pure parahydrogen pair transitions used, obtained from experimentally determined rotational solid hydrogen energy levels, are in perfect agreement with the observed features, whereas the three mixed ortho–para pair transitions need a presently unknown frequency correction, caused by the migration of the ortho-H₂ molecules into the parahydrogen crystal prior to emission, the so-called initial excess binding energies.

Thermodynamically, T 4 lysozyme behaves as a cooperative unit and the unfolding <b>transition</b> <b>fits</b> a two-state model. The structure of the protein, however, resembles a dumbbell with two potential subdomains: an N-terminal subdomain (residues 13 - 75), and a C-terminal subdomain (residues 76 - 164 and 1 - 12). To investigate the effect of uncoupling these two subdomains {{within the context of}} the native protein, we created two circular permutations, both at the subdomain interface (residues 13 and 75). Both variants adopt an active wild-type T 4 lysozyme fold. The protein starting with residue 13 is 3 kcal/mol less stable than wild type, whereas the protein beginning at residue 75 is 9 kcal/mol less stable, suggesting that the placement of the termini has a major effect on protein stability while minimally affecting the fold. When isolated as protein fragments, the C-terminal subdomain folds into a marginally stable helical structure, whereas the N-terminal subdomain is predominantly unfolded. ANS fluorescence studies indicate that, at low pH, the C-terminal subdomain adopts a loosely packed acid state. An acid state intermediate is also seen for all of the full-length variants.

We developed a procedure to detect the arrival of seismic waves based {{on the degree of}} conformity of the amplitude values in the raw seismic trace to the BL. The signal is divided in time windows of appropriate length and the fitting of the first digits distribution to BL is checked in each time window using a conformity estimator. We document that both teleseismic and local earthquakes can be clearly identified in this procedure and we compare its performance with respect to the classical STA/LTA approach. Moreover, we show that the conformity of the seismic record to the BL does not depend on the amplitude of the incoming series, as the occurrence of events with very different amplitudes result in quite similar degree of BL fitting. On the other hand, we show that natural or man-made quasi-monochromatic seismic signals, surface wave trains or engine-generated vibrations can be identified through their very low BL estimator values, when appropriate interval lengths are used. Therefore, we conclude that the degree of conformity of a seismic signal with the BL is primarily dependent on the frequency content of that signal. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
