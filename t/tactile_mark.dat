40|$|The body of {{work that}} {{constituted}} {{the core of the}} exhibitions was made between January 2006 and April 2007. The concept of the repair or the mend is central and is further developed through the use of recycled clay and the use of elements of earlier sculptures reconstructed within this work. It draws on two strands of enquiry: 1) The reinterpretation of the detail of sail repairs in Gerritt Pompe’s ‘Shipping off a Dutch Harbour’, discussed in Dr Geoff Quilley’s essay in ‘In Parallel: Sculpture and Drawing’; 2) The repair of bed linen found in a house in Umbria, referred to in Mel Gooding’s ‘texts’ in the catalogue of the extended ‘In Parallel’ exhibition at the gallery at Wimbledon College of Art. During the exhibition in Amsterdam an Agendas/KUNST 10 DAAGSE event took place in the gallery, debating the work and the research questions addressed; the sound-recording was accessioned by the British Library. This aspect was further developed in the Wimbledon show through a ‘listening post’ installation presenting the sound recordings of the Amsterdam event and the interview with William Furlong, ‘Audioarts’, which forms a central text in the publication that accompanied these exhibitions. These recordings sit alongside the recently completed Artists Lives recording with Bugg (July 2007), part of the Life Stories collection at the British Library. The later showing of this work at the gallery at WCA provided a broader context across the period of the 25 -year partnership of the artist with the Amsterdam gallery and provided the opportunity to exhibit three new works, one developing an earlier theme of the <b>tactile</b> <b>mark</b> evolved from the greater emphasis on drawing within this exhibition and the other two providing the culmination of the research based on reworking and recycling...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe present MarkPad, a novel {{interaction}} technique {{taking advantage of}} the touchpad. MarkPad allows creating a large number of size-dependent gestural shortcuts that can be spatially organized as desired by the user. It relies on the idea of using visual or <b>tactile</b> <b>marks</b> on the touchpad or a combination of them. Gestures start from a mark on the border and end on another mark anywhere. MarkPad does not conflict with standard interactions and provides a novice mode that acts as a rehearsal of the expert mode. A first study showed that an accuracy of 95 % could be achieved for a dense configuration of <b>tactile</b> and/or visual <b>marks</b> allowing many gestures. Performance was 5 % lower in a second study where the marks were only on the borders. A last study showed that borders are rarely used, even when the users are unaware of the technique. Finally, we present a working prototype and briefly report on how it was used by two users for a few months...|$|R
40|$|The Gesture and the Drip investigates our {{increasing}} {{reliance on}} digital media {{as a means}} to encounter and view art works online as photographic documentation. This body of work attempts to place significance on the human gesture in relation to the loss of the human presence that often accompanies digital documentation. The gesture is a reoccurring element that can be traced throughout my thesis body of work. Occasionally, gestures are <b>tactile</b> <b>marks</b> made by my hand and in other cases they are the result of photographic reproduction, silk-screened onto the surface. A paradox is formed between the real and illusion that are interchangeable on the canvas. My paintings encompass authentic and mediated gestures to challenge the visual experience and disrupt a logical reading...|$|R
40|$|Aftermath (2006) {{is a film}} made {{by three}} collaborators: Rosemary Butcher (choreographer), Cathy Lane (composer) and Cathy Greenhalgh (cinematographer and director). It is a 1 - minute film played in either a cinema or gallery {{environment}} as installation. The film uses colour, cinematography and editing in new recombinative ways. The film deepens and broadens the interdisciplinary research and shared language that was begun with their previous collaboration Undercurrent (2001). The director was inspired to explore the somatosensory and affective dimensions of perception of material phenomena on the cinema screen; in part her influence derives from recent critical approaches to the <b>tactile</b> in film (<b>Marks,</b> Sobchack, Naficy, Deleuze). Aftermath combines footage shot in Southern Iceland with dancer Elena Giannotti’s precise movement in the studio. The film language is minimal, concentrating on the body state; in parallel, the sound shifts between palpable silence and focused representation of the environmental sounds of ice and wind. ‘Aftermath’ refers to Icelandic jokulhlaups (glacial bursts of voluminous debris) that happen after subterranean volcanic eruptions under icecaps and to the aftershocks of earthquakes and tsunamis. The film {{has been designed to}} be experienced in two forms: as cinematic screening or gallery installation. The film was premiered at BAFTA, 6 July, 2006 as part of the launch of the Film and Phenomena research initiative. It was shown at the Videodanza Dance Film Festival in Barcelona in March 2007 and at ICMC 2007. It was the first prize-winner for Best Experimental Video at Strange Screen, the Sixth Audiovisual Festival of Experimental Video and Creative Documentary 2007, Thessaloniki, Greece...|$|R
40|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} (SCS) is {{an established}} treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. However, in recent studies conflicting results regarding {{the effect of}} SCS were noted in a selected group of patients suffering from complex regional pain syndrome and mechanical allodynia. In the present study we investigated the pain relieving effect of SCS in a rat experimental model of neuropathic pain as related to the severity of mechanical allodynia. Adult male rats (n= 45) were submitted to a unilateral sciatic nerve ligation. The level of allodynia was tested using the withdrawal response to tactile stimuli with the von Frey test. A portion of these rats developed <b>marked</b> <b>tactile</b> hypersensitivity in the nerve-lesioned paw (von Frey test), similar to "tactile allodynia" observed after nerve injury in humans. Prior to SCS treatment the rats were subdivided into three groups based {{on the level of}} allodynia: mild, moderate and severe. All allodynic rats were treated with SCS (n= 27) for 30 min (f= 50 Hz; pulse width 0. 2 ms and stimulation at 2 / 3 of motor threshold) at 16 days post-injury. Our data demonstrate a differential effect of SCS related to the severity of the mechanical allodynia. SCS leads to a faster and better pain relief in mildly allodynic rats as compared with the more severely allodynic rats. Thus, we suggest that the selection and subdivision of patient groups similar to those defined in our experimental setting (mild, moderate and severe allodynic) may provide better pre-treatment prediction of possible therapeutic benefits of SCS...|$|R
40|$|Inclusive {{education}} {{has increased in}} popularity {{over the last two}} decades. Inclusiveclassrooms consist of children from diverse backgrounds and with variousimpairments, with special educational needs. Children with special educationalneeds in vision require assistive tools to access visual information. Topics thatmake strong use of such information, e. g. geometry, can therefore be challengingfor children with visual impairments or blindness (VIB) as well as their teachers. Assistive tools like video magniers and physical objects in the shape ofgeometric gures are used to aid VIB in learning basic geometry. Researchershave investigated tools and applications to aid VIB in learning geometry byusing haptic or auditory feedback as well as combinations of these. However,the tools are often not created with considering the classroom environment. Tounderstand the situation and challenges of these two stakeholders (VIBs andtheir teachers) better, a preliminary questionnaire was conducted. Five participantsof each of the two groups lled out the questionnaires. A concept for anAndroid tablet application to convey pre-existing geometric shapes and theirannotations to VIB, using sound feedback and sonication was created andpartly developed in two incremental implementation phases. The shapes arerecreated on the tablet using elements like circles and paths and then enhancedwith sound feedback to guide VIB to the various elements. With an iterativedesign, the two prototype increments were evaluated. The rst evaluation wasan usability study. Using seven blindfolded, young adult participants, feedbackwas gathered on dierent combinations between sound, tactile, and vibrationfeedback, as well as the general usability of the application for an validation ofthe approach. Each participants was presented the dierent approaches in anotherorder. For each approach, they were asked to explore three basic geometricshapes and then, without blindfold, draw these shapes. The time for applicationinteraction was measured and overall observation notes were taken. After eachapproach a short questionnaire was given to the participant. Another longerquestionnaire was conducted after all approaches were tested. It was foundthat sound feedback alone is not sucient in precisely conveying the geometricshapes to the users. However, combined with <b>tactile</b> objects to <b>mark</b> positionsof vertices on the screen the result improved signicantly and this approach wasfavored by the participants. The usability of the application is good but hasroom for improvement. A study was conducted with two teachers as expertslater on with the second prototype version. Two teachers with several yearsof experience teaching geometry to VIB in inclusive settings were interviewedconcerning the expected usability of the application for VIB and in the classroom,as well as general challenges and possibilities of including the applicationinto geometry lectures. As the teachers were located in Germany, they weresent a video demonstrating the application. One interview was conducted overemail while the other was conducted over Skype. The only challenges identiedare the media anity of teachers and the reliability of technology. VIB are notexpected to face challenges in utilizing the application and teachers could havemore freedom in the geometric shapes they present to their class...|$|R
