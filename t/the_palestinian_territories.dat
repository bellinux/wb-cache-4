The study is based on a national household sample survey in <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory,</b> which was conducted by <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). The results of this study revealed various interesting trends. For example, while about 90 % of households in <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory</b> receive solid waste collection service, about 50 % of the households receive this service three times per week or less, leaving a chance for waste pile-up and litter generation. Organic waste (including food waste) was found to account for more than 90 % of RSW, providing an opportunity for waste utilization through composting or biogas generation. Additional efforts are required, and some were suggested in this paper, in order to improve the current situation of Palestinian residential solid waste management...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{consider}} <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> housing sector and to address the factors hindering its expansion. The study analyses the factors which affect the demand and supply of houses and the demand for mortgages, a key indicator of efficiency in the housing sector. The study reviews the sources of, and conditions for, mortgage lending in <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory</b> and addresses <b>the</b> specific difficulties facing this type of lending. The study reviews existing literature on the subject and presents data related to housing and housing investment. In order to estimate the potential demand on mortgage lending, the study reviews a survey that has been conducted to identify consumer preferences, their ability to buy houses, and the volume of their demand. The study also reviews the laws and regulations related to housing and mortgages along with the sources of and conditions attached to mortgage lending in <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory.</b> <b>The</b> study consists of an introduction and six chapters, the last of which provides a number of policy recommendations to improve the housing sector and mortgage lending in <b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Territory.</b> <b>The</b> study also includes two appendices.

5|$|On July 24, 1994, the PNA proclaimed Gaza {{the first}} city council in <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territories.</b> The 2005 Palestinian {{municipal}} elections were not held in Gaza, nor in Khan Yunis or Rafah. Instead, Fatah party officials selected the smaller cities, towns, and villages to hold elections, assuming they would fare better in less urban areas. The rival Hamas party, however, won {{the majority of}} seats in seven of the ten municipalities selected for the first round with voter turnout being around 80%. 2007 saw violent clashes {{between the two parties}} that left over 100 dead, ultimately resulting in Hamas taking over the city.|$|E

5|$|A massive {{influx of}} Palestinian {{refugees}} swelled Gaza's population after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. By 1967, the population {{had grown to}} about six times its 1948 size.

The city's population has continued to increase since that time to 515,556 in 2012, making it the largest city in <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territories.</b> Gaza City {{has one of the}} highest overall growth rates in the world. Its population density is 9,982.69/km² (26,424.76/sq mi) comparable to New York City (10,725.4/km² – 27,778.7/sq mi), half of Paris density (21,000/km² – 55,000/sq mi).

5|$|Prior to {{signing the}} accords, Arafat—as Chairman of the PLO and its {{official}} representative—signed two letters renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel. In return, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, {{on behalf of}} Israel, officially recognized the PLO. The following year, Arafat and Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Shimon Peres. The Palestinian reaction was mixed. The Rejectionist Front of the PLO allied itself with Islamists in a common opposition against the agreements. It was rejected also by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan {{as well as by}} many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territories.</b> However, the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the agreements and Arafat's promise for peace and economic well-being.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>territories.</b> He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E
