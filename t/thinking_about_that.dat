Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition.

Lear described the premise simply: [...] "God created Eve first, took out her rib {{and gave her a}} companion so she wouldn't be lonely." [...] Lear {{came up with the idea}} on a trip to Washington, D.C.: [...] "I had visited the Institute of Policy Studies, and I just loved the whole thing. And I thought there was a series in it—a five-times-a-week series: I went to bed <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and I woke up the next morning thinking what would happen if the male-female equation were changed? What would happen if the women had all the power and all the advantage, and the men had what the women normally would have?” ...|$|E

[...] Zach Boren said, [...] "Everyone in the whole family is an Ohio State fan now[...] [...]No one cares about Michigan at all anymore.

[...] During spring practice, Boren impressed his coaches and teammates; however, he refused all interview requests. [...] During the summer, when asked about the impending Michigan – Ohio State game he said [...] "My attitude is there are 11 games before that game,[...] [...]I can't let myself get worked up <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> game. I don't want to take a chance of being unprepared for any of the first 11 games. The week that game gets here, it will be my primary focus." [...] By then, he was projected to be the starting left guard, and he was expected to be an important part of the team.|$|E

It was mainly associated with the September Group of academics, so called because they have biennial meetings in varying locations every other September to discuss common interests. The group also dubbed itself [...] "Non-Bullshit Marxism" [...] (Cohen 2000a).

According to a cousin, Mixon had recently purchased his handgun (illegal for a felon on parole), as well as the burgundy Buick he had been driving when the traffic stop happened, by using profits from his most recent criminal endeavor, pimping. Mixon was talking with his uncle on a cell phone {{at the time of the}} traffic stop and promised to call back afterwards.

2500|$|One {{influential}} {{friend was}} the Piedmontese Justice Minister Urbano Rattazzi. He was anticlerical in his politics, {{but he saw}} some value in Bosco’s work. While Rattazzi was pushing a bill through the Sardinian legislature to suppress religious orders, he advised Bosco {{on how to get}} around the law. He found a religious order to keep the oratory going after its founder’s death. Bosco had been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> problem, too, and had been slowly organizing his helpers into a loose [...] "Congregation of St. Francis de Sales". He was also training select older boys for the priesthood. Another supporter of the idea to establish a religious order to carry out Bosco's vision was the reigning pope, Blessed Pius IX.|$|E
2500|$|On October 22, 2003, Moody {{left the}} band during the European tour for Fallen, {{reportedly}} because of creative differences. In an interview several months later, Amy Lee said: [...] "...we'd gotten {{to a point}} that if something didn't change, we wouldn't have been able to make a second record." [...] This became a point of confusion, as Moody and Lee stated on the Fallen album liner notes that they were best friends. Lee said it was almost a relief that Moody left because of tensions created within the band. During an interview, Lee has said, [...] "I don't know, I just think it's exactly what I would've expected. He's more about kind of the pop influence sort of thing and also, you know, about being commercial and I mean selling albums: That's the part of him we often disagreed on. I wanted to do the more artistic weird thing and he'd wanna do the thing that people would want to hear..." [...] She adds [...] "So that's a lot of the reason [...] it's been so fun writing now, is [...] we're not <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It's like 'what do we like?', 'what's fun?', like 'what do we want to do that's different?'"

50|$|Self-awareness {{appears to}} be a sign of {{abstract}} thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning (<b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>thinking)</b> <b>that</b> humans exploit. Cetaceans appear to possess self-awareness. The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the mirror test, in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body and the animal is then presented with a mirror. Researchers then explore whether the animal shows signs of self-recognition.|$|R
