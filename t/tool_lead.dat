50|$|Free {{machining}} steels are {{carbon steels}} that have sulfur, lead, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, or phosphorus added. Sulfur forms the compound manganese sulfide, which {{is soft and}} acts as a chip-breaking discontinuity. It also acts as a dry lubricant to prevent a built up edge on the cutting <b>tool.</b> <b>Lead</b> works {{in a similar way}} to sulfur. Bismuth achieves a free machining steel by melting into a thin film of liquid for a fraction of a microsecond to lubricate the cut. Other advantages to bismuth include: more uniformly distributed because of its similar density to iron; more environmentally friendly, as compared to lead; still weldable.|$|E

It is demonstrated that high-frequency vibrations superimposed onto the continuous movement of the <b>tool</b> <b>lead</b> to milling process stabilization with superior surface finish in comparison to conventional machining. A finite element model of the vibration milling tool was built and verified experimentally. The model treats the tool as an elastic pre-twisted structure (mill cutter) characterised by its natural vibration modes. The resonance frequencies of the axial vibration mode of cutters of two different lengths were predicted numerically and subsequently used for excitation of the vibration milling tool during cutting experiments. Qualitative and quantitative characterization of the surface quality of the machined stainless steel and titanium alloys was performed. Measurement results have confirmed that excitation of a specific tool mode {{is a prerequisite for}} achieving maximal efficiency of the vibration milling process. Statistical analysis of the collected roughness measurement data identified factors that most significantly contribute to the improved surface finish of the workpieces...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{effective}} orthogonal cutting edge in turning is considered. The orientation of this edge in the radial-longitudinal plane, as commonly modeled through an effective lead angle, is studied. The methods of effective lead angle prediction used in numerous previously developed force models are plagued with large errors over ranges of process inputs, in particular feed rate and depth of cut. Four previously developed methods of effective lead angle prediction are reviewed and compared to a new method presented here. This new method accounts for the size effect as introduced through the variation in chip thickness along the cutting edge, especially along the tool nose region. The difference in the new method is {{that the effect of}} continuous chip thickness variation along the cutting edge is included when evaluating the specific machining energies rather than using an average chip thickness, which has been used in the other methods. Therefore, the differential normal and friction force components acting on the rake face are functions of chip thickness through both the elemental chip load and the specific energies. Their directions are characterized by the orientations of the rake face and edge. By numerically integrating the differential force components modeled in this fashion, a significant improvement in effective lead angle prediction accuracy is realized. This improved accuracy is verified using experimental data obtained for 1018 steel and 304 stainless steel at varying levels of feed rate, depth of cut, cutting speed, nose radius and <b>tool</b> <b>lead</b> angle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Now a days as the {{industries}} are developing rapidly, man power reduces gradually in industries. In olden days almost all industries uses conventional machines for manufacturing processes. In conventional machining processes, the time consumption is very high, labour cost {{is high and}} which increases the manufacturing cost of the product. The accuracy is also not achieved as per the design requirements. To overcome all these difficulties, {{the industries}} are made automated through some devices such as electronic components, pneumatic device electrical equipments etc. For producing economically better quality products with high productivity, accuracy and quality, the conventional machine tools are being replaced gradually by the automated machine tool devices. Automation of the machines are made with help of Pneumatic device, Sensors, Mechatronics, and PLCs etc. Here the efforts are made to develop a electro pneumatic circuit for a shaping operations using a shaper machine. This makes the operations semi automatic producing shaping operations by a single point cutting tool. The three movements of the shaper are a) The reciprocating movement of the ram. b) The Crosswise movement of the <b>tool</b> <b>lead</b> across the cross rail. c) The vertical up and down movement of the table. The above movements are being automated using electropneumatic components such as pneumatic cylinders, direction control valves, flow control valves and other electrical and electronics devices. For automation of the shaper, an electropneumatic circuit is developed {{with the help of}} sensors, solenoids, electrical and electronic devices. The electro pneumatic circuit developed is simulated, executed and will be interfaced with PLCs, L 10 /L 20 manufactured by BOSCH – REXROTH Germany.

40|$|The {{review of}} manufacturer's {{programs}} to make thread milling cutters {{has shown that}} most of milling cutters are produced with the helical flutes with the ω slope angle {{within the range of}} 10 ° [...] . 30 °. Thus, thread milling cutters, made of high speed steels, essentially, are not produced. In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of thread milling cutter shaving with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the <b>tool</b> <b>lead</b> to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of thread milling cutter with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of thread milling cutter, made of cemented carbide and high speed steel. The paper presents a method for constructing models and key assumptions adopted for its development. Dependences are obtained for the model with a variation of the five factors (external diameter d, step profiles, P, rake γтц, clearance α, inclination angle of helical flutes ω) for thread milling cutters, made of cemented carbide and according to the model that extends the range of variation factors (d, P, γтц, ω) according to GOST 1336 - 77. Thus, this model to have the angles of the tooth profile of thread milling cutter with helical flutes can be used both to obtain the angles profile β 1 and β 2 {{in a wide range of}} varying tool parameters for all types of tool materials, and to broaden the possibilities for calculation of parameters according to GOST 1336 - 77. </p...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The LOMOLD {{process is}} a new plastic {{moulding}} process being researched at the University of Stellenbosch. The process essentially combines injection moulding and compression moulding. Molten plastic is forced into the mould cavity using a plunger. This plunger then forms part of the cavity wall. The plunger face must therefore follow the geometry of the part. Rapid Tooling evolved from Rapid Prototyping. There are two categories of Rapid Tooling: indirect and direct rapid tools. Indirect rapid tools are manufactured by using a master pattern to form the mould cavity. The accuracy of the mould cavity depends heavily on {{the accuracy of the}} master pattern. The master pattern is usually produced using Rapid Prototyping technology. Direct rapid tools use Rapid Prototyping technology to build the mould through and additive, layer by layer process or a subtractive process. This research investigates the use of Rapid Tools for the LOMOLD process. Aluminium Filled Epoxy Tooling (AFET) represents the indirect technology and CNC-machined tooling the direct technology. Both of these technologies are available at the University of Stellenbosch. Parts are manufactured on these tools using an experimental LOMOLD machine. These two technologies are compared in terms of part accuracy, <b>tool</b> <b>lead</b> time, tool cost and part cost. The research concluded that the only advantage the AFET has over the CNC-machined tool is a shorter manufacturing lead-time. In terms of tool cost, tool life, part geometric accuracy, part cost and cycle time the CNC tool is superior. Therefore the application of AFET is limited to small volume, prototype or pre-production runs for tool design confirmation, part functional testing and part appearance testing. It is also demonstrated that a cooling system on the AFET tool has no significant influence on the tool performance and should therefore, especially for production runs less than 150 parts, not be included in the tool to save on tool cost. Another conclusion is that the LOMOLD process is not consistent enough for a production process. This statement could be limited to the machine used for the research but to prove this statement wrong, the machine must be improved and more investigation is required...|$|E
