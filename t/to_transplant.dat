5|$|It {{has been}} noted that N. rajah {{produces}} a very extensive root system (for a Nepenthes) and, for this reason, {{it is recommended that}} a wide pot be used to allow for proper development of the root system. This also eliminates the need for frequent re-potting, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>transplant</b> shock and the eventual death of the plant.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1989, OTA {{approved}} a contract <b>to</b> <b>transplant</b> approximately 290 live {{trees in the}} path of the turnpike to locations along the edge of the right-of-way. There, the trees would serve as a barrier between the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree ($544.19 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects <b>to</b> <b>transplant</b> a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E

For example, LVAD often serves as a bridge <b>to</b> heart <b>transplant,</b> locoregional therapy (such as radiofrequency ablation) for hepatocellular carcinoma can serve as a bridge <b>to</b> liver <b>transplant,</b> and LVRS can serve as a bridge <b>to</b> lung <b>transplant.</b>|$|R

5|$|When an {{adequate}} band of attached tissue is absent, {{it can be}} recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods {{that can be used}} <b>to</b> <b>transplant</b> soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), gingiva from the palate can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the palate can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Smith {{moved to}} MIT as an Institute Professor with {{appointments}} {{in both the}} Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. His focus was <b>to</b> <b>transplant</b> the techniques of metallurgy into {{the study of the}} production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about this at the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic soil, {{with added}} peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult <b>to</b> <b>transplant,</b> though it can be readily grown as a pot plant. Along {{with other members of}} the genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E
5000|$|The acute or fulminant form of {{the disease}} (aGvHD) is {{normally}} observed within the first 100 days post-transplant, and is a major challenge <b>to</b> <b>transplants</b> owing <b>to</b> associated morbidity and mortality.|$|R

5|$|Several months later, a {{metallic}} artifact with inscriptions is discovered {{on the beach}} of Côte d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he falls into a dangerous coma. Hoping {{to find a cure}} for her partner, Scully rushes to Africa and discovers a massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the ocean. Skinner and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) desperately attempt to find the truth behind the alien object. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder, but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. The Smoking Man has taken Mulder away <b>to</b> <b>transplant</b> the telepathic part of Mulder's brain into his own cranium, but the surgery is a failure.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{successfully}} rendezvous in time {{to bring}} aboard the new host, a female (Nicole Orth-Pallavicini), much to Dr. Crusher's surprise. She helps with the other Trill <b>to</b> <b>transplant</b> Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. Crusher is uncomfortable, knowing both that the Trill appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will continue to live on {{in any number of}} hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. Crusher, but understands her confusion and discomfort, and promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. Crusher replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female host body, Odan then kisses the inner wrist of her hand.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} organ transplants began with several {{attempts}} that were unsuccessful due <b>to</b> <b>transplant</b> rejection.

25|$|Until recently, people labeled as obese {{were not}} {{considered}} appropriate candidates for renal transplantation.

25|$|Transplantation {{medicine}} {{is one of}} the most challenging and complex areas of modern medicine. Some of the key areas for medical management are the problems of transplant rejection, during which the body has an immune response to the transplanted organ, possibly leading <b>to</b> <b>transplant</b> failure and the need to immediately remove the organ from the recipient. When possible, transplant rejection can be reduced through serotyping to determine the most appropriate donor-recipient match and through the use of immunosuppressant drugs.|$|E

The methods of economic theoretical analyses are used where following definitions and assumptions some conclusions are drawn. This paper finds that factors such as inequality, rule of law and religion have significant effect on the ratio of cadaveric <b>transplants</b> <b>to</b> all <b>transplants.</b> The paper concludes that improvement in equality and in rule of law will increase the use of cadaveric kidney transplants.
