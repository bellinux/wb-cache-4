40|$|Introduction. Irregularities in <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> of {{the spine}} affect {{a large part of}} society and the problem affects the people at an {{increasingly}} younger age. Classical massage is a form of mechanotherapy that affects the regulation of the work of muscles, joints, tendons and ligaments. Aim of work: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of classical massage section of thoracolumbar spine to increase the mobility in these segments. Material: The study was carried out on 36 healthy volunteers (20 women and 16 men) aged 21 to 27 years old (average age - 23. 8) who were subjected to a series of five classical massages (according to strictly established protocol). In order to objectify the effects in all subjects before and after a series of treatments the following measurements were made: the fingers-floor test; the Otto -Wurna test; the straightening {{of the spine}}; lateral flexion of the spine; twist of the spine. Results A statistically important difference has been shown in the results of all tested variables before the first and after the last treatment of classical massage. Conclusions The results of personal research apply to young, healthy volunteers. It is worth to continue research into the effects of this form of therapy in the case of restrictions of <b>movable</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>property,</b> resulting from spinal pain syndromes...|$|R
40|$|Apparently article 1275, {{paragraph}} (1) of the Civil Code {{covers all}} situations that may arise in practice, {{without making a}} distinction for the constituent or transferring contracts if they are of the same or of different nature.

Corroborating this text with the norms in article 937 paragraph (1) of the Civil Code and article 1273 paragraph (1) of the Civil Code it leads to the solution according to which article 1275 of the Civil Code regards only the cases where the transfer of successive property are of the same nature, the onerous primary act has not resulted in immediate transmission of real previous right of the document with the free subsidiary title and when the primal act is free, and the alternative is onerous.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} to what extent should a lease of <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> fall within the ambits of the National Credit Act. The paper analyses the courts decisions regarding leases of <b>movable</b> <b>properties,</b> and further adds value to the existing scholarship. Courts are not ready to entertain extrinsic evidence in the cases where it contradicts the terms of an agreement. Parties should make sure that their contractual provisions are clear and unambiguous. Such provisions depict the notion that a lease of a <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> should fall within the ambits of the National Credit Act, hereinafter called NCA. And in such circumstances that qualifies it in terms of the Act ought to be met. In terms of section 8 (4) of the NCA, a lease of <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> should by no means exclude the provision that ownership will pass to the lessee upon payment of the final rental instalment. Alternatively upon meeting certain conditions as determined by parties. One should therefore be able to differentiate leases in terms of the NCA and leases as defined by common law. Thus, one cannot try to qualify common law leases within the context of section 8 (4) of the NCA where the original intention was an ordinary common law lease agreement. The Court in the case of ABSA Technology v Michael`s Bid House concluded that the NCA was not applicable to leases of <b>movable</b> <b>property</b> in certain circumstances. It is the findings of this paper that courts, recognize lease of movable propert...|$|R
