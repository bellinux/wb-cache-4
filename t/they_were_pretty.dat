We worked mainly four on, four off. Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E
500|$|In the film, Ferris convinces Cameron {{to borrow}} his father's rare 1961 Ferrari GT California. [...] "The insert {{shots of the}} Ferrari were of the real 250 GT California", Hughes {{explains}} in the DVD commentary. [...] "The cars we used in the wide shots were obviously reproductions. There were only 100 of these cars, so it was way too expensive to destroy. We {{had a number of}} replicas made. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> good, but for the tight shots I needed a real one, so we brought one in to the stage and shot the inserts with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{writers have}} {{commented on the}} {{parallel}} between the love darts of snails and the love darts fired by the mythological being Cupid, known as Eros in Greek mythology. It is even possible {{that there is a}} connection between the behavior of the snails and the myth. Malacologist (mollusk expert) Ronald Chase of McGill University said about the garden snail Cornu aspersum, [...] "I believe the myth of Cupid and his arrows has its basis in this snail species, which is native to Greece". He added, [...] "The Greeks probably knew about this behavior because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> good naturalists and observers." ...|$|E

500|$|Gilbert {{was known}} for being {{sometimes}} prickly. [...] Aware of this general impression, he claimed that [...] "If you give me your attention", the misanthrope's song from Princess Ida, was a satiric self-reference, saying: [...] "I thought it my duty {{to live up to}} my reputation." [...] However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity. [...] Actress May Fortescue recalled, [...] "His kindness was extraordinary. [...] On wet nights and when rehearsals were late and the last buses were gone, he would pay the cab-fares of the girls whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> or not, instead of letting them trudge home on foot... He was just as large-hearted when he was poor as when he was rich and successful. [...] For money as money he cared less than nothing. [...] Gilbert was no plaster saint, but he was an ideal friend." [...] The journalist Frank M. Boyd wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slant magazine, Keith Uhlich {{gave the}} season an overall rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five, {{finding that the}} {{appointment}} of Morgan and Wong was [...] "an inspired choice that led to, arguably, the finest episodic run ever produced under [...] Carter's Ten-Thirteen Productions banner". Uhlich found that the season was torn between episodes remaining true to the Carter-led first season's [...] "serial killer of the week" [...] format and make-it-up-as-you-go-along approach to storytelling", and Morgan and Wong's attempt to introduce a continuous story arc which lent a [...] "sealed-off feel" [...] to the season, finding that the latter approach lead to a [...] "compulsively watchable" [...] but largely dated end result. DVD Talk's Bill Gibron rated the season overall four-and-a-half stars out of five, finding that the new thematic direction was [...] "right on the money". Gibron felt that the season [...] "was truly ahead of its time. It predates and predicts such fashionable fads as The Da Vinci Code, the omens of terrorist evil and the slow erosion of the citizenry's faith in the Federal Government". Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, wrote that [...] "the second season of Millennium {{is some sort of}} work of weird genius". VanDerWerff added that the season [...] "moves like a series with a new purpose, with a new sense of meaning. Morgan and Wong start tossing ideas at the wall with a thrilling abandon, almost as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> sure they’d never work in Hollywood again".|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{was written}} by Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and its {{producer}} Ian Kirkpatrick, and was included on Dua Lipa's eponymous debut studio album in 2017. Lipa worked on the record during three years, stating that the extended process led to her writing and recording songs until {{she felt she had}} a considerable amount to pick from. When asked what it was like working with younger artists like Lipa and Noah Cyrus, Warren stated that they both were [...] "older souls" [...] and that she helped them to express what they wanted to say. [...] "In both cases <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> comfortable telling those stories. [...] end up being true to each artist because it is coming from their story, too," [...] Warren said. Kirkpatrick also engineered and programmed the track, while Chris Gehringer mastered it and Josh Gudwin mixed it. Talking about the song, the artist explained that [...] "'New Rules' is quite different to a lot of tracks on the album. I wanted it to feel very new [...] It's the breakup song that I wish I had when I was breaking up with someone" [...] and that [...] "It's about keeping your distance from someone who's bad for you. I'm setting some rules down so [...] won't go back to that person." [...] "New Rules" [...] was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017 as the album's sixth single. It impacted the same format in the United States on 22 August 2017. Three days later, a remixed version by Australian DJ Alison Wonderland was released on iTunes.|$|E

500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966–67, Gouldman {{recorded}} singles {{with two}} other bands, High Society and the Manchester Mob, both of which featured singer Peter Cowap. In March 1968, he stepped in as a temporary replacement for bassist Bob Lang in the Mindbenders, writing two of the band's final singles, [...] "Schoolgirl" [...] and [...] "Uncle Joe, the Ice Cream Man". The band dissolved eight months later. Gouldman said his time with the band was depressing: [...] "They were sliding down, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> well finished by the time I joined them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peyton {{was further}} {{designed}} as an artist, {{in order to}} add more depth to the character and express what she cannot or {{does not want to}} say. It also complemented her romance with Lucas, as both are deep thinkers who use their skills to speak to the world. The actual artist of Peyton's works is Helen Ward. [...] "Before joining , I had already worked as a set designer, storyboard artist and illustrator for a number of films. But I still had to try out for the job," [...] she said. [...] "I think they asked a bunch of people to give their shot at a particular drawing. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> specific about what they were looking for. I guess my work was closest. I got the job." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fenton {{introduced}} continental {{ideas to}} the team, revamping training methods and taking inspiration from higher ranked teams, and even inspiring some. Fenton had been impressed greatly by the all-conquering Hungarians of the 1950s led by Ferenc Puskás, and the Casseteri program {{and development of the}} academy were at the core. [...] Ernie Gregory said (of the 1950s diet), [...] "We'd usually eaten fish or chicken and toast before then, but Dr. Thomas advised us all to eat steak and rice two hours before kick-off. All the other clubs copied us after that." [...] However, not all the changes were strictly down to Fenton; Musgrove attributed much of the training regime to Allison, {{going so far as to}} state that once the players were at the club (signed by Fenton) <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>pretty</b> much Allison's property. [...] As well as being a student of the game himself, Fenton encouraged all players to take coaching badges and many of his former players went on to coaching and managing roles after they retired. [...] The Academy also involved, beyond the routine training and development of the youth and squad, actual tactical discussions between the players.|$|E
