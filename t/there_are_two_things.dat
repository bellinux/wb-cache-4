500|$|The {{concert was}} {{telecast}} {{live by the}} National Broadcasting Company (NBC) {{to an audience of}} 26 million viewers. As part of its program, NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about Connotations. While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score, Copland said, [...] "It seems to me that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> you can do when listening to any new work. The {{most important thing is to}} lend yourself—or to put it another way—try to be as sensitive as you can to the overall feeling the new piece gives off. The second way is to listen with some awareness of the general shape of the new piece, realizing that a composer works with his musical materials just as an architect works with his building materials in order to construct an edifice that makes sense." [...] He then discussed the work briefly but in some detail.|$|E

2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>two</b> <b>things</b> {{to which}} I am devoted: {{absolute}} academic and spiritual freedom, and {{the subordination of}} the state to the interests of the individual; expressed in other forms, the furthering of conditions in which the individual can develop to the best of his ability—as far as it is possible with a full understanding of the fetters imposed upon us by tradition; and the fight against all forms of power policy of states or private organizations. This means a devotion to principles of true democracy. I object to teaching of slogans intended to befog the mind, of whatever kind they may be. (letter from Boas to John Dewey, 11/6/39) ...|$|E
