Because of the crossing an interlocking signal system was necessary <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>trains,</b> and {{it was necessary to}} have an operator on duty 24 hours a day. Three operators were hired, each working an eight-hour shift, in addition to the agent. Section crews were located at Linby by both railroads and the town began to grow rapidly, creating need for goods and living quarters. The depot was quite large, built to accommodate a number of passengers. The main office surrounded by windows commanded a view down the right-of-way of both railroads. The remainder of the building included a waiting room, baggage and freight room. Up to 20 or more trains passed through Linby including passenger trains day and night.|$|R

50|$|Responsibility lay {{primarily}} with Mr Elliott, the chief clerk. He had directed {{a course of}} action which ignored Company rules. These laid down that the main guard should not leave his van until perfectly satisfied that his brake would hold the train (the train should therefore have been allowed to ease back upon the rear brake van); once he had left his brake, no attempt should be made to move the train until he was back at the brake. Meanwhile, the more junior guard should have gone back down the track <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> These precautions had been omitted to pursue a strategy (dividing the train) which, even had nothing gone wrong, would have had no advantages over awaiting the scheduled train to assist the excursion to Hamilton's Bawn.If Mr. Elliott had therefore only had the prudence to wait where the excursion train stopped {{near the top of the}} bank and to send back one of the guards to protect his train, with instructions to ask the driver of the ordinary train to help the excursion train up the short remaining distance, he would hardly have lost time and would, besides, have avoided the risk inseparable from the delicate operation he unwisely determined to carry out and which should have been resorted to under only most exceptional circumstances and not, as in the present case, where there was so easy a solution of the difficulty.|$|E
5000|$|The 45th and Colonel McCray's brigade, was {{assigned}} to Maj. Gen. James F. Fagan's division, of Sterling Price's Army of Missouri, for Price's Missouri Expedition (commonly referred to a Price's Raid). [...] The 45th fought {{in some of the}} most fierce combat operations on Price's Raid. Its war record is mixed. It was hampered due to lack of ammunition, food, blankets weapons, and uniforms. It also was hampered by leadership who were used to operating as Infantry, and several of the men were conscripts, and deserters. Colonel Baber was captured in the fight near Independence, Missouri, on October 22, 1864. Upon Colonel Baber's capture, Lieutenant Colonel John W. Clark assumed command of the regiment. Major George R. James was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and Captain C. J. Wasburn, who had previously commanded Company A, was advanced to the rank of Major. According to John Edward's [...] "Shelby and his Men", and the book [...] "Action Before Westport", the crossing of the Little Blue on the afternoon and evening of the 21st of October 1864 was met with fierce Federal resistance. Elements of Fagan's Division (which the 45th belonged to) were trying to protect the crossing and Price's very long train. Cabell's brigade was ordered <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> in order to allow Fagan's troops to concentrate on forcing the crossing. Somewhere during that time frame Colonel Baber was captured, however the records are not clear as to exactly when or how Colonel Baber was captured. Colonel Baber was sent first to Alton prison and then transferred to Camp Douglas. While a prisoner of war, Colonel Baber wrote letters on behalf of the enlisted prisoners requesting blankets.|$|E
40|$|Introducing new {{technology}} generally {{has the potential}} to improve safety and/or efficiency. For example, Positive Train Control is designed to both enhance operations and increase safety. Positive Train Control is designed <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> from driver error by applying the brakes if the system thinks the driver will over-speed, pass a signal showing a red aspect or operate outside limits set by train controllers (Wreathall, Woods, Bing and Christoffersen, 2007). This seeks to reduce driver errors that lead to worker injuries, harm to the general public and significant economic losses for the rail operators (Wreathall, Woods et al., 2007). According to Wreathall, Woods et al. (2007), the US National Transportation Safety Board has identified over 100 collisions that could have been avoided by a full-function Positive Train Control system. The installation of a similar system in the UK (known as the Train Protection Warning System, TPWS) that intervenes if the train is predicted to over-speed or fail to stop at a red signal has led to a 22 per cent reduction in signals passed at danger (SPADs) and an estimated 86 per cent reduction in overall risk (Rail Accident Investigation Branch, 2008). This presents an impressive case for the installation of such systems in the rail industry...|$|E
50|$|In October 2008, a {{road trip}} from Mendoza to the Chilean border at Las Cuevas showed that the line {{is in a very}} {{neglected}} state but is by no means beyond repair. The rails are still in place, at least wherever the track {{can be seen from the}} road, but in many cases there are rocks and other debris on the track. In some places there is significant avalanche debris covering the track completely. In other places recent improvements to the main road have left behind construction debris on the track. In most cases the bridges are in excellent condition, some even showing signs of a recent coat of paint, in stark contrast to the state of the track itself. At Puente de Los Incas hundreds of tourists walk across the tracks every day to view the natural bridge. If it ever reopens, this line could become one of the world's most spectacular railway journeys. The rails and associated features on the Chilean side (from the tunnel at Los Libertadores to near the Saladillo junction (above the Río Blanco station)), are in much worse condition than the infrastructure on the Argentine side of the frontier. In many places the rails have been removed, or covered by landslides. Some of <b>the</b> sheds <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> and rails from snow and rocks are now virtually buried or otherwise unusable.
