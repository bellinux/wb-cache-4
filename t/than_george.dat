5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs {{as well as a}} coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history. Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Davis, who at the time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|George Elsworth Smith {{was born}} in Sewickley, Pennsylvania in 1862 to Elizabeth ("Eliza") and Christian Smith. The Smith family also {{included}} two sisters, Annie and Elizabeth, and another son, William C. Smith, that {{was a few years}} younger <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Smith. His mother was originally from Ireland and emigrated to the United States in 1857, and his father was a carpenter from Baden, Germany. Eliza remarried after Christian Smith's death in the early 1870s to retail grocer Edward Downing, who died in the 1880s. She remarried a second time on November 20, 1906 to real estate and coal developer Thomas S. Wood after George Smith's death.|$|E
5|$|Franklin County, {{which has}} elected Kilroy twice, makes up 87% of the 15th Congressional {{district}}. The 2006 race in Ohio's 15th district gained significant national attention {{as it was}} seen {{as one of a}} handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain from Republicans. As of mid-October, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to incumbent Representative Pryce's leadership in the Republican Party. Pryce had not had a close contest since her first election in 1992 and had garnered 10% more of the vote <b>than</b> <b>George</b> W. Bush in 2004. However, Pryce was vulnerable due to Ohio Republican Party (Bob Taft and Bob Ney) scandals, the lagging Ohio economy, her association with controversial Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley, and backlash to Republican support of the Iraq War. Another Ohio Republican scandal in the minds of Ohio voters during the 2006 campaign was the Coingate scandal. Pryce and the Republicans had to keep conservative independent, Charles Morrison, off the ballot to have their best shot at success. A month before the election, Pryce was 12points behind Kilroy. On the eve of the election, some experts, such as Time, considered Pryce the underdog. Kilroy was expected to be the beneficiary of the decade-long migration of conservative voters to suburbs outside of the district.|$|E

25|$|After {{three years}} at the Old Vic, Olivier advised Gambon to gain {{experience}} in provincial rep. In 1967, he left the NT for the Birmingham Repertory Company, which was to give him his first crack at the title roles in Othello (his favourite), Macbeth and Coriolanus. Gambon was suggested {{for the role of}} James Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), although he was dismissed for being even less known <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Lazenby who was cast.|$|E
25|$|The {{best friend}} of George Osborne, William Dobbin is tall, ungainly, and not {{particularly}} handsome. He {{is a few}} years older <b>than</b> <b>George</b> but has been friends with him since his school days even though Dobbin's father is a fig-merchant and the Osbornes belong to the genteel class and have become independently wealthy. He defends George and is blind to his faults in many ways although he tries to force George to do the right thing. He pushes George to keep his promise to marry Amelia even though Dobbin is in love with Amelia himself. After George is killed, Dobbin puts together an annuity to help support Amelia, ostensibly with the help of George's fellow officers.|$|E
25|$|In {{football}} Jepson was a goalkeeper, {{after leaving}} Newark Town {{he played for}} Mansfield Town and then Grantham Town. In June 1938 he joined Port Vale and made his Third Division South debut in a 1–0 defeat at Clapton Orient on 8 September. He {{proved to be a}} more competent keeper <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Heppell and was an ever-present at The Old Recreation Ground {{during the rest of the}} 1938–39 season despite problems with injury and gaining permission to play from Nottinghamshire CCC. Also a regular during the 1939–40 campaign, during the war he guested for Nottingham Forest, Watford, Notts County and Swansea Town. After his demobbing from the forces in October 1945 he was one of six pre-war Port Vale players who returned to Burslem, regaining his place in the side.|$|E

Although the upper-class characters {{disapprove of the}} alliance, nobody is more scandalised <b>than</b> <b>George's</b> father, who keeps reminding his son that he's [...] "the scum of the earth." [...] When Emily becomes pregnant, she suggests giving the child to George's father; George, appalled, begs her {{to sell it to}} pirates, abandon it on a mountain, or let it be raised by wolves instead.|$|R

500|$|Hirst {{completed}} the double 14 times, {{more than any}} other cricketer except Rhodes. Unusually for an all-rounder, for much of his career he was equally successful as a batsman and as a bowler. Consequently, he was a key member of the Yorkshire team. His Yorkshire captain Lord Hawke described Hirst as [...] "the greatest county cricketer of all time", and journalist Jim Kilburn noted that no cricketer could [...] "capture the heart and the imagination and the affections more firmly <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Herbert Hirst." [...] E. W. Swanton described his typical style of play as [...] "grafting for victory without heroics". His record as a Test cricketer was less impressive than his figures in county cricket, owing to some extent to playing conditions during his two tours of Australia which reduced the effectiveness of his bowling and batting.|$|E
500|$|Even {{film critics}} who {{generally}} disliked the film tended to enjoy Scar's characterization and Irons' performance. Terrence Rafferty of The New Yorker wrote, [...] "Among the celebrity {{voices on the}} soundtrack, two performances stand out," [...] namely, [...] "Jeremy Irons, as the villainous lion Scar" [...] who [...] "does an elegant, funny George Sanders impersonation." [...] (Sanders himself had voiced Shere Khan for Disney in their 1967 version of The Jungle Book). Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun described Irons' voice as [...] "plummy-rich with rancid irony." [...] Television Without Pitys Ethan Alter admitted to enjoying Scar, praising the character as [...] "a fantastic villain and easily the most fully realized of the film's characters, thanks both to Jeremy Irons' marvelously wicked vocal performance and some clever character flourishes {{on behalf of the}} animators." [...] David Denby of New York, who otherwise criticized the film, felt that [...] "Irons... sounds like he's having a better time than he's ever had in movies before." [...] In a rare lukewarm review, Anthony Quinn of The Independent felt that Irons' performance was too campy: [...] "more Liberace <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Sanders." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes." [...] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin [...] "his Lost in Translation." ...|$|E

500|$|Harrison's songwriting ability {{improved}} {{throughout the}} Beatles' career, but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin until near the group's break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: [...] "Until this year, our songs {{have been better}} <b>than</b> <b>George's.</b> Now this year his songs {{are at least as}} good as ours". Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs. Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions; three of his songs appear on Revolver, [...] "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter", according to Inglis.|$|R

2500|$|When Jackie Grant gave up cricket {{to become}} a missionary (like his grandfather), his brother Rolph Grant became captain for the 1939 tour rather <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Headley [...] "The {{appointment}} of Rolph Grant was historically necessary, for British colonialism based itself {{on the idea that}} the colonised were inferior people who were incapable of self-rule. The whites in the colonies subscribed to this fallacy, so they could not appoint a black skipper : to do so would have been tantamount to rejecting the cardinal logic of colonialism." ...|$|E

As he released George, he said, 'Anytime you want to talk to me, just pick up the phone and come over.' It was a vintage LBJ performance." ...|$|E

He is noticed by Louis Alexandre, Count of Toulouse, who takes him on as a page, and later as a valet de chambre. He became a Captain of the Mounted Constabulary. He is {{assigned}} the mission of getting rid of the Wolves in the Forest of Rennes and protecting the convoy that will escort the takings of taxes.

2500|$|Also, John Adams Presidential dollars {{have been}} {{discovered}} with plain edges. They are fewer in quantity <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Washington plain-edge dollars, making them rarer, thus more expensive. A more frequently encountered edge lettering error for the John Adams dollar is a coin with doubled edge lettering. This error occurs when a coin passes through the edge lettering machine twice. Most examples of the doubled-edge-letter John Adams dollar are from the Philadelphia Mint (Denver Mint issues are comparatively scarce). They are seen in two varieties: 1) with both edge lettering inscriptions reading in the same direction, called [...] "overlapped", and 2) with the two inscriptions running in opposite directions—i.e., inverted or upside-down relative to one another—called [...] "inverted".|$|E
2500|$|The string {{arrangement}} {{reinforces the}} song's air of sadness, in the groaning cello line {{that connects the}} two halves of the bridge, notably the [...] "blue" [...] seventh in the second bridge pass (the E played after the vocal line, [...] "I don't know / she wouldn't say") [...] and in the descending run by the viola that segues the bridge back into the verses, mimicked by McCartney's vocal on the second pass of the bridge. This viola line, the [...] "blue" [...] cello phrase, the high A sustained by the violin over the final verse and the minimal use of vibrato are elements of the string arrangement attributable to McCartney rather <b>than</b> <b>George</b> Martin.|$|E
2500|$|In some episodes, George aligns {{with both}} Kramer and Elaine, against whom he's also {{frequently}} pitted. With Elaine, while {{he gets into}} arguments with her, they also work together, most notably in [...] "The Cadillac", although George states in [...] "The Dinner Party" [...] that he's frightened of Elaine. George and Kramer usually feel awkward around one another but find themselves working together (and against one another) in [...] "The Busboy", [...] "The Stall" [...] and [...] "The Slicer". [...] "The Susie" [...] is the only episode where their relationship is as prominent as {{the relationships between the}} other characters.
