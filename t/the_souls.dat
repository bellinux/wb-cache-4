5000|$|Vives {{expressed}} an interest in <b>the</b> <b>soul.</b> He believed that understanding how <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> functions is more valuable than understanding <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> itself. “He was not concerned with what <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> is, but rather what <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> was like”. Norena explains that Vives thought that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> had certain characteristics. He believed that the best part of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> is its ability to [...] "…understand, remember, reason, and judge." [...] Vives touched on the mind in terms of his explanations of the soul—he claims that one cannot simply define what <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> is, but by piecing together parts of it, a better concept of how <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> works can be achieved. He compared <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> to art with an analogy by stating: “How we perceive a painted picture is more telling than declaring what the picture is itself”. Vives rejected the deterministic view of human behavior, and said instead that our soul can [...] "modify our behavior in ethically and socially."

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF ASTERIOS STAMATIKOS, for the Master of Philosophy {{degree in}} Philosophy, {{presented}} on October 14, 2014, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. 2 ̆ 2 FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT: ΘΎΜΟϚ IN THE REPUBLIC 2 ̆ 2 MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Thomas Alexander This paper {{shows that the}} spirted part of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> should be ranked above the appetitive part of <b>the</b> <b>soul,</b> according to <b>the</b> standards Plato set forth in The Republic. Plato exalted the rational part of <b>the</b> <b>soul,</b> but he likened the spirited part of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> to <b>the</b> rational part in various ways. The moral goodness of the spirited part of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> can be shown through the ways it {{is similar to the}} rational part. These ways include the similarities between the regimes based on the rational and spirited part of <b>the</b> <b>soul,</b> as well as the characteristics of the spirited part of <b>the</b> <b>soul,</b> which make it auxiliary to the rational part of <b>the</b> <b>soul.</b> <b>The</b> spirited part of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> fights against injustice within <b>the</b> <b>soul,</b> allying itself with the rational part against the desirous part; spiritedness also rises up when it perceives evil external to <b>the</b> <b>soul.</b> <b>The</b> way in which Plato exalted the rational part of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> allows for an argument like this to be made. One way he shows the superiority of the rational part of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> is by condemning the other two parts. Plato praised the spirited part of <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> for <b>the</b> most part though, and some of the characteristics he attributed to the spiritedness were in accord with the virtues and social order of classical Athens...|$|R

60|$|Answer 5. <b>The</b> <b>soul</b> {{will be most}} tormented, because strongest; {{the biggest}} burden must lie upon the strongest part, {{especially}} since, also, it is made capable of it by its sin. <b>The</b> <b>soul</b> must bear its own punishment, and {{a great part of}} the body's too, forasmuch as, so far as apprehension goes, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> will be quicker at the work than the body. True, the body, by the help of <b>the</b> <b>soul,</b> will see too, but <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> will see yet abundantly further. And good reason that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> should bear part of the punishment of the body, because it was through its allurements that the body yielded to help <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> to sin. <b>The</b> devil presented sin, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> took it by the body, and now devil, and soul, and body, and all must be lost, cast away; that is, damned in hell for sin; but <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> must be <b>the</b> burden bearer.|$|R
