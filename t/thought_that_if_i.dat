David Abramowitz, creative consultant {{from the second}} season onwards, said, [...] "When I saw her and Adrian together, I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> died, {{and there was a}} Mount Olympus, {{that the two of them}} would be standing together with thunderbolts around them. They were god-like. They were so beautiful and had such presence." [...] Paul said that he was [...] "detached" [...] from the fictional relationship between Tessa and MacLeod, but that [...] "...it was a good relationship". Later, he said he [...] "...was sad to see it go." ...|$|E

[...] In 2010, Parton said she became involved with the operation because she [...] "always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> made it big or got successful at what I had started out to do, that I wanted to come back to my part of the country and do something great, something that would bring a lot of jobs into this area." ...|$|E

2500|$|Axelrod {{contemplated}} {{taking a}} break from politics during the 2008 presidential campaign, as five of the candidates—Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Chris Dodd and Tom Vilsack—were past clients. Personal ties between Axelrod and Hillary Clinton made it difficult, as she had raised significant funds for epilepsy on behalf of a foundation co-founded by Axelrod's wife and mother, Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE). (Axelrod's daughter suffers from developmental disabilities associated with chronic epileptic seizures.) Axelrod's wife even said that a 1999 conference Clinton convened to find a cure for the condition was [...] "one {{of the most important things}} anyone has done for epilepsy." [...] Axelrod ultimately decided to participate in the Obama campaign, and served as chief strategist and media advisor for Obama. He told The Washington Post, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could help Barack Obama get to Washington, then I would have accomplished something great in my life." ...|$|E

[...] Philip Levine ...|$|R
60|$|These were {{therefore}} difficulties insurmountable, and such as I knew not {{what to do}} in. I had such strong impressions on my mind about discovering myself to my brother, formerly my husband, that I could not withstand them; and the rather, because it ran constantly in my <b>thoughts,</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{did not do it}} while he lived, I might in vain endeavour to convince my son afterward that I was really the same person, and that I was his mother, and so might both lose the assistance and comfort of the relation, and the benefit of whatever it was my mother had left me; and yet, on the other hand, I could never think it proper to discover myself to them in the circumstances I was in, as well relating to the having a husband with me as to my being brought over by a legal transportation as a criminal; on both which accounts it was absolutely necessary to me to remove from the place where I was, and come again to him, as from another place and in another figure.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>thought</b> of <b>that.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> {{could get}} a good bed, I'd try it awhile anyhow. You see the hotels have raised.

6000|$|... "For a {{good many}} years," [...] says Mack, [...] "I've <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever had extravagant money I'd rent a two-room cabin somewhere, hire a Chinaman to cook, and sit in my {{stocking}} feet and read Buckle's History of Civilisation." ...|$|E
60|$|I told him, smiling, that {{no doubt}} I {{could have found}} a ship much nearer my native place, but I had <b>thought</b> to myself <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{was to be a}} seaman then I would be a British seaman and no other. It was a matter of {{deliberate}} choice.|$|R

6000|$|... "Children love me so, that {{sometimes}} I half fancy--it's a silly fancy, William--they have some way I don't know of, of feeling for my little child, and me, and understanding why their love is precious to me. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> have been quiet since, I {{have been more}} happy, William, in a hundred ways. Not least happy, dear, in this- -that even when my little child was born and dead but a few days, and I was weak and sorrowful, and could not help grieving a little, the <b>thought</b> arose, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> tried to lead a good life, I should meet in Heaven a bright creature, who would call me, Mother!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] mused Peter. [...] "I {{spoke to}} Wilkinson, of Kingsley's, myself. He advised {{me to try}} and get Landor's. He <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could get an {{advertisement}} out of Landor, he might persuade his people to give us theirs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Kinney, {{looking at}} Bartley for his approval, [...] "and I've always <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever got run clean ashore, high and dry, I'd make a stagger {{to write it}} out and do {{something}} with it. Do you suppose I could?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am glad of that,' she said. 'I always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had {{a father}} I {{should like to}} love him. If you had been my father I expect as you would have wanted me to love you, and I am sure I should {{never be able to}} do it.' ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the negro}} porter bedded {{me up for}} the night and I had solved the problem of undressing while lying down,--I was much cheered by the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> {{anything}} happened <b>I</b> should have to stay where I was and wait till the kerosene lamps set the overturned car alight and burned me to death. It is easier {{to get out of}} a full theatre than to leave a Pullman in haste.|$|R
50|$|Went {{to visit}} the Duke of Norfolk and to know whether he would sell me any of his {{cartoons}} and other drawings of Raphael and the great masters. He answered me that he would part with and sell anything for money but his wife the Duchess who stood near him; and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> with myself <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were in his condition she {{should be the first}} thing that I would be glad to part with.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{to myself}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> stayed to drag {{this man to}} the village stocks or some other safe place, {{there would be an}} end of meeting with my love that day, and I did not know when I might find another chance. Now I would not have missed that hour's talk with Lily to bring a score of murderous-minded foreigners to their deserts, and, moreover, this one had earned good payment for his behaviour. Surely thought I, he might wait a while till I had done my love-making, and if he would not wait I could find a means to make him do so. Not twenty paces from us the horse stood {{cropping}} the grass. I went to him and undid his bridle rein, and with it fastened the Spaniard to a small wayside tree as best I was able.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{said a word}} to her, {{perhaps that}} would be enough.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Bold, almost {{trembling}} with hesitation. [...] "The Jupiter, you know, {{has taken the}} matter up very strongly.

6000|$|... "The reason I {{wanted that}} darned thing was because I've just got engaged {{to a girl}} over in England, and I <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could hand my father that china figure-thing {{with one hand and}} break the news with the other, it might help a bit.

40|$|Human {{urine and}} flush water are {{eventually}} converted into drinking {{water with the}} Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) aboard the International Space Station (ISS). This conversion is made possible through the Distillation Assembly (DA) of the UPA. One component of the DA is a molded circular piston cup made of virgin polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The piston cup is assembled to a titanium component using eight fasteners and washers. Molded PTFE produced for spare piston cups {{in the first quarter}} of 2010 was different in appearance and texture, and softer than material molded for previous cups. For the suspect newer PTFE material, cup fasteners were tightened to only one-half the required torque value, yet the washers embedded almost halfway into the material. The molded PTFE used in the DA piston cup should be Type II, based on AMS 3667 D and ASTM D 4894 specifications. The properties of molded PTFE are considerably different between Type I and II materials. Engineers working with the DA <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Type <b>I</b> PTFE was molded by mistake instead of Type II material, that could have resulted in the anomalous material properties. Typically, the vendor molds flat sheet PTFE from the same material lot used to mold the piston cups, and tensile testing as part of quality control should verify that the PTFE is Type II material. However, for this discrepant lot of material, such tensile data was not available. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were two of the testing techniques used at the NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to investigate the anomaly for the PTFE material. Other techniques used on PTFE specimens were: Shore D hardness testing, tensile testing on dog bone specimens and a qualitative estimation of porosity by optical and scanning electron microscopy...|$|R

It {{was the only one}} of the sort in {{existence}} at the time, and the wires at the side would at once suffice to identify it and to arouse the suspicion even of an English policeman. I paused for a moment behind a thick clump of lilacs and tried to pull out the incriminating negatives. Oh, Una, I did it for your sake; but there, terrified and trembling, in hiding behind the bushes, and in danger of my life, with that still more unspeakable danger for yours haunting me always like a nightmare, can you wonder that for the moment I almost felt myself a murderer? The very breezes in the trees made my heart give a jump, and then stand still within me. I got out the first two or three plates with some trifling difficulty, for I didn't understand the automatic apparatus then as I understand it now: but the fourth stuck hard for a minute; the fifth broke in two; and the sixth--well, the sixth plate baffled me entirely by getting jammed in the clockwork, and refusing to move, either backward or forward.|$|R
60|$|I now took {{leave of}} printing, as I thought, for ever, and was daily {{employed}} {{in my new}} business, going about with Mr. Denham among the tradesmen to purchase various articles, and seeing them pack'd up, doing errands, calling upon workmen to dispatch, etc.; and, when all was on board, I had a few days' leisure. On one of these days, I was, to my surprise, sent for by a great man I knew only by name, a Sir William Wyndham, and I waited upon him. He had heard by some means or other of my swimming from Chelsea to Blackfriar's, and of my teaching Wygate and another young man to swim in a few hours. He had two sons, about to set out on their travels; he wish'd to have them first taught swimming, and proposed to gratify me handsomely <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would teach them. They were not yet come to town, and my stay was uncertain, so I could not undertake it; but, from this incident, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it likely <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to remain in England and open a swimming-school, I might get {{a good deal of}} money; and it struck me so strongly, that, had the overture been sooner made me, probably I should not so soon have returned to America. After many years, you and I had something of more importance to do with one of these sons of Sir William Wyndham, become Earl of Egremont, which I shall mention in its place.|$|R
