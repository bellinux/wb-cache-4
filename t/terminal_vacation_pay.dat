50|$|Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. {{filed for}} bankruptcy; {{employees}} subsequently lost their jobs. The company paid all wages, salaries, commissions, and <b>vacation</b> <b>pay</b> through termination. The Ministry of Labour for the Province of Ontario audited {{the company to}} ensure that no further payments were owed to former employees under the Employment Standards Act (ESA). Proof of claim was submitted to a trustee, who subsequently disallowed the claim. According to the trustee, a company's bankruptcy does not constitute dismissal from employment; thus, the former employees of Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes gained no positive right to severance, termination or <b>vacation</b> <b>pay</b> under the ESA.|$|R

25|$|On December 5, 2008, {{members of}} UE Local 1110 at Republic Windows and Doors in Chicago, when the plant closed {{with only three}} days notice to the employees, {{occupied}} the plant in protest of the closing and company's failure to pay employees their accrued <b>vacation</b> <b>pay,</b> and payments required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The WARN Act requires 60 days notice of a plant closing, or 60 days pay if timely notice is not given. The workers' action drew extensive media coverage and attracted wide support, including from US President-elect Barack Obama, and Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich banned state business with Bank of America, because the bank's cancellation of the company's line of credit had prompted the shutdown. Protest demonstrations at Bank of America branches took place in dozens of US cities during the sit-in. On December 10 the union members voted to end the occupation after Republic, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and the union negotiated a settlement that paid each worker eight weeks wages, plus all accumulated <b>vacation</b> <b>pay,</b> and health insurance for two months.|$|R
50|$|There is no Pennsylvania {{labor law}} which {{requires}} an employer {{to pay an}} employee not to work. Benefits like sick leave, <b>vacation</b> <b>pay,</b> and severance pay are payments to an employee not to be at work. Therefore, an employer only has to pay these benefits if the employer has a policy to pay such benefits or a contract with you to pay these benefits. An employer must follow its own rules {{for these kinds of}} payments.|$|R

[...] Reisner argues that this gives employers an obligation to fairly compensate workers including sick and <b>vacation</b> <b>pay.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Since his retirement, Stewart {{has been}} the subject of an {{investigation}} by the Office of the Auditor General of Canada, Sheila Fraser.

[...] The file was handed over to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for investigation.|$|R
2500|$|But the CIO unions on {{the whole}} grew {{stronger}} during the war. [...] The government put pressure on employers to recognize unions to avoid the sort of turbulent struggles over union recognition of the 1930s, while unions were generally able to obtain maintenance of membership clauses, a form of union security, through arbitration and negotiation. [...] Workers also won benefits, such as <b>vacation</b> <b>pay,</b> that had been available only to a few in the past while wage gaps between higher skilled and less skilled workers narrowed.|$|R

While the New York City Board of Education had not decided on a replacement, Anker was seen as the most likely person to fill the spot on a permanent basis if the board's choice was an [...] "insider".|$|R
25|$|Following the accident, the MMA {{temporarily}} ceased {{operations on}} its lines between Lac-Mégantic and Jackman, Maine, effectively severing rail transport on its lines between Maine and Quebec, though rail traffic continued outside the affected area.

The Act applies to most Danish employees, but not, for example, to civil servants. A number of the provisions of the Act may be waived under collective bargaining. The law states, among other things, that [...] "an employee shall be entitled to 2.08 days of paid vacation for each month of employment." ...|$|R
25|$|Metra {{also has}} been marred by {{allegations}} and investigations of corruption. In April 2010 Metra's executive director, Phil Pagano, faced investigation for taking an unauthorized $56,000 bonus and was later found to have improperly received $475,000 in <b>vacation</b> <b>pay.</b> The day that the agency's board was scheduled to discuss his fate, Pagano {{stepped in front of}} a moving Metra train in an apparent suicide. Around the time of Pagano's death, allegations also surfaced that a Metra employee demanded a $2,000 payoff from the studio that used Metra in the 2011 film Source Code. That employee was later relieved of his duties.|$|R
50|$|A {{voluntary}} employees' beneficiary association (VEBA) {{is a form}} {{of trust}} fund permitted under United States federal tax law, whose sole purpose must be to provide employee benefits. Among the types of benefits which a VEBA may provide are accident insurance benefits, childcare costs, employee continuing education, the cost of legal services, life insurance benefits, severance pay, supplemental unemployment benefits, sick leave pay, training benefits, and <b>vacation</b> <b>pay.</b> A VEBA cannot, however, provide commuter benefits, miscellaneous fringe benefits, or retiree income. The plan may pay benefits to employees, their dependents, or their designated beneficiaries, or to disabled, laid-off, or retired former employees.|$|R
50|$|Benefits can {{be divided}} into as company-paid and employee-paid. Some, such as holiday <b>pay,</b> <b>vacation</b> <b>pay,</b> etc., are usually paid for by the firm. Others, are often paid, at least in part, by employees. A notable example is medical insurance, which has risen in cost {{dramatically}} in recent decades and been shifted to employees by many American employers. Even when paid entirely by employees, these programs may still provide value to employees and be called benefits because their cost may be considerably lower than that of equivalent non-employer-sponsored programs, thanks to employers having negotiated discounts with providers.|$|R
