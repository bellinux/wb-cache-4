The term is also often used to refer to a solenoid valve, which is an integrated device containing an electromechanical solenoid which actuates either a pneumatic or hydraulic valve, or a solenoid switch, which is a specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>relay</b> that internally uses an electromechanical solenoid to operate an electrical switch; for example, an automobile starter solenoid, or a linear solenoid, which is an electromechanical solenoid.

50|$|A {{reed relay}} (sometimes {{also known as}} Herkon relay) is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>relay</b> that uses an {{electromagnet}} to control one or more reed switches. The contacts are of magnetic material and the electromagnet acts directly on them without requiring an armature to move them. Sealed in a long, narrow glass tube, the contacts are protected from corrosion, and are usually plated with silver, which has very low resistivity but is prone to corrosion when exposed, rather than corrosion-resistant but more resistive gold as used in the exposed contacts of high quality relays. The glass envelope may contain multiple reed switches or multiple reed switches can be inserted into a single bobbin and actuate simultaneously. Reed switches have been manufactured since the 1930s.|$|E
30|$|In {{cooperative}} relay networks, a relay {{is basically}} employed as two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaying</b> methods: amplify‐and‐forward (AF) and decode‐and‐forward (DF) relaying. In the former scheme, a relay simply amplifies the received {{signal from the}} source and forwards it to the corresponding destination irrespective of source‐to‐relay (SR) link condition [4]. In the latter scheme, a relay first decodes the received signal and re‐encodes it for forwarding regardless of the decoding result at the relay, namely, fixed DF relaying scheme [5] or determines whether to forward it or not depending on the channel condition of the SR link, namely, selective DF relaying scheme [6]. These two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaying</b> schemes form the foundation <b>of</b> various sophisticated <b>relaying</b> schemes.|$|R

50|$|A first relay {{was built}} on this {{location}} in 1869. It {{was at that time}} only a wooden shack containing a bread oven. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>relay</b> was frequent in the region. Between the two world wars, L'Étape became the end of road 54 (now road 175) and a forest protection outpost was installed there. In 1951, the road is completed to Saguenay and the Quebec Government decides to build a hostel, a restaurant and a gas station to provide services to motorists and promote sport fishing the area. The hostel was later demolished in 1973 but the restaurant and gas station remain in operation to this day. In 1967, the Notre-Dame-de-L'Assomption chapel open its registers only to be abandoned shortly after in 1989.|$|E
50|$|A {{spring brake}} relay valve {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the service brake relay valve, although it has the opposite effect. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>relay</b> valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|E

The literature on harmonics and relays covers mostly the theoretical studies.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we provide}} {{complete}} end-to-end delay analyses including the relay nodes for instant messages. Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) {{is used to}} provide congestion control for large messages in the Instant Messaging (IM) service. Large messages are broken into several chunks. These chunks may traverse through a maximum number of two relay nodes before reaching destination according to the IETF specification of the MSRP relay extensions. We discuss the current solutions of sending large instant messages and introduce a proposal to reduce message flows in the IM service. We consider virtual traffic parameter i. e., the relay nodes are stateless non-blocking for scalability purpose. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>relay</b> node is also assumed to have input rate at constant bit rate.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{demonstrate}} that by employing relaying and using the remaining battery lifetime information of Mobile Terminals (MT) in next generation cellular networks, the outage probability of the MT is reduced. We define outage probability as the probability that the connection between the MT and the Base Station (BS) is lost when the MT is asked to use a transmission power greater than some threshold. This threshold is determined based on the remaining battery lifetime of the MT. We assume a linear relationship between the remaining battery lifetime and the maximum allowed transmission power. We used a 2 -hop relaying mechanism to illustrate our concept, and simulated for both urban and sub-urban terrains. We will see that outage probability is significantly different for both the terrains, upon which we suggest the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>relay</b> suitable for relaying for each of the terrains.
