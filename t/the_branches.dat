5|$|Cacti show a {{wide variety}} of growth habits, which are {{difficult}} to divide into clear, simple categories. They can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody trunk topped by several to many branches. In the genus Pereskia, <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> are covered with leaves, so the species of this genus may not be recognized as cacti. In most other cacti, <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> are more typically cactus-like, bare of leaves and bark, and covered with spines, as in Pachycereus pringlei or the larger opuntias. Some cacti may become tree-sized but without branches, such as larger specimens of Echinocactus platyacanthus. Cacti may also be described as shrubby, with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down, such as in Stenocereus thurberi.|$|E
5|$|In this {{flat and}} marshy area, <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> and roots of {{mangrove}} trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus. These tangles help retain soil, {{a process which}} expands the island where the power of tidal race would normally have the opposite effect.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp and fish take refuge among <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> of Millepora alcicornis, {{seemingly}} immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. <b>The</b> <b>branches</b> of the postorbital and jugal that usually {{surround}} the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely.

Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Article III has one section, {{confirming}} {{the principle of}} separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government.

50|$|<b>The</b> calling of <b>branch</b> {{president}} {{is very similar}} to the calling of bishop, except that instead of presiding over a ward, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> president presides over a <b>branch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>branch</b> {{president is}} directly responsible for the operation of his <b>branch</b> and <b>the</b> well-being of its patrons. <b>The</b> <b>branch</b> president usually has two counselors to assist him in his duties.

50|$|Pruning {{focuses on}} {{removing}} dead or diseased branches with minimal {{damage done to}} <b>the</b> tree. <b>Branches</b> connect to <b>the</b> trunk and grow from <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> collar. While <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> itself may be dead, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> collar is still healthy and resistant to disease. It is from <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> collar that a new limb will generate and grow, so {{it is important not}} to damage it while pruning. Make clean cuts at <b>the</b> base of <b>branch</b> adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> collar.

5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the mistle thrush is {{important}} in propagating the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> of suitable trees.

5|$|Especially in warmer areas, {{the house}} sparrow may build its nests in the open, on <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> of trees, {{especially}} evergreens and hawthorns, {{or in the}} nests of large birds such as storks or magpies. In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to be lower, since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms. Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, which are then domed over.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, Sharp {{was again}} {{elected to the}} Kentucky House of Representatives.

5|$|In 2009 the RBS Group {{announced}} that it would divest all 311 RBS branches in England and Wales (until 1985, Williams and Glyn's) together with the seven NatWest branches in Scotland as a standalone business, to comply with European Commission state aid requirements. In August 2010, it was {{announced that}} <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> would be sold to Santander UK, along with the accounts of 1.8million personal customers and 244,000 SME customers. Santander withdrew from the sale in October 2012. On 27 September 2013, the RBS Group confirmed it had agreed to sell 308 RBS branches in England and Wales and 6 NatWest branches in Scotland to the Corsair consortium.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{the number of}} {{passengers}} using the branch stabilised at about 800 people each weekday. In 2009 the Chesham branch saw 427,000 journeys each year. The proposal to close the Aylesbury–Marylebone route was dropped, and instead the line was upgraded and equipped with fast British Rail Class 165 trains in the early 1990s. These reduced the travel time between Chalfont& Latimer and Marylebone to 33 minutes, increasing usage of the line as a commuter route. The Chesham branch was proposed as a terminus for the original Crossrail scheme, which would have seen Crossrail trains running from Paddington to serve the stations between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury and the Chesham branch, allowing London Transport to withdraw from Buckinghamshire and cut the Metropolitan line back to serve only <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> to Watford and Uxbridge. The bill proposing the scheme was defeated in Parliament and abandoned in 1995, and the revived scheme authorised by the Crossrail Act 2008 did not include <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> to Aylesbury and Chesham. By this time the little-used Central line branch from Epping to Ongar had closed, with the last services running on 30 September 1994, leaving Chesham—already the westernmost point of the London Underground network since 1961's withdrawal from Aylesbury—as the northernmost point on the London Underground.|$|E

50|$|Memory {{dependence}} prediction for {{loads and}} stores {{is analogous to}} branch prediction for conditional branch instructions. In <b>branch</b> prediction, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> predictor predicts which way <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> will resolve before it is known. The processor can then speculatively fetch and execute instructions {{down one of the}} paths of <b>the</b> <b>branch.</b> Later, when <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> instruction executes, it can be determined if <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> instruction was correctly predicted. If not, this is a branch misprediction, and a pipeline flush is necessary to throw away instructions that were speculatively fetched and executed.|$|R

5|$|Other fauna, such as hydrozoa, bryozoa {{and brittle}} stars, often dwell among <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> of gorgonian and coral colonies. The pygmy seahorse {{not only makes}} certain species of gorgonians its home, but closely resembles its host and is thus well camouflaged. Some organisms have an obligate {{relationship}} with their host species. The mollusc Simnialena marferula is only found on the sea whip Leptogorgia virgulata, is coloured like it and has sequestered its defensive chemicals, and the nudibranch Tritonia wellsi is another obligate symbiont, its feathery gills resembling the tentacles of the polyps.|$|E

In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E

Overall, the Home Army regional structure largely resembled Poland's interwar administration division, with an okręg being {{similar to a}} voivodeship (see Administrative division of Second Polish Republic).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 30/31 <b>Branch</b> {{library is}} located at the {{intersection}} of 31st Avenue and 30th Street, which is why it is called the 30/31 Library. <b>The</b> <b>branch</b> was built in 1957 as a combination library and fire station, which was closed when Rock Island's fire stations consolidated in the 1970s.
