5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a new entry in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live.

One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player.

5|$|The game's {{predecessor}} was Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, {{a tactical}} shooter announced in 2011. It had {{a focus on}} narrative, and the story campaign features many cut-scenes and scripted events. However, the game fell into a development hell shortly after its announcement. The game's outdated engine and frequent change of leadership hindered development progress, and game quality was not up to par. In addition, it was planned to be released on seventh-generation video-game consoles which were not capable of processing certain game mechanics. Seeing {{the arrival of a}} new generation of consoles, the team wanted to make use of this opportunity to create a more technologically advanced game.
