5|$|Originally, the {{standard}} complement of each submarine was six officers and thirty-six sailors, with facilities to carry an additional twelve personnel (usually trainees). This number was minimised by the RAN during design, which insisted that functions be automated where possible; the RAN also requiring that each sailor {{have his own}} rack and {{did not need to}} 'hot bunk'. It was originally intended <b>that</b> <b>multiple</b> ship's companies be established per submarine, and that these be rotated to maximise the submarines' time at sea without adversely affecting personnel, but difficulties in maintaining submariner numbers made this plan unworkable. Enlisted submariners are accommodated in six-bunk cabins.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOur {{research}} focuses {{specifically on}} the methodology {{to be applied to}} improve the relevance of the multiples-based valuation method regarding the identification of the most relevant <b>multiples</b> (i. e., <b>that</b> reduce the relative absolute valuation error within any industry-based peer group). In line with prior empirical studies, our results confirm <b>that</b> Enterprise Value <b>multiples</b> based on EBIT and EBITDA perform better, compared to Sales and Capital Employed, and <b>that</b> <b>multiples</b> based on forward-looking EBIT and EBITDA are more relevant compared to corresponding actual earnings. In the absence of forward-looking earnings, available at the date of valuation, our study shows <b>that</b> EBITDA <b>multiples</b> provide better estimates than EBIT multiples do. Beyond these general results, the approach implemented in our research can be easily reproduced by practitioners (e. g., financial analysts, M&A advisors, independent appraisers) to identify case-by-case the <b>multiples</b> <b>that</b> are the most relevant within any industry-based peer group...|$|R
5|$|By 2000, Gas Powered Games {{had begun}} {{to search for a}} {{publisher}} for the game. Taylor claims <b>that</b> <b>multiple</b> publishers were interested in the game, but he was convinced by Ed Fries to partner with the newly established Microsoft Game Studios. Although Microsoft's publishing wing was established in part to publish games for the newly announced Xbox console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due {{to the size of the}} game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at the time. Dungeon Siege was initially planned for release in the third quarter of 2001, before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time tuning and polishing the game and expanding the game's items and multiplayer features. Dungeon Siege was released for Microsoft Windows on April 5, 2002, and for MacOS on May 2, 2003 by Destineer.|$|E
5|$|Four {{specimens}} (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) {{are thought}} to represent second upper incisors (I2) of Ferugliotherium. 702A (height 1.5mm; width 1.1mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2mm; width 0.9mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that Ferugliotherium was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were deciduous precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely <b>that</b> <b>multiple</b> species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the dorsal side. The wear facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors {{because they have a}} less acute angle at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.|$|E
5|$|It {{is true that}} a {{house that}} is between two {{destroyed}} homes can be undamaged, {{but this is not}} the result of a tornado skipping, as some previously thought. After the 1974 Super Outbreak, Dr. Ted Fujita studied many films of tornadoes from that day. Included in his review was damage and tornado film footage of F4 and F5 tornadoes. Fujita concluded <b>that</b> <b>multiple</b> vortices, highly volatile tornadic satellites transiting within a parent tornado at high speeds, are responsible for making tornadoes appear to skip houses. The phenomenon of satellite tornadoes, where a smaller tornado orbits a larger companion tornado, can also lead to gaps in damage between the two tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|Mike Brown and {{his team}} favored the {{hypothesis}} that Sedna was lifted into its current orbit by a star from the Sun's birth cluster, arguing that Sedna's aphelion of about 1,000AU, which is relatively close compared to those of long-period comets, is not distant enough {{to be affected by}} passing stars at their current distances from the Sun. They propose that Sedna's orbit is best explained by the Sun having formed in an open cluster of several stars that gradually disassociated over time. That hypothesis has also been advanced by both Alessandro Morbidelli and Scott Jay Kenyon. Computer simulations by Julio A. Fernandez and Adrian Brunini suggest <b>that</b> <b>multiple</b> close passes by young stars in such a cluster would pull many objects into Sedna-like orbits. A study by Morbidelli and Levison suggested that the most likely explanation for Sedna's orbit was that it had been perturbed by a close (approximately 800AU) pass by another star in the first 100 million years or so of the Solar System's existence.|$|E
5|$|On September1, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission {{into the}} low found a closed circulation center and tropical storm-force winds. Upon finding the low-level circulation center, the NHC began monitoring {{the system as}} Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the 2009 season. Erika was slightly disorganized due to moderate wind shear, with the center partially devoid of convection. However, with warm sea surface temperatures, the storm was forecast to intensify to a strong tropical storm within a few days. A mid-level ridge to the north led to Erika maintaining a general westward track {{for most of its}} existence. Several hours after being classified, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1004mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg). However, the peak intensity was operationally placed at 60mph (95km/h) based on readings from reconnaissance missions. In post-storm analysis of these readings, it was determined that the NHC had overestimated the wind speeds in an area of unusually heavy rains. By the morning of September2, Erika became significantly disorganized, and Hurricane Hunters reported the possibility <b>that</b> <b>multiple</b> circulation centers existed within the broader storm system.|$|E
5|$|The US Open 2014 saw the Big Four's {{collective}} grip on {{the major}} titles slip still further, however, as Kei Nishikori and Marin Čilić beat Djokovic and Federer in the semi-finals respectively to contest the first Slam final featuring none of the Big Four since the 2005 Australian Open, {{and the first time}} since 2003 <b>that</b> <b>multiple</b> first-time Grand Slam tournament winners have been crowned in a single season. Following the tournament, Murray dropped to 11th in the rankings, his first time outside the top 10 since 2008. The tournament as a whole further signalled the decline of the Big Four's dominance. Towards the end of the year, Andy Murray managed to return to form, winning three titles in Shenzhen, Vienna and Valencia, allowing him to return to the top ten in the rankings and qualify for the Tour Finals, but he bowed out at the group stages following a humiliating defeat by Federer, in which he won just a single game. Indeed, throughout the year Murray failed to register a single victory against another member of the Big Four in nine meetings.|$|E

5|$|Most colonies are monogyne, {{meaning that}} a colony {{only has a}} single queen, but based on observations, some nests contain {{more than a single}} queen. Some nests are known to contain two queens, with some even having as many as four in a single colony, making them polygynous; a high {{proportion}} of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another. Some colonies are oligogynous, which means <b>that</b> <b>multiple</b> queens are present in a colony, but they are tolerated by all workers birthed from different queens and treated equally. Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born, but recognition based on kin from queens and workers is known, hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed; queens will only take care of their own brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens. The queens, on the other hand, will only cooperate with each other during nest founding, but will be antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony. Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows, and eventually separate within the nest, resulting in the queen laying more eggs. Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs, or if a queen ant is adopted by a colony, setting up aggressive relationships. Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} scenario and {{concept of}} Final Fantasy Type-0, originally a mobile title named Final Fantasy Agito XIII, was conceived by Hajime Tabata. He wished for a group-driven story {{as he felt}} that a single playable character {{would not be able}} to properly convey the scope and themes of the story. Because Tabata wanted to show a history of survival told from the point of view of young people caught in a war, it was decided to set the story during a war between four nations. Much of the original story, which mainly revolved about defying the gods, was drawn from popular anime and manga and did not survive. After the platform change to PlayStation Portable, Tabata adopted a story-telling style similar to a documentary film: a direct inspiration for this was Centuries of Picture, a documentary series broadcast on NHK. Alongside <b>that,</b> <b>multiple</b> war films were used as inspiration. Type-0s script was written by Hiroki Chiba and Sarah Okabe. During the rough draft stage, elements such as extra plot points involving Khalia Chival, a boss fight with Arecia, and a main plot thread involving Joker and Tiz were planned. Most of these elements were cut from the final product, meaning elements such as Joker and Tiz's role needed to be included in written texts found in-game so they were not left hanging. The deaths of Class Zero were planned from an early stage, and to emphasize the state of the world, a large number of the supporting cast were killed off near the end. Tabata wanted to create a story depicting different fates for Type-0s characters, and this decision was supported by both staff members and fans of the original. He also implemented the ability for players to decide the course of the story, which was to have been included in the Type-0 when it was still known as Agito XIII. Final Fantasy Agito was given a more upbeat atmosphere when compared to Type-0, although dark and more dramatic moments were still present. The story grew out of what Tabata originally envisioned for Type-0.|$|E
