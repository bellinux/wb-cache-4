40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{centered}} around an apparent tension that research on implicit bias raises between virtue and social knowledge. Research suggests that simply {{knowing what the}} prevalent stereotypes are leads individuals to act in prejudiced ways—biasing decisions about <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> trust and <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> ignore, <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> promote and <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> imprison—even if they reflectively reject those stereotypes. Because efforts to combat discrimination obviously depend on knowledge of stereotypes, a question arises {{about what to do}} next. This chapter argues that the obstacle to virtue is not knowledge of stereotypes as such, but the “accessibility” of such knowledge to the agent who has it. “Accessibility” refers to how easily knowledge comes to mind. Social agents can acquire the requisite knowledge of stereotypes while resisting their pernicious influence, so long as that knowledge remains, in relevant contexts, relatively inaccessibl...|$|R

40|$|Originally {{conceptualized}} by Hambrick and Mason (1984), {{the upper}} echelons perspective (UEP) {{has become a}} dominant theme {{in the study of}} strategic decision making across a great number of disciplines. Over the past two decades, the work of these authors has been cited in over 500 refereed journal publications, lending credence to the applicability of the UEP when studying top management teams (TMTs) (Carpenter, 2005; Carpenter, Geletkanycz, 2 ̆ 6 Sanders, 2004). To compensate for shortcomings in accessibility and instrumentation, the UEP uses demographic variables as proxies for the underlying psychological constructs that shape TMTs 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of business situations in formulating and implementing appropriate strategic alternatives (Cannella 2 ̆ 6 Holcomb, 2005 a; Carpenter et al., 2004). ^ In the context of Major League Baseball (MLB), the selection and development of player resources are critical to organizational performance (Olson 2 ̆ 6 Schwab, 2000). Perhaps more than any other professional sport, the selection of MLB player talent is amenable to influence by the decision making of clubs 2 ̆ 7 front office executives. Policies and decisions regarding <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> scout, <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> draft, <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> promote, <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> demote, <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> acquire, <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> trade away, <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> play in which positions, and <b>whom</b> <b>to</b> hit in which slot in the batting line-up are all elements that are managed to some degree by the club 2 ̆ 7 s TMT (Gamson 2 ̆ 6 Scotch, 1964). Consistent with the UEP, it was believed that the cognitions, values and perceptions of MLB TMT members, along with their undeniable influence on the process of strategic choice, would be associated with significant player selection outcomes. ^ Drawing upon theory and literature related to the UEP, the researcher employed fixed-effects regression models to explore the effects of TMT composition on the quality of player selection in MLB between 1990 and 2002. Using a linear run estimation model of offensive performance called Extrapolated Runs Basic (Furtado, 1999) as the basis for measuring player selection quality, the findings from this study suggested that basic TMT characteristics had a limited capacity to affect the overall quality of player selection decisions in MLB between 1990 and 2002. Specifically, the overall regression results suggested that these variables cumulatively accounted for between 2. 5...|$|R
