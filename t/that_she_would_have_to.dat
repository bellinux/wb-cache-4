5|$|Barkley gets {{a police}} permit to raid the Buyers Club, but {{can do nothing}} but give Woodroof a fine. In 1987, the FDA changes its {{regulations}} such that any unapproved drug is also illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Dr. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses to comply and insists <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be fired.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
60|$|Miss Mackenzie did {{not dare}} to say <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{preferred}} to be wicked, but <b>that</b> is what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said if <b>she</b> had dared.|$|R

5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother told}} Copeland <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give up ballet, but Bradley wanted Copeland to {{continue}} and offered to host her. DelaCerna agreed to this, and Copeland moved in with Bradley and her family. Eventually, Copeland and DelaCerna signed a management contract and a life-story contract with Bradley. Copeland spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends {{at home with her}} mother, a two-hour bus ride away. Copeland would spend most of her next three years with the Bradleys. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a national ballet contest and won her first solo role. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she saw Paloma Herrera, a principal ballerina with ABT, perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize her as much as she did Mariah Carey. The media first noticed her when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in The Nutcracker at the San Pedro High School after only eight months of study. A larger role as Kitri in Don Quixote at the San Pedro Dance Center and a featured role in The Chocolate Nutcracker, an African American version of the tale, narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed. The latter was presented at UCLA's Royce Hall. Copeland's role was modified especially for her, and included ethnic dances.|$|E
25|$|As news of Tyresö's {{financial}} difficulties spread, Marta had been linked with a transfer to Avaldsnes IL. But the Norwegian Toppserien club's chairman warned <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take a substantial pay cut. Paris Saint-Germain Féminines were also {{reported to have}} approached Marta and Tyresö teammate Caroline Seger.|$|E

60|$|She laughed suddenly, laughed {{loudly and}} long. Manlike, {{he did not}} notice the forced ring of that merriment. He had blundered, of course, but this he did not know. In the {{simplicity}} of his heart he thought <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been ready to understand, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> explained and then agreed with him as to the best means of throwing the nefarious proposal back into the King's teeth.|$|R

25|$|On 18 June 1825, Larkins, {{which had}} sailed from Calcutta for England, {{had to return}} as she was leaky. The {{expectation}} was <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go into dock. After Larkins was {{pulled out of the}} dock and had taken on part of her cargo, it was discovered that she was still taking on water. She therefore was pulled back into the dock to be coppered and sheathed.|$|E
25|$|Cruz {{has stated}} {{that when he was}} a child, his mother told him <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make an affirmative act to claim Canadian {{citizenship}} for him, so his family assumed that he did not hold Canadian citizenship. In August 2013, after the Dallas Morning News pointed out that Cruz had dual Canadian-American citizenship, he applied to formally renounce his Canadian citizenship and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014.|$|E
25|$|After {{injuring}} {{herself in}} the quarterfinal match against Dementieva, Venus Williams defaulted to Serena in the semifinals. Although Venus told the tournament official hours beforehand <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> default, the official word was not given until 10 minutes before the scheduled start (in the hopes that Venus would change her mind), angering fans {{who had come to}} see the match. Consequently, during the final against Kim Clijsters two days later, the spectators jeered Serena from when she first took the court for warm-up through the final trophy presentation including cheering double faults and errors with no intervention from the tournament officials. Despite these attacks, Serena {{went on to win the}} tournament.|$|E

25|$|Playing {{her first}} clay tennis match {{in three years}} at the Andalucia Tennis Experience as the third seed, Clijsters {{advanced}} to the second round after beating Alexandra Dulgheru in three sets. However, in the second round, Clijsters lost to the world no. 258 Beatriz García Vidagany. Clijsters played in Belgium's Fed Cup tie against Estonia, easily defeating Maret Ani, 6–4, 6–2, in her opening singles match. However, {{it was discovered that}} she had torn a muscle in her left foot, causing her to pull out of her next match against Kaia Kanepi. Doctors ruled her out for six weeks, but Clijsters hoped to make an early recovery. She later announced in a press conference <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> withdraw {{from the rest of the}} clay-court season, including the French Open.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E
500|$|To make a living, Eunice Waymon {{changed her}} name to [...] "Nina Simone". The change related to her need to {{disguise}} herself from family members, having chosen to play [...] "the devil's music" [...] or [...] "cocktail piano" [...] at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> sing to her own accompaniment, and this effectively launched {{her career as a}} jazz vocalist.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day, Hendrix {{received a}} phone call from one of his girlfriends, Devon Wilson, who had become jealous after hearing rumors that he was dating another woman, Kirsten Nefer. Nefer recalled: [...] "I heard Jimi talk to Devon... she was mad... she went into fits... Jimi said 'Devon, get off my back'". Hendrix was scheduled to perform in Rotterdam on September 13, but the show, along with three others, was cancelled due to Cox's incapacitation. During the evening of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. After informing him <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go back to work that evening, he convinced her to phone her boss, actor George Lazenby, and ask for the night off. Lazenby became angry and shouted over the phone to Nefer: [...] "You're nothing but a fucking groupie", which Hendrix overheard. The exchange upset him, and he told Nefer: [...] "Don't you ever go out to that guy again". Nefer explained to him that she had spent six months working on a film with Lazenby and that she did not want to quit her job; Hendrix eventually agreed. Nefer spent the night with him and left in the morning.|$|E
500|$|Until 1999, she {{continued}} {{working as a}} [...] "jobbing actress", making appearances in [...] and Sale of the Century, and Tales of the South Seas. Eager {{to move away from}} soap opera acting, Joseph moved to the United States to study acting with the Atlantic Theater Company in New York City. She then moved to Los Angeles, where she spent 18 months living off her savings trying to get auditions. In those 18 months, her only jobs were a single commercial and a job interviewing LA-based film actors for Australian television. In 2001, her lawyer informed her <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> travel to Sydney, Australia to be interviewed for her green card. On the day she was due to fly back to Australia, her agent informed her of an audition for the British television series Cold Feet, whose producer was looking for an Australian actress to become a new main cast member. Two weeks later she had moved to Manchester, England and was doing script read-throughs {{with the rest of the}} cast. Her character, Jo Ellison, appeared in all episodes of the fourth and fifth series. Two days after filming the final episode in 2002, Joseph left Britain and returned to Australia.|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E

500|$|After she {{accepted}} the role, Richard {{was told by}} Julia Smith <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change her appearance, {{to make it more}} in keeping with Pauline's unglamorous lifestyle. This included having her hair cut. Richard has commented, [...] "I was very proud of my long hair, which had taken me years to grow. I hadn't had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly, I agreed... I cried my eyes out {{for the rest of the}} day after that traumatic hair cut." [...] From September 1984, Richard was involved in pre-production of the series, covering every angle, from hair, costume design and make-up to organising the set interior of her character's screen house. Richard has said that Pauline had been given extensive biographical detail, including minute specifics, such as her fictional time of her birth: [...] "It was vital that we should get to know our own characters intimately and so the cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our 'relations'... it was essential to develop the rapport that families, who'd been together for years, would naturally have." [...] Richard's casting was considered to be [...] "a giant leap of faith" [...] by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately [...] "landed on its feet", because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in EastEnders history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.|$|E
2500|$|Rainier {{then had}} Amboyna escort a ship with a cargo of spices to China. Dobbie's mission was also to procure {{supplies}} for the British squadron in the Moluccas.

While Dobbie went up to Whampoa, he left Amboyna in the Typa (inner harbour) {{under the supervision of}} Lieutenant Arthur Farquhar, a friend who had traveled on her as a supernumerary. While she was being turned on her side, a gang of [...] "ladrones" [...] (thieves) attempted to capture and loot her; fortunately Farquhar was able to drive them off.|$|E
2500|$|Etruria lasted {{less than}} a decade. By the Treaty of Fontainebleau (27 October 1807), Etruria was to be annexed by France.

She and her court left on 10 December. On 30 May 1808, Etruria was formally annexed to France. An [...] "Extraordinary Giunta" [...] was placed in charge under General Jacques François Menou. Tuscany was divided into the départements of Arno, Méditerranée and Ombrone.
