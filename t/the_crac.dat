25|$|After {{years of}} {{corporate}} and financial crisis due to <b>the</b> <b>Crac</b> Parmalat, Parma A.C. was renamed to Parma F.C. in June 2004. Prandelli's departure as manager preceded the 2004–05 season, {{as did the}} decision to revert to the club's traditional colours: white shirts again being adorned by black crosses, replacing the yellow and blue hoops associated with Parmalat's ownership. The club had to come out from previous sugar daddy model and saw Matteo Ferrari and Matteo Brighi were sold to Roma. Although Parma reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, they plummeted to their lowest finish since promotion fifteen years earlier, appointing and relieving Silvio Baldini of his duties {{in the space of}} a few months and hiring Pietro Carmignani. All of this despite another 23-league goal haul from Gilardino. Parma's league position meant they had to contest a two-legged play-off against Bologna in order to stay in the top tier of Italian football. They won the play-off 2-1 on aggregate, having lost the first leg at home by a solitary goal. With the club still not having found a new owner after it was put up for sale at the beginning of January 2005, Enrico Bondi was made president and charged with securing a sale, continuing to sell Parma's most valuable assets, such as Alberto Gilardino, who left for A.C. Milan at the cost of €25M in the summer of 2005, having scored 50 league goals in 95 matches, and French goalkeeper Sébastien Frey who departed for Fiorentina. The Emilian outfit ended the following season with a finish in tenth place, but the Calciopoli scandal saw their official position changed to seventh and assured them a return to the UEFA Cup. Players such as Daniele Bonera continued to be sold on for money and another new coach, Stefano Pioli, was appointed as the 2006–07 season approached.|$|E

5000|$|The plasma {{membrane}} protein [...] "Orai" [...] (ORAI1 and ORAI2 in humans) forms the pore of <b>the</b> <b>CRAC</b> channel. The protein ORAI1 is a structural component of <b>the</b> <b>CRAC</b> calcium channel. ORAI1 {{interacts with the}} STIM1 protein. STIM1 is a transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). STIM1 can sense the concentration of Ca2+ inside the ER. When the concentration of Ca2+ inside the ER becomes low, STIM1 proteins aggregate and interact with ORAI1 located in the cell surface membrane. [...] When the concentration of Ca2+ inside the ER approaches an upper set point, another protein, SARAF (TMEM66) associates with STIM1 to inactivate the store-operated calcium channel (SOCE).|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} better manage the cooling {{infrastructure}} in a data center with multiple computer room air conditioning (<b>CRAC)</b> units, <b>the</b> relationship between <b>CRAC</b> settings and temperature at various locations in the data center needs to be accurately and reliably determined.

In this paper, we describe a machine learning based technique to model rack inlet temperature sensors in a data center {{as a function of}} CRAC settings. These models can then be used to automatically estimate thermal correlation indices (TCI) at any particular CRAC settings. We have implemented a prototype of our methodology in a real data center with eight CRACs and several hundred sensors. The temperature sensor models developed have high accuracy (mean RMSE error is 0. 2 ˚C).

50|$|Calcium release-activated {{channels}} (CRAC) are specialized {{plasma membrane}} Ca2+ ion channels. When calcium ions (Ca2+) are depleted from the endoplasmic reticulum (a major store of Ca2+) of mammalian cells, <b>the</b> <b>CRAC</b> channel is activated to slowly replenish {{the level of}} calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum. The Ca2+ Release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) Channel (CRAC-C) Family (TC# 1.A.52) {{is a member of}} the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) Superfamily. These proteins typically have between 4 and 6 transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). The 4 TMS CRAC channels arose by loss of 2TMSs from 6TMS CDF carriers, an example of 'reverse' evolution'.|$|E
50|$|Antigen {{stimulation}} of immune cells triggers Ca2+ entry through tetrameric Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, promoting the immune response to pathogens by activating the transcription factor NFAT. Cells from patients with {{one form of}} hereditary Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) syndrome are defective in store-operated Ca2+ entry and CRAC channel function. The genetic defect in these patients {{appears to be in}} ORAI1 (TM protein 142A; TMEM142a), which contains four putative transmembrane segments. SCID patients are homozygous for a single missense mutation in ORAI1, and expression of wild-type ORAI1 in SCID T cells restores store-operated Ca2+ influx and <b>the</b> <b>CRAC</b> current (ICRAC).|$|E

40|$|To {{quantify}} the fracture loads of railway prestressed concrete sleepers the dynamic bending tests were carried out. In {{the course of}} tests the initial (first) crack, the crack opening and crash event of presstressed monobloc sleepers were registered by a Method of Acoustic Emission (MАE). It is shown that MAE allows to fix the beginning of cracking and evolution of cracks earlier, than other instrumental and visual inspection. During visual inspections (no longer than 5 min between the dynamic loading steps) for crack shores opening measurement the cracks are “healing”. This effect it is clearly seen by the Acoustic Emission signals movement on the next loading step. <b>The</b> <b>cracs</b> "curing" time is reduced from one load step to another.

50|$|STIM1 is a Ca2+-sensor protein {{specialized}} for electrical signaling in the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER). It interacts with and mediates store-dependent regulation of both Orai1 and TRPC1 channels. TRPC1+STIM1-dependent SOC requires functional Orai1. STIM1 is the mechanistic 'missing link' between the ER and the plasma membrane. STIM proteins sense {{the depletion of}} luminal Ca2+ from the ER and trigger activation of CRAC channels in the surface membrane after Ca2+ store depletion. The process involves oligomerization, then translocation to junctions adjacent to the plasma membrane, by which <b>the</b> <b>CRAC</b> channels become organized into clusters and then open to bring about SOC entry.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{mechanism}} of extracellular Ca2+ entry in lymphocytes involves CRAC channels. STIM1 {{is a crucial}} component of <b>the</b> <b>CRAC</b> influx mechanism in lymphocytes, acting as a sensor of low Ca2+ concentration in the ER and an activator of the Ca2+ selective channel ORAI1 in the plasma membrane. Yarkoni and Cambier (2011) reported that STIM1 expression differs in murine T and B lymphocytes; mature T cells express about 4 times more STIM1 than mature B cells. Through the physiologic range of expression, STIM1 levels determine the magnitude of Ca2+ influx responses that follow BCR-induced intracellular store depletion.|$|E

50|$|PM-ER contact {{sites have}} a well known {{role in the}} control of calcium dynamics. The major {{intracellular}} pool of calcium is the ER and its release may be triggered by different stimuli. In excitable cells the coupling between PM depolarization and the release from the intracellular pools is essential to generate the Ca2+ signalling. In muscle cells, at the triad, junctophilin, an integral ER membrane protein, is involved in ER-PM contact stabilization by interacting with PIPs in the PM. In these contact sites, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) activate closely apposed ryanodine receptors expressed on the ER to trigger calcium release during excitation-contraction coupling.However, calcium levels need to be tightly controlled in all cell types. Non-excitable cells regulate calcium influx through PM calcium channels by sensing luminal ER calcium levels (the Calcium Release Activated Channels). ORAI1 is a molecular component of <b>the</b> <b>CRAC,</b> and it interacts with STIM1 an ER protein. STIM1 can rapidly translocate to a PM-ER contact site after depletion of the ER stores.|$|E
50|$|Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 {{regulate}} {{membrane potential}} and calcium signaling of T cells. Calcium entry through <b>the</b> <b>CRAC</b> channel is promoted by potassium efflux through the Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 potassium channels. Blockade of Kv1.3 channels in effector-memory T cells by ShK-186 suppresses calcium signaling, cytokine production (interferon-gamma, interleukin 2) and cell proliferation. In vivo, ShK-186 paralyzes effector-memory T cells at {{the sites of}} inflammation and prevent their reactivation in inflamed tissues. In contrast, ShK-186 {{does not affect the}} homing to and motility within lymph nodes of naive and central memory T cells, most likely because these cells express the KCa3.1 channel and are therefore protected from the effect of Kv1.3 blockade. In proof-of-concept studies, ShK and its analogs have prevented and treated disease in rat models of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and delayed type hypersensitivity. ShK-186, due to its durable pharmacological action, is effective in ameliorating disease in rat models of delayed type hypersensitivity, multiple sclerosis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) and rheumatoid arthritis (pristane induced arthritis) when administered once every 2-5 days. ShK-186 has completed non-clinical safety studies. ShK-186 is the subject of an open Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the USA, and has completed human phase 1A and 1B trials in healthy volunteers.|$|E

40|$|CaT 1, {{the calcium}} {{transport}} protein 1 encoded by TRPV 6, {{is able to}} generate a Ca 2 + conductance similar but not identical to <b>the</b> classical <b>CRAC</b> current in mucosal-type mast cells. Here we show that CaT 1 -derived Ca 2 + entry into HEK 293 cells is effectively inhibited either by expression of various dominant negative N-terminal fragments of CaT 1 (N 334 -CaT 1, N 198 -CaT 1 and N 154 -CaT 1) or by antisense suppression. By contrast, <b>the</b> endogenous <b>CRAC</b> current of <b>the</b> mast cells was unaffected by CaT 1 antisense and siRNA knockdown but markedly suppressed by two (N 334 -CaT 1, N 198 -CaT 1) of the dominant negative N-CaT 1 fragments. Inhibition of CRAC current was not an unspecific, toxic effect, as inward rectifier K+ and MagNuM currents of the mast cells were not significantly affected by these N-CaT 1 fragments. The shortest N 154 -CaT 1 fragment inhibited CaT 1 -derived currents in mast cells, but failed to inhibit <b>CRAC</b> currents. Thus, <b>the</b> structural requirements of rCaT N-terminal fragments for inhibition of rCaT 1 and CRAC channels are different. These results together {{with the lack of}} CaT 1 antisense and siRNA effects on currents render it unlikely that CaT 1 is a component of native CRAC channels in mast cells. The data further demonstrate a novel strategy for CRAC current inhibition by an N-terminal structure of CaT 1...|$|R
40|$|There was {{suggested}} a phenomenological modified quadratic {{condition of the}} beginning of plasticity for plastic and quasifragile orthotropic materials. Limiting surface {{in the shape of a}} paraboloid with an axis bend over hydrostatic axis corresponds to the condition. The equations of theory of current with the isotropic and anisotropic hardenings, associated with the suggested yield condition, modified into the version of determining equations of strain theory of plasticity are received. These defining equations formed the basis of highlyprecise non-classic continual (along thickness) theory of non-linear deformation of thick sandwich plates and sloping shells. In the approximations along the cross coordinate the specificity of flexural and non-flexural deformations is taken into account. The necessity of introducing the approximations of higher order, as well as accounting for the cross compression while decreasing of the relatively cross normal and shear layer rigidness is shown. The specifications, obtained in comparison with the known physically nonlinear specified model of the bending of plates with orthotropic layers are distinguished. An effective procedure of linearization of the solving equations and getting the solutions in frames of the discrete-continual scheme of the finite-element method is suggested.

40|$|Abstract. Cosmogenic nuclides are {{produced}} by cosmic rays in the atmosphere and used in many research applications, such as paleoclimatology, solar activity reconstructions, dating methods, etc. For these purposes, a precise computational model is needed to account for complicated production and transport of the isotopes in the Earths atmosphere.
