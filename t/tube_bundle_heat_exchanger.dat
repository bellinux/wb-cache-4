30|$|The {{occurrence}} of scale-fragments (flakes) of variable dimensions constitutes a particular development of scaling in geothermal installations (Wolfgramm et al. 2011; Bauer et al. 2014). Typically thin (mm-range) scale deposits form in wells and transport pipes and are later mobilized (flaked off) {{in the course}} of thermal water flow. The growth and subsequent mobilization of such scale-fragments can cause specific and often serious problems, i.e., material damages and a rapid deterioration in the efficiency of hydrogeothermal heat extraction. Over short time intervals (e.g., weeks to few months in this study), critical accumulation, cementation, and clogging of filters and <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> can occur. This leads to significantly reduced fluid flows and energy transfers. As a consequence, necessary maintenance intervals are shortened and impaired technical components (e.g., plate or <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers)</b> have to be replaced unscheduled. In worst cases, the commercial viability of the geothermal infrastructure becomes a subject of debate.|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} approach which utilizes an isotropic porous medium {{model has been}} widely adopted for modeling the flow through a compact heat exchanger. With respect to situations where the compact heat exchangers are partially installed inside a channel, such as the application of recuperators in an intercooled recuperative engine, {{the use of an}} isotropic porous medium model needs to be carefully assessed because the flow passing through the heat exchanger is very complicated. For this purpose, in this study the isotropic porous medium model is assessed together with specific pressure–velocity relationships for flow field modeling inside a rectangular channel with a built-in double-U-shaped <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> Firstly, experiments were conducted using models to investigate the relationship between the pressure drop and the inlet velocity for a specific heat exchanger with different installation angles inside a rectangular channel.

Finally, a three-dimensional (3 -D) direct computation was made using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method for the comparison of detailed flow fields.

40|$|As an {{implication}} from increasing {{mobility of}} people and goods over lands, across oceans and air, transportation demand {{is expected to rise}} continuously for the next 30 years. Until today, internal combustion powertrains still dominate current vehicle propulsion systems. Fuel shortages and CO 2 emission problems have renewed concerns for higher efficiency of fuel use and eventually alternative engine propulsion methods to meet the increasing transportation needs. To improve fuel efficiency in internal combustion powertrains and hybrid vehicles, automotive thermal management has become important subject of research for the past years. One of the research goals in automotive thermal management is the storage of waste heat recovered for cabin heating, air-conditioning and improving engine warm-up during cold start. In conjunction with the project "Next Generation Car" at Institute of Technical Thermodynamics of German Aerospace Center (DLR), an automotive heating and cooling system utilizing metal hydrides and hydrogen is suggested. Waste heat recovered is stored in the form of chemical compound and can be used on-board for heating and cooling demands in summer and winter. The fundamental principle of this concept is the enthalpy change of a reversible sorption reaction between metal hydrides and hydrogen. The system consists of two connected reactors, which contain two different types of metal hydrides. The absorption of hydrogen into metal hydrides is an exothermic reaction, which produces heat output. On the other hand, desorption of hydrogen from metal hydrides is an endothermic reaction that produces cold output. In the framework of this research, a test bench is planned and constructed. To stimulate cold and heat output in summer and winter conditions using waste heat from coolant loop, - 20 °C to 130 °C is defined as the temperature range in this work. Among the choices of metal hydrides present, C 5 and LaNi 4. 85 Al 0. 15 are chosen for both heating and cooling modes. <b>Tube</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is chosen as the reaction beds due to its large heat transfer area and performance...|$|E

40|$|Thermochemical {{energy storage}} {{is based on}} the {{application}} of reversible chemical reactions for storage of thermal energy. Gas-solid reactions are well suited due to easily separable products and high reaction enthalpies resulting in high storage densities. In addition, heat transformation processes can be realized with this energy storage technology. The reaction temperature can be adjusted by variation of the partial pressure of the gaseous component resulting in discharging temperatures being higher than charging temperatures of the storage. Therefore this technology is interesting especially for the utilization of process waste heat. To realize technical application simulation tools for development of reactor concepts have to be evolved and validated by experimental results. Since various gas-solid reactions are known, the reaction system can in principle be adapted to the respective industrial process. However, reaction kinetics as well as cycling stability of the system can hinder technical application. In the range of 80 to 200 °C, which is relevant for process waste heat, full conversion and full reversibility with reasonable kinetics has been demonstrated [1] for the reaction: CaCl 2 ∙ 2 H 2 O (s) ⇌ CaCl 2 (s) + 2 H 2 O (g) The endothermic dehydration of calcium chloride dihydrate is used for charging the thermal storage leading to separation of the products water vapour and calcium chloride. During discharge of the storage heat is released by recombining these products. Both reactions (hydration and dehydration) take place with intermediate products. The reaction system CaCl 2 /H 2 O has been tested in a reaction bed in laboratory scale using a closed system with indirect heat transfer (Fig. 1). A <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> has been used as reactor. The reaction bed was located inside the tubes (Fig. 2). The temperature in the reaction bed was measured at different positions. A 2 D reaction model of a reaction tube was set up and solved by the Finite Element Method in COMSOL Multiphysics® (Fig. 3). Thermodynamic equilibrium and reaction kinetics of products, educts and all intermediate steps were measured by means of simultaneous thermal analysis and implemented in the model. Material properties such as thermal conductivity and permeability of the bed were determined experimentally and included in the mass and heat balances. The presentation outlined the results of the simulation and their validation with the experiments. Special attention was given to possible heat and mass transfer limitations depending on the reactor geometry. For dehydration in a reaction bed with small particles mass transport limitations dominate whereas hydration seems to be limited by heat transfer processes. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis supports {{the design of a}} horizontal tube bundle condenser for passive heat removal system in nuclear reactors. From nuclear power plant containment, condensation of steam from a steam/noncondensable gas occurs on the primary side and boiling occurs on the secondary side; thus, heat exchanger modeling is a challenge. ^ For the purpose of this experimental study, a six-tube bundle is used, where the outer diameter, inner diameter, and length of each stainless steel tube measures 38. 10 mm (1. 5 inches), 31. 75 mm (1. 25 inches) and 3. 96 m (156 inches), respectively. The pitch to diameter ratio was determined based on information gathered from literature surveys, and the dimensions were determined from calculations and experimental data. The objective of the calculations, correlations, and experimental data was to obtain complete condensation within the tube bundle. ^ Experimental conditions for the tests in this thesis work were determined from Design Basis Accident (DBA). The applications are for an actual Passive Containment Cooling Systems (PCCS) condenser under postulated accident conditions in future light water reactors. ^ In this research, steady state and transient experiments were performed to investigate the effect of noncondensable gas on steam condensation inside and boiling outside a <b>tube</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> The condenser tube inlet steam mass flow rate varied from 18. 0 to 48. 0 g/s, the inlet pressure varied from 100 kPa to 400 kPa, and the inlet noncondensable gas mass fraction varied from 1 % to 10 %. The effect of the noncondensable gas was examined by comparing the tube centerline temperatures for various inlet and system conditions. As a result, it was determined that the noncondensable gas accumulated near the condensate film causing a decrease of mass and energy transfer. ^ In addition, the effect of the inlet steam flow rate gas was investigated by comparing the tube centerline temperatures, the conclusion being that, as the inlet steam mass flow rate increased, the length required for complete condensation also increased. Comparison of tube centerline temperature profiles was also used to examine the effect of inlet pressure on the heat transfer performance. From this assessment, it was determined that as the inlet pressure increased, the length required for complete condensation decreased. ^ The investigation of tube bundle effects was conducted by comparing the condensate flow rates. The experimental results showed that the upper tubes in the bundle had better heat transfer performance than the lower tubes. ^ In regard to modeling of the heat exchanger in this study, for the primary side, an empirical correlation was developed herein to provide Nusselt numbers for condensation heat transfer in horizontal tubes with noncondensable gases. Nusselt numbers were correlated as: Nu = 106. 31 ·Re m 0. 147 ·W a- 0. 843. The empirical model for condensation heat transfer coefficients and the secondary-side model were integrated within a Matlab program to provide an analysis tool for horizontal tube bundle condenser heat exchangers. Also on the secondary side, two phase heat transfer coefficients were modeled considering both convective boiling and nucleate boiling as: hTP = 10. 03 ·exp(- 2. 28 ·α) · hCV + 0. 076 ·exp[3. 73 × 10 - 6 ·(Re f- 1. 6 × 105) ]·hNB. ...|$|E

Four new cycles were studied and two cycles were analyzed in detail based on the second law of thermodynamics. The first cycle uses a triple combined cycle, which consists of a topping cycle (Brayton/gas), an intermediate cycle (Rankine/steam), and a bottoming cycle (Rankine/ammonia). This cycle can produce high efficiency and reduces the irreversibility of the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSC) of conventional combined power cycles. The effect of important system parameters on the irreversibility distribution of all components in the cycle under reasonable practical constraints was evaluated. The second cycle is a combined cycle, which consists of a topping cycle (Brayton/gas) and a bottoming cycle (Rankine/ammonia) with integrated compressor inlet air cooling. This innovative cycle can produce high power and efficiency.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{considers}} steady laminar two-dimensional incompressible flow over both in-line and staggered flat <b>tube</b> <b>bundles</b> used in <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> applications. The effects of various independent parameters, such as Reynolds number (Re), Prandtl number (Pr), length ratio (L/Da), and height ratio (H/Da), on the pressure drop and heat transfer were studied. A finite volume based FORTRAN code {{was developed to}} solve the governing equations. The scalar and velocity variables were stored at staggered grid locations. Scalar variables (pressure and temperature) and all thermophysical properties were stored at the main grid location and velocities were stored at the control volume faces. The solution to a one-dimensional convection diffusion equation was represented by the power law. The locations of grid points were generated by the algebraic grid generation technique. The curvilinear velocity and pressure fields were linked by the Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations (SIMPLE) algorithm. The line-by-line method, which {{is a combination of}} the Tri-Diagonal Matrix Algorithm (TDMA) and the Gauss-Seidel procedure, was used to solve the resulting set of discretization equations. The result of the study established that the flow is observed to attain a periodically fully developed profile downstream of the fourth module. The strength increases {{and the size of the}} recirculation gets larger as the Reynolds number increases. As the height ratio increases, the strength and size of the recirculation decreases because the flow has enough space to expand through the tube passages. The increase in length ratio does not significantly impact the strength and size of the recirculation. The non-dimesionalized pressure drop monotonically decreased with an increase in the Reynolds number. In general, the module average Nusselt number increases with an increase in the Reynolds number. The results at Pr = 7. 0 indicate a significant increase in the computed module average Nusselt number when compared to those for Pr = 0. 7. The overall performance of in-line configuration for lower height ratio (H/Da = 2) and higher length ratio (L/Da = 6) is preferable since it provides higher heat transfer rate for all Reynolds numbers except for the lowest Re value of 25.

Cost of production and reliability of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> of this type is to a wide extent determined by corresponding characteristics of <b>tube</b> <b>bundle,</b> «tube – tubesheet» is its typical joint in particular when welding operations are used in order to attach tubes to tubesheet in addition to expansion. When manufacturing such equipment of heat-resistant chrome-bearing or chromium-molybdenum steels including steel 15 H 5 M, the process of fixed joint manufacturing gets significantly more complicated and costly due to the necessity to use thermal treatment before, during and after welding (this problem is particularly applicable for manufacturing of large-size equipment). One of the options to exclude thermal treatment from manufacturing process is to use «non-arc» welding methods – laser welding, explosion welding as well as friction welding. Use {{of each of the}} welding methods mentioned above during production of heat-exchange equipment has its process challenges and peculiarities. This article gives a comparative analysis of weld structure and distribution of electrode potentials of welded joints and parent metal of the joints simulating welding of tube to tubesheet of steel 15 H 5 M using the following welding methods: shielded manual arc welding, tungsten-arc inert-gas welding and friction welding. Comparative analysis of macro- and microstructures of specific zones of the studied welded joints showed that the joints produced by arc welding methods do not exhibit evident inhomogeneity of the structure after application of thermal treatment which is explained by the correctness of thermal treatment. Joints obtained via friction welding are characterized by structural inhomogeneity of the welded joint zone metal microstructure. The ultra-fine-grained structure obtained as a result of friction welding makes it possible to speak of a qualitative improvement in the structure of compounds as a result of exposure to a metal at the nanolevel. The conducted study of electrode potential values in specific points of parent metal and of welded joints obtained via different methods showed, that from the electrochemical corrosion point of view the «tube – tubesheet» joints obtained by friction welding without thermal treatment are highly competitive in terms of corrosion resistance with similar details obtained via arc welding methods. This fact allows to consider the friction welding method of «tube – tubesheet» fixed joints manufacturing as an alternative for arc welding methods, which in its turn not only allows producers to obtain «tube – tubesheet» fixed joints with high level of strength and plastic properties without thermal treatment but also significantly reduce energy and labor costs on manufacturing of <b>tube</b> <b>bundles</b> of shell-and-tube <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> including those made of steel 15 H 5 M...|$|R

40|$|With an {{increasing}} tendency in civil engineering to build ever taller skyscrapers and longer bridges with lighter materials, structures {{are more susceptible}} to wind-induced vibrations. In the design process, however, aeroelastic safety is often not considered. While the conceived structures are perfectly adopted to standard design loads, they are only seldom aerodynamically optimized. Many examples exist where wind-induced vibrations have led to catastrophic structural failure. Wind-induced vibrations can be caused by either forced excitation or aeroelastic effects. In the first case, the forced vibrations originate from turbulent fluctuations in the wind flow around the structure, e. g. from natural turbulence in the wind flow attacking the structure or due to periodic vortex shedding {{in the wake of the}} structure. The second, aeroelastic phenomena are typically self-excited and are due to displacements of the structure that result in interactions with the wind flow. It must be emphasized that it is often impossible to pinpoint one specific excitation mechanism as the single cause of observed wind-induced vibrations since these are often initiated by a combination of different phenomena. In design codes, however, only forced excitation is mostly considered. It is therefore important to develop advanced techniques to study wind-induced vibrations that can incorporate all different excitation mechanisms at once. To study the susceptibility of a structure to wind-induced phenomena, a coupled multiphysics problem considering both wind flow and structural dynamics has to be solved. Because of the complexity of such problems, simplified phenomenological and experimental models are often unsatisfactory while numerical methods have the advantage that all possibly interacting excitation mechanisms can be accounted for simultaneously. With procedures available to couple a numerical model for the wind flow, i. e. computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the structure, e. g. finite element (FE) models, it should be possible to study wind-structure interaction (WSI) numerically. The goal of this thesis is therefore to investigate whether for a realistic, complex WSI problem numerical simulations can adequately predict observed wind-induced vibrations. For this purpose, the specific case study of a silo group is considered where wind-induced ovalling vibrations were observed during a storm in October 2002 on several empty silos in a group of forty silos in the port of Antwerp (Belgium). The necessity of performing complicated numerical WSI simulations for this problem is examined. First, it is investigated with both 2 D and 3 D CFD simulations how turbulent fluctuations in natural atmospheric winds can be simulated and how they are preserved in the flow field. In the 2 D simulations realistic turbulence levels cannot be simulated in the oncoming wind flow but these calculations allow to study wake-induced effects on the aerodynamic pressures in the silo group for a changing angle of incidence of the wind flow, as the simulations are computationally significantly less intensive. In the 3 D simulations, the turbulent wind flow can be modelled more realistically although some difficulties are encountered with the preservation of turbulence levels in the wind flow attacking the silo group as well. Due to the particular geometry of the silo group and the highly turbulent character of the wind flow, validation of the CFD simulation results is difficult. In addition to the silo group, the flow around a single silo is therefore considered. The better documented 2 D flow around a single cylinder is validated with results from the literature, while for the validation of the 3 D wind flow simulations, a wind tunnel test is performed for the single silo configuration. The influence of the blockage effect in the experiment is investigated and the pressure distribution on the silo surface shows reasonably good agreement in experiment and simulation. Qualitative validation is furthermore performed wherever possible for the silo group by comparing the flow pattern with geometrically similar flows e. g. through <b>tube</b> <b>bundles</b> of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> or around surface mounted prisms. The typical ovalling eigenmodes of a silo are determined from the FE model of the structure and subsequently, the modal projection of the aerodynamic pressure distributions from the 2 D and 3 D CFD simulations is determined. This approach allows to assess at which locations in the silo group ovalling vibrations are excited through direct forcing by the transient wind loads. For all angles of incidence in the 2 D simulations, a harmonic decomposition methodology is introduced as an alternative for the 3 D modal projection. The effect of a different turbulence modelling approach in the 2 D and 3 D simulations on the aerodynamic pressures on the silo surfaces is significant. While the 2 D simulations are found to be inadequate for the present purposes, the location of the ovalling vibrations in the silo group is predicted well by the 3 D simulations. Finally, the FE model of the structure and the 3 D CFD wind flow simulations are considered together as a single problem. To evaluate the importance of incorporating WSI for the prediction of ovalling vibrations, the structural response due to external aerodynamic forces is first calculated in one-way coupled simulations. The applied transient wind loads are determined a priori in the 3 D CFD simulations. In this approach, only forced excitation is considered as a possible excitation mechanism of wind-induced vibrations. In the two-way coupled WSI simulations by contrast, the structural and fluid solver are fully interacting and information is exchanged at the interface between the two solvers in every time step. Therefore, in this approach aeroelastic phenomena are also accounted for. Both one-way and two-way coupled simulations are performed for the single silo configuration and for the entire silo group. The structural response in the different coupled simulations in terms of excited eigenmodes is compared by considering modal deformation energy. Different frequency components can be clearly distinguished in the modal deformation energy of the structural response which are related to physical phenomena in the turbulent wind flow. After qualitative comparison of the results in the one-way and two-way coupled simulations, it cannot decisively be concluded whether ovalling vibrations of a single silo are due to forced excitation or if aeroelastic effects are important. Because the coupled WSI simulations are at the limit of practical feasibility of present day computational power, no grid independent solutions could be obtained. Nevertheless, the results of low resolution simulations for the silo group arrangement indicate that aeroelastic effects have a sigificant impact on the structural response of the silos. It is therefore concluded that complicated and grid independent WSI simulations are in general required to realistically predict the onset of ovalling vibrations in silo groups with numerical techniques. nrpages: 238 status: publishe...|$|R

Heat transfer character of frontal and further tubes to downward foam flow is different in comparison with the one–phase coolant flow.
