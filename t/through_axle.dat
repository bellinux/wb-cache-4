25|$|There {{are many}} {{standards}} for mounting disc brake calipers. I.S. (International Standard) is different for 160mm and 203mm rotor and differs between forks with a QR and 20mm <b>through</b> <b>axle.</b> The post-mount standard also differs by disc size and axle type. Many incompatible variants were produced over the years, mostly by fork manufacturers. The mount {{used on the}} Rockshox Boxxer is the most typical of these specialty mounts, but most fork manufactures now use either the IS or post-mount standard for their current forks. As a point of reference, Hayes currently sells no fewer than 13 different adapters to fit their brakes to various mounting patterns.|$|E
50|$|The Stampe et Vertongen RSV.22 was a {{training}} biplane produced in Belgium in the 1920s. It was a conventional, single-bay biplane with staggered wings of unequal span that were braced with N-struts near their tips. The fixed undercarriage {{consisted of two}} mainwheels that were joined by a common <b>through</b> <b>axle,</b> plus a tailskid. The student pilot and the instructor sat in open cockpits in tandem that were fitted with dual controls. Construction was of mixed materials, with metal used for the undercarriage, engine mount, and cabane struts. The control surfaces were operated by a rigid linkage made of dural tube. The horizontal stabilizer was adjustable in flight, using a lever in the cockpit to adjust the aircraft's trim. Incorrect use of this latter feature led {{to a number of}} accidents. The base model RSV 22/180 was powered by a 134-kW (180-hp) Hispano-Suiza engine, but the aircraft was designed to use powerplants of up to 220 kW (300 hp). The RSV 22/200 variant used a 150-kW (200-hp) Renard-built radial engine in place of the Hispano-Suiza.|$|E
50|$|After the war, at {{the request}} of Viv Bellamy, then Chief Flying Instructor at the Hampshire Aeroplane Club (HAC) at Eastleigh, Currie used the same {{drawings}} to enable the HAC to build two more examples under the supervision of J O Isaacs. The first aircraft, registered G-APNT, first flew on the 11 September 1958. G-APNT was soon re-engined with a four-cylinder 60 hp Walter Mikron II engine and was also trialled using floats. With the more powerful Mikron engine it was known as the Hot Wot and later, with the floats, as the Wet Wot. The floatplane version was not a success and they were soon removed. With the original Aeronca-JAP engine fitted it was delivered on 29 May 1959 as the personal aircraft of Westland Aircraft test pilot H J Penrose, who christened the aeroplane 'Airymouse' and wrote a book of the same name about his experiences flying the aircraft. The second aircraft, registered G-APWT had a number of different engines fitted for trials, including a 60 hp Rover TP60/1 industrial gas turbine engine,before being delivered to Elstree Aerodrome in 1962. G-APWT was later sold to Robert Rust Sr. and relocated to Fayetteville, Georgia in the United States. The aircraft was restored to flying condition and flew again {{for the first time in}} 2008 with an original Walter Mikron engine. At the time it carried the registration N67247, but the registration was allowed to lapse in 2013.Aircraft plans were sold to amateur builders and soon examples were being constructed, the first homebuilt aircraft flying in 1963. The aircraft featured all-wood construction with fabric covering. The most unusual Wots were built in 1967 by Slingsby Sailplanes Limited. Slingsby built six aircraft modified to represent the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5A for film work. They were powered by 115 hp Lycoming O-235 engines with dummy exhausts and other modifications as 0.83 scale replicas. They were delivered to Ireland and fitted with dummy guns for the film Darling Lili. Some of the aircraft were also used in the films I Shot Down Richthofen, I Think, and Dubious Patriot. The Currie Super Wot is clipped-wing variant with X-bracing between the undercarriage V-struts instead of a <b>through</b> <b>axle.</b> Other refinements in the Super Wot include rounding out the fuselage with formers and stringers and doing away with the upper wing centre-section, replacing the cabane struts with inverted V tubular struts in a similar style to the Pitts Special. These refinements result in a faster cruise and enhanced climb rate and a quicker roll rate. A Super Wot fitted with a 90hp Continental will fly a quarter-vertical roll, which is probably outside the capability of the standard Wot. Nick Bloom wrote a series of articles about his Super Wot which appeared in Pilot magazine under the title 'Diary of a Homebuilder'. His Currie Super Wot is one of only two on the G-register, and has the registration G-BGES.|$|E
50|$|The {{width of}} the fork, also called spacing, is {{measured}} colinear with the front wheel axle between the inside edges of the two fork ends. Most modern adult sized forks have 100 mm spacing. Downhill mountain bike forks designed for <b>through</b> <b>axles</b> have 110 mm spacing.|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{rear wheel}} drive cars solve this problem by using a form of {{traction}} control which limits engine power when fishtailing occurs. The ability of the rear suspension to keep tires in contact with, and perpendicular to the road is also {{a key factor in}} the amount of grip available <b>through</b> the rear <b>axle.</b> For example, a live beam axle suspension will have far less grip on a bumpy road than an independent rear suspension, due to its far greater unsprung weight, and forces from one wheel being transmitted <b>through</b> the <b>axle</b> to the other wheel, leading to the tire being out of contact with the road surface more of the time.|$|R

40|$|Template {{approaches}} to rotaxanes normally require at least n - 1 template sites to interlock n components. Here {{we describe the}} one-pot synthesis of [3]rotaxanes in which a single metal template site induces formation of <b>axles</b> <b>through</b> each cavity of a bicyclic macrocycle. Central to the approach is that {{a portion of the}} bicyclic molecule acts as a ligand for a transition metal ion that mediates covalent bond formation through one or other macrocyclic cavity, depending on the ligand's orientation, making a mechanical bond. The ligand can then rotate so that the transition metal can catalyze the formation of a second <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> the other macrocycle. Using this strategy with the Cu(I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (the CuAAC reaction) generates a [3]rotaxane with two identical axles in up to 86 % yield. [3]Rotaxanes with two different <b>axles</b> threaded <b>through</b> the macrobicyclic rings can also be created using a single template site, either by having copper(I) sequentially form both mechanical bonds (via the CuAAC reaction) using different sets of building blocks for each axle or by using two different reactions catalyzed by two different metal ions: a palladium(II) -mediated alkyne homocoupling to assemble the first thread through one cavity, followed by a copper(I) -mediated CuAAC reaction to form the second <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> the other ring...|$|R
50|$|The Triouleyre was a French {{automobile}} manufactured between 1896 and 1898. The car had a rear-mounted five-horsepower {{horizontal engine}} {{along the lines}} of a Benz driving the back <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> belts and chains. Two started in the 1896 Paris-Marseille-Paris and Paris-Nantes races but failed to finish.|$|R
50|$|Power {{from the}} engine is {{transmitted}} in a conventional manner through the lightweight flywheel, clutch, and Corvette type four-speed transmission. Attaching directly to the rear end of the transmission case is the differential and final drive gear mechanism. A feature of the final drive gears {{is the ability to}} quickly change ratios so that vehicle performance can be as quickly tailored to a new environment. Power transmission to the wheels is completed <b>through</b> individual <b>axle</b> shafts with universal joints on each end, or a total of four in-all.|$|R
50|$|The outside {{cylinders}} {{drove the}} third pair of driving wheels while the inside cylinder drove the second pair <b>through</b> a cranked <b>axle,</b> with the cylinder mounted in an inclined position.

50|$|SM01 {{locomotives}} in fact slightly differed between units, mostly regarding exterior. It is a Bo locomotive, what {{means there}} are two powered axles under the unit.

50|$|The {{original}} model, the Aero Type 500 cyclecar, had a 499 cc single-cylinder {{two-stroke engine}} with water cooling. Drive {{was to the}} rear <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> a 3-speed gearbox to a back axle without differential. Body styles were a roadster, cabriolet and coupé all with two seats {{in the front and}} one in the rear. About 1500 were made.|$|R
50|$|A {{water wheel}} is a machine for {{converting}} {{the energy of}} flowing or falling water into useful forms of power, often in a watermill. A water wheel consists of a wheel (usually constructed from wood or metal), {{with a number of}} blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface. Most commonly, the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle, but can also be mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft, for example the tub or Norse. Vertical wheels can transmit power either <b>through</b> the <b>axle</b> or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears; horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load.|$|R
5000|$|On the 33rd car, heat {{began to}} build up in an improperly-lubricated journal bearing {{on one of the}} wheels, one of the few still in use at that time as most had long since been {{replaced}} with roller bearings, resulting in the condition known among train workers as a [...] "hot box". Residents living beside the tracks reported smoke and sparks coming from the car, and those who were close to Mississauga thought the train was afire. The friction eventually burned <b>through</b> the <b>axle</b> and bearing, and as the train was passing the Burnhamthorpe Road level crossing, a wheelset (one axle and pair of wheels) fell off completely.|$|R
50|$|American {{locomotives}} universally employed inside Stephenson {{valve gear}} placed between the frames until around 1900 when it quickly {{gave way to}} outside Walschaerts motion. In Europe, Stephenson gear could be placed either outside the driving wheels and driven by either eccentrics or return cranks or else between the frames driven from the <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> eccentrics, as was mostly the case in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|Before the mid-20th century, {{a single}} large motor was {{often used to}} drive {{multiple}} driving wheels through connecting rods that were {{very similar to those}} used on steam locomotives. Examples are the Pennsylvania Railroad DD1, FF1 and L5 and the various Swiss Crocodiles. It is now standard practice to provide one traction motor driving each <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> a gear drive.|$|R
50|$|The first {{vehicles}} were electrically powered trucks {{coming from the}} company's background in electric motor manufacture. Car manufacture followed using 4-cylinder engines from Ballot and Daimler. The trucks moved to engines from White and Poppe, Continental and Hercules. The 1914 car used a 12 hp Ballot engine driving the rear <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> a three-speed gearbox. There was no differential on the rear axle.|$|R
50|$|Stout {{designed}} the Scarab in strong contrast to contemporary production cars that commonly used a separate chassis and body; {{with a long}} front, with engine compartment and engine located longitudinally behind the front axle, and a rearward passenger compartment. The front-mounted engine typically drove the rear <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> a connecting drive shaft running underneath {{the floor of the}} vehicle. This layout worked well, but had space limitations.|$|R
50|$|On {{streetcar}} (tram) systems using grooved rails, if {{the wheels}} {{on both sides}} of the car are connected by a rigid solid axle, only one switchpoint is needed to steer it onto one or the other track. The switchpoint will be on inside rail of the switch's curve route. When a streetcar enters the curve route of the switch, the wheel on the inside of the curve (the right side of the car on a right turn) is pulled into the turn, and <b>through</b> the <b>axle,</b> directs the wheel on the outside to also follow the curve. The outside wheel is supported for a short distance by its flange running in the groove.|$|R

The 7 feet 6 inch (2286 mm) wheelbase, 3 feet 10 inch (1150 mm) track chassis was a conventional one with half elliptic leaf spring suspension front and rear but the bodywork could be specified made from cane basketwork. Drive was to the rear <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> a variable ratio friction drive and chains.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} created by Riley as a {{subsidiary}} to produce large luxury cars and a new factory was built. A 2849 cc 90°V-8, triple camshaft engine was developed {{from a pair of}} 1½-litre Riley engine blocks and coupled to a pre selector unit bought from Armstrong Siddeley. One car was fitted withed a zf 4 speed manual box, Drive was to the rear wheels <b>through</b> a live <b>axle</b> with worm gear final drive.|$|R
5000|$|The car, a tiller-steered three-seater in the voiturette (cyclecar) class, {{was called}} a voiturelle.

50|$|Dampers were {{mounted to}} the chassis and <b>axle</b> <b>through</b> Silentbloc bushes at each end. Silentbloc bushes were another {{development}} of the early 1930s, a vulcanised rubber bush bonded into a steel tube. These provided the stiff location that accurate suspension required, but reduced vibration and road noise, compared to earlier cars. Many cars used a different design for front and rear, where the rear arms were rigidly bolted to the chassis, rather than with a swivelling bush.|$|R
5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving <b>axles</b> <b>through</b> pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|R
