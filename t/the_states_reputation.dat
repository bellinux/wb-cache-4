5000|$|The stereotype, {{frequently}} {{characterized by}} a lazy, rural, poor, banjo-playing, racist, cousin-marrying hick is commonly applied to Arkansas and her residents. Arkansas's hillbilly reputation, and her citizen's defensiveness on the subject, are a very important piece of Arkansas's culture. Many Arkansans defend <b>the</b> <b>state</b> from this image, yet others embrace it. <b>The</b> Old <b>State</b> House Museum currently houses an exhibit regarding <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Another Republican, however, {{was appalled}} at Odom's troubles.

5000|$|Aaron Venable Brown (August 15, 1795 - March 8, 1859) was an American politician. He {{served as}} Governor of Tennessee from 1845 to 1847, and as United States Postmaster General from 1857 {{until his death}} in 1859. He also served three terms in <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> House of Representatives, from 1839 to 1845.

5000|$|Other governments, {{such as that}} of <b>the</b> American <b>state</b> of Nebraska, have {{attempted}} to use the creation of tourism regions to help produce a tourism industry in a state not frequently considered by potential tourists. [...] <b>The</b> <b>state's</b> [...] "Lewis and Clark" [...] region in northeast Nebraska and the [...] "Frontier Trails" [...] region of south-central Nebraska attempt to deemphasize <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation</b> as a place people cross on their way somewhere else by capitalizing <b>the</b> role <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> territory played in the United States' often romanticized project of westward expansion.|$|R
50|$|In February 2002, the National Security Council met {{to decide}} whether to expand ISAF beyond Kabul. In a dispute between Powell and Rumsfeld (a pattern {{repeated}} often through the Bush Administration) Rumsfeld's view that the force should not be expanded prevailed. Historians later wrote that the failure of ISAF to be deployed beyond Kabul drove Karzai to offer positions within <b>the</b> <b>state</b> to potential spoilers whose activities did great harm to <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation.</b> Because <b>the</b> rise of the insurgency was linked to grievances over governance, this became a serious problem.|$|R
50|$|On March 23, 2011, Governor LePage sparked protests when he {{announced}} that he planned to remove a large mural depicting the history of <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> labor movement from the lobby of the Maine Department of Labor offices. Despite protests, on March 28 it was disclosed that the murals had been removed over the weekend. The Portland Museum of Art issued a statement that said LePage's decision has tarnished <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation</b> as a haven for artists. His actions sparked furthered backlash and lawsuits were brought forward regarding the murals.|$|R
50|$|Rights for Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) {{people in}} Utah {{have become increasingly}} enacted since 2014, despite <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation</b> as socially conservative and highly religious. Same-sex marriage has been legal there since <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> ban on same-sex marriage was ruled unconstitutional by a federal court on October 6, 2014. In addition, statewide anti-discrimination laws now cover sexual orientation and gender identity in employment and housing. In spite of this, {{there are still a}} few differences between treatment of LGBT people {{and the rest of the}} population.|$|R
5000|$|When the Mexican-American War began, {{largely through}} {{the actions of}} his friend and former law partner, Polk, who was now president, Brown issued a call for 2,800 {{volunteer}} soldiers for the war effort. Over 30,000 answered the call, solidifying <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation</b> as <b>the</b> [...] "Volunteer State," [...] a reputation that had been gained when Tennesseans answered a similar call during the War of 1812. [...] While initially popular, {{support for the war}} gradually declined, and Brown was defeated in his reelection bid by Neill S. Brown (no relation) in 1847.|$|R
5|$|The primary {{campaign}} issue was the ongoing Black Patch Tobacco Wars. Hager carried {{the stigma of}} being the hand-picked candidate of Governor Beckham, who had largely ignored the violence during his administration. On the other hand, Willson had twice represented the American Tobacco Company, whose business practices were the reason for farmers' discontent and violence. Democrats made much of this issue, and Willson did little to counter accusations that he was unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} the farmers. Hager tried to appeal to both sides of the conflict, but ultimately lost the support of both. Willson's position appealed to urban voters who wanted <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation</b> for violence to end even if it meant siding with the tobacco industry against <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> farmers.|$|R
5000|$|While Blanton <b>stated</b> <b>the</b> pardons were {{to comply}} with a court order to reduce <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> prison population, <b>the</b> FBI and members of both parties grew {{concerned}} that the pardons were related to the alleged scandal then under investigation. [...] After U.S. Attorney Hal Hardin (a friend of Blanton) tipped off state leaders that Blanton was planning more pardons, Lieutenant Governor (and Senate Speaker) John S. Wilder and State House Speaker Ned McWherter searched for a way to prevent further damage to <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation.</b> They found it in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> constitution, which is somewhat vague on when a newly elected governor must be sworn in. It was eventually decided to swear in Alexander three days before the traditional inauguration day. Wilder later referred to Blanton's ouster as [...] "impeachment Tennessee-style." ...|$|R
2500|$|In August both Governor Bennett and Mayor Hamilton {{published}} {{accounts of}} the insurrection and Court proceedings; Bennett downplayed the danger posed by the alleged crisis and argued that the Court's executions and lack of due process damaged <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation.</b> But Hamilton captured the public with his 46-page account, which became the [...] "received version" [...] of a narrowly avoided bloodbath and citizens saved by the city's and Court's heroic actions.

Over the years, many Arkansans have looked to the Razorbacks football team as the public image of <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> Following <b>the</b> Little Rock Nine integration crisis at Little Rock Central High School, Arkansans looked to the successful Razorback teams in the following years to repair <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation.</b> Although <b>the</b> University of Arkansas is based in Fayetteville, the Razorbacks have always played at least one game per season at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock {{in an effort to keep}} fan support in central and south Arkansas.|$|R
5000|$|Illinois is a Democratic stronghold {{in presidential}} {{elections}} {{and one of}} the [...] "big three" [...] Democratic states alongside California and New York. It is considered one of <b>the</b> most Democratic <b>states</b> in <b>the</b> nation in presidential contests. For most of its history, Illinois was widely considered to be a swing <b>state,</b> voting for <b>the</b> winner of all but two presidential elections in the 20th century. Political party strength in Illinois is highly dependent upon Cook County, and <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation</b> as a blue <b>state</b> rests upon <b>the</b> fact that the majority of its population and political power is concentrated in Chicago, Cook County, and the Chicago metropolitan area. Outside of Chicago, the suburban collar counties continue to trend Democratic while downstate Illinois can be considered more conservative.|$|R
50|$|Massachusetts {{had been}} a Democratic-leaning state since 1928, and a Democratic stronghold since 1960- and the 1960s {{would prove to be}} a decade of Democratic {{dominance}} in Massachusetts. Prior to 1960, Massachusetts had usually been a swing state, and Republican Dwight Eisenhower had carried it by 19 points in 1956. However, in 1960 Massachusetts native John F. Kennedy would become the first Democrat to ever win Massachusetts with over sixty percent of the vote, taking 60.22 percent. In the midst of the 1964 nationwide Democratic landslide, Lyndon Johnson had carried <b>the</b> <b>state</b> in an historically massive landslide, taking over 76 {{percent of the vote in}} Massachusetts to Republican Barry Goldwater’s 23 percent. While Humphrey did not reach Johnson’s level of support, his 63.01 percent outperformed JFK and remains the second highest vote share any Democratic presidential candidate has ever received in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> - even though Humphrey was losing the election nationally, thus establishing <b>the</b> <b>state’s</b> <b>reputation</b> as a Democratic stronghold in the modern era.|$|R

These factors partly explain why some U.

The challenge will be to preserve these features while positioning <b>the</b> <b>state</b> to compete in a more knowledge-intensive economy.; Texas faces issues in public finance, education, changing demographics and infrastructure.

5000|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s, Hazel, who was by then a {{seasoned}} land-use attorney, positioned himself as a tireless advocate for commercial and residential growth in Fairfax County. He quickly became the go-to guy for developers who wished to open up Fairfax to new housing and commercial development. Hazel pursued rezoning applications and changes to the county’s comprehensive plan with great energy. Once these changes were approved, he then pushed for the timely installation of sewers and other utilities {{in accordance with the}} comprehensive plan, which primed the targeted areas for development. If the county board was slow or hesitant to take action on a particular rezoning application or land-use measure, Hazel was quick to turn to the courts. He petitioned often and was almost always successful, as the Virginia courts affirmed <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation</b> time and again as being more receptive to the rights of landowners than not. In Edge City, Garreau notes that [...] "Hazel was a buzz saw. During his heyday, he never lost a zoning case in the Virginia Supreme Court.” ...|$|R

This hypothesis is tested empirically across all dyads in the international system from 1817 - 2000.

50|$|Football, {{especially}} collegiate football, {{has always}} been important to Arkansans, primarily {{because of a lack}} of a top level professional sports team. College football in Arkansas began from humble beginnings. The University of Arkansas first fielded a team in 1894 when football was a very dangerous game. Many attempts to regulate violence and use of ringers plagued the sport early on. Calling the Hogs is a cheer that shows support for the Razorbacks, one of the two FBS teams in <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> High school football also began to grow in Arkansas in the early 20th century. Over the years, many Arkansans have looked to the Razorbacks football team as the public image of <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> despite their general mediocrity. Following the Little Rock Nine integration crisis at Little Rock Central High School, Arkansans looked to the successful Razorback teams in the following years to repair <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>reputation.</b> Although <b>the</b> University of Arkansas is based in Fayetteville, the Razorbacks have always played at least two games per season at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock in an effort to keep fan support in central and south Arkansas. Arkansas <b>State</b> University joined <b>the</b> Football Bowl Subdivision along with the University of Arkansas in 1992 after playing in lower divisions for decades. However, the two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas' policy of not playing intrastate games.

50|$|The American art {{magazine}} Art & Antiques named Cherry in 1985 {{among the}} 100 most important art collectors of <b>the</b> United <b>States.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reputation</b> of this collection {{was not only}} because of the quality of the works, but also for the sometimes very high prices that he paid for these pictures and scored from subsequent sales. A record-breaking example of these works was Pablo Picasso's self-portrait Yo, Picasso. Cherry purchased the picture in 1981 at Sotheby's for $5.3 million. At the time the highest amount ever paid for a Picasso painting. The same painting was sold by Cherry in May 1989 again at Sotheby's and received from the highest bidder, the Greek shipowner Stavros Niarchos, $47.9 million—again the highest price for a work of Picasso and also the second highest ever paid for a work of art at that time.|$|R
