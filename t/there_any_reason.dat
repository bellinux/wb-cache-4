25|$|There is {{no reason}} why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of {{security}} should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health. Nor is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 {{study of}} oil {{depletion}} by the UK Energy Research Centre {{pointed out that}} there is no theoretical and no robust practical reason to assume that oil production will follow a logistic curve. Neither is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> to assume that the peak will occur when half the ultimate recoverable resource has been produced; and in fact, empirical evidence appears to contradict this idea. An analysis of a 55 post-peak countries found that the average peak was at 25 percent of the ultimate recovery.|$|E
2500|$|Hayek {{also wrote}} that the state {{can play a role}} in the economy, and specifically, in {{creating}} a safety net. [...] He wrote, [...] "There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom; that is: some minimum of food, shelter and clothing, sufficient to preserve health.

6000|$|... "When the {{ambulance}} comes {{you get out}} of sight until we pack these fellows out. I'll leave the door open--so if <b>there's</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> you want to come back--why--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I'll {{tell him}} {{if it seems}} necessary; that is, if <b>there's</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> for sending you word. Otherwise, of course, {{there would be no}} need to mention it." ...|$|R
2500|$|A lively controversialist, Francis {{began with}} some largely valid {{complaints}} {{about how the}} Southern heritage is demonized in mainstream culture. He went on, however, to attack the liberal principles of humanism and universalism for facilitating [...] "the war against the white race." [...] At one point he described country music megastar Garth Brooks as [...] "repulsive" [...] because [...] "he has that stupid universalist song, in which we all intermarry." [...] His fellow whites, he insisted, must [...] "reassert our identity and our solidarity, and we must do so in explicitly racial terms through the articulation of a racial consciousness as whites... The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> {{to believe that the}} civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nor is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> why {{the state}} should not assist... {{individuals}} in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision. Where, {{as in the case}} of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance – where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks – the case for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.... there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom. Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make the provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Tynan, Executive Editor of PC World {{and author}} of Computer Privacy Annoyances (2005), said: [...] "This is {{extremely}} creepy, and way beyond {{the purview of the}} school.... There's really no need to try to take a picture of someone—in fact, how can you prove the person in front of the laptop was the one who stole it?... And to install this stuff on anyone's computer and not notify them about, it is just begging for a world of pain." [...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X. Cringely wrote in InfoWorld: [...] Is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> why you'd need to take two weeks' worth of photos to locate a missing laptop, especially when you already have other ways of tracking it? I don't think so.... Cafiero issued … the rather interesting statement that the 15-year-old Robbins had [...] "no reasonable expectation of privacy" [...] in his own home, because … his family hadn't paid the $55 insurance fee required by the school for home loaners. [...] In other words: If you don't pay your dues, we can watch you while you sleep. Did I say [...] "creepy" [...] already? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And sea-beans, too, perhaps," [...] said I. [...] "But I don't think <b>there's</b> <b>any</b> <b>reason</b> {{for going}} so soon. I'm {{going to settle}} those Indians, and you've only seen one girl, and perhaps we'll never see her again." ...|$|R

3000|$|We {{would assume}} that {{educational}} institutions will justify their data processing either by consent or legitimate interests, e.g. stated in a contract. What are the limits to using legitimate interests, and are <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>reasons</b> related to LA that would speak against consent as a default justification for collecting data from learning activities?
