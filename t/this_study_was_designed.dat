The group initiated a multi-agency study under the perception that a high density of gangs were operating {{in the area of}} interest or the city of Boston. It was assumed that youth violence was the direct product of gangs involvement almost in every youth violence incident. Some gang members were interviewed and it was learned that many did not classify themselves as gangs or gang members.|$|E
50|$|Diabetes {{treatments}} {{account for}} 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 {{study was a}} global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.|$|E

5000|$|Studies {{done for}} the Minerals Management Service have {{questioned}} the reliability of shear rams in deep-water drilling. Figure 1 shows {{the result of a}} 2002 study on offshore oil rigs. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> to answer the question “Can a given rig’s BOP equipment shear the pipe to be used in a given drilling program at the most demanding condition to be expected?” [...] Seven of the fourteen cases in this study opted not to test, another had insufficient data to draw a definitive conclusion, and three failed to shear the pipe under realistic conditions of expected well bore and seawater pressure. In each case of failure, increasing the pressure on the rams above its design value, successfully sheared the pipe. A follow-up study in 2004 confirmed these results with a much larger sample of drill pipes and typical blowout preventers from three different manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|Equestrian Communities are platted housing {{developments}} that include amenities suited for horse boarding and riding. Since the mid-1970s, this particular sector of amenity community development {{has become an}} increasing trend. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> {{to take a look}} at the way these communities are designed; where they are located; how they are managed; and, to whom they are marketed. Designing equestrian communities requires knowledge of how these communities are designed, where the land comes from, why people are buying into them and who those people are. Case study methodology was used to gather data on 22 communities across the US. Data sources included review of the marketing websites belonging to the communities; a literature review; and, interviews conducted with individuals responsible for the design and sales of the communities' lots or the management of the equestrian facilities. Statistics and images of the communities, including plats where available, were compiled into community [...] "cut sheets" [...] which are single-page synopses of each community. Master's thesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> {{to review}} the {{experience}} of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) with judiciary capacity building. UNMIK is significant both because Kosovo is a linchpin of Balkan politics and diplomacy, and because it provides a laboratory for deriving lessons for future efforts at post-conflict governance and administration. The goal {{of the study was to}} enable policy makers to “learn the lessons of capacity building for a judiciary as a part of the mandate of a peace support cooperation if similar work in the future is to be more effective”. A direct result of this study, Pearson Paper 8, Lessons Learned on UNMIK Judiciary describes problems at each stage of judiciary building, how they were addressed, how they could have been addressed more effectively, and what changes would facilitate such improvements. After outlining the broader context in which the development of Kosovo’s judicial system takes place, this assessment will describe chronological developments in the judiciary. It then turns to broader themes and patterns in the establishment of the judiciary by focusing on the specific challenges that most characterized the development of the judiciary at each stage and to some underlying patterns in the development of Kosovo’s judiciary and concludes with some suggestions - both for the future of Kosovo’s judiciary and in other post-conflict administrations, as well.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Maureen Durkin, who is {{involved}} in the health sciences department at the University of Wisconsin, did a cross-sectional study {{to see if there was}} any correlation between children who are born with autism and socioeconomic status. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> to see if socioeconomic status has any association with children who are born with autism spectrum disorder. Durkin and associates discovered that children born in low SES family and the births of autistic children are increasing. Although, there were some limitations to this study; ADDM Network surveillance system. Durkin et al based their research on this system, it's a system where children with disabilities have access to diagnostic services. Therefore, autistic children in low SES, may not have access to the same. Another limitation this study has is that this study took part in children that were eight years old rather than when they were first diagnosed. This would have an effect on the outcome as some families who might be in a high SES, may use all the funds to help the child towards intervention programs and may leave the family in a low SES in the long run. Families that are in high SES, are well educated, and have the financial resources to pay for the highest quality of education for their child. Durkin et al also found that good or low SES had to do with race and ethnicity.|$|E
