5000|$|In older vehicles, the {{tachometer}} {{is driven}} by the RMS voltage waves from the low tension (LT) side of the ignition coil, while on others (and nearly all diesel engines, which have no ignition system) engine speed is determined by the frequency from the alternator <b>tachometer</b> <b>output.</b> This is from a special connection called an [...] "AC tap" [...] which is a connection to one of the stator's coil output, before the rectifier. Tachometers driven by a rotating cable from a drive unit fitted to the engine (usually on the camshaft) exist - usually on simple diesel-engined machinery with basic or no electrical systems. On recent EMS found on modern vehicles, the signal for the tachometer is usually generated from an ECU which derives the information from either the crankshaft or camshaft speed sensor.|$|E
40|$|The ZXBM 1021 {{is a high}} performance, low noise, single-phase, Direct Current Brushless (BLDC) motor pre-driver with {{variable}} PWM {{speed control}} and current control suitable for fan and blower motors. For system flexibility the motor speed can be controlled by either an external PWM control signal or by a DC voltage signal from an external control voltage or from a Thermistor network. To prevent motor inrush current the device has a soft start feature. To help protect the motor coil, the ZXBM 1021 provides rotor lock protection which shuts down the output drive if rotor lock is detected. The device automatically re-starts with soft-start when the rotor lock is removed. The ZXBM 1021 monitors the motor current to provide a programmable over current limit. A <b>Tachometer</b> <b>output</b> {{is provided by the}} open collector output Frequency Generator (FG) pin which allows external interface to monitor motor rotation or speed. The FG output is the magnetic change frequency. The ZXBM 1021 is available in space saving and low profile U-QFN 4040 - 20 package. Features Operating Voltage: 6. 8 V to 18 V Can be extended with external regulator Speed control via external PWM, DC or Thermistor signals Low noise, high efficiency Soft start Integrated current control Reference voltage output Built-in Hall amplifier for direct connection of Hall element Rotor Lock Protection Lock detection, output shutdown and automatic re-start Minimum speed setting Frequency generator (FG) output Thermally enhanced space saving low profile U-QFN 4040 - 20 packag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of {{tachometer}} carbon brush wear detection technology is proposed based on data acquisition and signal processing technology, the key {{of which is that}} the <b>tachometer</b> carbon brush <b>output</b> information is acquired and processed, moreover, the real time conditions of the carbon brush wear are detected and analyzed based on the time domain Eigen value analysis method. During the data processing process, the results of the dimensional parameter processing method are compared with the results of the dimensionless parameter processing method at the same time. Then, we find that the detecting precision is greatly promoted and measurement probability is guaranteed by reasonable threshold selection. Experimental results indicate that the technology proposed here has high stability, high reliability, and high detecting probability, which has great practical value and deserves being extended widely...|$|R
