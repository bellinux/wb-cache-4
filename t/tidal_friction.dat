5|$|Currently Ariel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in a 5:3 resonance with Miranda, which could have been partially responsible for the heating of that moon (although the maximum heating attributable to a former 1:3 resonance of Umbriel with Miranda was likely about three times greater). Ariel may have once been locked in the 4:1 resonance with Titania, from which it later escaped. Escape from a mean motion resonance is much easier for the moons of Uranus than for those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to Uranus's lesser degree of oblateness. This resonance, which was likely encountered about 3.8 billion years ago, would have increased Ariel's orbital eccentricity, resulting in <b>tidal</b> <b>friction</b> due to time-varying tidal forces from Uranus.

25|$|The {{rotational}} {{angular momentum}} of Earth decreases and consequently {{the length of}} the day increases. The net tide raised on Earth by the Moon is dragged ahead of the Moon by Earth's much faster rotation. <b>Tidal</b> <b>friction</b> is required to drag and maintain the bulge ahead of the Moon, and it dissipates the excess energy of the exchange of rotational and orbital energy between Earth and the Moon as heat. If the friction and heat dissipation were not present, the Moon's gravitational force on the tidal bulge would rapidly (within two days) bring the tide back into synchronization with the Moon, and the Moon would no longer recede. Most of the dissipation occurs in a turbulent bottom boundary layer in shallow seas such as the European Shelf around the British Isles, the Patagonian Shelf off Argentina, and the Bering Sea.|$|E
25|$|The Moon is {{gradually}} receding from Earth into a higher orbit, and calculations {{suggest that this}} would continue for about 50 billion years. By that time, Earth and the Moon {{would be in a}} mutual spin–orbit resonance or tidal locking, in which the Moon will orbit Earth in about 47 days (currently 27 days), and both the Moon and Earth would rotate around their axes in the same time, always facing each other with the same side. This has already happened to the Moon—the same side always faces Earth—and is also slowly happening to the Earth. However, the slowdown of Earth's rotation is not occurring fast enough for the rotation to lengthen to a month before other effects change the situation: approximately 2.3 billion years from now, the increase of the Sun's radiation will have caused Earth's oceans to evaporate, removing the bulk of the <b>tidal</b> <b>friction</b> and acceleration.|$|E
500|$|Tidal heating occurs {{through the}} <b>tidal</b> <b>friction</b> processes: orbital and {{rotational}} energy are dissipated as {{heat in the}} crust of an object. In addition, {{to the extent that}} tides produce heat along fractures, libration may affect the magnitude and distribution of such tidal shear heating. Tidal dissipation of Enceladus's ice crust is significant because Enceladus has a subsurface ocean. A computer simulation that used data from Cassini was published in November 2017, and it indicates that friction heat from the sliding rock fragments within the permeable and fragmented core of Enceladus could keep its underground ocean warm for up to billions of years. It is thought that if Enceladus had a more eccentric orbit in the past, the enhanced tidal forces could be sufficient to maintain a subsurface ocean, such that a periodic enhancement in eccentricity could maintain a subsurface ocean that periodically changes in size. A more recent analysis claimed that [...] "a model of the tiger stripes as tidally flexed slots that puncture the ice shell can simultaneously explain the persistence of the eruptions through the tidal cycle, the phase lag, and the total power output of the tiger stripe terrain, while suggesting that eruptions are maintained over geological timescales." [...] Previous models suggest that resonant perturbations of Dione could provide the necessary periodic eccentricity changes to maintain the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, if the ocean contains a substantial amount of ammonia. The surface of Enceladus indicates that the entire moon has experienced periods of enhanced heat flux in the past.|$|E

50|$|When a body rotates while {{subject to}} <b>tidal</b> forces, {{internal}} <b>friction</b> {{results in the}} gradual dissipation of its rotational kinetic energy as heat. In {{the case for the}} Earth, and Earth's Moon, the loss of rotational kinetic energy results in a gain of about 2 milliseconds per century. If the body is close enough to its primary, this can result in a rotation which is tidally locked to the orbital motion, {{as in the case of}} the Earth's moon. Tidal heating produces dramatic volcanic effects on Jupiter's moon Io. Stresses caused by tidal forces also cause a regular monthly pattern of moonquakes on Earth's Moon.|$|R
2500|$|As mentioned, {{the idea}} of the nebular {{hypothesis}} had been outlined by Immanuel Kant in 1755, and he had also suggested [...] "meteoric aggregations" [...] and <b>tidal</b> <b>friction</b> as causes affecting the formation of the Solar System.

2500|$|The {{main reason}} for the slowing down of the Earth's {{rotation}} is <b>tidal</b> <b>friction,</b> which alone would lengthen the day by 2.3 ms/century. Other contributing factors are {{the movement of the}} Earth's crust relative to its core, changes in mantle convection, and any other events or processes that cause a significant redistribution of mass. These processes change the Earth's moment of inertia, affecting the rate of rotation due to conservation of angular momentum. Some of these redistributions increase earth's rotational speed, shorten the solar day and oppose <b>tidal</b> <b>friction.</b> For example, glacial rebound shortens the solar day by 0.6 ms/century and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is thought to have shortened it by 2.68 microseconds. [...] It is evident from the figure that the Earth's rotation has slowed at a decreasing rate since the initiation of the current system in 1971, and the rate of leap second insertions has therefore been decreasing.|$|E

40|$|For {{one-dimensional}} salt intrusion {{models to}} be predictive, we need predictive equations to link model parameters to observable hydraulic and geometric variables. The one-dimensional model of Savenije (1993 b) {{made use of}} predictive equation for the Van der Burgh coefficient K and the dispersion at the seaward boundary D 0. Here we have improved these equations by using an expanded database, including new previously un-surveyed estuaries. Furthermore, we derived a revised predictive equation for the dispersion at tidal average (TA) condition and with the boundary situated at the well identifiable inflection point where the estuary changes from wave-dominated to tide-dominated geometry. We used 89 salinity profiles in 30 estuaries (including 7 recently studied estuaries in Malaysia), and empirically derived a range of equations using various combinations of dimensionless parameters. We split our data in two separated datasets: (1) with more reliable data for calibration, and (2) with less reliable data for validation. The dimensionless parameters that gave the best performance depended on the geometry, <b>tidal</b> strength, <b>friction</b> and the Richardson Number. The limitation of the equations is that the friction is generally unknown. In order to overcome this problem, a coupling has been made with the analytical hydraulic model of Cai et al.

The mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by Simon Newcomb as the independent unit of time in his Tables of the Sun. These tables were used to calculate the world's ephemerides between 1900 and 1983, so this second became known as the ephemeris second.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} present-day galactic haloes contain a population of massive black holes (MBHs) that form by hierarchical merging of the black hole remnants of the first stars.

We estimate to what extent this process could contribute to the mass of the super-massive black holes (SMBHs) observed in galactic centres today. Many MBHs will not reach the centre of the main halo, however, but continue to orbit within satellite subhaloes. Using a semi-analytical approach that explicitly accounts for dynamical <b>friction,</b> <b>tidal</b> disruption and encounters with the galactic disk, we follow the dynamics of the satellites and their MBHs and determine the abundance and distribution of MBHs in present-day haloes of various masses.

We confirm the validity of some analytic formulae pro-posed earlier based on simple arguments. For rigid satellites represented by softened point masses, the merging time scale depends on both the orbital shape and con-centration of the satellite. The dependence on orbital ellipticity is roughly a power law, as suggested by Lacey & Cole, and the dependence on satellite concentration {{is similar to that}} proposed by White. When merging satellites are represented by non-rigid objects, Tidal effects must be considered. We found that material beyond the tidal radius are stripped off. The decrease in the satellite mass might mean an increase in the merging time scale, but in fact, the merging time is decreased, because the stripped-off material carries away a proportionately larger amount of of orbital energy and angular momentum...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the methodology to include nonlinear evolution, including tidal effects, in the computation of subhalo distribution properties in both cold (CDM) and warm (WDM) dark matter universes. Using semi-analytic modeling, we include effects from dynamical <b>friction,</b> <b>tidal</b> stripping, and tidal heating, {{allowing us to}} dynamically evolve the subhalo distribution. We calibrate our nonlinear evolution scheme to the CDM subhalo mass function in the Aquarius N-body simulation, producing a subhalo mass function {{within the range of}} simulations. We find tidal effects to be the dominant mechanism of nonlinear evolution in the subhalo population. Finally, we compute the subhalo mass function for m_χ= 1. 5 keV WDM including the effects of nonlinear evolution, and compare radial number densities and mass density profiles of subhalos in CDM and WDM models. We show that all three signatures differ between the two dark matter models, suggesting that probes of substructure may be able to differentiate between them.

Thus, the mass-luminosity relation for galaxy groups cannot be described by the same power law as galaxy clusters. A possible explanation for this break is the dynamical <b>friction,</b> <b>tidal</b> interactions and projection effects which reduce the velocity dispersion values of the galaxy groups. By extending the cluster luminosity function to the group regime, we predict the number of groups that new X-ray surveys, particularly eROSITA, will detect.

40|$|We {{further study}} {{the idea that}} a self-gravitating {{accretion}} disc around a supermassive black hole can increase the rate of gradual orbital decay of stellar trajectories (and hence tidal disruption events) by setting some stars on eccentric trajectories.

We examine this process {{as a function of the}} black hole mass and conclude that it is most efficient for intermediate central masses of the order of ∼ 104 Mʘ. Members of the cluster experience the stage of orbital decay via collisions with an accretion disc and by other dissipative processes, such as <b>tidal</b> effects, dynamical <b>friction</b> and the emission of gravitational waves.

There are many dynamic factors that affect the flow characteristics in the estuary. The effect of tide on the generation of <b>tidal</b> current, bottom <b>friction</b> and geometry effect is the focus of this paper. The Wu River estuary is about 15 km in length, with a small bottom slope and no physical obstruction; thus the incident wave at the estuary is considered a progressive wave with damping effect. The amplitude reduction and phase shift of the incident wave are analyzed. By the analysis of celerity reduction factor of the estuary, the estimated value of mean resistance coefficient M (mu, kappa), damping modulus mu, and wave number kappa gathered from on-site observations are applied for validation. Finally, Manning's coefficient for each section of the observation stations can be determined.
