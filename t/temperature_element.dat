The temperature segment covers ambient temperature and surface and bottom temperature for three types of PV generator systems, namely, Fixed Flat (FF), Tracking Flat (TF), and Concentrating PV (CPV) generators. The location of measuring the cell temperature, Tc for the PV module is still being debated by researchers {{with the issue of}} how much the cell temperature (Tc) is being affected by the surface temperature (Ts), bottom temperature (Tb), and surrounding temperature (Ta) furthermore when it is located in fluctuating weather conditions.

The high enthusiasm and green culture {{is based on the}} fact that solar energy source is free, abundance, clean and Malaysia receive approximately 6 hours of sunlight every day the whole year round. This study explores the performance test conditions (PTC) for PV arrays in the tropics based on the direct temperature effect whereby surface temperature (Ts) is implied to the Flat (FF) PV and Tracking Flat (TF) PV array while the concentrating PV (CPV) array implies bottom temperature (Tb) of the Monocrystalline PV module. The field measurement for 10 months results in array efficiency of 3. 04 % for CPV, 10. 04 % for FF and the highest conversion efficiency of 10. 78 % from TF array.

Based on this critical value and field validation, contrarily, it is found that an increase of 1 0 C of direct <b>temperature</b> <b>element</b> results in 3. 3 % of array efficiency increase for CPV, 6. 7 % for TF array and the highest increment of 8. 2 % for FF array...|$|E
40|$|Examined is the vitiated coflow flame, an {{experimental}} condition that decouples the combustion processes of flows found in practical combustors from the associated recirculating fluid mechanics. The configuration {{consists of a}} 4. 57 mm diameter fuel jet into a coaxial flow of hot combustion products from a lean premixed flame. The 210 mm diameter coflow isolates the jet flame from the cool ambient, providing a hot environment similar to the operating conditions of advanced combustors; this important high <b>temperature</b> <b>element</b> is lacking in the traditional laboratory experiments of jet flames into cool (room) air. A family of flows of increasing complexity is presented: 1) nonreacting flow, 2) all hydrogen flame (fuel jet and premixed coflow), and 3) set of methane flames. This sequence of experiments provides a convenient ordering of validation data for combustion models. Laser Raman-Rayleigh-LIF diagnostics at the Turbulent Diffusion Flame laboratory of Sandia National Laboratories produced instantaneous multiscalar point measurements. These results attest to the attractive features of the vitiated coflow burner and the well-defined boundary conditions provided by the coflow. The coflow is uniform and steady, isolating the jet flame from the laboratory air for a downstream distance ranging from z/d = 50 - 70. The statistical results show that differential diffusion effects in this highly turbulent flow are negligible. Complementing the comprehensive set of multiscalar measurements is a parametric study of lifted methane flames that was conducted to analyze flame sensitivity to jet and coflow velocity, as well as coflow temperature. The linear relationship found between the lift-off height and the jet velocity {{is consistent with previous}} experiments. New linear sensitivities were found correlating the lift-off height to coflow velocity and temperature. A blow-off study revealed that the methane flame blows off at a common coflow temperature (1260 K), regardless of coflow or jet velocity. An explanation for this phenomenon is that entrainment of ambient air at the high lift-off heights prevents autoignition. Analysis of the results suggests that flame stabilization occurs through a combination of flame propagation, autoignition, and localized extinction processes. Proposed is an expanded view of distributed reaction combustion based on analysis of the distributions of probe volume conditions at the stabilization region of the lifted hydrogen and methane flames. Turbulent eddies the size of the flame thickness mix fuel and hot coflow across the flame front, thereby enhancing the reaction zone with autoignition of reactants at elevated temperatures; this is the reverse effect of turbulent flames in ambient air, where intense turbulence in cool mixtures result in localized extinction. Each of the three processes (i. e., flame propagation, autoignition and localized extinction) contributes to flame stabilization in varying degrees, depending on flow conditions...|$|E
40|$|The surface air {{temperature}} {{is a significant}} meteorological element in agricultural studies {{and the demand for}} this data has increased. Thus, satisfactory exactness is required, especially over un-sampled areas. Spatial models of surface {{air temperature}} elements were developed for the Peninsular Malaysia region. There were eight environmental variables - elevation, locations (latitude and longitude), and five nearest distances of coastline and four land use types (water bodies, forest, agriculture and built-up) - that are significant to surface air temperature elements, evaluated in this study. A multiple regression model was generated to explain the contributions of these environmental factors for each surface air <b>temperature</b> <b>element.</b> The seasonal and regional roles were also considered in the modelling process. Peninsular Malaysia experiences four seasons; namely, northeast monsoon, spring transition, southwest monsoon and autumn transition. The new regionalization of Peninsular Malaysia was delineated using a multi-step approach by integrating in-situ data for the surface air temperature elements and raster data of Geographical Information System (GIS). The developed climate region divided the area into three regions - West Coast, East Coast and the Main Range. In selecting the most appropriate model, which considered environmental, seasonal and regional factors, four categories of models were developed {{for each of the three}} surface air temperature elements. These categories were ‘all clusters and all seasons’, w_c_s (three models), ‘all clusters and each season’, s (12 models), ‘each cluster and all seasons’, c (nine models) and ‘each cluster and each season’, c_s (36 models). In modelling of surface air temperature elements, analysis of spatial interpolation plays a vital role to produce continuous surface of discrete data, in which all un-sampled values of surface air temperature elements are able to be estimated. In implementing integration of multiple regression models and spatial interpolation technique, the monthly data of T-T’ was generated, in which T was surface air temperature values and T’ was estimated values of the 60 developed models. Interpolation analyses for 70 % of T-T’ monthly data were carried out by applying the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technique, since this technique has been widely used, tested and evaluated. IDW direct interpolation of monthly data for surface air temperature elements was also carried out to examine the effect of environmental factors. Cross validation analysis was conducted by using 30 % of the monthly data to determine the performance of the models. Although the model category for ‘each cluster and each season’ (c_s model category) produced the lowest errors, the model category for ‘each cluster and all seasons’ (c model category) was recommended as the most appropriate model for each of the three surface air temperature elements. The statistical test to determine the differences between two groups, found that there is no significant difference between the performances of both model categories. Furthermore, the selected model category is simple, practical and user friendly. This research discovered that in addition to the environmental factor, the regional factor plays a significant role in estimating the surface air temperature elements of maximum, minimum and mean in Peninsular Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The heat {{unit concept}} of time-temperature {{relationships}} {{is used in}} this thesis {{as a means of}} studying the <b>temperature</b> <b>element</b> of the climate at nine Oregon stations. The stations, Astoria, Baker, Burns, Eugene, Medford, Pendleton, Portland, Roseburg, and Salem, were {{selected on the basis of}} distribution and availability of Weather Bureau data. One table of average daily heat unit totals was compiled for each of five selected threshold temperatures, 30 °, 35 °, 40 °, 45 °, and 50 °F, for each of the nine stations. The method of heat unit computation devised by Lindsey and Newman was considered the best adapted to the aims of this study. An average daily heat unit graph and an annual accumulation graph were prepared for each of the stations. In an effort to note similarities and/or differences in heat unit occurrences in the several parts of Oregon, the following aspects were considered: time of occurrence of maxima and minima, range between maxima and minima, rates of change of heat unit occurrence, rates of heat unit accumulation, and annual heat unit totals. Astoria has the greatest seasonal lag of maxima after the summer solstice, approximately two months, while the remainder of the stations have lags of approximately one month. During the cool season, all stations exhibit a similar lag of about twenty days. Pendleton has the highest maxima at all threshold levels, while Medford has the next highest, followed by Burns, Baker, Portland and Salem, Roseburg, and Eugene, with Astoria having the lowest maxima at all thresholds, Astoria has the highest minima at the 30 °F threshold and eastern Oregon stations have the lowest minima, with Roseburg, the Willamette Valley stations, and Medford being intermediate. Astoria has the smallest range between maxima and minima; the eastern Oregon stations have the greatest range. Ranges at Medford resemble those of the eastern Oregon stations, while Roseburg and the Willamette Valley stations have similar ranges between those for Astoria and the eastern Oregon stations. The eastern Oregon stations have the most rapid rate of increase in daily heat units in the spring and the most rapid rate of decrease in the fall. Astoria has the most gradual rate of change during these two periods, while the Willamette Valley stations are intermediate. Roseburg resembles Portland, Salem, and Eugene, while Medford is more similar to the eastern stations of Pendleton, Baker, and Burns. Pendleton, Medford, Baker, and Burns have the most rapid accumulation rates during the summer, the Willamette Valley stations and Roseburg have intermediate rates, and Astoria the least rapid rate during this period. During the cool season, however, the accumulation curves for Medford and the eastern Oregon stations are not as steep as the others. Medford has the greatest accumulated heat unit total at the 30 °, 35 °, and 40 °F thresholds, with Pendleton having the greatest totals for the 45 ° and 50 °F threshold levels.
