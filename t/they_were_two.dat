5|$|The 199091 {{season was}} Vengloš's only season {{as manager of}} Aston Villa. Their second-place finish the {{previous}} season earned them qualification for the UEFA Cup {{as one of the}} first English clubs to enter European competition after ban resulting from the Heysel Stadium disaster was lifted. They beat first round opponents Baník Ostrava over two legs, and won the first leg of the second round tie against Inter Milan. However, this lead was overturned by Inter in the return leg 30, and Villa were eliminated. The defeat started a decline, and by the end of the season <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> places above the relegation zone. Vengloš stepped down and David Platt was sold to Italian side Bari for £5million. Aston Villa's new manager was Ron Atkinson, who had taken West Bromwich Albion to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup and had won the League Cup with Sheffield Wednesday. In his first season in charge, 199192, Villa finished in sixth place and thus became one of the founder members of the FA Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Vincent first {{appears in}} the December 16, 2004 episode as his alter-ego Valerie Davis. While working as an {{executive}} assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, Valerie is characterized through her connection with the Crane family and past sexual encounter with Chad Harris-Crane. Vincent had fabricated a backstory for Valerie to maintain the illusion that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> separate people. Valerie joins Crane Industries to change its lack of minority employees. Initially appearing as a supporting character, Valerie helps Ivy Winthrop in her attempts to break up Fox Crane and Kay Bennett and supports Chad during their job. She gains more prominence when Eve catches her having sex with Julian; they engage in a catfight with Eve accusing Valerie of using sex to climb the corporate ladder. During this time, Whitney Russell suspects that Valerie is {{having an affair with}} Chad. Vincent is first seen outside of his split-personality when he introduces himself as a tabloid reporter at Chad and Whitney's wedding on December 26, 2006. Whitney sets up Vincent and Valerie as a couple without knowing they are in fact the same person.|$|E

25|$|A colony {{can grow}} {{exceptionally}} fast. Colonies that housed 15–20 workers in May grew to over 7,000 by September. These colonies started to produce reproductive ants {{when they were}} a year old, {{and by the time}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> years old, they had over 25,000 workers. The population doubled to 50,000 when these colonies were three years old. At maturity, a colony can house 100,000 to 250,000 individuals, but other reports suggest that colonies can hold more than 400,000. Polygyne colonies have the potential to grow much larger than monogyne colonies.|$|E

25|$|The {{table of}} results shows some {{relevant}} {{differences in the}} different parts of Italy. The peninsula seemed to be drastically cut in two areas: the North for the republic (with 66.2%), the South for the monarchy (with 63.8%), as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> different, respectively homogeneous countries. Some monarchist groups claimed that there was manipulation by northern republicans, socialists and communists. Others argued that Italy was still too chaotic in 1946 to have an accurate referendum. Regardless, to prevent civil war Umberto II was deposed and a new republic was born with bitter resentment by the new government against the House of Savoy. All male members of the Savoy family were barred from entering Italy in 1948, which was only repealed in 2002.|$|E
25|$|After STW-9 {{entered the}} market, a 'cartel' was formed {{between the two}} {{stations}} for the duty of buying from both Australian and overseas production sources. The two stations set up a separate company, TV Facilities, (50%/50% partners). This allowed the stations to purchase programs cheaper than if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> separate entities, which would bid on shows and subsequently raise prices. This partnership was disliked by Eastern States stations who could not increase their charges to the extent which they would have liked. Allocation of programs was decided by a coin toss, which would allow the winner to pick first and then alternate the picking of programs. However TVW would always be in a more dominant position as it had the rights to continuing shows from the previous six years as well as half of the new programs.|$|E
25|$|One approach, {{suggested}} by {{writers such as}} Stephen D. Unwin, is to treat (particular versions of) theism and naturalism as though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> hypotheses in the Bayesian sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about the world, and {{to suggest that the}} likelihoods of these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other. Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously {{suggested by}} proponents of the arguments that they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the prior probability that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.|$|E

Five of the six tank commanders in the motorized force were hit by Syrian commandos lying {{at the side of the}} road. The reconnaissance company was also hit and its commander was killed. The exchange of fire took place at range of a few yards. In addition to snipers, the Syrians also used Israeli machine guns taken from the outpost after the first battle.|$|E
25|$|Their {{number is}} {{variously}} reported as {{from two to}} five. In the Odyssey, Homer says nothing of their origin or names, but gives {{the number of the}} Sirens as two. Later writers mention both their names and number: some state that there were three, Peisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepeia (Tzetzes, ad Lycophron 7l2; Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E7. 18) or Parthenope, Ligeia, and Leucosia (Eustathius, loc. cit.; Strabo v. §246, 252; Servius' commentary on Virgil's Georgics iv. 562); Apollonius followed Hesiod gives their names as Thelxinoe, Molpe, and Aglaophonos (Scholiast on Homer's Odyssey 12. 168, trans. Evelyn-White); Suidas gives their names as Thelxiepeia, Peisinoe, and Ligeia (Suidas s.v. Seirenas); Hyginus gives the number of the Sirens as four: Teles, Raidne, Molpe, and Thelxiope (Fabulae, praefat. p.30, ed. Bunte); Eustathius (Commentaries §1709) states that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>two,</b> Aglaopheme and Thelxiepeia; An ancient vase painting attests the two names as Himerope and Thelxiepeia. Their individual names are variously rendered in the later sources as Thelxiepeia/Thelxiope/Thelxinoe, Molpe, Himerope, Aglaophonos/Aglaope/Aglaopheme, Pisinoe/Peisinoë/Peisithoe, Parthenope, Ligeia, Leucosia, Raidne, and Teles.|$|E
25|$|On 25 May 1981, 34 {{year old}} Wallace Mercer became {{chairman}} after buying a controlling interested in Hearts for £265 000. Hearts {{had just been}} relegated from the top flight {{for the third time}} in five seasons. The following December (1981), Mercer promoted Alex MacDonald to be Player Manager. At the end of the 1982/83 season Hearts were promoted back to the top flight. This marked an upturn in their fortunes to rejoin the more competitive clubs in Scotland's top flight. The 1985–86 season was their best since 1965. The league campaign started poorly losing five of the first eight games. From there the club went on a 27-game unbeaten league run hitting league top spot on 21 December after a 1–0 win at St Mirren. Hearts needed a draw from the last game of the season away to Dundee on 3 May 1986 to win the Scottish league title. Before that final game <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>two</b> points ahead of Celtic and with a superior goal difference of four goals. However this strong statistical position was undermined in the run up to the game when several players in the Hearts squad were hit by a viral infection. Craig Levein failed to recover to make the game in Dundee.|$|E
