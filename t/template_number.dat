40|$|By using subsets of the HATNet and K 2 (Kepler two-wheel) Campaign 1 databases, {{we examine}} the {{effectiveness}} of filtering out systematics from photometric time series while simultaneously searching for periodic signals. We carry out tests to recover simulated sinusoidal and transit signals added to time series with both real and artificial noise. We find that the simple (and more traditional) method that performs correction for systematics first and signal search thereafter, produces higher signal recovery rates on the average, while also being substantially faster than the simultaneous method. Independently of the method of search, once the signal is found, a far less time consuming full-fledged model, incorporating both the signal and systematics, must be employed to recover the correct signal shape. As a by-product of the tests on the K 2 data, we find that for longer period sinusoidal signals the detection rate decreases (after an optimum value is reached) {{as the number of}} light curves used for systematics filtering increases. The decline of the detection rate is observable in both methods of filtering, albeit the simultaneous method performs better in the regime of relative high <b>template</b> <b>number.</b> We suspect that the observed phenomenon is linked to the increased role of low amplitude intrinsic stellar variability in the space-based data.

40|$|When {{planning}} new wind farms, {{the cost}} for the internal electrical grid is estimated to account for 8 - 9 % of the total investment cost. On top of that, {{the cost for}} accumulated reduced income over several years (due to electrical losses), has to be added. The economic lifespan is relatively long (about 20 years) which means that an error in the loss calculation {{could lead to a}} bad decision basis. The accumulated reduced incomes due to electrical losses can be higher than the initial investment cost for the internal electrical grid. Today, Statkraft Sweden is using a <b>template</b> <b>number</b> when estimating the electrical losses in a wind farm. The actual losses are probably lower than the <b>template</b> <b>number</b> which could lead to an unnecessary high loss cost when planning a new wind farm. The aim of this M. Sc. thesis is to develop a better method than the one currently used to estimate the electrical losses in an early stage of the planning process. With necessary information of the proposed wind farm, an early calculation can be done. The user will then have the option to make changes in the wind farm to minimize losses, long before the wind farm is actually built. In the initial stage of the thesis, the components generating losses was modeled using available literature. Next, a MATLAB-program was constructed where the user could build a proposed wind farm consisting of wind turbines, cables and transformers. The program was named Wind Farm Electric System Calculator (WFESC). Finally, WFESC was verified with measurement data from one of Statkraft’s wind farms in Småland, Sweden. WFESC can simulate the electrical losses and production from a wind farm. The simulation takes turbine information, cable types and transformer specifications into account. The user gets detailed information about the different types of losses which makes it possible to minimize losses in the wind farm. In a comparison, WFESC presents a result that differs 5 % from measured data acquired from one of Statkraft’s wind farms in Sweden. The difference between data produced with WFESC and measured data emerges from approximations done in WFESC and difficulties in estimating cable temperatures in a wind farm. The conclusion is that WFESC estimates the internal electrical losses well and can be used when planning a wind farm...|$|E
40|$|Positive and {{negative}} effects of DNA replication on gene transcription have been documented {{in a variety of}} systems. We examined the effects of the simian virus 40 (SV 40) origin of replication on transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) promoter, using a transient expression assay in COS- 1 cells. The basal activity and Tat transactivation of the HIV promoter were greatly stimulated by the SV 40 origin of replication independent of its position relative to the long terminal repeat. These effects were abolished by mutational inactivation of the SV 40 origin and were reduced by a DNA replication inhibitor. The magnitude of promoter activation exceeded the increment expected from the increase in <b>template</b> <b>number</b> resulting from DNA replication. The SV 40 T-antigen-induced DNA replication augmented the generation of both processive and nonprocessive HIV long terminal repeat-directed transcripts, and Tat primarily enhanced the initiation of those transcripts that were destined to be efficiently elongated.

Do sculptures change in their shape because of the perfect philosophical facts? The importance of the search paper is clear in following up the Greek religious thought through the gods' sculptures, nature and worship practices. So the research contributes, to some extent, to provide a form about the Greek religion and nature. The research also clarifies the Greek philosophy, especially the perfect philosophy, and identify the philosophy effect on the concepts of beauty and art especially the gods' sculptures. It provides a cognitive achievement which contributes to educate searchers in history, art and beliefs because it has useful information about such topics. It contributes to make the students of the fine art college and institutes understand all these aspects. The search goal is identifying the perfect dimension in the rounded sculptures of Greek gods. The search limits are limited to the period extended between the fourth century {{and the first one}} B. C for the Greek State. It is identified in studying the perfect dimensions for the rounded sculptures of Greek gods. The second chapter of the research is about the theoretical frame which includes three topics. The first topic is about following up the perfect dimension in the Greek philosophy, the second one is about Greek perfection, religion and legends. The third topic is about the perfection in the Greek graving. The third chapter includes the search procedures like the sample (65) from the community, 6 templates are chosen purposely to be the sample of the current research. The researcher depends on the descriptive analytic topic that copes with the search nature and the indicators concluded from the theoretical frame of the research that are described as indicators. The last chapter includes the results as 1 - the Greek gods are embodied in different shapes like human (masculine) as in <b>template</b> <b>number</b> (2, 3, 4) and feminine as in template (4, 5) and superstitiously as in <b>template</b> <b>number</b> (1). 2 - the idealism in the rounded sculptures for Greek gods is embodied through the realistic embodiment for human shapes. The Greek sculptor makes a value for the human body (shapes) and tries to reach the genuine idealism by the divine perfection as in templates number (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The researcher provides a number of conclusions like 1 - the variety of the rounded sculptures for Greek gods. 2 - the rounded sculptures for Greek gods have embodied a state of superstitious thinking that is close to the idealism image. This chapter is ended in recommendations that the researcher thinks that must be taken into consideration in the future. Recommendations are represented by 1 - put the topic of idealism for the Greek in the subject of art history and must be supported by pictures 2 - including the artistic topics for the Greek artistic templates and their effect on the next arts and eras.

40|$|The prior {{knowledge}} of the gravitational waveform from compact binary systems makes matched filtering an attractive detection strategy. This detection method involves the filtering of the detector output {{with a set of}} theoretical waveforms or templates. One of the most important factors in this strategy is knowing how many templates are needed {{in order to reduce the}} loss of possible signals. In this study we calculate the number of templates and computational power needed for a one-step search for gravitational waves from inspiralling binary systems. We build on previous works by firstly expanding the post-Newtonian waveforms to 2. 5 -PN order and secondly, for the first time, calculating the number of templates needed when using P-approximant waveforms. The analysis is carried out for the four main first-generation interferometers, LIGO, GEO 600, VIRGO and TAMA. As well as <b>template</b> <b>number,</b> we also calculate the computational cost of generating banks of templates for filtering GW data. We carry out the calculations for two initial conditions. In the first case we assume a minimum individual mass of 1 M_ and in the second, we assume a minimum individual mass of 5 M_. We find that, in general, we need more P-approximant templates to carry out a search than if we use standard PN templates. This increase varies according to the order of PN-approximation, but can be as high as a factor of 3 and is explained by the smaller span of the P-approximant templates as we go to higher masses. The promising outcome is that for 2 -PN templates the increase is small and is outweighed by the known robustness of the 2 -PN P-approximant templates.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{conventional}} PCR, total amplicon yield becomes {{independent of}} starting <b>template</b> <b>number</b> as amplification reaches plateau and varies significantly among replicate reactions. This paper describes {{a strategy for}} reconfiguring PCR so that the signal intensity of a single fluorescent detection probe after PCR thermal cycling reflects genomic composition. The resulting method corrects for product yield variations among replicate amplification reactions, permits resolution of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes based on endpoint fluorescence signal intensities, and readily identifies imbalanced allele ratios equivalent to those arising from gene/chromosomal duplications. Furthermore, the use of only a single colored probe for genotyping enhances the multiplex detection capacity of the assay. Results Two-Temperature LATE-PCR endpoint genotyping combines Linear-After-The-Exponential (LATE) -PCR (an advanced form of asymmetric PCR that efficiently generates single-stranded DNA) and mismatch-tolerant probes capable of detecting allele-specific targets at high temperature and total single-stranded amplicons at a lower temperature in the same reaction. The method is demonstrated here for genotyping single-nucleotide alleles of the human HEXA gene responsible for Tay-Sachs disease and for genotyping SNP alleles near the human p 53 tumor suppressor gene. In each case, the final probe signals were normalized against total single-stranded DNA generated in the same reaction. Normalization reduces the coefficient of variation among replicates from 17. 22 % to as little as 2. 78 % and permits endpoint genotyping with > 99. 7 % accuracy. These assays are robust because they are consistent {{over a wide range}} of input DNA concentrations and give the same results regardless of how many cycles of linear amplification have elapsed. The method is also sufficiently powerful to distinguish between samples with a 1 : 1 ratio of two alleles from samples comprised of 2 : 1 and 1 : 2 ratios of the same alleles. Conclusion SNP genotyping via Two-Temperature LATE-PCR takes place in a homogeneous closed-tube format and uses a single hybridization probe per SNP site. These assays are convenient, rely on endpoint analysis, improve the options for construction of multiplex assays, and are suitable for SNP genotyping, mutation scanning, and detection of DNA duplication or deletions. </p...|$|E

40|$|Humans {{in industrialized}} {{societies}} are continuously {{exposed to a}} plethora of environmental chemicals, of which the long-term consequences are largely unknown. Reduced fertility could be one such undesired consequence, and indeed reduced sperm quality is increasingly reported from many developed countries. Many environmental chemicals induce DNA damage, and sperm DNA damage is associated with reduced sperm quality, disturbed embryo development and early abortions. The present work was aimed at establishing a method to detect sperm DNA damage and to elucidate its impact on fertilization and early embryo development. Specifically we chose to study the widely distributed genotoxic benzo(a) pyrene (B(a) P) and glycidamide (GA; a metabolite of acrylamide), {{that most of us}} are exposed to on a daily basis. Determination of sperm DNA damage is a major challenge and at present there are no established protocols available. A less explored strategy is to assess DNA damage by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The easily accessible mitochondrial genome is more susceptible to DNA damage than the nuclear genome and thus represents a more sensitive target for the identification of sperm DNA damage. The PCR strategy involves a long amplicon (10 kb) for the determination of DNA damage relative to <b>template</b> <b>number</b> determined by a short fragment PCR assay (117 bp), the mitochondrial DNA damage assay (MDDA). The underlying concept is that DNA lesions will inhibit the DNA polymerase which is utilized in the long PCR assay to detect DNA damage: less PCR product equates to more DNA damage. The short PCR also reveals changes in mitochondrial genome numbers. The optimization of the method included determination of suitable DNA isolation and quantification procedures, along with appropriate PCR conditions, subsequently tested in cells exposed in vitro and frozen mouse tissue samples. Sperm and liver were harvested from mice exposed to B(a) P or GA a few days prior to sacrifice. The level of DNA damage in sperm and in liver was assessed by the MDDA. In parallel the sperm was used for in vitro fertilization experiments to determine fertilization rate and early embryo development. The MDDA proved successful in liver samples although more extensive optimization is required in sperm than was permitted within the scope of this MSc-thesis. Exposure to both B(a) P and GA gave rise to reduced fertilization rates with no indications of disturbance of early embryonal development at the doses used. In conclusion the MDDA is a promising tool for measuring DNA damage, and warrants further optimization for use in sperm. Moreover we verify that exposure to ubiquitous genotoxic agents influence fertilization...|$|E

Subsequently, we analyze the Jacobi linearization of the system evaluated at the equilibria in order to show that the equilibria are asymptotically stable relative to certain affine subspaces.

Regional museum hubs are a cluster of four-five museums which receive government investment {{in order to develop}} as centres of excellence and as leaders of their regional museum communities. MLA has been gathering data from the nine regional museum hubs from 2002 - 2003 to 2007 - 2008. The Renaissance Data Collection is a quarterly return of data from each site participating in the Renaissance in the Regions Programme. The data returns contain information on numbers of: visits; priority group visits; child visits; website visits; school visits; Higher Education visits; adult and child on-site participation; and outreach activity. The data returns support Programme management and monitoring and forms the basis of the Renaissance Museums Performance Indicator statistical series. From the 30 th June 2011, the regional Renaissance hub structure ceases to exist. 2011 - 12 is a transitional year for Renaissance, in which £ 37. 6 million of grant funding, previously known as museum hub funding, has been made available instead directly to 45 museum services.
