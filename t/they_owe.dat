50|$|Later that year, Ulster County's {{representatives in}} the Assembly {{were trying to get}} the county out of a {{crushing}} property tax debt a court had ruled <b>they</b> <b>owed</b> the state.

60|$|And {{his appeal}} to the Corinthians is a direct {{appeal to the}}ir honour: not to fears of any punishment, or wrath of God, but to the respect which <b>they</b> <b>owed</b> to {{themselves}} {{as members of a}} body, the Church of Corinth; and to the respect which <b>they</b> <b>owed</b> to that body as a whole, and which they had disgraced by allowing an open scandal in it.|$|R

5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money <b>they</b> <b>owe</b> to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E

25|$|A {{tax credit}} {{is a tax}} {{incentive}} which allows certain taxpayers to subtract {{the amount of the}} credit they have accrued from the total <b>they</b> <b>owe</b> the state.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, a {{tradition}} of more literary science fiction novels, treating with a dissonance between perceived Utopian conditions and the full expression of human desires, began to develop: the dystopian novel. For some time, the science fictional elements of these works were ignored by mainstream literary critics, though <b>they</b> <b>owe</b> a much greater debt to the science fiction genre than the modernists do. Sincerely Utopian writing, including much of Wells, has also deeply influenced science fiction, beginning with Hugo Gernsback's Ralph 124C 41+.|$|E
25|$|We, the Hebrews, {{descendants}} of the ancient Hebrew nation, who remained alive on God's earth despite that great calamity that our people have experienced, have come together in the Hebrew Committee of National Liberation. The Jews today {{who live in the}} European hell together with the Jews in the Land of Israel constitute the Hebrew nation—there isn't another nation to which <b>they</b> <b>owe</b> their allegiance but the Hebrew nation. We must state it clearly: the Jews in the United States do not belong to the Hebrew nation. These Jews are Americans of Hebrew descent.|$|E
25|$|A {{player who}} cannot pay what <b>they</b> <b>owe</b> is {{bankrupt}} and {{eliminated from the}} game. If the bankrupt player owes the bank, they must turn all of their assets over to the bank, who then auctions off their properties (if they have any), except buildings. If the debt is instead to another player, all the assets are instead given to that opponent, but the new owner must still pay the bank to un-mortgage any such properties received. The winner is the remaining player left after all the others have gone bankrupt.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom <b>they</b> <b>owe</b> the {{abundance}} of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an assaron for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest {{for the use of the}} priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest. Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century {{collection}} ranks {{second in}} terms of importance for a French museum after the National Museum of Modern Art. As for the paintings, <b>they</b> <b>owe</b> much to {{the policy of the}} curator Andry-Farcy. In 1923, the legacy of Agutte-Sembat brought in 24 drawings including a charcoal sketch of The Dance by Matisse in 1909. Other than Matisse (with 28 works in all) the collection includes drawings by: Jean Arp, Antonin Artaud, Pierre Bonnard, Alexander Calder, Marc Chagall, Jean Cocteau, André Derain (Portrait of Francis Carco), Raoul Dufy (68 works), Max Ernst, Leonard Foujita, Julio Gonzalez, Juan Gris, František Kupka, Le Corbusier, Fernand Léger, Alberto Magnelli, Albert Marquet, André Masson, Joan Miró, Amedeo Modigliani, Pablo Picasso (Glass, glued paper from 1914 acquired in 2012), Kurt Schwitters, Paul Signac, Cy Twombly, Suzanne Valadon, Maurice de Vlaminck, Édouard Vuillard, and Ossip Zadkine.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{is again}} {{on the run from}} Ashby and the miners. Nick and Rance are {{discussing}} Johnson and wonder what Minnie sees in him when Ashby arrives in triumph: Johnson has been captured. Rance and the miners all want Johnson to be hanged. Johnson accepts the sentence and only asks the miners not to tell Minnie about his capture and his fate ("Ch'ella mi creda"). Minnie arrives, armed with a pistol, just before the execution and throws herself in front of Johnson to protect him. While Rance tries to proceed, she convinces the miners that <b>they</b> <b>owe</b> her too much to kill the man she loves, and asks them to forgive him ("Ah! Ah! E Minnie!"). One by one, the miners yield to her plea ("E anche tu lo vorrai, Joe"). Rance is not happy but finally he too gives in. Sonora unties Johnson and sets him free. The miners bid Minnie farewell ("Le tue parole sono di Dio"). Minnie and Johnson leave California {{to start a new life}} together.|$|E

500|$|In 2011 Steve Ignorant {{embarked}} on an international tour, entitled [...] "The Last Supper". He performed Crass material, culminating with a final performance at the Shepherds Bush Empire on 19 November. Ignorant {{said that this was}} the last time he would sing the songs of Crass, with Rimbaud's support; the latter joined him onstage for a drum-and-vocal rendition of [...] "Do <b>They</b> <b>Owe</b> Us A Living", bringing the band's career full circle after 34 years: [...] "And then Penny came on...and we did it, 'Do <b>They</b> <b>Owe</b> Us A Living' as we'd first done it all those years ago. As it started, so it finished". Ignorant's lineup for the tour were Gizz Butt, Carol Hodge, Pete Wilson and Spike T. Smith, and he was joined by Eve Libertine for a number of songs.

500|$|Jefferson {{had written}} a {{separate}} letter to Shelby warning him against aiding the French schemes and informing him that negotiations were under way with the Spanish regarding trade on the Mississippi. When the letter was sent on August 29, 1793, it was Jefferson's intent that it reach Shelby before Michaux did, but Shelby did not receive it until October 1793. On September 13, 1793, Michaux met with Shelby, {{but there is no}} evidence that Shelby agreed to help him. In his response to Jefferson's delayed letter, Shelby assured Jefferson that Kentuckians [...] "possess too just a sense of the obligation <b>they</b> <b>owe</b> the General Government, to embark in any enterprise that would be so injurious to the United States".|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} based around Dial House, an open-house {{community}} near Epping, Essex, and formed when Dial House founder Penny Rimbaud began jamming with Steve Ignorant (who was {{staying in the}} house at the time). Ignorant was inspired to form a band after seeing The Clash perform at Colston Hall in Bristol, whilst Rimbaud, a veteran of avant garde performance art groups such as EXIT and Ceres Confusion, was working on his book Reality Asylum. They produced [...] "So What?" [...] and [...] "Do <b>They</b> <b>Owe</b> Us A Living?" [...] as a drum-and-vocal duo.

[...] Al-Sharif said that the women prisoners were mostly domestic workers who remained in prison after completing their prison terms, {{because they could not}} pay their debts and because their former Saudi employers did not help to release them or fund their flights to return to their countries of origin. She referred to 22 Indonesian women and named four women needing help and stated the amount of their debts. She called for donations to be made directly to the director of the Dammam women's prison in order to reimburse the women's debts and free them.|$|E
