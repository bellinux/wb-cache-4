40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{the role of the}} size and {{duration}} of unemployment insurance on welfare in a dynamic economy with precautionary savings. We consider three instruments of economic policy: the replacement ratio, the duration of UI benefits and <b>the</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>conditions.</b> We show that an increase of the duration with a reduction of the replacement ratio improve the welfare. Low replacement ratio for first months of unemployment is not costly in terms of welfare, as the eligible unemployed workers have precautionary savings to decumulate. ...|$|E

These conditionalities have important implications, {{which can be}} seen by considering the limiting case of a participation requirement for an unemployment benefit recipient. That is, there is a requirement to participate in some programme to claim benefits. For the sake of argument, it is assumed that participation does not affect qualifications but only serves as an availability test. Participation in such a programme increases the opportunity costs of receiving benefits, which reduces both adverse selection and moral hazard problems related to individual search incentives.|$|E

40|$|After {{presenting}} {{an extensive}} {{overview of the}} reforms undertaken in the EU between 1990 and 2006, The paper assess with a diff-in-diff technique the short-term effects of pension reforms on the participation rates of individuals aged between 50 and 64 years. The analysis suggests that in the short-term pension reforms have different effects on the participation rate of men and women. First, reforms tightening the access to early retirement {{have a positive effect}} on female participation, but reduce somewhat male participation rates. Second, the results for non-fundamental reforms are more uncertain. Third, reforms that change the way of financing pensions or <b>the</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>conditions</b> (what we dubbed fundamental reforms), usually with long phasing-in periods, may have unintended short-run effects on the female participation rate. Thus, our findings point at the importance of designing pension reforms and strategies to reform social security that reduce the risks of undesired effects on the decision to remain in the labour market.

40|$|A key policy {{question}} {{in most countries}} is how to ensure a high employment rate. At {{the same time the}} financing of the public sector is being challenged, in particular due to demographic shifts. The former seems to call for lower taxes, and the later for higher taxes, and hence a difficult policy conundrum is left. Recent debates have suggested that taxation is very detrimental to labour force participation and employment. However, some countries- notably the Scandinavian- stand out as contradictions to this view since they have managed to sustain high labour force participation despite high tax rates and a generous social safety net. This paper considers the experience of European countries and Scandinavia and asks whether Scandinavian countries are outliers, and what accounts for the ability to reconcilce high taxes and a generous social safety net with a high labour force particiaption rate. It is argued that while the social safety net is relatively generous it is also very conditional in the sense that benefits cannot be claimed unconditionally and there is a substantial employment focus in <b>the</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>conditions</b> underlying key welfare arrangements. ∗Paper prepared as part of the DG ECFIN Visiting Fellows Programme.

40|$|Recent {{demographic}} changes have spurred pension reforms aimed at restoring the financial sustainability of PAYG systems. In Spain, {{the most significant}} reforms were undertaken in 1997 and in 2002, entailing {{an increase in the}} length of the averaging period in the pension formula, an increase in the penalties for early retirement and for retirement with short contributive records, a bonus for retirement after the age of 65, and a change in <b>the</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this paper we use an Applied General Equilibrium model populated by two-earners households to evaluate the redistributive impact of the pension system and the financial and welfare consequences of these reforms on households that differ in their education, region of residence and year of birth. The initial redistribution is assessed by comparing the internal rate of return provided to different households. We find that they vary considerable depending on education and cohort. Regarding the reforms, we find an increase in the implicit debt of the pension system after the reforms, and important changes in welfare. Households up to secondary education born between 1935 and 1975 are predicted to benefit from the reform, while the welfare of younger cohorts will be hit by higher taxes and unfavorable macroeconomic changes.

40|$|Availability of (partial) {{insurance}} mechanisms {{is arguably}} {{important for the}} decision of (riskaverse) workers to start up a risky entrepreneurial venture. Using administrative data from Denmark, where unemployment insurance (UI) is available to both wage earners and self-employed on a voluntary basis, we estimate the causal effect of UI cover on the self-employment choice of wage earners after instrumenting for the UI choice. The instruments we use {{are based on a}} series of policy variations that took place at three points in time during an observation period spanning three decades: only UI covered individuals could under certain conditions qualify for an early retirement (ER) program. Changes (reforms) in <b>the</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>conditions</b> of the program that affected different age groups differentially at these three different points in time identify the UI choice process. Results show that the causal effect of insurance on the probability of starting up a venture is positive for would-be entrepreneurs, in contrast to correlations in the data or uninstrumented estimates. Using firm data, we also investigate how the newly insurance-induced entrepreneurs fare relative to their uninsured peers. Results suggest that they survive longer, but are not more likely to employ any workers or to make higher or lower profits...|$|E

40|$|In most {{developed}} countries the insurance against involuntary unemployment is a pivotal policy {{for supporting the}} income of workers. In Italy, it has just a marginal role; furthermore, it is currently questioned for the very low coverage it grants to its target population. In this paper we show that the weaknesses and inconsistencies {{in the design of}} the Ordinary Unemployment Benefit (oub), the main unemployment insurance measure in Italy, are even more serious. Exploiting an original database tracing the transitions in and out of the measure, we are able to show that what should be considered its proper use – a benefit granted for episodes of frictional unemployment – accounts for just half of the cases. The other half is absorbed by seasonal work, «permanently precarious» work in the public sector, and temporary layoffs. In the latter case, oub is used as a substitute for the measure specifically targeted to temporary layoffs (the Cassa Integrazione Guadagni) when <b>the</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>conditions</b> for it are not met, this way hampering the effectiveness of those conditions. Furthermore, it appears that a large share of individuals eligible for oub do opt for a competing measure, nearly equivalent in terms of benefit but not conditional on job search and availability for work – a crucial requirement for oub recipiency, again this way neutralizing its effectiveness. Finally, with a simple accounting micro-simulation we show how the documented (mis) uses of oub do imply a structural imbalance between contributions and benefits across different categories of workers. This evidence raises both equity and financial sustainability issues, that we briefly discuss...|$|E
40|$|The {{short time}} left until the EU {{accession}} date, {{has become a}} strong pressure factor for the speeding up of the necessary restructuring processes of the agrifood sector and rural areas.

In the same time the sector also has to be to be “morally” prepared for the exigencies and potential shocks {{due to the lack of}} competitiveness after entering the Single Market and this activity has to be also a priority.

The cost/benefits estimations in this document are based on a very simplistic approach. The scenario proposed starts from the optimistic hypothesis that, until 2007 Romania will be fully prepared from institutional point of view, as well as from point of view of the requirements regarding food security, animal welfare, the environment's state etc., and it will be able to produce at the level established by negotiations, fulfilling 100 % <b>the</b> <b>eligibility</b> <b>conditions,</b> and Romania will enter on the Single Market with the negotiated elements (quotas, basic areas, reference productions, etc.).

We interpret this as evidence of the existence of an income effect conditional on business cycle conditions. The coefficient for the unemployment exit for individuals that have contributed between 15 + and 25 years is not significant.|$|R
