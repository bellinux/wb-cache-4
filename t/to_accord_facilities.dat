In an open network environment, secret session key needs to be shared between two users before it establishes a secret communication [7, 16, 17, 18]. As the number of users in the network is increasing, key distribution will become a serious problem. The public key cryptosystem can effectively solve the session key distribution problem in an open network environment, but each user should authenticate the public key of the partner before using it. The public key infrastructure (PKI) is proposed to implement the authentication of the public key, but it leads to large management overheads.|$|R
