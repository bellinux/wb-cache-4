40|$|Extreme wind {{events such}} as {{tropical}} cyclones, tornadoes and storms {{are more likely to}} impact the Australian coastal regions due to possible climate changes. Such events can be extremely destructive to building structures, in particular, low-rise buildings with lightweight roofing systems that are commonly made of thin steel roofing sheets and battens. Large wind uplift loads that act on the roofs during high wind events often cause premature roof connection failures. Recent wind damage investigations have shown that roof failures have mostly occurred at the batten to rafter or <b>truss</b> <b>screw</b> connections. In most of these cases, the screw fastener heads pulled through the bottom flanges of thin steel roof battens. This roof connection failure is very critical as both roofing sheets and battens will be lost during the high wind events. Hence, a research study was conducted to investigate this critical pull-through failure using both experimental and numerical methods. This paper presents the details of numerical modeling and the results...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the application of methodology and tools of inverse analysis in regards to probabilistic design of selected design parameters of structure. The {{first step was to}} get familiar with the probabilistic design and analysis, then understanding of the inverse analysis methodology itself which is based on artificial neural networks. After researching the topic we could get to the actual issue. To put the theory in practice easier examples were used at first. These were mathematical functions and one practical-based example, whereas the results were known in advance. This simplified a process of checking achieved values. Using software tools and especially DLNNET software allowed us to take on practical exercises. Used exercises are chosen from earlier undergraduate studies at the Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno. The first of these was a design of reinforced concrete slab, where desired parameters were slabâ€™s height and area of reinforcement. The second one was a design of a diagonal <b>truss</b> <b>screw</b> connection, aimed to size the screw diameter and its quantity...|$|E
50|$|To provide {{adjustable}} relief, most guitars have {{an adjustable}} truss rod. Some guitars, such as certain older Guild 12-strings, have two parallel truss rods. Turning the <b>truss</b> rod <b>screw</b> changes {{the tension of}} the truss rod, and thus the relief. Novice players should not attempt this, as the guitar neck can easily be damaged or broken.|$|R
40|$|Recent extreme wind {{events such}} as {{tropical}} cyclones and severe storms have shown that thin steel roof battens fail prematurely at their screw connections to the rafters or <b>trusses.</b> The <b>screw</b> heads connecting the bottom flanges of thin steel roof battens to the rafters or trusses often pull through the roof batten bottom flanges. Since such localised pull-through failures occur in the lower level of roof connections, they often cause {{the loss of the}} entire roofing system during extreme wind events. Therefore detailed experimental and numerical studies were conducted at the Queensland University of Technology, and suitable test, design and strengthening methods were developed to accurately design the roof batten to rafter/truss connections and to enhance the roof batten performances under wind uplift loads. However, the levels of possible damages at community level due to the pull-through failures of roof battens are still unknown. Therefore fragility curves were developed in this study to determine the likely level of roof damage during extreme wind events, based on the governing pull-through failures of thin steel roof battens. Detailed probabilistic analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for this purpose. Fragility curves were also used to evaluate the effects of roof batten span and spacing and, levels of enhancement that could be achieved with the strengthening method proposed for roof battens. This paper presents the details of this study on the development of fragility curves and the results...|$|R
