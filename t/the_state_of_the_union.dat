25|$|Wilson pioneered twice-weekly press {{conferences}} in the White House.

25|$|The House of Representatives Chamber has 448 {{permanent}} seats. Unlike Senators, Representatives do {{not have}} assigned seats.

25|$|Although {{much of the}} {{pomp and}} {{ceremony}} behind <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> address is governed by tradition rather than law, in modern times, the event is seen {{as one of the}} most important in the US political calendar. It is one of the few instances when all three branches of the US government are assembled under one roof: members of both houses of Congress constituting the legislature, the President's Cabinet constituting the executive, and the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court constituting the judiciary. In addition, the military is represented by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while foreign governments are represented by the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps. The address has also been used as an opportunity to honor the achievements of some ordinary Americans, who are typically invited by the President to sit with the First Lady.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution's Ineligibility Clause {{prevents}} the President (and all other executive officers) from simultaneously {{being a member}} of Congress. Therefore, the president cannot directly introduce legislative proposals for consideration in Congress. However, the president can take an indirect role in shaping legislation, especially if the president's political party has a majority in one or both houses of Congress. For example, the president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated, periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, but today are given as <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> address, which often outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.|$|E

25|$|If an {{observable}} {{is measured}} {{and the result}} is a certain eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenvector is <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system immediately after the measurement. <b>The</b> act <b>of</b> measurement in matrix mechanics 'collapses' <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system.

Tunny soon exposes the do-nothing go-nowhere quicksand of their lives ("City of the Damned"). They get riled up, and Johnny challenges his friends to engage ("I Don't Care"). Will's girlfriend, Heather, soon makes an appearance. She is pregnant and doesn't know what to do ("Dearly Beloved"). Johnny borrows money and buys bus tickets to the city for the three young men, eager to escape suburbia. Before the boys are able to leave, Heather tells Will of her pregnancy. With no other choice, he stays home ("Tales of Another Broken Home"). Johnny and Tunny depart for the city with a group of other jaded youths ("Holiday").|$|E
