5|$|In the {{two main}} engagements, the fighter losses had been about equal. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> was the bombers losses. Fighter Command had had greater success against the {{afternoon}} attack rather than the morning assault, which it out numbered 2:1. The ratio of German fighters to bombers had been 3:1 in the morning but 5:1 in the afternoon, so there were more targets. The more bombers Kesselring sent, the more were lost.|$|E
500|$|For Anita Gates in the New York Times, [...] "the film's strongest message" [...] is [...] "a {{questioning}} of the actor's trade."

You don't have a lot of support from the ground. You really are on your own." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{great thing}} about Kylie is that she differs from other celebrities. There is a {{separation}} between how celebrities perceive themselves and what the public wants to see. Most are concerned with reproducing a certain logo or caricature of themselves. They want to cling on to an image developed years ago which makes things difficult {{because there is no}} room to take a picture, you aren't really forced to improvise which is when the best things happen. Every photographer has their own very personal vision of her, and she lets them have it. That is <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> with Kylie, that she walks in and says 'This is me, {{what are you going to}} do with it.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{problems}} have beset {{the use of}} groundwater around the world. Just as river waters have been over-used and polluted {{in many parts of}} the world, so too have aquifers. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> is that aquifers are out of sight. The other major problem is that water management agencies, when calculating the [...] "sustainable yield" [...] of aquifer and river water, have often counted the same water twice, once in the aquifer, and once in its connected river. This problem, although understood for centuries, has persisted, partly through inertia within government agencies. In Australia, for example, prior to the statutory reforms initiated by the Council of Australian Governments water reform framework in the 1990s, many Australian states managed groundwater and surface water through separate government agencies, an approach beset by rivalry and poor communication.|$|E

2500|$|Another event dubbed a [...] "Battle of the Sexes" [...] {{took place}} during the 1998 Australian Open between Karsten Braasch and the Williams sisters. Venus and Serena Williams had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world's top 200, so Braasch, then ranked 203rd, {{challenged}} them both. Braasch was described by one journalist as [...] "a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple bottles of ice cold lager". The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park, after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5–0, beat her 6–1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6–2. Braasch said afterwards, [...] "500 and above, no chance". He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th {{in order to keep the}} game [...] "fun". Braasch said <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> was that men can chase down shots much easier, and that men put spin on the ball that the women can't handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson shares five co-writing credits on Piece by Piece, as she {{explained}} her pregnancy prevented her from writing more material. She recalled: [...] "It {{was the first}} time I didn't really feel inspired, because I was so sick, but I didn't feel like writing anymore. <b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> for this recording was collecting from other writers I'm inspired by." [...] The album opens with [...] "Heartbeat Song", produced by Greg Kurstin and written by Kara DioGuardi, Jason Evigan, Audra Mae, and Mitch Allan. Clarkson described the track as a song that could have fit on Stronger but was a little more progressive, and said that the track serves as a bridge connecting Stronger to Piece by Piece. Produced by Jesse Shatkin, [...] "Invincible" [...] follows as the second song of empowerment, written by Sia, Shatkin, Steve Mostyn, and Warren Felder. Clarkson had originally intended the song to be recorded as a duet with Sia, but RCA ultimately decided to keep Sia's vocals uncredited to avoid competition with her studio album 1000 Forms of Fear (2014), as both were on the same label. The last song recorded for Piece by Piece, Shatkin sent the song to Clarkson, saying: [...] "Sia and I just wrote this song and you've gotta hear it. I know you're finished with the record but you've gotta hear it", to which she quickly agreed. The third track, [...] "Someone", is a non-apology apology song written by Matthew Koma and produced by Kurstin. [...] "Take You High", the fourth track, was written with Mozella and produced by Shatkin, who described it as [...] "an electronic banger" [...] and [...] "a little left-of-center", but also having a haunting melody that he thought Clarkson was attracted to.|$|E
