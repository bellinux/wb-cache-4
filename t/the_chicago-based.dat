5|$|One of the {{individuals}} that Hergé could have learned about through Blanchard's article was <b>the</b> <b>Chicago-based</b> American gangster Al Capone. In the preceding story, Tintin in the Congo, Capone had been introduced as a character within the series.

Capone was one of only two real-life individuals to be named in The Adventures of Tintin, and was the only real-life figure to appear as a character in the series. In the original version, Hergé avoided depicting him directly, either illustrating the back of his head, or hiding his face behind a scarf; this was altered in the second version, in which Capone's face was depicted. It is not known if Capone ever learned about his inclusion in the story, although during initial serialisation he would have been preoccupied with his trial and ensuing imprisonment.|$|E
