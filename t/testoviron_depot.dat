Groupers coUectedfrom the wild and harvested from the culture ponds were raised to broodstock in 10 x 5 X 2. 3 m (net water capacity of 100 tons) R. C. C. tanks by feeding with freshly killed sardines, cod liver oil and vitamin tablets. E^erimental rearing ofjmgerluigs was carried out in 30 ton tank. In broodstock rearing, the growth rate variedfrom 10. 1 mm/ 106. 8 g to 13. 1 mm/ 178. 3 g Jor the wild and 16. 6 mm/ 116. 8 g to 21. 1 mm/ 271. 5 g for the pond harvested stock with a feed conversion ratio of 4. 6 - 7. 7 and 3. 2 - 3. 5 respectively. Maximum growth increments of 27. 2 mm/ 404 g and 25. 5 nvn/ 305 g have been realisedfor the wild and pond harvested stock respectively. In general, pond harvested groupers showed higher growth with less conversion ratio. The fingerlings registered a growth rate of 24 mm/ 42 g with a conversion ratio of 10. Preliminary experiments on sex reversal using androgen hornvone (<b>Testoviron</b> <b>Depot</b> containing Testosterone Enanthate) revealed the possibility of converting female to male by the indication of regression in ovary size and disappearance of oocytes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cholesterol {{is mainly}} {{synthesised}} in liver and the rate-limiting step is {{the reduction of}} 3 -hydroxy- 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, a reaction catalysed by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). There is a comprehensive body of evidence documenting that anabolic-androgenic steroids are associated with deleterious alterations of lipid profile. In this study we investigated whether a single dose of testosterone enanthate affects the cholesterol biosynthesis and the expression of HMGCR. Methods 39 healthy male volunteers were given 500 mg testosterone enanthate as single intramuscular dose of <b>Testoviron</b> Â® [...] <b>Depot.</b> The total cholesterol levels prior to and two days after testosterone administration were analysed. Protein expression of HMGCR in whole blood was investigated by Western blotting. In order to study whether testosterone regulates the mRNA expression of HMGCR, in vitro studies were performed in a human liver cell-line (HepG 2). Results The total cholesterol level was significantly increased 15 % {{two days after the}} testosterone injection (p = 0. 007). This is the first time a perturbation in the lipoprotein profile is observed after only a single dose of testosterone. Moreover, the HMGCR mRNA and protein expression was induced by testosterone in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Conclusion Here we provide a molecular explanation how anabolic androgenic steroids may impact on the cholesterol homeostasis, i. e. via an increase of the HMGCR expression. Increasing knowledge and understanding of AAS induced side-effects is important in order to find measures for treatment and care of these abusers. </p...|$|R
