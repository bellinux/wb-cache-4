When Hibiki makes a mistake, Misaki lectures her and informs her how {{a member of the}} faculty should act, even when it may not entirely be her fault. Due to Hibiki's low magical experience, Misaki worries about Hibiki succeeding {{as a member of the}} staff. Like Hibiki, Misaki cannot perform magic, though she still has a vast knowledge of magic at her disposal. She had been adopted by a man that constantly abused her and the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> cheer her up was a book from a magic user. She had been saved by Asuma and hopes to be of use to him.|$|E

Ayers stated that touring with Vendetta Red was the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> have {{happened}} to the band, comparing it to touring with the band Green Day. He expressed that touring with a band with a similar style and an already established fanbase would influence the band members positively.|$|E

Not long after, Booster Gold {{appeared}} at Jaime's house to retrieve it, {{but it had}} fused itself to Jaime's spine while he was sleeping. Booster recruited Jaime for Batman's assault on the Brother Eye satellite, since the scarab was the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> see the satellite. Using the scarab's powers, Jaime was able to reveal the satellite to Batman's group, enabling them to defeat it. Once Brother Eye was sent plummeting Earthward, Jaime disappeared from the ship, teleported away by the scarab, which sought to escape the Green Lanterns on board.|$|E

At a cabin, while a storm goes on outside, Babe helps Bianca give birth to her baby daughter, Miranda Montgomery. Bianca falls unconscious and Babe leaves to go get help. She breaks into Dr. David Hayward's cabin and calls Paul at Llanview Hospital for help. The day before (on One Life to Live), Paul helped his sister, Kelly, {{give birth to a}} baby boy, but the baby died right after birth. Kelly, believing a baby would be the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> save her marriage, begged her brother to get her a child.

25|$|The {{departure}} in 1979 of animators Don Bluth, Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy, {{along with}} a further four animators and four assistant animators from Disney's feature animation studio, caused a considerable disturbance in the animation industry. The 11 animators who left represented about 17% of the studio's animation staff, a loss that delayed the release of The Fox and the Hound by six months. Ron W. Miller, the president and CEO of The Walt Disney Company at the time, remarked that although the timing of their departure was unfortunate, it was “possibly the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> happen to our animation group”. Bluth expressed concerns that as Disney's productions became more technically advanced, the story seemed to lose importance. The aim of his new studio was to “return animation to its glorious past”, concentrating on strong stories, and using traditional animation techniques that {{had fallen out of}} favour at Disney. Animation historian Jerry Beck observed that Don Bluth Productions was clearly set up in direct opposition to Disney; even Aurora Productions, who backed the studio's first feature, The Secret of NIMH, was made up of former Disney executives.|$|E

Barbauld's father prompted many such tributes, although Lucy Aikin {{described him as}} excessively modest and reserved. Barbauld developed a strong bond with her brother during childhood, standing in as a mother figure to him; they eventually became literary partners. In 1817, Joanna Baillie commented of their relationship [...] "How few brothers and sisters have been to one another {{what they have been}} through so long a course of years!" ...|$|E

[...] Some saw his entrance in the race {{as an attempt to}} split the African American vote. However, O'Malley received endorsements from prominent African American politicians in August, including Rawlings, fellow state Delegate Kenneth Montague, and Conway. Rawlings credited O'Malley's [...] "track record of empowering black Americans." [...] He also received an endorsement from Schaefer. Some African Americans charged Rawlings with [...] "stabbing us in the back" [...] over the endorsement.|$|E

Mackenzie King wrote in his diary on 8 December 1936 that Edward's [...] "sense of right or wrong has been largely obliterated by the jazz of life he has led for years" [...] and, upon receiving news of Edward's final decision to abdicate, [...] "if {{that is the kind of}} man he is it is better he should not be longer on the Throne." [...] Edward's own Assistant Private Secretary, Alan Lascelles, had told Baldwin as early as 1927: [...] "I can't help thinking that the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> happen to him, and to the country, would be for him to break his neck." ...|$|E

Albacete {{teammate}} Miquel Buades suggested that those key attributes made him [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> happen to a forward". His coach at both Albacete and Atlético, César Ferrando, said {{he had all the}} qualities needed for his position, which included anticipation and the intelligence to keep things simple. Again according to Ferrando, Pablo rarely fouled, because [...] "he doesn't need to. He has a whole arsenal of defensive resources." [...] A 2006 World Cup profile suggested he was [...] "much happier on the ball than first impressions may suggest", and could look [...] "ungainly". A scout's assessment of his running style as [...] "ugly" [...] reportedly discouraged Real Madrid from pursuing an early interest in him.|$|E
500|$|With John Winchester {{making a}} demonic pact {{in the second}} season première, it was decided early on that the season would also end with another demonic pact. This {{required}} the writers to kill Sam—they felt {{it was the only}} <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> motivate Dean to sell his soul—with the pact becoming one of the driving forces behind the third season. At the same time, it opened up another new storyline by questioning if what returned was [...] "one hundred percent pure Sam". Additionally, the [...] "war of demons against humanity"—hinted at throughout the first two seasons—finally started with the release of demons through the Devil's Gate {{at the end of the}} second episode. This plotline continues throughout the rest of the series, with the Winchesters attempting to hunt down the demons in the third season.|$|E

Despite noting that it is [...] "a totally serviceable episode of Adventure Time", {{he argued that the}} episode felt too much like an episode from the show's first or second seasons, when installments were often lacking in depth and a bit more uneven across the board. He noted that, [...] "Tonight’s episode is for the kids. It’s simple and easy to follow, and doesn’t contain any unsettling imagery … but that also prevents it from being especially memorable." [...] Ultimately, he felt that the show's returned fixation on Finn and Jake proved that the expansion of the show's universe was [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> have happened to it." ...|$|E

In {{his review of}} the album, Allmusic's Steve Huey wrote [...] "There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well with late-'90s metal and punk fans." [...] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "We had these romantic visions of the music industry, and {{we thought it would be}} cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also probably the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> have happened.

500|$|Written in spare language, [...] "A slumber did {{my spirit}} seal" [...] {{consists}} of two stanzas, each four lines long. The first stanza is built upon even, soporific movement in which figurative language conveys the nebulous image of a girl who [...] "seemed a <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not feel / The touch of earthly years". The second maintains the quiet and even tone of the first but serves to undermine its sense of the eternal by revealing that Lucy has died and that the calmness of the first stanza represents death. The narrator's response to her death lacks bitterness or emptiness; instead he takes consolation {{from the fact that}} she is now beyond life's trials, and [...] "at last...in inanimate community with the earth's natural fixtures". The lifeless rocks and stones depicted in the concluding line convey the finality of Lucy's death.|$|E

With this Lasance later reaffirmed his belief that [...] "no matter what {{there is always a}} deep-rooted connection that can't be broken" [...] between Aden and Belle.

He became a fascist, plotting {{to gain control of}} the United States and use his enormous influence to turn Americans to fascist ideals. She shows O'Malley papers stored in the arsenal which reveal how Forrest (backed by secretive, ultra-wealthy, power-hungry individuals) planned to use racism, anti-union feeling, and antisemitism to divide the country, turning one group against another if it became too powerful to control, in order to create the chaos that would let him seize power. Christine discovered the plot the day before her husband's death. She went riding the next morning and came upon the washed-out bridge. She could have warned her husband, but decided that a [...] "clean death in the rain was the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> happen to Robert Forrest". O'Malley convinces her to help him write a book detailing Forrest's scheme.|$|E
500|$|Rock 'n' Roll Circus {{received}} mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. [...] A staff reviewer from CD Journal praised the album's rock influences, and commended the album's production. Greg from Selective Hearing was positive towards the album. He commented, [...] "This {{was an excellent}} album and I couldn’t think of a single <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be wrong. It proves that Ayu is still {{at the top of}} her game." [...] However, he felt that [...] "Last Links", [...] "Lady Dynamite", [...] "Sexy Little Things", [...] "The Meaning Of Love", and [...] "Red Line -for TA-" [...] were the album's, [...] "standard cookie cutter fillers". Asian Junkie editor Random J reviewed the album on his personal blog, and awarded it seven stars. He stated, [...] "Rock 'n Roll Circus feels more accessible and easier to connect with than the likes of Guilty." [...] He later commented, [...] "I think this is one of the few albums where Ayumi Hamasaki sounds comfortable and locked into its sound... The album title is a tad misleading, but we can forgive Ayumi Hamasaki for it, given that given the music is good." ...|$|E
