The coupled-cavity resonance <b>tapering</b> allows the velocity reduction to continue beyond the limit of stable period <b>tapering,</b> and it is accomplished by a gradual reduction in the cavity resonance frequency, with the period and the circuit bandwidth unchanged. The advantages of cavity resonance <b>tapering</b> vs period <b>tapering</b> are discussed, and test data are presented with the results of large-signal computer calculations.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Kinesiology (Exercise Science)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. While {{a wealth}} of current {{literature}} exists to support {{the effectiveness of a}} training <b>taper</b> on athletic performance, no study has compared the sequencing of high intensity exercise bouts during the <b>taper</b> period. Purpose: To examine the effect of different sequences of high intensity exercise bouts on cycling time trial performance during a seven-day <b>taper.</b> Methods: 10 well-trained male cyclists age 24 - 48 underwent a VO 2 peak test to determine Wmax. Subjects were then counter-balanced to 1 of 2 groups following an opposite <b>taper</b> week order (<b>Taper</b> 1 - 2 or <b>Taper</b> 2 - 1). Each <b>taper</b> week was preceded by a seven-day training volume increase to 120 % of a subject???s self-reported weekly training volume. Both <b>taper</b> weeks utilized a 50 % reduction in training volume. <b>Taper</b> 1 consisted of a H|L|H|O|L|L|T sequence (H=High Intensity, L=Low Intensity, O=Day Off). <b>Taper</b> 2 consisted of a H|L|H|O|L|H|T sequence. All participants returned to the lab for a 288 kJ time trial (T) on the first and seventh day of each <b>taper.</b> Analysis between the <b>tapers</b> used a two-way repeating measures ANOVA, with an ??-level of. 05. Results: There was no main effect for time trial performance, HR response, or RPE vs. <b>taper</b> protocol. There was however a trend toward significance comparing pre and post time trial performance (p= 0. 11) as well as HR response (p= 0. 08) following both <b>taper</b> protocols.
