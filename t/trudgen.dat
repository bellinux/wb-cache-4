2500|$|There {{are four}} main strokes used in {{competition}} and recreation swimming: the front crawl, {{also known as}} freestyle, the breaststroke, the backstroke and the butterfly. [...] Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke. In 1873, John Arthur <b>Trudgen</b> introduced the <b>trudgen</b> to Western swimming competitions. [...] The butterfly stroke developed in the 1930s, and was considered {{a variant of the}} breaststroke until accepted as a separate style in 1953. Butterfly is also known as the hardest stroke to many, but it burns the most calories compared to the other 3 strokes.|$|E
2500|$|This {{style was}} further {{improved}} by the Australian champion swimmer, Richmond [...] "Dick" [...] Cavill (the son of swimming instructor Professor Richard [...] "Frederick" [...] Cavill) {{who developed the}} stroke with his brother [...] "Tums".

50|$|The 1924 Olympics {{were the}} first to use the {{standard}} 50 metre pool with marked lanes. In the freestyle, swimmers originally dove from the pool walls, but diving blocks were eventually incorporated at the 1936 Olympics. The tumble turn, better known as the flip turn, was developed in the 1950s. The <b>Trudgen,</b> introduced in England during the 1880s, has been completely supplanted by the front crawl, also known as the Australian crawl.Lane design created in the early 1970s has also cut down on turbulence in water.|$|E
50|$|Sir John Arthur <b>Trudgen</b> {{picked up}} the {{hand-over}} stroke from South American natives he observed swimming {{on a trip to}} Buenos Aires. On his return to England in 1868, he successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873 and won a local competition in 1875. Although the new stroke was really the reintroduction of a more intuitive method for swimming, one that had been in evidence in ancient cultures such as Ancient Assyria, his method revolutionized the state of competitive swimming - his stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today. In his stroke, the arms were brought forward, alternating, while the body rolled from side to side. The kick was a scissors kick such as that familiarly used in breaststroke, with one kick for two arm strokes, although it is believed that the Native Americans had indeed used a flutter kick. Front crawl variants used different ratios of scissor kicks to arm strokes, or alternated with a flutter (up-and-down) kick. The speed of the new stroke was demonstrated by F.V.C. Lane in 1901, swimming 100 yd in 1:00.0, an improvement of about ten seconds compared to the breaststroke record. Due to its speed the <b>Trudgen</b> became very quickly popular around the world, despite all the ungentle-manlike splashing.|$|E
50|$|The Olympics in 1904 in St. Louis {{included}} races over 50 yd, 100 yards, 220 yd, 440 yards, 880 yd and {{one mile}} (1.6 km) freestyle, 100 yd backstroke and 440 yd breaststroke, and the 4x50 yards freestyle relay (see also Swimming at the 1904 Summer Olympics). These games differentiated between breaststroke and freestyle, {{so that there}} were now two defined styles (breaststroke and backstroke) and freestyle, where most people swam <b>Trudgen.</b> These games also featured a competition to plunge for distance, where the distance without swimming, after jumping in a pool, was measured.|$|E
