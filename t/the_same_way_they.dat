5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Scott (as well as Irish writer Maria Edgeworth), {{and decided to}} write novels using France's turbulent history as a literary backdrop in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> had used the history of Scotland and Ireland. Balzac had previously only published potboiler novels {{under a variety of}} pseudonyms, books designed to excite readers and sell copies. He had also engaged in a series of ill-fated speculative investments, which left him in considerable debt. Nevertheless, he believed in his skills as a writer, and awaited success around every corner.|$|E
5|$|In practice, {{the huge}} Valdez glacier that stood between the port and the Alaskan {{interior}} proved almost insurmountable and only 200 managed to climb it; by 1899, {{the cold and}} scurvy was causing many deaths amongst the rest. Other prospectors attempted an alternative route across the Malaspina Glacier just to the east, suffering even greater hardships. Those who did manage to cross it found themselves having to negotiate miles of wilderness before they could reach Dawson. Their expedition was forced to turn back <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> had come with only four men surviving.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{visit to}} the Peloponnese in 1862 a new coup was {{launched}} and this time a Provisional Government was set up and summoned a National Convention. Ambassadors of the Great Powers urged King Otto not to resist, and the king and queen took refuge on a British warship and returned to Bavaria aboard (<b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> had come to Greece) taking with them the Greek royal regalia which they had brought from Bavaria in 1832. It has been suggested that had Otto and Amalia borne an heir, then the King would not have been overthrown, as succession was also a major unresolved question at the time. It is also true, however, that the Constitution of 1843 made provision for his succession by his two younger brothers and their descendants.|$|E

5|$|The show's {{producers}} and creators presented material in a narrative format {{instead of the}} more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E
5|$|For 2006, Pescarolo {{were the}} only team to run the C60 in the newly-renamed Le Mans Series (LMS). Collard and Boullion started the season in exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> had {{finished}} the previous one, by winning the 1000km of Istanbul in the Pescarolo C60 Hybrid. The 1000km of Spa saw Collard and Boullion win again, despite starting the race from the pitlane after a crash in free practice. At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Pescarolo entered two C60s, as usual; one driven by Hélary, Loeb and Franck Montagny, whilst the other was driven by Collard, Minassian and Comas. The Montagny/Hélary/Loeb car took second overall, beating one of the brand-new Audi R10 TDIs, whilst the other car finished fifth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. Having returned to the LMS, Collard and Boullion were joined by Hélary for the 1000km of Nürburgring, and the trio took another win for Pescarolo. Didier André replaced Hélary {{in the final two}} rounds, which were the 1000 km of Donington and 1000 km of Jarama, and Pescarolo won both races to complete a clean sweep. As a result, Pescarolo retained the LMP1 team's championship with the maximum score possible. The C60 was made obsolete by the new LMP1 regulations for 2007, and thus was retired, and replaced by the Pescarolo 01.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the modern}} era, the main written {{language}} of China was Classical Chinese, which has grammar and vocabulary based on Old Chinese used in ancient times. Whilst the written form of Chinese mostly remained static, the spoken varieties of Chinese diverged from Old Chinese.

But {{she did not want}} to hurt anyone's feelings in the least, did not interfere in the matters, sought justice and equity, and because she was firmly religious she passed a good deal of time in prayers. She possessed good, high moral standards, which led her to help the poor and needy. When anyone went to see her, they would enter her presence in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> did the Sultan's, then take a seat in front of her.

25|$|As {{children}} grow older they slowly grow into their roles within their society. Both genders learn from adults {{how to do}} certain things that later will help the tribe. For example, girls learn how to make doll clothing, which teaches them how to make real garments. Boys, on the other hand, are given miniature bows for them to practice hunting very small game with. Children at young ages are integrated into society evenly. They are given small tasks based on their age to follow. Boys practice hunting and follow men on some hunting events. Having little boys follow the men into hunting events lets them learn firsthand how to hunt, receive tips on what to do while hunting, and gain experience for when they do events when they are older. Girls learn <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> watch the women of the society do their daily routines and mimic them on smaller scales. Like the example given above with the doll making. Having a little girl make the clothes for themselves teaches them how to make clothing they would want in the future.|$|E

25|$|Bottled beers were commonplace by the 17th {{century for}} the well off {{who wished to}} drink outside of public inns, or who {{wanted to take a}} beer with them when fishing. There is a famous story of Alexander Nowell, the Dean of St Paul's, who, in 1568, left his bottled beer by the river bank, and upon {{returning}} a few days later discovered the bottle opened with a bang and that the contents were very tasty. But while the middle and upper classes could indulge themselves with such expensive luxuries, the ordinary folk continued to drink their beer served direct from the cask. India Pale Ale (IPA), the famous ale that was shipped to India, was delivered in casks, and only transferred to the bottle for the civilian middle classes; the troops drank their beer <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> drank it back home, from flagons filled direct from the cask. But as beer developed and became paler and lower in alcohol, so it became more difficult to keep it fresh tasting in the cask, especially in countries with warmer climates. By the late 19th century commercial refrigeration and Louis Pasteur's flash heating method of sterilisation prolonged the life of beer. In Britain's cooler climate these methods did not catch on at this time.|$|E

500|$|The wing {{shape of}} Pteranodon {{suggests}} {{that it would have}} flown rather like a modern-day albatross. This is {{based on the fact that}} Pteranodon had a high aspect ratio (wingspan to chord length) similar to that of the albatross — 9:1 for Pteranodon, compared to 8:1 for an albatross. Albatrosses spend long stretches of time at sea fishing, and use a flight pattern called [...] "dynamic soaring" [...] which exploits the vertical gradient of wind speed near the ocean surface to travel long distances without flapping, and without the aid of thermals (which do not occur over the open ocean <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> do over land). While most of a Pteranodon flight would have depended on soaring, like long-winged seabirds, it probably required an occasional active, rapid burst of flapping, and studies of Pteranodon wing loading (the strength of the wings vs. the weight of the body) indicate that they were capable of substantial flapping flight, contrary to some earlier suggestions that they were so big they could only glide.|$|E

[...] The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket ('The Threat from [...] the Darkness) condemning Islamic spiritual leaders [...] "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire." [...] In October 2005, Politiken, another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said {{they would be willing to}} draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals, and six artists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad.|$|E
