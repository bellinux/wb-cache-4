Sometimes the choice of <b>text</b> has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian.

40|$|In Malaysia, {{corporate}} {{social responsibility}} (CSR) is relatively new but corporations have been required to engage in and disclose their CSR. A typical genre for disclosure is CSR reports and these reports often refer to other <b>texts.</b> The article investigates the act of referencing to other <b>texts</b> or intertextuality in Malaysian CSR reports. It creates an archive of CEO Statements and Environment Sections in CSR reports and studies the archive for keywords, which can identify the incorporated <b>texts.</b> The function of these <b>texts</b> is examined in relation to Malaysia’s corporate context. CSR reports contain explicit references to documents (policies, regulations, reports, research, standards) and to individuals/groups (CEOs, stakeholders, expert organizations). The incorporated <b>texts</b> display variation in corporate control, which organizes these <b>texts</b> along an intertextual cline. The cline helps to identify corporate and non-corporate sources among the <b>texts.</b> The selection of incorporated <b>texts</b> may reflect government and stock exchange demands. The <b>texts</b> are not standardized and are relevant for the CSR domain and corporations, where these <b>texts</b> monitor and justify CSR performance. Yet, the incorporated <b>texts</b> may perpetuate inexact reporting because corporations select the <b>texts</b> and the parts of <b>texts</b> to refer to. Since these <b>texts</b> have been employed to scrutinize initiatives and results, CSR reports can claim to represent the “truth” about a corporation’s CSR. Hence, intertextuality serves corporate interests...|$|R

5|$|Burnett Hillman Streeter {{proposed}} Caesarea or Beirut {{for three}} reasons: it contains, after the New Testament, the two Epistles of Clement; it represents an eclectic <b>text</b> in the New Testament, Antiochian in the Gospels and Alexandrian in the Acts and Epistles, it suggests some {{place where the}} influence of Antioch and of Alexandria met; the <b>text</b> of the Old Testament {{appears to be a}} non-Alexandrian <b>text</b> heavily revised by the Hexapla, the Old Testament quotations in New Testament more often than not agree with Alexandrinus against Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the <b>text</b> of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type.

5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating {{in a dispute over}} minor differences between different editions of the received <b>text.</b> The first school, known as New <b>Text</b> criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided the basis of the School of Images and Numbers. The other school, Old <b>Text</b> criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the <b>text,</b> providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles. The New <b>Text</b> scholars distributed alternate versions of the <b>text</b> and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing. Most of this early commentary, such as the image and number work of Jing Fang, Yu Fan and Xun Shuang, is no longer extant.
