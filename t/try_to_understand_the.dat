25|$|Qualitative data {{analysis}} contains reviewing, summarizing, generalizing and interpreting data {{in an appropriate}} and accurate way. It is to describe and explain the phenomena or social worlds being studied. One {{of the most important}} steps in the qualitative research process is analysis of data. Analyzing qualitative data also requires researchers’ patience. There are two different analytical procedures: Meaning and discovery-Focused approaches. Meaning-focused approaches emphasize meaning comprehension. In other words, <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> subjective meaning of experiences for the participants, instead of placing those meanings into researchers’ own conceptions. Discovery-focused techniques aim to establish patterns and connections among elements of data. However, no matter which procedure is used, it is essential to apply an effective system for retrieving data because of the identity of qualitative {{data analysis}}, which is exploring data progressively.|$|E

An angered Doctor sets out to the Shard on an anti-gravity motorbike and crashes it into Miss Kizlet's office. He demands that she release all the minds that have been uploaded, but Miss Kizlet refuses. The Doctor then reveals that he is still at the café and she was talking to the server he had hacked which he then uses to upload Miss Kizlet to the network. Trapped in the network, she orders her subordinates to release her (with the Doctor ensuring that they do so using a pad that controls her employees). By doing this, everyone else including Clara, is restored.|$|E

She rarely interfered with politics, preferring to devote her time and energies to her family, charities and the more social side of her position. Her one exception was her militant anti-German sentiment due to the annexation of Danish territories by Prussia in 1864, a sentiment echoed by her sister, Alexandra. Prince Gorchakov remarked about this policy: “it is our belief, that Germany will not forget that both in Russia and in England a Danish Princess has her foot {{on the steps of}} the throne.” [...] Maria Feodorovna suffered a miscarriage in 1866 in Denmark while horseriding.|$|E

It isn’t a judgment of guilt. It isn't a disciplinary measure. And what we've done is to use the interim to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> nature of the case better. Weighing a lot of things [...] the presumption of innocence, the nature of the charges, the need of the students to get on with their life.

2500|$|From this {{starting}} point Baudrillard theorized broadly about human society based upon {{this kind of}} self-referentiality. His writing portrays societies always searching {{for a sense of}} meaning—or a [...] "total" [...] understanding of the world—that remains consistently elusive. In contrast to Post-structuralism (such as Michel Foucault), for whom the formations of knowledge emerge only as the result of relations of power, Baudrillard developed theories in which the excessive, fruitless search for total knowledge leads almost inevitably to a kind of delusion. In Baudrillard's view, the (human) subject may <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> (non-human) object, but because the object can only be understood according to what it signifies (and because the process of signification immediately involves a web of other signs from which it is distinguished) this never produces the desired results. The subject is, rather, seduced (in the original Latin sense, seducere, to lead away) by the object. He argued therefore that, in final analysis, a complete understanding of the minutiae of human life is impossible, and when people are seduced into thinking otherwise they become drawn toward a [...] "simulated" [...] version of reality, or, to use one of his neologisms, a state of [...] "hyperreality". This {{is not to say that}} the world becomes unreal, but rather that the faster and more comprehensively societies begin to bring reality together into one supposedly coherent picture, the more insecure and unstable it looks and the more fearful societies become. Reality, in this sense, [...] "dies out".|$|E
2500|$|Every year on 19 April, {{which is}} Holocaust Remembrance Day in Poland, pupils and {{citizens}} of Lublin {{are asked to}} send letters addressed to Henio Zytomirski at 11th Kowalska Street, the last known address of Henio in Lublin. Thousands of letters were sent to Henio, including paintings, personal letters and exciting stories of 12- to 13-year-old children. At {{the entrance to the}} PKO Bank, the place where Henio's last picture was taken, a special mailbox is placed every year for sending the letters to Henio. Lublin postal Authorities have to deal with full sacks of letters which are sent back to senders with the post seal: [...] "Unknown Addressee". Later in the day, participants follow a walking tour by foot and visit the addresses where Henio had lived at: 3 Szewska Street, 11 Kowalska Street (in the Ghetto). The walk ends with a silent prayer {{at the foot of a}} street lamp, which is the last remnant of the pre-war Jewish town of Lublin serving as a memorial candle. In 2007 the passengers by the bank were asked to write letters to Henio on the spot. The response was extraordinary. The national Polish press dedicates a lot of reportages to this project. Since 2005 Henio Zytomirski has become an icon of the Holocaust, not only in Lublin but all over Poland. Today his life story is a part of the curriculum which is learnt in the general education system in Poland. School newspapers tell about him and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> meaning of the Holocaust through his short life story.|$|E
2500|$|Fee-based consultants, some {{available}} entirely online, can {{be hired}} {{to help a}} student gain admission to the so-called right schools, {{although there are some}} free programs to help underprivileged youth learn how to fill out applications, write essays, get ready for tests, and work on interviews. Consultants can help a student select schools to apply to, counsel them on test taking strategies, review scores, help with essay preparation (but not writing), review applications, conduct mock interviews, provide logistical planning, and collaborate with others such as athletic coaches. Consultants try to keep a low profile; however, one admissions dean explained that she can [...] "sniff out when there has been some adult involved in the process". Assistance by consultants or other adults can go to extremes, particularly with hard-to-check variables such as the college essays; according to one view, plagiarism on admissions essays has been a [...] "serious problem", particularly on applications to private universities and colleges. There is the possibility that hiring a professional admissions consultant can make an application appear artificial; for example, admissions personnel may suspect adult coaching when one part of an application is polished, while other parts aren't, such as varying quality regarding writing samples. Another risk in hiring a consultant, which can happen if parents become too involved in the process, is what Mamlet and VanDeVelde term overpackaging: the applicant appears so smooth and perfect that admissions officers suspect the person is not real but a marketing creation. Generally, when hiring a college admissions counselor, parents and students <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> counselor's philosophy, learn what services are provided, and whether any help will be offered regarding advice about financial aid or scholarships. Mamlet and VanDeVelde suggest that it is improper for an admissions counselor to tamper with a student's [...] "authentic self". According to their view, ideal counselors have experience with college admissions, meet regularly with college admissions officers, visit campuses regularly, and belong to professional affiliations.|$|E
