6000|$|Watts {{rubbed his}} jaw. [...] "Well, it's a {{difficult}} situation, Harris. I {{have to let}} the men leave the grounds sometimes. They can see the forest from the buildings, {{and as long as}} you can see a nice place to stretch out and relax that does it. Once every ten days they have a full period of rest. Then <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> fool around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and a fat {{lot of good}} it's done us," [...] said Naughten. [...] "They come in {{here and}} jaw our heads off when we ought to be jawin' them. Beetle talks to us as if we were a lot of blackguards and--and all that. And when they've hung us up to dry, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> slam the door like a house-master. All your fault, Tulke." ...|$|E
6000|$|The pair {{return to}} the crypt, Durdles falls asleep, dreams that Jasper leaves him, [...] "and that {{something}} touches him and something falls from his hand. Then something clinks and gropes about," [...] and the lines of moonlight shift their direction, as Durdles finds that they have really done when he wakens, with Jasper beside him, while the Cathedral clock strikes two. They have had many hours, not less than five, for their expedition. The key of the crypt lies beside Durdles on the ground. <b>They</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> as Deputy begins stone-throwing, Jasper half strangles him.|$|E

60|$|The {{place to}} buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we didn't see no rafts laying up; {{so we went}} along during three hours and more. Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog. You can't tell {{the shape of the}} river, and you can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a {{steamboat}} up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it. Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.|$|E
6000|$|We {{agreed to}} go in a launch, a large launch--to be exact, the largest in the town. We could have gone in row boats, but a row boat is a poor thing to fish from. Kernin said that in a row boat it is {{impossible}} properly to [...] "play" [...] your fish. The side of the boat is so low that the fish is apt to leap over the side into the boat when half [...] "played." [...] Popley said that there is no comfort in a row boat. In a launch a man can reach out his feet and take it easy. Charlie Jones said that in a launch a man could rest his back against something, and Morse said that in a launch a man could rest his neck. Young inexperienced boys, in the small sense of the word, never think of these things. So <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> after a few hours their necks get tired; whereas a group of expert fishers in a launch can rest their backs and necks and even fall asleep during the pauses when the fish stop biting.|$|E

We {{are in the midst}} of the rainy season, and dwell among alarms of hurricanes, in a very unsafe little two-storied wooden box 650 feet above and about three miles from the sea-beach. Behind us, till the other slope of the island, desert forest, peaks, and loud torrents; in front green slopes to the sea, some fifty miles of which we dominate. We see the ships as <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> in to the {{dangerous}} roadstead of Apia; and if they lie far out, we can even see their topmasts while they are at anchor. Of sounds of men, beyond those of our own labourers, there reach us, at very long intervals, salutes from the warships in harbour, the bell of the cathedral church, and the low of the conch-shell calling the labour boys on the German plantations. Yesterday, which was Sunday--the quantième is most likely erroneous; you can now correct it--we had a visitor--Baker of Tonga. Heard you ever of him? He is a great man here: he is accused of theft, rape, judicial murder, private poisoning, abortion, misappropriation of public moneys--oddly enough, not forgery, nor arson; you would be amused if you knew how thick the accusations fly in this South Sea world. I make no doubt my own character is something illustrious; or if not yet, there is a good time coming.|$|E

50|$|Talent {{management}} is an organization's ability to recruit, retain, and produce {{the most talented}} employees available in the job market.

However, most of those people are either satisfied with the job they have, or <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> look for better opportunities.|$|E
