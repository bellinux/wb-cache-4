500|$|... "Get Sexy" [...] {{features}} an interpolation of Right Said Fred's song [...] "I'm Too Sexy", which was composed by Christopher Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, and Robert Manzoli. It samples the trademark lyric, [...] "I'm too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my shirt, so sexy it hurts", but replaces [...] "for my shirt" [...] with [...] "in this club". According to Digital Spy, {{in an interview}} with Teletext, Buchanan revealed that inspiration for the song came [...] "by accident", saying: [...] "The producers were messing around going, 'I'm too sexy for the studio'. We were like, 'That sounds cool', and [...] said, 'You remember that Right Said Fred song?' We were like, 'Do you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it?' By accident it came together." [...] Balls and Levine compared the song to [...] "Boom Boom Pow" [...] by Black Eyed Peas.|$|E

"Even if, as Catholics, we were {{prepared}} to take the responsibility of disregarding [...] views, which I do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> it would be politically impossible to do so [...] [...] [...] We {{are dealing with the}} considered views {{of the leaders of the}} Catholic Church to which the vast majority of our people belong; these views cannot be ignored." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2010 Sinclair told The Guardian {{newspaper}} {{that he was}} working on a new prototype electric vehicle, called the X-1, to be launched within a year. [...] "Technology has moved on quite a bit, there are new batteries available and I just rethought the thing. The C5 was OK, but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> a better job now." [...] The two-wheel X-1 was to have been available on July 2011 at the price of Â£595, but failed to reach production.|$|E

He says he {{will get}} us the proper outfit, and before we start he'll have a {{professional}} photographer, {{who has made a}} study of landscapes, give us pointers on how to get the best results. He knows <b>we</b> <b>can</b> take pretty good pictures already." ...|$|R
6000|$|March asked rather absently, [...] "Some good?" [...] Then he added: [...] "Oh yes; I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can.</b> What <b>do</b> {{you mean}} by good? Improve the public taste? Elevate the {{standard}} of literature? Give young authors and artists a chance?" ...|$|R
2500|$|PAUL: I believe very {{sincerely}} {{that the}} CIA is correct when they teach {{and talk about}} blowback. When we went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah, yes there was blowback. The reaction to that was the taking of our hostages, and that persists. And if we ignore that, we ignore that at our own risk. If we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> what we want {{around the world and}} not incite hatred, then we have a problem. They don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free, they come and attack us because we're over there. I mean what would we think if other foreign countries were doing that to us? ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{better than}} put on that young trumpeter till {{you can play}} again. I have watched him several times at practice, and he always keeps his wickets up well, and hits freely {{whenever}} he gets a chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know {{he hates}} the country," [...] Louise assented. She rose {{and went to}} the glass door {{standing}} open on the piazza, where a syringa bush was filling the dull, warm air with its breath. [...] "We must all try to <b>think</b> what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for Suzette." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Ah, smart, smart!' he cried, {{in a kind}} {{of ecstasy}} of delight. 'You are the very man for us. You are not to be talked over, and quite right, too. Now, here's a note for a hundred pounds, and if you <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{business}} you may just slip it into your pocket as an advance upon your salary.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If only {{we could}} capture them ourselves!" [...] murmured Tom, his eyes glistening. [...] "Don't you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it, with the sticks and pistols?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you must}} have a horse. I will <b>think</b> over what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you, in that way. There is no buying one here, unless a field officer is killed, or dies.|$|R
6000|$|... "I agree. But we can't {{take the}} course we were following. I <b>think</b> the best <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{is to turn}} further {{to the left and}} strike Risley's from the west," [...] added Henry.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had forgotten, Ruth," [...] he said slowly, [...] "but does it matter? You {{have no one}} in {{the world}} but Isaac, and I have {{no one in the}} world at all. Don't you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> afford to <b>do</b> what seems sensible?" ...|$|R
6000|$|CUTHBERTSON. Therefore, though I have {{no sympathy}} {{whatever}} with Charteris's views, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> no harm by waiting--say ten minutes or so. (He sits down.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> without you, after all," [...] he said, {{breathing}} thickly. [...] "I've {{no doubt}} you owe money all over England. You're a cadger, that's what you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm well {{satisfied}} {{to have you}} near me, in an alarm, Chippewa. We've stood by each other once, in troublesome times; and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> as much, ag'in." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{fortunate}} {{that it was}} the elder Beatrice instead of the younger, for provoked as she already had been before with the old lady, it was not easy even for her to make a cheerful answer. [...] "Well, it is very kind in you to attend to my London fancies," [...] said she; [...] "I <b>think</b> if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything to spare him such a night as the last, it should be tried." ...|$|R
500|$|Despite the album's {{critical}} and commercial success, lead singer Chris Martin said that Coldplay didn't like the album. He also commented {{that they look}} beyond Parachutes: [...] "We know that's terrible music and we always try to <b>think</b> about what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> next." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he's got our bonds he'll {{certainly}} do {{his best to}} keep out of our way," [...] returned Dick, grimly. [...] "I <b>think</b> the best <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> first of all is to locate Barton Pelter and make him tell us all he knows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything, Wilfrid, beyond {{trying to}} find out whether the fellows who came here were alone, or were part of a larger party. Where are your natives?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Jerry. You're a jewel. I envy Maggie. Well, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} {{till they}} come back from England, as aunt Nesta is sure to take Ogden with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] said Capes, [...] "what {{on earth}} do you want? What do you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do?</b> Don't {{you know what}} men are, and what life is?--to {{come to me and}} talk to me like this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{that with}} four hands {{less than we}} have now. You see, there are {{nineteen}} and the two mates and myself. Say two of the wounded won't be able to lend a hand, that makes us twenty, {{to say nothing of}} Jake and Pedro. So, even if you took four hands, we should be pretty even in numbers; and if our men could not each whip two Belgians, they had better give up the sea." ...|$|R
5000|$|Donât {{think about}} winning the SEC Championship. Donât {{think about the}} {{national}} championship. Think about what you needed {{to do in this}} drill, on this play, in this moment.

5000|$|Anything <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> Humanity's idea {{of colors}} is too broad. This {{needs to be}} more personal, because ideas of colors vary from person to person. Even for people who have synesthesia, the {{specific}} images or sounds they hear attached to colors vary from person to person. And that just reinforces the point of doing the project, to produce our interpretation of color, the way we feel about colors or are inspired by the colors - how we hear them or see them.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I was exactly {{thinking}} of that," [...] said Margaret, [...] "but {{that ought to}} be the way. If we are not just the thing in our niche at home, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> much real good elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Dryfoos reddened {{and looked}} down, as if {{unable or unwilling}} to cope with the {{difficulty}} of making a polite protest against March's self-depreciation. He said, after a moment: [...] "It's new business to all of us except Mr. Fulkerson. But I think it will succeed. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> some good in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can imagine}} {{it to some}} extent. If the ore carries as much silver as <b>we</b> <b>think,</b> you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> what you like when you get your patent; build laboratories, travel, make friends with clever people. In fact, your money will buy you {{anything}} you want." ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2010, Planet Green's {{programming}} was broadened {{to include}} non-ecology themed shows; despite this broadened focus, in February 2011, Discovery Communications executives were acknowledging the channel's failure. Discovery chief executive David Zaslav stated {{in a conference}} call with investors [...] "We <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> probably <b>do</b> something else with that that would be more meaningful." [...] Shortly thereafter the channel had abandoned its theme, rerunning programs from other Discovery Communications channels and featuring programming blocks such as [...] "Paranormal Fridays". Discovery announced a probable rebranding of the channel by the start of the summer of 2012.|$|R

[...] "After that, <b>think!</b> What <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> Captain Griffiths knows {{that there was}} no Hamar Lessingham at college with Dick, that he never visited Wood Norton, that there is some mystery about your arrival here, and he told me to my face that he {{believes}} you to be Bertram Maderstrom." ...|$|R
