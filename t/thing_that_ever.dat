[...] The British journalist and author Leo McKinstry said [...] "England's most successful manager would have had a legacy fit for a hero {{had it not been for}} the malevolence of the FA chief Harold Thompson".

While in Ocala, he tried to become better at basketball by doing 200 push-ups every night. He also visited his hometown during school vacations.

500|$|Bowie {{declared}} himself gay {{in an interview}} with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, [...] "If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality". In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, [...] "It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened to me". According to his first wife, Angie, Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy then restlessly {{wandered around}} the hotel, {{checking}} {{in on his}} staff. When asked if King's murder had {{reminded him of the}} 1963 assassination of John F.

[...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened in the world."

500|$|Hastert {{opposed the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold), the {{landmark}} {{campaign finance reform}} law. In 2001, during {{the debate on the}} bill, Hastert criticized Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, saying that McCain had [...] "bullied" [...] House Republicans by sending them letters in support of his campaign-finance reform proposals. Hastert called the legislation [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened to Congress" [...] and expressed the view that there were [...] "constitutional flaws" [...] in the legislation. Supporters of campaign-finance reform circumvented Hastert by means of a discharge petition, a seldom-used procedural mechanism in which a measure may be brought to a floor vote (over the objections of the speaker) if an absolute majority of Representatives sign a petition in support of doing so. The discharge petition was not successfully used again until 2015.|$|E
500|$|In 1956 Curtiss-Wright began isotope {{work at the}} facility, and The New York Times {{published}} {{two stories}} on the new nuclear research laboratory that year, followed by a November 1957 report that the one-megawatt nuclear reactor was completed. In 1958, the corporation received a twenty-year license from the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to operate a four-megawatt pool-type nuclear research reactor, and received permission from the Pennsylvania Sanitary Water Board to dispose of some radioactive waste in Meeker Run, a tributary of Mosquito Creek. The project was billed as [...] "the greatest <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened in North Central Pennsylvania", and was expected to employ between 7,000 and 8,000 people. Curtiss-Wright spent $30million on the project, and developed a community for its scientific and technical staff at the village of Pine Glen, southeast of Karthaus in Centre County.|$|E
500|$|Jean and Reiss {{served as}} show runners {{until the end}} of the fourth season in 1993. Since the show had already {{established}} itself in the first two seasons, they were able to give it more depth during their tenure. Jean believes this is one of the reasons that many fans and critics regard season three and four as the best seasons of The Simpsons. Bill Oakley, another writer on The Simpsons, has commented that [...] "Mike and Al are responsible for the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> appeared on television, which was the third season of The Simpsons." [...] Comedy writer Jay Kogen has said that [...] "those years with Al Jean and Mike Reiss running it were pretty darn good. And then the ones after that maybe not so much.

As Love later reflected, [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> {{happened}} to me in a way, was Kat." [...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they recruited bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a period}} of adjustment, Selänne gained an {{appreciation}} for his new team; he quickly came to call the deal the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened to him. He was paired with Paul Kariya, whom he met at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game, and the duo were counted on to lead the young franchise to a post-season berth for the first time. Selänne scored 36 points in 28 games with the Ducks, and combined with his Jets totals, finished the 1995–96 season with 108 points. He followed {{it up with a}} third 100-point season in 1996–97, finishing with 109, including 51 goals.

Despite being criticized as being a [...] "one-line team," [...] Anaheim defeated the Phoenix Coyotes in the first round before being eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5000|$|The usual view {{taken of}} Peter's {{use of the}} [...] "apokatastasis {{of all the things}} about which God spoke" [...] is that it refers to the {{restoration}} of the Kingdom of Israel and/or the Garden of Eden and not [...] "all <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> existed".|$|R

500|$|Final Fantasy Adventure was {{featured}} in Nintendo Power when it was re-released in the United States.

They additionally praised the game's puzzle elements as innovative and drew comparisons to , though noted that its role-playing gameplay did not blend well with its action-oriented nature. RPGFan also praised the game stating it was [...] "possibly the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened to Gameboy." [...] RPGamer praised the game's plot stating,"The story is one where you can relate to the characters and also the world around them." [...] Ndojo also gave similar praise to the game however noting it being vastly different from Final Fantasy stating, [...] "If you’re expecting Final Fantasy in the traditional sense, you’re going to be disappointed. However, if you play the game for a while, you just might find that it’s equally entertaining in its own fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} ended its first season, a problem had arisen for the producers: the {{pregnancy}} of Gillian Anderson, who played Dana Scully. Some network executives wanted the role recast, which Carter refused to do. Though they considered having Scully {{giving birth to}} an alien child, the producers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy by having her abducted and appearing comatose several episodes later. This was described by executive producer Frank Spotnitz as [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened to the series" [...] as it helped form the intricate mythology that would run throughout the show. The writers decided to close the X-Files {{at the end of}} the first season and thus separate Mulder and Scully in the earlier episodes of the season. To hide Anderson's pregnancy in the early episodes, the producers disguised it with [...] "very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing". Anderson was not featured at all in the episode [...] "3", as she was giving birth to her daughter at the time.|$|E
500|$|After several {{stand-alone}} episodes featuring UFOs and extraterrestrials {{early in}} the first season, the show's mythology developed largely based on the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson, who became pregnant midway through production of the first season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described it as [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened to the series", noting that the mythology [...] "really ended up running through {{the life of the}} series, all because Gillian Anderson became pregnant". Although there were initially thoughts about Anderson's character Scully giving birth to an alien child, ultimately the writers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy. The writers decided on closing the X-Files {{at the end of the}} season to separate Mulder and Scully from one another, and have Scully abducted, reappearing comatose several episodes later. In addition to the creation of the storyline concerning Scully's abduction, Anderson's reduced role in the first half of the second season permitted the writers to develop some of the other characters in the show including Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and X (Steven Williams), and resulted in the introduction of the character Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder's partner for three episodes eventually grew into a character that lasted seven seasons on the show.|$|E

500|$|Although widely acclaimed, {{the album}} has been censured by some. It was voted the worst record ever {{made in a}} 1998 Melody Maker poll of pop stars, DJs and journalists. Among the harshest detractors was {{musician}} and journalist John Robb, who described the album as [...] "the benchmark of 1967 – the low water point of rock 'n' roll". In a scathing appraisal of the record prior to its 40th anniversary in 2007, Guardian critic Richard Smith wrote that it is [...] "if not the worst, then certainly the most overrated album of all time". He {{also said that the}} [...] "excruciating" [...] LP was often ranked by members of the music press as the best ever due to affection for its cultural impact, and [...] "not because of anything intrinsically great about the record". Asked in 2007 to nominate the [...] "supposedly great" [...] album he would [...] "gladly never hear again", artist and writer Billy Childish named Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, saying that it [...] "signalled the death of rock 'n' roll". Musician and author Bill Drummond, in a 2010 publication, called the record [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened to music". In 2015, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards denounced the album as [...] "a mishmash of rubbish, kind of like Satanic Majesties".|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> happened to me in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
500|$|In season five, Mary Alice {{appears in}} {{multiple}} flashbacks in [...] "The Best <b>Thing</b> <b>That</b> <b>Ever</b> Could Have Happened", including when handyman Eli Scruggs (Beau Bridges) was first starting out and approached Mary Alice on the street, asking {{her if she}} had any work for him. After initially declining, she notices a hole in his shoe and says she has a broken vase that he can glue back together for her. Years later, on the day Mary Alice committed suicide, Eli was at her house dropping something off. He asks if she is alright, to which she says she is, and just as he is about to leave she picks up the vase he glued for her and says she wants him to have it. Eli asks again if she is alright, and she politely asks him to leave. Later that day, after Mary Alice had shot herself, Eli watches police cars and neighbors gossiping from afar, regretting that he did nothing to save her. He then makes a vow to God to not only fix people's belongings but their lives as much as he can as well. In season six, Mary Alice again appears in a flashback in [...] "Epiphany", when she notices four-year-old Eddie Orlofsky (Davin Ransom) witnessing his father leave their family. Mary Alice continues to check on Eddie and his mother Barbara (Diane Farr), bringing them a hot meal and later to bring a teddy bear for Eddie, where she finds the young child left home alone. Mary Alice finds Barbara in a bar, brings her home and scolds her for her poor parenting skills.|$|E
