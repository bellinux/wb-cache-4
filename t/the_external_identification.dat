40|$|Semantic {{data models}} and {{semantic}} networks use logical names for <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>identification</b> of objects. Yet the naming schemes they employ are not "natural" enough and several problems often arise: logical names can be ambiguous, excessively {{long and difficult}} to handle, unrelated to {{the environment of the}} named object, or unable to follow changes of that environment. In natural language similar problems are resolved by the context within which words (i. e. "names") are used. This paper focuses on developing a context mechanism for a semantic network - structured information base and, in particular, exploiting this mechanism for naming purposes. This contextbased naming mechanism enhances name readability, resolves ambiguities, saves a lot of redundant name substrings, localizes and thus facilitates consistency checking, query processing and update operations. 1 Introduction Semantic data models and semantic networks provide a "natural" mechanism (that is, similar to the way a user or [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{qualitative}} research project, I examine {{the development of}} landscapes of care for, and by, identified trafficked people {{and its implications for}} rebuilding a sense of place and identity. Through in-depth interviews and ethnographic data, I argue that discourse, place and identity interact to form complex landscapes within both providers and clients/patients that emerge as distinct experiences of care or non-care experiences. Each analytical chapter examines a particular production of care: a merging of psycho-legal care, the interactions of formalized informal caring relationships, and <b>the</b> burden of <b>external</b> <b>identification</b> in <b>the</b> configuration of self-identity among identified trafficked people. Building on anthropological theories of care (Giordano 2014; Mulla 2014; Stevenson 2014; Mattingly 2010), these chapters build the argument that, in contrast to humanitarian human trafficking and trauma discourse that focuses on a specific kind of trafficking experience; the complex assemblage of trafficking experience and subsequent care should be considered within what I term “structural trafficking. ” Becoming identified as trafficked is beneficial for receiving specific rights and services. However, this identity can also be detrimental for rebuilding a sense of self and place, because it assumes a fixed experience that translates to fixed care packages. I examine multiple landscapes of care to better understand potentials for care by expanding identity and coordinating existing and novel systems of care...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to gain a deeper {{understanding}} {{in relation to the}} construction of a ‘Net Generation’. With regards to the idea of an information society, technologies and young people are given certain positions, which are not in any sense natural but are socially constructed. This thesis explores these socially given meanings and shows what types of meanings are prioritized and legitimized. The exploration is conducted by examining, both externally and internally, given meanings of a generation identity. <b>The</b> <b>external</b> (nominal <b>identification)</b> in this study is understood as the construction of an abstract user and is studied by means of academic texts concerning the ‘Net Generation’. The internal (virtual identification) involves young people’s construction of their generation identity and is studied by means of collage. The collages are used to understand how the young participants position themselves in contemporary society and how they, as concrete users, articulate their relationship with information technologies.   The findings show that the ‘type of behavior’ which is articulated in the signifying practice of the construction of the abstract user, ‘Net Generation’, reduces users and technology to a marketing / economical discourse. In addition the idea of the abstract user implies that all users have the same possibilities to achieve ‘success’ in the information society, by being active ‘prosumers’. The concrete users articulate that they feel stressed and pressured in relation to all the choices that they are expected to make. In this sense, the participants do not articulate the (economical) interests as assumed for the ‘Net Generation’, but, rather articulate interests to play, to have a hobby and be social when using information technologies.   What this thesis thus proposes, is to critically explore the ‘taken for granted’ notions of a technological order in society as pertaining to young people. Only if we understand how socially given meaning is constructed can we break loose from the temporarily prioritized values to which the position of technology and users are fixed...|$|R
