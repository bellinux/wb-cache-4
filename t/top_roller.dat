5000|$|In December Joffre was {{replaced}} as supreme commander by Robert Nivelle. In late January Nivelle {{learned of the}} heavy tank project from Estienne. He was much more alarmed than Joffre had been. On 29 January {{he wrote a letter}} to Minister Thomas, making clear that under no circumstances could the project be allowed to impede production of the Schneider CA. Thomas answered on 5 February that there was no danger of this; anyway he had just happened to affirm on 1 February the policy of General Mourret, who had already ordered the simultaneous development of three prototypes: the lightened [...] "A" [...] version, weighing thirty tons, having a length of 6.92 metres, with a suspension featuring twenty-nine double road wheels, four main bogies and five <b>top</b> <b>rollers,</b> powered by two Renault 200 hp engines and to be equipped with a 75 mm gun, to fulfil the original order of 20 October; the [...] "B" [...] version of forty-five tons with a hull lengthened to 7.39 metres, armed with a 75 mm gun and two machine guns, with a suspension featuring thirty road wheels, five main bogies and six <b>top</b> <b>rollers,</b> using a new 380 hp engine and a petro-hydraulic transmission and the [...] "C" [...] version of 62 tons with a 75 mm gun, a length of 9.31 meters, a suspension featuring forty-five road wheels, six main bogies and nine <b>top</b> <b>rollers,</b> and four engines of 110 hp combined with a petro-electrical transmission. Nivelle's misgivings were reinforced by inquiries from a parliamentary financial commission led by Pierre Renaudel. A plan by Breton to immediately order fifty vehicles more or less identical to the mock-up was therefore rejected. The 1 February order of two additional prototypes was confirmed by the CCAS on 7 February. Eventually the [...] "FCM 1A" [...] would be developed with a 105 mm gun and the [...] "FCM 1B" [...] would use a petrol-mechanical transmission.|$|R

5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{consisted of}} three bogies per side—each formed of two bell cranks arranged as [...] "scissors" [...] with springs at the top. Each bogie carried two rubber-rimmed wheels. The first ten production vehicles, which {{can be considered as}} forming a separate preseries, had curved bogie sides; in later vehicles the bogies had straight sides. The bogies superficially resembled the R35 type, but used horizontal helical springs instead of rubber cylinders. The sprocket was at the front, the idler—which itself was sprung to automatically control tension—at the rear. There were two <b>top</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R

50|$|The glass flows {{onto the}} tin surface forming a {{floating}} ribbon with perfectly smooth surfaces {{on both sides}} and of even thickness. As the glass flows along the tin bath, the temperature is gradually reduced from 1100 °C until at approximately 600 °C the sheet can be lifted from the tin onto rollers. The glass ribbon is pulled off the bath by rollers at a controlled speed. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. <b>Top</b> <b>rollers</b> positioned above the molten tin may be used to control both the thickness and the width of the glass ribbon.|$|R

The tank had been evaluated by an unknown reputed tank manufacturer who said that the Arjun had excellent mobility and firepower characteristics. DRDO installed an instrument to function as a black box in the Arjun, following allegations of attempts to sabotage its engine.|$|R
50|$|The rack is a torture device {{consisting}} of a rectangular, usually wooden frame, slightly raised from the ground, with a roller at one or both ends. The victim's ankles are fastened to one roller and the wrists are chained to the other. As the interrogation progresses, a handle and ratchet mechanism attached to the <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> are used to very gradually increase the tension on the chains, inducing excruciating pain. By means of pulleys and levers this roller could be rotated on its own axis, thus straining the ropes until the sufferer's joints were dislocated and eventually separated. Additionally, if muscle fibres are stretched excessively, they lose their ability to contract, rendering them ineffective.|$|E
50|$|The {{flexibility}} of the Dickerson Press allows numerous approaches not possible with other machines. When using the <b>top</b> <b>roller,</b> the user can adjust {{it so that the}} thickest blocks will pass under it. It is not necessary to pad the relief from below because once brought down to the surface to be printed, the roller (or scraper bar in certain techniques) holds its position before, during, and after the print is made. Since the roller can be made to cant about 15 degrees, it will conform to uneven or warped surfaces. Sensitive pressure adjustment allows a range of printing from the richest blacks to the most velvety grays. Reliefs can be printed either face up or face down, to provide perfect color registry.|$|E

50|$|The {{suspension}} uses four {{much more}} robust road wheels. The {{two in the}} middle are paired into a central bogie, sprung by a horizontal rubber cylinder block, that again consists of five smaller rubber cylinders separated by steel discs. These cylinders also serve as shock dampers, avoiding the problems caused by the oil dampers used with the AMR 33. The wheels {{in the front and}} back are independently sprung, again by a rubber cylinder block, but now consisting of four smaller cylinders. The sprocket is in the front. The track is 22 centimetres wide and is supported by four <b>top</b> <b>rollers.</b> The wading capacity is sixty centimetres, the trench crossing-capacity 1,7 metres and a vertical obstacle of fifty centimetres or slope of 50% can be climbed.|$|R
50|$|In essence the Char D2 is an {{improved}} Char D1. The different turret type used, increases its height somewhat to 266.6 centimetres; the hull is 175.5 centimetres high. The {{length of the}} hull, without tail, is 546 centimetres; its width is reduced to 222.3 centimetres {{through the use of}} a narrower track, 35 centimetres wide. The suspension is largely identical but the top rollers, to which a tension wheel is added, are placed somewhat higher to prevent track resonance, a persistent problem with the Char D1. The armour plate covering the three vertical coil springs consists of six instead of eight panels; mud-chutes are added below each <b>top</b> <b>roller.</b> There are three bogies per side, each with four road wheels, a coil spring and two shock absorbers. In front, and at the back below the sprocket, there is a tension wheel with its own damper; identical to the road wheels proper they bring the total number of such wheels to fourteen. Another change are the fenders with large stowage bins that give the false impression to be part of the main armour.|$|E
50|$|In the Frue Vanner a {{continuous}} rubber belt {{4 feet wide}} and 27½ feet long passed over rollers to form the surface of an inclined plane on which the orestuff was concentrated. The belt travelled up hill at from 3 to 12 feet per minute while being laterally shaken about 180 to 200 times. The inclination of the belt was from 4 to 12 in. per 12 feet. The belt received crushed orestuff from the stamps via a distributor about 4 feet from its upper end. As it travelled upwards, it met with small jets of water which gradually washed the gangue off {{the bottom of the}} belt. As the belt travelled over the <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> with the heavier ore adhering to it, it passed into a box containing water where the ore was deposited. From 3 to 6 gallons per minute of water was required. One machine could treat 6 tons per 24 hours of stuff passing a 40 mesh screen, or 2 Vanners to 5 stamps. The Embrey Concentrator and the Triumph Concentrator were similar to the Frue Vanner except that the shaking was longitudinal instead of lateral.|$|E

C. says, 'let the cavern be opened,' {{and at that moment}} the board is lowered at one end and hoisted at the other, and the {{candidate}} slides down to the mouth of a large sheet iron cylinder—something similar to the smoke-stack of a steamboat—and as he slides down a rough voice whispers in his ear, 'Crawl for your life'--following this advice, he crawls through the thing, while all hands are pounding on the outside of it with sticks—just as he comes out he is taken, again up the steep ladder of rollers to the platform at the top. He is now told to stand up, straight, and divest himself of all matter that will spoil by coming into contact with water. While he is being thus prepared for the water the members have got ready a large canvas sheet with rope all round it; this is placed behind him, and held outstretched by as many men as can get hold of the ropes; as soon as all is ready, the candidate is thrown from the platform back upon this sheet, and away he goes—up and down—no sooner down than up again—like Sancho Panza tossed in a blanket—until the members get tired tossing him, at which time he is let down upon a mattress; from which he is lifted back upon the platform, where he is set upon the <b>top</b> <b>roller</b> with his feet directed toward the bottom, an umbrella without any covering is then hoisted and given to him, in his left hand, while in his right hand is placed a cow-bell-he is told to hold up the umbrella and ring the bell, and thus sails down over the rollers into a tub, full of wet sponges, at the bottom. Here the blinds are taken from his eyes, and he beholds himself surrounded by about fifty persons, in their shirt sleeves, all laughing at him.|$|E
