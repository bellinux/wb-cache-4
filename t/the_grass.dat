5|$|Alonso {{ran across}} <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> at turn one again on lap 15, which {{resulted}} in him falling further behind Hamilton. Three laps later he made a similar mistake at the same turn, resulting in him sliding across <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> {{for the third time}} in the race.

5|$|The site is {{also known}} as the Gorwell Circle, a name adopted from Gorwell Farm to the south. It can be {{approached}} via a footpath from near to Gorwell Farm.

5|$|Armies {{of workers}} would gather a long, durable grass known as shicra in the {{highlands}} above the city, tie <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive retaining wall of the step pyramids with the stone-filled bags.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> lies in part in their {{morphology}} and growth processes {{and in part}} in their physiological diversity. Most of <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> divide into two physiological groups, using the C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways for carbon fixation. <b>The</b> C4 <b>grasses</b> have a photosynthetic pathway, linked to specialized Kranz leaf anatomy, which allows for increased water use efficiency, rendering them better adapted to hot, arid environments and those lacking in carbon dioxide.|$|R

5|$|Clotted {{cream can}} be used as an accompaniment to hot or cold desserts.

40|$|It is {{convenient}} and sometimes necessary to identify <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> in their vegetative stage of growth. This is especially desirable {{in a study}} of the vegetation of native hay meadows and permanent pastures. This key is prepared as a guide in the identification of the more important prairie hay <b>grasses</b> of Nebraska. <b>The</b> meadows are often harvested before the floral parts of many of <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> appear. If it is desired, therefore, to study the botanical composition of the native meadows, it becomes necessary to rely on identification of many of <b>the</b> <b>grasses</b> by means of vegetative characters...|$|R

5|$|According to the National Trust, <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> is trimmed {{regularly}} {{and the giant}} is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with a wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> who looked at them. She later described what she saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E
5|$|By 3:30p.m. the {{massacre}} was well under way. A {{group of women}} in Rock Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E
