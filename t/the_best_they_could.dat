25|$|After World War II, Bayern {{played in}} the Oberliga Süd, {{which was one of}} five upper league {{conferences}} established in the western half of the country. Through the period from the formation of the Oberligen in 1947 {{to the creation of the}} Bundesliga, Germany's professional league, in 1963, they played as a middling side. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> manage in their division was third- and fourth-place finishes. They even found themselves relegated to the second tier 2nd Oberliga Süd for the 1956 season – the only time this has happened.|$|E
25|$|With Germany {{in chaos}} {{towards the end}} of World War II, Schalke played just two matches in 1945. They resumed regular play {{following}} the war and, for a time, continued to compete as a strong side. They set a record in a national championship round match with a 20–0 drubbing of SpVgg Herten, but that spoke more to the weakened condition of German football than the ability of the team. Schalke's play fell off and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> manage in the new Oberliga West in 1947 was a sixth-place finish. Within two years, they slipped to 12th place.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{hearing the}} explosions {{at the power}} plant, Lance Sergeant O'Brien's group {{activated}} its own explosives. Both groups then withdrew back into the hills, just as German reinforcements were arriving at the plant. The Germans were unwilling to enter the tunnel, fearing it might be booby trapped, so they used boats belonging to the villagers to bypass the tunnel and reach the power plant. Granlund had pressed on ahead of the main group trying to locate a foot bridge to aid their escape. He did locate a mountain hut occupied by three Norwegians whom he asked for directions, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do was draw him a map. Granlund left to try to locate the bridge but returned to the hut soon after being unable to {{find it in the}} dark. He arrived back {{at the same time as}} Captain Houghton and the other Norwegian, Djupdraet, and all three entered the hut. Unknowingly while Granlund had been away two Germans had arrived at the hut and were busy questioning the occupants. In the ensuing fight, one of the Germans was killed and the other wounded. Djupdraet was also wounded, stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet.|$|E

25|$|In April 2013, Botswana {{were given}} hosting rights {{again for the}} ICC World Cricket League Division 7 in their second attempt {{in trying to get}} {{promoted}} out of Division 7 after halting the relegation slide in the last edition. Beating Ghana in the first match, Botswana lost their second match in a competitive encounter against Vanuatu by 23 runs. Botswana then lost third next match heavily to eventual WCL Div 7 winners and arch rivals Nigeria. Botswana tried in vain to get back into contention for promotion but after a tied match against Germany, all hopes were dashed and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> hope for was a third-place finish. This was achieved by beating Fiji in the last group match and then beating them again in the third-place playoff earning Botswana a third place, finishing behind Vanuatu and Nigeria who were both promoted to Division 6 of the WCL. With the ICC's decision to eliminate the ICC World Cricket League Divisions 7 and 8, Botswana will now have to qualify through regional tournaments to make it into the ICC World Cricket League Division 6, which will now be the entry point for the World Cricket League.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Spanish {{recording}} artist Juan Ramon released his second studio album Por Haberte Amado Tanto which was arranged and produced by Cuban-American musician Rudy Pérez.

One year later, Argentine musician María Martha Serra Lima covered the song on her studio album {{of the same name}} which was also arranged and produced by Pérez. Pérez also proposed the song to be covered by Mexican singer Luis Miguel for his album Segundo Romance (1994). However Miguel rejected the song because he felt {{it was more of a}} ballad than a bolero.|$|E

[...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor any minute of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company."

500|$|Dalglish {{cited the}} Hillsborough {{disaster}} and its repercussions {{as the reason}} for his resignation in 1991; he was replaced by former player Graeme Souness. Under his leadership Liverpool won the 1992 FA Cup Final, but their league performances slumped, with two consecutive sixth-place finishes, eventually resulting in his dismissal in January 1994. Souness was replaced by Roy Evans, and Liverpool {{went on to win the}} 1995 Football League Cup Final. While they made some title challenges under Evans, third-place finishes in 1996 and 1998 were <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> manage, and so Gérard Houllier was appointed co-manager in the 1998–99 season, and became the sole manager in November 1998 after Evans resigned. In 2001, Houllier's second full season in charge, Liverpool won a [...] "Treble": the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. Houllier underwent major heart surgery during the 2001–02 season and Liverpool finished second in the League, behind Arsenal. They won a further League Cup in 2003, but failed to mount a title challenge in the two seasons that followed.|$|E
500|$|At this time, {{the priests}} who {{were part of}} St. Peter were doing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to keep the faith alive in their congregation. The priests were smart men who had {{attended}} school in Italy prior to their immigration, but most were unable to speak fluent English. At a time when immigrants were desperately trying to fit into the American life and be as American as possible, going to a church where the congregation was Italian was not the most desirable choice. [...] Therefore, many Catholic Italians began going to churches and many others changed their religion altogether. Many of these Italians were becoming Protestant. [...] The priests were poorly paid and most lived on about twenty-five cents per day. They had no permanent housing: many slept in the church itself, and preferred the altar floor {{because it was the only}} place in the church that had carpeting. It was also common for the priests to say Mass several churches on the same day. These circuits trips were sometimes as much as twenty-five miles away.|$|E

[...] Kennedy had planned that Ngô Đình Diệm would be safely exiled and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. recalled that the US President was [...] "somber and shaken". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was [...] "particularly abhorrent" [...] and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that [...] "It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam." [...] When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ngô brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied [...] "No. They were in a difficult position.
