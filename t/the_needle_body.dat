5000|$|Eyed or {{reusable}} needles are needles {{with holes}} called eyes which are supplied separate from their suture thread. The suture must be threaded on site, as is done when sewing at home. The {{advantage of this}} is that any thread and needle combination is possible to suit the job at hand. Swaged, or atraumatic, needles with sutures comprise a pre-packed eyeless needle attached to a specific length of suture thread. The suture manufacturer swages the suture thread to the eyeless atraumatic needle at the factory. The chief advantage {{of this is that}} the doctor or the nurse does not have to spend time threading the suture on the needle, which may be difficult for very fine needles and sutures. Also, the suture end of a swaged needle is narrower than <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> <b>body,</b> eliminating drag from the thread attachment site. In eyed needles, the thread protrudes from <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> <b>body</b> on both sides, and at best causes drag. When passing through friable tissues, the eye needle and suture combination may thus traumatise tissues more than a swaged needle, hence the designation of the latter as [...] "atraumatic".|$|E

Electromagnetic micro- and nanoneedles may be used to selectively trap a single magnetic particle because the magnetic force is confined within a few microns of the small needle tip [10].

40|$|International audienceIn image-guided {{percutaneous}} interventions, {{a precise}} planning of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> path {{is a key}} factor to a successful intervention. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel method for computing a patient-specific optimal path for such interventions, accounting for both the deformation of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> and soft tissues due to the insertion of <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> in <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> To achieve this objective, we propose an optimization method for estimating preoperatively a curved trajectory allowing to reach a target even in the case of tissue motion and needle bending. Needle insertions are simulated and regarded as evaluations of the objective function by the iterative planning process. In order to test the planning algorithm, it is coupled with a fast needle insertion simulation involving a flexible needle model and soft tissue finite element modeling, and experimented on the use-case of thermal ablation of liver tumors. Our algorithm has been successfully tested on twelve datasets of patient-specific geometries. Fast convergence to the actual optimal solution has been shown.

40|$|Wafer probing is {{a testing}} process to inspect {{semiconductor}} wafers before packaging for defects by checking the electrical conductivity via physical {{contact between the}} wafers and the probe card. During the contact process, the shape of <b>the</b> probe <b>needle</b> and <b>the</b> mounting configuration onto the probe card have large influences on the stresses and contact force that <b>the</b> probe <b>needles</b> experience. In this paper, static performance of a vertical-type probe needle integrated with floating mount technology is analyzed with a nonlinear finite element analysis. The comparison between fixed mount and floating mount technologies {{is a part of}} the analyses. The geometry of a vertical probe needle is optimized to minimize the stress that occurs during the overdrive process, while maintaining adequate force for proper contact with the wafer. Effects of major overall dimensions of probe <b>needle</b> on <b>the</b> maximum stress and contact force is analyzed first, and then curvature of <b>the</b> probe <b>needle</b> <b>body</b> is optimized by employing a constrained minimization function, fmincon, in MATLAB. The maximum stress in the vertical probe pin at 125 µm overdrive is effectively reduced from 1339 MPa to 972 MPa by applying floating mount technology over the fixed mount, and further reduced to 666 MPa by applying the optimization scheme. The final optimized design induced the contact force of 5. 217 gf, which is in the range of the required contact force of 5 to 8 gf.

40|$|ABSTRACTDue to its {{simplicity}} and convenience, acupuncture has become popular as a complementary therapy. In this Chinese medicine, doctors {{have to find}} the traditional meridian acupuncture points before puncturing the needles into them. Moxibustion (艾灸 Ài Jiǔ) is also {{an important part of the}} acupuncture remedy. Treatment by acupuncture can be classified roughly into two types – direct moxibustion and indirect moxibustion. Warm-needling acupuncture (溫針灸 Wēn Zhēn Jiǔ) is classified under the method of indirect moxibustion. In the present study, 10 standard stainless steel acupuncture needles with 10 pieces of cylinder-shaped moxa cone (艾柱 Ài Zhù) as the heat source of warm needles were used. In order to prevent the practitioners from getting burns, it is necessary to study the temperature changes in some designated parts of the needles. Two sizes, 0. 6 g and 1. 0 g, of moxa cones were used for comparison of the measured temperatures. The needles are typically divided into two parts – the handle part and <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> <b>body.</b> In our experiment, the temperatures of WNA at different parts of the needles were measured. The larger the size of moxa cone is, the longer is the burning time. Based on the observations we suggest that when 0. 6 g moxa is used, the physicians should better pick out the needles around 9 min after ignition; however, while using the 1 g moxa, it might be safer to pick out the needles around 13 min after ignition...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} placement of epidural injections using the lumbar and caudal approaches. To identify which factors, if any, predicted successful placement. METHODS: 200 consecutive patients referred to a pain clinic for an epidural injection of steroid were randomly allocated {{to one of two}} groups. Group L had a lumbar approach to the epidural space and group C a caudal approach to the epidural space. Both groups then had epidurography performed using Omnipaque and an image intensifier to determine the position of <b>the</b> <b>needle.</b> RESULTS: <b>Body</b> mass index (BMI), grade of operator, and route of injection were predictors of a successful placement. 93 % of lumbar and 64 % of caudal epidural injections were correctly placed (p 30 v BMI < 30). A more senior grade of operator was associated with a reduced chance of successful placement (OR 0. 16 (95 % CI 0. 03 to 0. 89) consultant v other). However, small numbers may have accounted for the latter result. CONCLUSIONS: The weight of the patient and intended approach need to be considered when deciding the method used to enter the epidural space. In the non-obese patient, lumbar epidural injections can be accurately placed without x ray screening, but caudal epidural injections, to be placed accurately, require x ray screening no matter what the weight of the patient...|$|R
40|$|Background: Precise needle {{puncture}} of renal calyces is {{a challenging}} and essential step for successful percutaneous nephrolithotomy. This work tests and evaluates, through a clinical trial, a real-time navigation system {{to plan and}} guide percutaneous kidney puncture. Methods: A novel system, entitled i 3 DPuncture, was developed to aid surgeons in establishing the desired puncture site and the best virtual puncture trajectory, by gathering and processing data from a tracked needle with optical passive markers. In order to navigate and superimpose <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> to a preoperative volume, the patient, 3 D image data and tracker system were previously registered intraoperatively using seven points that were strategically chosen based on rigid bone structures and nearby kidney area. In addition, relevant anatomical structures for surgical navigation were automatically segmented using a multi-organ segmentation algorithm that clusters volumes based on statistical properties and minimum description length criterion. For each cluster, a rendering transfer function enhanced the visualization of different organs and surrounding tissues. Results: One puncture attempt was sufficient to achieve a successful kidney puncture. The puncture took 265 seconds, and 32 seconds were necessary to plan the puncture trajectory. The virtual puncture path was followed correctively until <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> tip reached <b>the</b> desired kidney calyceal. Conclusions: This new solution provided spatial information regarding <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> inside <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and the possibility to visualize surrounding organs.
