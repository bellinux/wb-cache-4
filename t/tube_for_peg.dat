40|$|Background: Artificial feeding by a {{percutaneous}} en-doscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube {{in patients}} with de-mentia has increased since {{the introduction of the}} en-doscopic method of tube placement. Few studies have documented survival benefit from this intervention. This report reviews our experience with <b>PEG</b> <b>tube</b> place-ment <b>for</b> feeding patients with dementia. Methods:All consultations <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> <b>tube</b> placementwere evaluated by a certified nutrition support nurse (L. M. M.) in consultation with a member of the gastroenterology physician staff (T. O. L.) for 24 months. Evaluation in-cluded the attainment of a brief medical history, a physi-cal examination, and a review of comorbid conditions, laboratory variables for nutrition status, and bleeding risk. Interviews with patients or surrogates were conducted, including an explanation of the risks and benefits of PEG tube placement. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to compare the median survival between patients with dementia who received a PEG tube and patients with de-mentia in whom PEG tube placement was refused. Results: We received 41 consultations <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> <b>tube</b> placement {{in patients with}} dementia. Percutaneous en-doscopic gastrostomy was performed in 23 patients; 18 patients met the medical criteria <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> <b>tube</b> place-ment, but surrogates refused placement.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Percutaneous end oscopic {{gastrostomy}} (PEG) is {{a widely}} used method for providing long-term administration of tube feeding. Different indications in relation to diseases, impairments and nutritional factors <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> placement have been mentioned in guidelines. Treatment with PEG has not been described previously for tuberculosis (TB). Our aim was to identify and describe indications and contributing factors <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> placement in TB patients. METHODS: A retrospective medical record review was conducted of 32 TB patients who required PEG from March 1996 to April 2004. Indications and contributing factors <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> placement were analysed. RESULTS: PEG placement was based on three different indications. In 18 patients, PEG was used to administer tube feeding, in 4 patients anti-tuberculosis drugs were administered and in 10 patients both tube feeding and anti-tuberculosis drugs were administered. Contributing factors <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> placement were swallowing disabilities, weakness, anti-tuberculosis drugs and their side effects, pain of neuralgic origin, hiccups and refusal of food and drugs. CONCLUSIONS: In TB, imminent and overt malnutrition, {{as well as the}} administration of drugs with a curative aim, are new indications <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> placement.

Conjugates were purified by HPLC and characterized by MALDI-TOF MS. A 96 % PEGylation yield was obtained in buffer pH 7. 5 after 6 h reaction at 20 degrees C. The anorectic activity was tested in vivo in rats.

The cumulative food intake reduction of non-modified CCK- 9 is normalized within 1 - 2 h, whereas the PEG-CCK- 9 molecules showed a prolonged anorectic activity lasting for 6 h <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 5 kDa-CCK- 9; 23 h <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 10 kDa-CCK- 9 and between 8 h and 23 h <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 20 kDa-CCK- 9. <b>For</b> <b>PEG</b> 30 kDa-CCK- 9 conjugate, neither an initial nor a cumulative FI reduction was observed.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Percutaneous {{endoscopic}} gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is {{a widely}} used method for long-term enteral feeding of demented patients unable to take sufficient food by mouth. National time trends in PEG tube use {{over the last decade}} have not been previously reported. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether use of <b>PEG</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>for</b> patients with dementia has changed over time and by race. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: All Veterans Affairs hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Using an administrative database of the Veterans Health Administration, all veterans with dementia and all veterans who received a PEG tube were identified between fiscal years 1990 – 2001. MEASUREMENTS: Proportion of <b>PEG</b> <b>tube</b> placement <b>for</b> dementia patients over time and by race. RESULTS: Four hundred thirteen thousand six hundred twenty-seven dementia patients aged 60 and older were identified, of whom 6, 464 (1. 6 %) received a PEG tube. Use of <b>PEG</b> <b>tubes</b> <b>for</b> dementia patients increased during the first half of the decade but subsequently decreased almost to baseline after peaking in 1996 (1990 : 1. 2 %, 1996 : 1. 8 %, 2001 : 1. 3 %). Time trends in the use of <b>PEG</b> <b>tube</b> feeding <b>for</b> dementia patients varied by race. Specifically, the relative risk <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> <b>tube</b> placement in African-American dementia patients increased from 1. 65 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 51. 25 – 2. 17, FY 1990) to 1. 97 (95 % CI 51. 62 – 2. 4, FY 2001). CONCLUSION: Although the overall use of <b>PEG</b> <b>tube</b> feeding <b>for</b> dementia patients decreased over time, rates in use and changes in use over time varied significantly by race.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: i) To {{test whether}} or not pH {{modifications}} of a PEG hydrogel matrix influence degradation time and bone regeneration in acute and unprepared (chronic) defects; and ii) to test {{whether or not}} the addition of a PEG hydrogel to hydroxyapatite/tricalciumphosphate (HA/TCP) can further enhance bone regeneration compared to HA/TCP alone in acute defects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 11 mini-pigs, three acute standardized defects and one chronic site were prepared in each hemi-mandible. The following treatment modalities were applied in acute defects: PEG hydrogel regular (PEG 8. 7), PEG hydrogel pH-modified plus (PEG 9. 0), PEG hydrogel pH-modified minus (PEG 8. 4), PEG 8. 7 mixed with HA/TCP granules (PEG-HA/TCP), HA/TCP granules (HA/TCP), and empty control (control). In chronic sites, PEG 8. 7 and PEG 9. 0 were applied. Subsequently primary wound closure was obtained and animals sacrificed at 10 (n =  6) and 21  days (n =  5). Descriptive histology and histomorphometric analyses were performed including measurements for newly formed bone, remaining hydrogel, and percent defect fill. Standard descriptive statistics were calculated, and regression analysis used to determine the difference between treatments, taking into account relevant factors and correction for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: In acute defects, the amount of newly formed bone increased statistically significantly over time for all treatments. The increase was higher <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 8. 7 (35. 9 %) compared with PEG 8. 4 and PEG 9. 0 and was higher for PEG-HA/TCP (24. 7 %) than for HA/TCP (14. 6 %). The remaining hydrogel ranged between 7. 6  ±  13. 3 % <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 8. 4 and 17. 7  ±  12. 8 % <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 8. 7 at 10  days. At 21  days, no remaining hydrogel was found except for PEG-HA/TCP (11. 5  ±  10. 4 %). In chronic sites, at 10  days, the remaining hydrogel covered 29. 5  ±  10. 3 % (PEG 9. 0) and 25. 6  ±  21. 8 % (PEG 8. 7) of the area. At 21  days, the amount of hydrogel (29. 7  ±  31. 7 % <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 9. 0; 1. 4  ±  2. 5 % <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 8. 7) decreased, while the amount of bone increased to 14. 0  ±  16. 3 % <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 9. 0 and to 37. 9  ±  15. 7 % <b>for</b> <b>PEG</b> 8. 7. CONCLUSIONS: The PEG hydrogel matrix with a mid-range pH (PEG 8. 7) may serve as a matrix for localized bone regeneration with or without the addition of a bone substitute material. This was demonstrated by enhanced bone regeneration in acute and chronic defects compared with control hydrogels and HA/TCP alone...|$|R
