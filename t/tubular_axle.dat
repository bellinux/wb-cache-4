2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was also}} steel tube-framed, reinforced with wood {{and covered with}} fabric. [...] The forward part, with the engine, pylon and open cockpit, had four longerons and a rectangular cross-section deepest around the cockpit, producing a tubby-bellied look. [...] Behind the cockpit, the lower longerons met to make a triangular rear cross-section, much {{like that of the}} earlier Etrich Taube's rear fuselage. [...] A single piece rounded rudder with no fin was attached to the extreme tail. A semicircular tailplane, fitted with a pair of similarly shaped elevators, was placed well ahead of the rudder, giving it plenty of room for movement. [...] Under the forward fuselage, a pair of skids formed the undercarriage, often straight with turned up front ends but sometimes continuously curved, connected to the fuselage by three struts. [...] Between them and connected with elastic was a <b>tubular</b> <b>axle</b> carrying a single wheel at each end. Some aircraft (seaplanes or idro), with somewhat different dimensions, were fitted with twin floats in lieu of wheels.|$|E
50|$|Gassers {{are based}} on closed body {{production}} models from the 1930s to mid-1960s, which have been stripped of extraneous weight and jacked up using a beam axle or <b>tubular</b> <b>axle</b> to provide better weight distribution on acceleration (beam axles are also lighter than an independent front suspension), though a raised stock front suspension is common as well. Common weight reduction techniques include fiberglass body panels, stripped interiors, and plexiglass windows (sometimes color tinted).|$|E

40|$|The study {{includes}} {{the analysis and}} investigation of inverter-fed squirrel cage induction machine drives. The particular drive used was a 120 Â° square wave inverter feeding a <b>Tubular</b> <b>Axle</b> Induction Motor developed for rail traction by British Railways. The system and its operating modes, including self-excited braking, are described. The conditions under which self-excited braking can be achieved are investigated both theoretically and experimentally and upper and lower limits to the range of permissible rotor speeds are found by several analytical methods. An original analogue model of the inverter is developed which is suitable for the investigation of inverter firing algorithms. A simpler and more efficient model is developed for the investigation of commonly used inverters. A two axis model of the induction machine is described and used to produce an analogue simulation. State-variable analysis is used to predict the steady-state waveforms and the transfer functions of the system. A simple method of predicting the frequency response of a linear or linearised system is described. Steady-state sinusoidal analysis is used to predict the limits to self-excitation. Results from the various methods of analysis are compared {{with each other and}} with results from the real system in both the transient and steady-state modes of operation. The results from the analogue model are found to give best agreement with those from the real system in both modes. Inverter losses are found to affect the boundaries of self-excitation. The possibility of using the analogue model in the development of micro-processor control for the traction system is discussed...|$|E
