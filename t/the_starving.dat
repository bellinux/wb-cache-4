5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|Caused {{in part by}} a drought, the Russian famine of 1921 was {{the most}} severe that the country had {{experienced}} since that of 1891, resulting in around five million deaths. The famine was exacerbated by government requisitioning, as well as the export of large quantities of Russian grain. To aid the famine victims, the US government established an American Relief Administration to distribute food; Lenin was suspicious of this aid and had it closely monitored. During the famine, Patriarch Tikhon called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed <b>the</b> <b>starving,</b> an action endorsed by the government. In February 1922 Sovnarkom went further by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be forcibly appropriated and sold. Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the Eucharist and many clergy resisted the appropriations, resulting in violence.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{were held}} {{six days a}} week at the Pushkin Theatre, usually from 10am to 1pm. They were {{frequently}} interrupted by air-raid sirens, and some musicians were required to undertake anti-aircraft or firefighting duties. To enable them to attend rehearsals, performers were granted orchestral ID cards to show at checkpoints. Members of the military orchestra (and some ordinary troops) were dispatched to the rehearsals to supplement the performers. Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June, and in late July were increased to 5–6 hours a day. Instruments were in poor condition and few repairmen were available; one oboist was asked for a cat in exchange for a repair, as <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> repairman had already eaten several.|$|E
40|$|Arterial [...] venous {{differences}} for metabolites across liver, kidney and hindquarters were measured in fed or starved, artificially ventilated chickens. The {{results indicate that}} the liver takes up amino acids under both conditions. Urate and glucose are released by the liver in both the fed and <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> state. Lactate and amino acids are extracted from blood by the kidneys, and this increases in <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> chicken. Urate is removed from the circulation by the kidney in <b>the</b> fed and <b>starved</b> state and excreted. In the fed bird there is no significant arteriovenous difference of glucose across the kidney, but in <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> state <b>the</b> kidney releases glucose into the circulation. The hindquarters take up glucose in the fed but not in <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> state. <b>The</b> branched-chain amino acids valine and leucine were taken up by the hindquarters in the fed, but not <b>the</b> <b>starved,</b> chicken. Glycerol is released by the hindquarter of fed and <b>starved</b> chickens. In <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> state, alanine and glutamine represent 57 % of the amino acids released by the hindquarter. Lactate is released by <b>the</b> hindquarter of <b>starved</b> chickens and represents the major gluconeogenic carbon source released by the hindquarter and taken up by kidney and liver. Although the liver is the major gluconeogenic organ in <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> chicken, <b>the</b> kidney accounts for approx. 30 % of the glucose produced...|$|R

5|$|To {{learn about}} the Yeti, which he {{depicted}} as a benevolent creature, Hergé contacted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, the author of On the Trail of Unknown Animals. After re-reading Heuvelmans' description of the Yeti, Hergé went on to research the cryptid species as much as possible. Hergé interviewed mountaineers, including Herzog, who had spotted the tracks of what he believed was an enormous biped that stopped {{at the foot of}} a rock face on Annapurna. The creature's care for <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> Chang derives from a Sherpa account of a Yeti that rescued a little girl in similar circumstances. Another influence came from Fanny Vlaminck, who was interested in extrasensory perception and the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, prominent themes in the story that also fascinated Hergé.|$|E
5|$|Until 1996, the {{domestic}} situation during Unas' reign {{was thought to}} have been disastrous, based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine. This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure, who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty. In addition, research showed that <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> people are likely to be desert dwellers, nomads distinguished by their specific hair-style, rather than Egyptians. Thus, these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of the generosity of the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events.|$|E

Her cousin, Prince Victor zu Erbach-Schönberg, was the German ambassador in Greece until the occupation of Athens by Axis forces in April 1941. She and her sister-in-law, Princess Nicholas of Greece (the mother of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent), lived in Athens {{for the duration of}} the war, while most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in South Africa. She moved out of her small flat and into her brother-in-law George's three-storey house in the centre of Athens. She worked for the Red Cross, helped organize soup kitchens for <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> populace and flew to Sweden to bring back medical supplies on the pretext of visiting her sister, Louise, who was married to the Crown Prince. She organized two shelters for orphaned and stray children, and a nursing circuit for poor neighbourhoods.|$|E

5|$|In 1315 the Nasrid Moors of Granada {{attempted}} to recapture Gibraltar but abandoned a brief siege when a Castilian relief force appeared. Eighteen years later, the Nasrid Sultan of Granada, Muhammed and the Marinid Sultan of Fez, Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman, united to besiege Gibraltar {{with a large}} army and naval force. This time the king of Castile, Alfonso XI, was unable to raise a relief force for several months because {{of the threat of}} rebellions within his kingdom. The relief force eventually arrived in June 1333 but found that <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> inhabitants of Gibraltar had already surrendered to the Moors of Fez. The Castilians now found themselves having to besiege an entrenched enemy, but they were unable to break through the Moorish defences and, faced with a stalemate, the two sides agreed to disengage in exchange for mutual concessions and a four-year truce.|$|E
5|$|In February 1800, a {{significant}} convoy under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée sent from Toulon made a determined effort to resupply the garrison. The blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson intercepted the convoy {{within sight of}} <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> troops on Malta. Perrée was killed and his flagship captured in the ensuing, but brief Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800). The following month, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell set sail from Valletta to Toulon, laden with soldiers, but this too was intercepted and in a hard-fought battle was forced to surrender to a larger British squadron. These defeats rendered the French position on Valletta untenable, and its surrender inevitable. Although Vaubois held out for another five months, he eventually surrendered on 4 September, by which time the garrison mortality from malnourishment and typhus had reached 100 men a day. Malta was retained by Britain, {{and control of the}} island was a factor in the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803. Ultimately it remained under British government for 164 years, gaining independence in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Life in {{the colony}} was perilous, and many died during <b>the</b> <b>Starving</b> Time in 1609 and the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, {{including}} the Indian massacre of 1622, which fostered the colonists' negative view of all tribes. By 1624, only 3,400of the 6,000early settlers had survived. However, European demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants. The headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to Virginia. African workers were first imported to Jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude. The shift {{to a system of}} African slavery in Virginia was propelled by the legal cases of John Punch, who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to run away, and of John Casor, who was claimed by Anthony Johnson as his servant for life in 1655. Slavery first appears in Virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662, when a law made it hereditary based on the mother's status.|$|E

40|$|Under {{anaerobic}} conditions, {{the rate}} of metabolism of lactate by starved resting cells of Veillonella dispar ATCC 17745 was very low. Because pyruvate was metabolized well by <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> cells, oxidation of lac-tate to pyruvate, {{which is the first}} step of the lactate metabolism, must have been limited in the cells. In <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> cells, <b>the</b> levels of the metabolic intermediates, oxalacetate orfumarate, ofwhich reductions to malate or to succinate could be coupled with lactate oxidation to pyruvate and initiate lactate metabolism, were quite low, suggesting that these had been reduced during the starvation steps under strictly anaerobic conditions. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> cells were unable to start the anaerobic lactate metabolism because of shortage of such reducible substrates. L-serine greatly enhanced anaerobic lactate metabolism of <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> cells. This enhancement may have been due to metab-olism of L-serine itself and conversion to oxalacetate and fumarate, which made it possible to begin lactate oxidation...|$|R

5|$|The Prussians besieged {{the many}} castles that the Knights had built {{and could not}} send large armies {{to fight in the}} west. Prussians were not {{familiar}} with Western European siege tactics and machinery and relied on siege forts, built around the castle, to cut the supplies to the garrisons. The Teutonic Knights could not raise large armies to deliver supplies to <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> garrisons and smaller castles began to fall. Those castles were usually destroyed and the Prussians manned just a few castles, notably one in Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmiński), because they lacked technology to defend the captured castles and organization to provide food and supplies to stationed garrisons. On August 29, 1261 Jacob of Liège, who negotiated the Treaty of Christburg after the first uprising, was elected as Pope Urban IV. He, having an inside scope on events in Prussia, was especially favourable to the Teutonic Knights and issued 22 papal bulls in three years of his papacy calling for reinforcements to the Knights. However, the reinforcements were slow to come as dukes of Poland and Germany were preoccupied with their own disputes and the Livonian Order was fighting the Semigallian uprising.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of his {{activities}} from then until early 545, by which time he was the garrison commander of Rome. Along with the general Conon {{he was responsible for}} the city's defence during the siege by Totila in 546. During the siege he restricted himself to passive defence, refusing to sally forth from the walls even when Belisarius, who had returned from the east and landed with reinforcements at the nearby Portus Romanus, ordered him to do so. As a result, Belisarius' attempts to succour the beleaguered city failed. Procopius heavily criticizes Bessas for his conduct during the siege. He neglected of the civilian population of the city and enriched himself by selling <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> populace the grain he had hoarded at exorbitant prices. The civilians were so exhausted by famine that when he finally allowed those who wanted to leave the city to do so, many simply died on the wayside, while others were killed by the Goths. Finally, he proved negligent in the conduct of the defence, and allowed security measures to grow lax: guards slept at their posts, and patrols were discontinued. This allowed four Isaurian soldiers to contact Totila, and on 17 December 546, the city was betrayed to the Goths. Bessas managed to escape with the greater part of the garrison, but the treasure that he had amassed was left behind for the Goths to enjoy. Following his dismal performance in Italy, Bessas was apparently recalled to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Sforza chose for his {{headquarters}} the Borromeo castle of Peschiera, south-east of the city. Starvation and suffering were rampant in Milan. At last Gaspare da Vimercate engineered a coup on 24 February 1450. The {{next day the}} citizens met, but the suggestions and opinions were of great variety, save that all condemned Venice for its apparent apathy. Da Vimercate convinced the people to surrender to Sforza. Sforza had made himself very popular for his generosity while fighting for Milan. He had abstained from ravaging the countryside as was so common among commanders of his day, and after some debate the public was convinced. The following day terms were offered to Sforza, who accepted them. Sforza earned the city's devotion by distributing food to <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> people. On 22 March 1450, he had himself declared capitano del popolo, and by right of his wife, the Duke of Milan. He secured his popular support by letting many office-holders keep their positions and being very lenient in his reprisals. The leaders were briefly imprisoned or relegated to their estates, but were generally pardoned soon after, even knighting some of his old enemies at his coronation. Ghibellines were allowed to return in safety and were restored to favor.|$|E

5|$|The Secret River is a {{story of}} Magical realism, {{blending}} real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy-Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to <b>the</b> <b>starving</b> people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment:Secret River is in my mind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Starved and fed carp (Cyprinus carpio) {{were exposed}} to {{sublethal}} waterborne copper exposure (1 ¦ÌM) for 28 d in softened Antwerp, Belgium, city tap water. Copper accumulation in liver and gill tissues was determined, and changes in branchial Na+/K+¨Cadenosine 5 ¡ä-triphosphatase (ATPase) activity and metallothionein (MT) induction in gill and liver tissues were investigated following 28 -d copper exposure. Gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity in exposed fish, both starved and fed, was at its lowest values after 3 d of exposure, after which it slowly recovered to preexposure values. No significant differences in branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity were found between starved and fed fish. Copper accumulation in the liver and gills of <b>the</b> exposed <b>starved</b> carp {{was significantly higher than}} that in the exposed fed carp. The highest MT induction was found in liver tissues. Different patterns of MT induction were observed in <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> and fed carp during copper exposure. Before exposure, MT concentrations in the livers of <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> fish were significantly higher than those in the fed ones. Copper exposure significantly increased MT concentration in the liver of the fed fish, but no changes occurred in <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> fish. In contrast, copper exposure increased MT concentrations in the gills of <b>the</b> <b>starved</b> fish during <b>the</b> first week of exposure, whereas only a slight increase in MT concentration in the gills of the fed fish was observed. When taking into account the role of feeding status in MT induction, hepatic MT was a more relevant indicator for long-term monitoring of copper pollution in carp, but gill MT provided useful information regarding short-term copper toxicity...|$|R
