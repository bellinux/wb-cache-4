Furthermore, as all traffic is being dealt with equally, there's no distinction taking place between different types of aircraft, neglecting the option of exploiting aircraft-specific (performance) information to issue customized and optimized instructions for any given <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> (i.e. by issuing climb instructions to those aircraft that can provide the best climb rates, while issuing descend instructions to aircraft providing comparatively better sink rates, thereby hopefully maximizing altitude change per time unit, that is separation).

At the end of 2011, the population of motorcycles reached 67. 83 million units and increased the composition of motorcycle on the road approximately from 60 to 70 %. The huge number of motorcycles showed the changing of traffic flow characteristics and decreased signalized intersection performance. Motorcycles movement at intersection approach is usually caused <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> between motorcycle and other types vehicles. The <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> is potential to cause the accident. Therefore, red box for motorcycle at signalized intersection is designate a space for motorcyclists to wait at a red light. Motorcyclists stop in front of other types vehicles and can proceed through the intersection first when the light turns green. This is one of the solution to reduce conflict between motorcycle and other types vehicles and increase intersection performance. Aim of this paper to analyze the influence of red motorcycle box to the <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> and traffic flow at intersection.

The <b>traffic</b> <b>conflicts</b> approach provided better understanding of collision contributing factors and the failure mechanism that leads to road collisions. This paper demonstrates an automated proactive safety diagnosis approach for vehicles, pedestrian and cyclists using video-based computer vision techniques. <b>Traffic</b> <b>conflicts</b> are automatically detected and several conflict indicators such as Time to collision (TTC) are calculated based on {{the analysis of the}} road-user positions in space and time. Additionally, spatial violations are detected based on the non-conformance of road users to travel regulations. Several case studies are described. The first case study deals of the safety analysis of a newly installed bike lane at the southern approach of a heavy volume Bridge in Vancouver, British Columbia. The results showed a high exposure of cyclists to <b>traffic</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Practical solutions to address the safety issues at the location were presented. The second case study deals with a major signalized intersection where concerns were raised regarding the high conflict rate between vehicles and pedestrians as well as an elevated number of traffic violations (i. e., jaywalking) at the intersection. Conflicts and violations were identified and pedestrian safety countermeasures were presented. The third case study deals with a before-after (BA) safety evaluation of a newly proposed design for channelized right-turn lanes at intersections. The new design, termed “Smart Channels”, decreases the angle of the channelized right turn to approximately 70 degrees. The results of the evaluation show that the implementation of the right-turn treatment has resulted in a considerable reduction in the severity and frequency of merging, rear-end, and total conflicts.

40|$|Most {{existing}} <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> indicators do {{not sufficiently}} {{take into account}} the severity of the injuries resulting from a collision had it occurred. Thus far, most of the indicators that have been developed express the severity of a traffic encounter as their proximity to a collision in terms of time or space. This paper presents the theoretical framework and the first implementation of Extended Delta-V as a measure of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> severity in site-based observations. It is derived from the concept of Delta-V as it is applied in crash reconstructions, which refers to the change of velocity experienced by a road user during a crash. The concept of Delta-V is recognised as an important predictor of crash outcome severity. The paper explains how the measure is operationalised within the context of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> observations. The Extended Delta-V <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> measure integrates the proximity to a crash as well as the outcome severity in the event a crash would have taken place, which are both important dimensions in defining the severity of a traffic event. The results from a case study are presented in which a number of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> indicators are calculated for interactions between left turning vehicles and vehicles driving straight through a signalised intersection. The results suggest that the Extended Delta-V indicator seems to perform well at selecting the most severe traffic events. The paper discusses how the indicator overcomes a number of limitations of traditional measures of conflict severity. While this is a promising first step towards operationalising an improved measure of <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> severity, additional research is needed to further develop and validate the indicator...|$|E

According to the observed relationship between overtaking conflict time, and drivers’ risk feeling membership, Cauchy distribution function was adopted as membership function.

40|$|Objective: Our study investigates whether {{trajectory}} uncertainty moderates {{the relationship}} between <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> and workload. Furthermore, we examine if the indirect effect of traffic density on workload through <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> is conditional {{on the presence of}} trajectory uncertainty. Background: Although it is widely accepted that uncertainty related to the future trajectory of an aircraft impacts air traffic controller decision making, little is known about how the presence of trajectory uncertainty impacts controller workload. A better understanding of the impact on controller workload can improve workload prediction models for en route air traffic control. Method: We collected data in a live operation environment, including workload ratings based on over-the-shoulder observations and real-time sector data. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze the data. Results: Trajectory uncertainty interacts with <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> {{in such a way that}} the positive relationship between <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> and workload is strongest in the presence of trajectory uncertainty. Furthermore, we found that the mediating effect of traffic density through <b>traffic</b> <b>conflict</b> is conditional on the presence of trajectory uncertainty. Conclusion: Our results indicate that workload prediction tools that do not incorporate trajectory uncertainty may underestimate workload under conditions of trajectory uncertainty, leading to possible overload situations of air traffic controllers. Application: Sources that generate trajectory uncertainty, as well as their interaction effects with dynamic complexity metrics, should be acknowledged in workload prediction models to increase the predictive power of these models. Implications for future air traffic management operations as envisioned by SESAR and NextGen are discussed...|$|E
