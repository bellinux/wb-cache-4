50|$|Batista's aim was {{to develop}} a utility vehicle to serve his mining company activities, as well as the Armed Forces and the general public.

The Montez was equipped with imported Peugeot's XUD-9A diesel engine and BA 7/5 gearbox, Carraro's axles and differentials. The body and chassis were made in Brazil. JPX sales were lower than expected: the projection was of 400 units sold/month, but the demand was of 200 units/month; most of them were issued to the army, park rangers and fire departments. Besides, the engines were not adapted to the diesel composition sold in the country and had overheating issues, due to a <b>turbocompressor</b> adapted to it.

A solution for solving this problem is to construct approximation models, whose behaviour is close that of the real system. The paper discusses aspects of the numerical modelling of a <b>turbocompressor,</b> used in fuel cell applications, and presents a comparative study. The first two models, one a semi-empirical approach and the other based on moving least squares algorithm (MLS), are considered as basic models. These basic models are used to develop a hybrid model of the <b>turbocompressor.</b> Thus, the paper begins with a short survey of compression FC subsystems and continues with a presentation of some approaches for compressors modelling.
