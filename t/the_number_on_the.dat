5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{top and bottom of}} the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> white jersey was switched from red to blue.|$|E

The Saints wore black pants with a wide gold stripe with their white jerseys in 1999, but following a 3-13 season and the dismissal of coach Mike Ditka, the black pants were mothballed by new coach Jim Haslett.|$|R

25|$|Before the game, Ball State players wore red T-shirts with Love’s jersey number 86on {{the front}} during warmups, and had {{stickers}} with <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{back of their}} helmets. A “We Love Dante” sign was draped over the fence just past the north end zone and Love also was named an honorary captain. MiQuale Lewis opened the scoring with a two-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. Early {{in the second quarter}}, Nate Davis threw a pass to Myles Trempe for a 31-yard touchdown that gave the Cardinals a 14–0 lead. Kent State responded late in the quarter when quarterback Julian Edelman scored on a 12-yard run to cut Ball State’s lead to 14–7. Lewis scored his second touchdown on a one-yard run with 21seconds left in the second quarter to give the Cardinals a 21–7 lead at halftime. Cory Sykes’ 10yard touchdown run in the opening minutes of the third quarter made it 28–7, and the Cardinals led by at least 17points the rest of the way. Lewis ran for 116yards and three touchdowns and Davis passed for 265yards and a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a maximum}} of 15 players from each team on a rugby field at one time. The players {{position}} {{at the start of}} the game is indicated by <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of their shirts, 1 to 15. The positions are divided into two main categories; forwards (numbered 1 to 8) and backs (numbered 9 to 15). In international matches, there are eight substitutes that can replace an on-field team member. The substitutes, numbered 16 to 23, can either take up the position of the player they replace or the on-field players can be shuffled to make room for this player in another position. Typically, the replacement players will have a number that corresponds with their intended replacement position with the numbers from 16 to 20 being forwards and 21 to 23 being backs (depending on the composition of the reserves). There are no personal squad numbers and a versatile player's position and number may change from one game to the next. Players can also change positions with players on the field during the match, and, as long as the laws are followed, any player can change positions with another player during the match. Common examples are the fly-half playing the full-back's position in defence or a prop taking the hooker's position at line-outs.|$|E
500|$|Gran Trak 10 is a single-player racing {{video game}} in which the player drives a race car along a race track, shown from above. The player {{controls}} the car with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and gear stick, as in a real car. The gear shifting requires the player to shift between reverse, first, second, and third gears as needed, but the pedals are digital controls rather than analog, so the player cannot control his speed by applying differing levels of pressure. The steering wheel turns the car only while it is being turned, rather than having a neutral [...] "straight" [...] position. Braking does not stop the car instantly and turning while braking will cause the car to skid. The course is defined on the screen by walls of white dots representing pylons, which if hit stop the car and spin it. There is only a single track layout. The track contains one black path representing an oil slick, which prevents the player's car from turning. At {{the top of the}} screen are two numbers; <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right is the remaining time in the game, starting at 78 and counting down by 2s, while <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left is the number of checkpoints the player has passed, and counts up by 2s.|$|E
50|$|Each {{team has}} a ball basin, each with 17 blue {{numbered}} balls, 1 blue ball with a question mark, 3 green balls and 3 red balls. <b>The</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> balls correspond to <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lingo card and are crossed off the card if that ball is drawn. The question mark acts as a wild card: if this ball is drawn, the team may choose any <b>number</b> from <b>the</b> Lingo card to be crossed off. However, <b>the</b> ball with that <b>number</b> <b>on</b> it remains in <b>the</b> ball basin, and should that ball be subsequently drawn, the team has effectively wasted a turn.|$|R

500|$|Two contestants {{compete on}} each episode. On each turn, a Bingo ball {{comes out of}} the hopper and a {{question}} is asked. Each ball has a number from 1 to 75 and a letter in the word [...] "BINGO" [...] printed on it. If the question is answered correctly, the player earns the letter from that ball and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball is added in dollars to the bank, which starts at $500 (e.g., if G-50 comes out, the bank increases by $50). If the letter is a duplicate already earned by the player, no extra letters are earned. The first player that spells out BINGO from the earned letters wins the game. A Free-Space Ball with a sponsor's logo acts as a wild card in the game. The player who answers a question correctly when that ball is rolled out can choose any letter, and $100 is added to the bank. Two regular games are played. Contestants who win both games win the match and receive {{all the money in the}} bank. If each contestant wins one game, a five-question tie-breaker game is played. The first question's answer begins with a B, the second question's answer starts with I, and so on. The first to answer three questions correctly wins the money in the bank and goes on to play the Bingo Bonus Board for a chance at $100,000.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the steep}} {{increase}} of oil prices in 1973, Braathens SAFE increased the ticket prices with about 30%, giving {{for the first}} year a {{reduction in the number of}} travelers. The IT-system Bracar was introduced on 4 February 1974, connecting all locations with 53 terminals, rationalizing 20 man-years. In 1974, Annæus Schjødt jr. became chair, and the following year, the employees were represented with two board members. The remaining three F-27s were sold to the Braathens Rederi-owned Busy Bee between 1975 and 1977. From 1 January 1976, Braathens SAFE introduced [...] "Green Routes", where passengers were granted 35% discount if they traveled on Saturdays or Sunday morning, booked a round trip and were away for at least a full week or over a weekend. From 1972 to 1976, the company's revenue doubled, to NOK500 million, while production increased 18%. The main contributing factor was the increase of labor costs, that had almost doubled in the four years, although also higher fuel prices and taxes contributed. In 1976, the airline transported 1,154,000 scheduled and 485,000 chartered passengers. Braathens SAFE had a 37% scheduled market share and 31% share of the charter flights. The largest traffic increases were in Stavanger, Bergen and Trondheim. During the late 1970s, Braathens SAFE increased the number of direct flights between these cities, without increasing the number of landings in Ålesund and Kristiansand. From 1 April 1977, the airline lost its dispensation to operate with reduced cabin crew, and was forced to increase <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> F-28 from one to two, and on the 737 from two to three.
