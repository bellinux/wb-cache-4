5|$|In the Gold Medal {{match in}} London, the team faced the Australia women's {{national}} wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48–46 in Sydney {{just a few}} months before, in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. They defeated the Australians 44–58 in front of a crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal, the first <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> had won in women's wheelchair basketball in 28 years. It was the first gold medal <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> had won in women's wheelchair basketball at the Paralympics since 1984. They were awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were named Team of the Year for 2012.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{month after}} this victory, Adolf Hitler issued a {{directive}} stating <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> must be ready for an offensive through France and the Low Countries. However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would take at least until the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to wait. In May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries in little more than six weeks.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causes of western Germany's remarkably poor {{performance}} since 1992. It challenges the view <b>that</b> <b>Germany's</b> poor economic record and marked deterioration in public finances since unification might be largely attributable to that event. Instead, the analysis highlights <b>that</b> <b>Germany's</b> approach to macroeconomic policymaking has starkly conflicted with economic theory and best practice. Not theunification "shock" itself, but the ill-guided fiscal and monetary policies pursued since 1991 caused the severe and protracted de-stabilization of western Germany [...] and today's ongoing crisis...|$|R

5|$|On 16 June, the Allied Powers demanded <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> unconditionally {{sign the}} treaty within seven days or face the {{resumption}} of hostilities. The German government was divided on whether to sign or reject the peace treaty. On 19 June, Chancellor Philipp Scheidemann resigned rather than sign the treaty and was followed by Brockdorff-Rantzau {{and other members of}} the government, leaving Germany without a cabinet or peace delegation. After being advised by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> was in no condition to resume the war, President Friedrich Ebert and the new Chancellor, Gustav Bauer, recommended that the Weimar National Assembly ratify the treaty. The Assembly did so by a large majority, and Clemenceau was informed nineteen minutes before the deadline expired. Germany unconditionally signed the peace treaty on 22 June.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Versailles stipulated <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> must {{relinquish}} {{several of}} its territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation—they especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war. The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.|$|E
5|$|After {{conducting}} a criminal investigation, verifying <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> would honor its military alliance, and persuading the skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, Austria-Hungary issued a formal {{letter to the}} government of Serbia. The letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands aimed at preventing the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, removing the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, arresting the people on Serbian soil {{who were involved in the}} assassination plot and preventing the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary.|$|E

5|$|An Advisory Committee on Uranium {{was formed}} under Lyman J. Briggs, a {{scientist}} {{and the director}} of the National Bureau of Standards. Its first meeting on October 21, 1939, was attended by Szilard, Teller, and Wigner, who persuaded the Army and Navy to provide $6,000 for Szilard to purchase supplies for experiments—in particular, more graphite. A 1940 Army intelligence report on Fermi and Szilard, prepared when the United States had not yet entered World War II, expressed reservations about both. While it contained some errors of fact about Szilard, it correctly noted his dire prediction <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> would win the war.|$|E

In addition, he was accused of visiting someone in Santa Fe and leaving them a blank cheque to finance the formation of a communist cell.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was moved}} to Maindiff Court Hospital on 26 June 1942, where he {{remained}} {{for the next three}} years. The facility was chosen for its added security and the need for fewer guards. Hess was allowed walks on the grounds and car trips into the surrounding countryside. He had access to newspapers and other reading materials; he wrote letters and journals. His mental health remained under the care of Dr Rees. Hess continued to complain on and off of memory loss and made a second suicide attempt on 4 February 1945, when he stabbed himself with a bread knife. The wound was not serious, requiring two stitches. Despondent <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> was losing the war, he took no food for the next week, only resuming eating when he was threatened with being force-fed.|$|E

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{question}} why firms pay for general training within the German apprenticeship system. Our hypothesis is <b>that</b> <b>Germany’s</b> wage setting institutions induce firms to do so. To test this hypothesis, we develop {{a model of}} firm-financed training that incorporates the specific features of the German collective bargaining system. We derive testable implications, and compare them with those of alternative explanations for firm-financed training, such as asymmetric information. We use a new administrative data set on workers and a panel data set on firms to test these. The evidence provides {{strong support for the}} hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>Germany’s</b> wage setting institutions and consequent wage compression favours firm-financed and firm-based training schemes. Preliminary and incomplete. and suggestions...|$|R
5|$|Hitler {{believed}} that Britain's refusal {{to end the}} war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later. He therefore decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets, or failing that, to attack and eliminate them as a factor. In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the Tripartite Pact. The Soviets showed some interest, but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Hess {{enrolled}} in the University of Munich, where he studied history and economics. His geopolitics professor was Karl Haushofer, a proponent {{of the concept of}} Lebensraum ("living space"), which Haushofer cited to justify the proposal <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> should forcefully conquer additional territory in Eastern Europe. Hess later introduced this concept to Adolf Hitler, and it became one of the pillars of Nazi Party ideology. Hess became friends with Haushofer and his son Albrecht, a social theorist and lecturer.|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, {{when the}} {{agreement}} was concluded, Lützow was fitting-out in Bremen.

The ship was then towed to Leningrad on 15 April by a private German towing company. The two navies agreed <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> would be responsible for naval escort, which included destroyers and smaller vessels. Rear Admiral Otto Feige was placed in command of the operation. Feige then led an advisory commission assigned to assist the Soviet effort to complete the ship.|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} argued <b>that</b> <b>Germany's</b> energy {{transition}} (the so-called "Energiewende") {{needs to be}} "Europeanized", {{so as to make}} the transition process more efficient. In particular, the German system of feed-in tariffs for renewables is criticized for being an obstacle to efficient European energy supply. However, we point out <b>that</b> <b>Germany's</b> approach is no outlier but rather well embedded in the European context of heterogeneous energy policies. Also, full centralization of energy policy decisions on the EU-level is neither desirable from an economic point of view nor a politically feasible option. Against this background, we identify priorities for fostering the European dimension of the Member States’ energy policies, such as the coordination of grid extensions and capacity markets...|$|R
5000|$|For Hitler, {{the twin}} {{goals of the}} party were always German {{nationalist}} expansionism and antisemitism. These two goals were fused in his mind by his belief <b>that</b> <b>Germany's</b> external enemies - Britain, France and the Soviet Union - were controlled by the Jews, and <b>that</b> <b>Germany's</b> future wars of national expansion would necessarily entail a war against the Jews. For Hitler and his principal lieutenants, national and racial issues were always dominant. This was symbolised by the adoption as the party emblem of the swastika or Hakenkreuz. In German nationalist circles, the swastika was considered a symbol of an [...] "Aryan race"; it symbolized {{the replacement of the}} Christian Cross with allegiance to a National Socialist State.|$|R
50|$|As {{tensions}} between Europe's Great Powers escalated {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, Bernstein feared <b>that</b> <b>Germany's</b> arms race with other powers was threatening {{the possibility of a}} major war.

5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio <b>that</b> <b>Germany</b> had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E
