Daigo prepares her body in front of both the Yamashita family and Mika, who had known the public bath owner. The ritual earns him <b>the</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> all present, and Mika stops insisting that Daigo change jobs.|$|E
5|$|After scoring touchdowns, Payton {{declined}} to celebrate; instead, he would often hand {{the ball to}} his teammates or the official. He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations; he preferred post-game antics such as rushing {{into the locker room}} and locking his teammates out in the cold while taking a long shower. Although Payton would have won <b>the</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> his peers and coaches by his running alone, he retired as the career leader in receptions for a running back with 492 for over 4,500 yards, and still holds the career record for a running back with 8 touchdown passes.|$|E

After establishing the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), Clark was invited {{by the government}} of Japan to establish a similar institution, the Sapporo Agricultural College (now the University of Hokkaido). Clark's fame persists in Japan where he is a household name due to the revolutionary western ideas he brought to Hokkaido and the influence he had {{on the development of the}} island. His military experience during the Civil War was an important factor in earning <b>the</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> his Japanese superiors.|$|E

5|$|Dormand opposed Britain's {{membership}} of the European Economic Community (EEC), {{and at the time}} of the referendum on EEC membership in 1975 he was an advocate for the United Kingdom leaving the EEC and rejoining the European Free Trade Association. His main work in opposition was as a member of select committee on nationalised industries, where his knowledge and inquisitorial skills won him <b>the</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> the committee's left-wing chair Ian Mikardo. In February 1972 he called for employment for miners who had been made redundant, and became Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party's Northern Group in 1973.|$|E

Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were too ill to lead the men; most actually feared losing <b>the</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair.

5000|$|Suppose, for example, that a respects b.

5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded <b>the</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E
5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose <b>the</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E

5|$|As a {{teenager}} John proves his worth and is gradually granted positions of authority, first as Master of the Falcons, then as Lord Warden of the East Marches and Constable of England. He takes all three positions seriously, devoting {{himself to the}} acquirement of knowledge necessary for effective administration. He comes {{of age in the}} midst of these busy tasks, a ready pupil to the string of men sent to advise him. He helps his father withstand the Glyndŵr and Northern Risings, and wisely gives military command to his more experienced uncle Westmorland. He understands that his administrative skill is more useful than acting as a soldier, and earns <b>the</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> the people under his control by not being unduly harsh with punishment and embarking on negotiations with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that {{guaranteed}} personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general Jorge Avilez (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning <b>the</b> <b>respect</b> <b>of</b> the troops and succeeding in reducing {{the impact of their}} more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that {{it was the last time}} he would yield under pressure.|$|E

In the final campaign of the war, {{he commanded}} German forces on the Western Front.
