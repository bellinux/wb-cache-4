40|$|The {{simplest}} {{definition of}} built up timber is {{the formation of}} structural members by connecting smaller dimension timber by nailing or gluing. Built up timber sections are used as columns, beams and slabs. The commonly used built up timber members are, a) Beams: Glued laminated beams, spaced beam, ply web beams b) Columns: Layered column, spaced column, braced column, box column c) Slabs: Stressed skin panel, laminated veneer lumber, plywood d) Timber <b>Trusse...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] A {{nonlinear}} neural dynamics {{model is}} presented as a new structural optimization technique and applied to minimum weight design of space trusses subjected to stress and displacement constraints under multiple loading conditions [...] 4 pseudo-objective function is formulated for the optimization problem {{in the form of a}} Lyapunov function to ensure the global convergence and the stability of the neural dynamic system by adopting an exterior penalty function method. The topology of the neural dynamics model consists of one variable layer and multi-constraint layers. The number of constraint layers corresponds to the number of loading conditions in the structural optimization problem. Design sensitivity coefficients calculated by the adjoint variable method are included in the inhibitory connections from the constraint layers to the variable layer. Optimum weights and design solutions are presented for four example structures and compared with those reported in the literature.

40|$|Abstract- Mechanix is {{a sketch}} {{recognition}} tool that provides an efficient means for engineering {{students to learn}} how to draw truss free-body diagrams (FBDs) and solve truss problems. The system allows students to sketch these FBDs into a tablet computer or by using a mouse just as they would by hand, a mouse {{can also be used to}} draw the sketch using a regular computer and monitor. Mechanix is then able to provide immediate feedback to the students and tell them if they are missing any components of the FBD, without providing answers. The program is also able to tell them whether their solved reaction or member forces are correct or not. This paper presents a study to evaluate the effectiveness and advantages of using Mechanix in the classroom, as a supplement to traditional teaching and learning methods. Current results demonstrate that students believe Mechanix enhances their learning and are highly engaged when using it. Future work on the refinement of the program is also discussed.

40|$|Among {{the factors}} that most likely affect the seismic {{response}} of timber roof structures are: the conceptual design of the structure, in terms of typology and of specific factors {{as the presence of}} unrestrained thrusts; the condition of the supports connecting the roof to the underlying structure; the type and condition of carpentry joints; the dimensions of timber elements; and the general state of conservation. A methodology proposed for assessing the seismic vulnerability comprises two steps. The first consists in a visual inspection of the structure, to be performed according to a standardized procedure. In the second, the information that was collected is used as the basis for evaluating a series of specific vulnerability indicators. These indicators quantify and grade the influencing factors listed above. Among them, the original conceptual design has a primary role in the capability of responding to seismic excitation. The factors associated to the structural typology that contribute positively to the seismic response, or to vulnerability when lacking, amount to: (a) a correct association of span, structural typology, and element sections according to values that comply with a sound constructional tradition, and (b) effective links between <b>trusse...</b>|$|E
40|$|Now a {{day there}} is {{pronounced}} application of Post-tensioning to steel trusses. The bridges which were earlier designed for lighter loads has {{to bear the}} increased load due to rapid urbanization and increased population and thus to replace the earlier bridge is uneconomical and also disrupts the transportation. So, these bridges are strengthened by the application of post-tensioning. Now post tensioning is most widely accepted all over since trusses consume a lot of less material compared to beams to span the same length and transfer moderate to heavy loads. In countries like India where labour cost is less post-tensioning can be utilized to the fullest extent. In the current study post tensioning {{has been applied to}} both angular and tubular trusses for 30 m span Mansard and Pratt trusses with single and double drape tendons using SAP 2000 v 15 software it has been found that with the application of Post tensioning with single and double drape tendons at the eccentricity of 0. 9 m and 1. 2 m the pre-stressing force in the members have been reduced. External Post-tensioning is considered in the present study since the tendons are outside the trusses. Here the trusses are examined for member forces, pre-stressing forces at zero deflection at the mid span of the truss, the reduction in the cross sections and weight of the members of <b>trusse...</b>|$|E
