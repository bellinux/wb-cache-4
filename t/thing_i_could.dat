Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The one <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} left their {{independent}} record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing {{to a major}} label caused many of the band's original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't {{go back to the}} punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure [...] The only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was get on my bike and go forward." ...|$|E
500|$|Ray Charles was 28years old in 1958, {{with ten}} years of {{experience}} recording primarily rhythm and blues music for the Downbeat and Swingtime record labels, in a style {{similar to that of}} Nat King Cole and Charles Brown. Charles signed with Atlantic Records in 1954 where producers Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler encouraged him to broaden his repertoire. Wexler would later remember that Atlantic Records' success came not from the artists' experience, but the enthusiasm for the music: [...] "We didn't know shit about making records, but we were having fun". Ertegun and Wexler found that a hands-off approach was the best way of encouraging Charles. Wexler later said, [...] "I realized the best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do with Ray was leave him alone".|$|E

The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ...

I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E

That same year, she gave birth to a daughter and namesake, Patricia, known as Tricia. In 1948, Pat had her second and last child, Julie. When asked about her husband's career, Pat once stated, [...] "The only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was help him, but [...] was not a life I would have chosen." [...] Pat participated in the campaign by doing research on his opponent, incumbent Jerry Voorhis. She also wrote and distributed campaign literature. Nixon was elected in his first campaign to represent California's 12th congressional district. During the next six years, Pat saw her husband move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the United States Senate, and then be nominated as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice presidential candidate.|$|E

500|$|The Cubs hired Leo Durocher {{as manager}} in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed {{interest}} in the team's fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says:... was a great player in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn't my time. Even more unfortunately, {{there was not a}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do about it. He couldn't run, he couldn't field; toward the end, he couldn't even hit. There are some players who instinctively do the right thing on the base paths.

[...] On 19 April 2014, Mourinho suffered his first ever home league defeat as Chelsea manager in a 2–1 loss to Sunderland at Stamford Bridge. He consistently played down Chelsea's title chances throughout the season and referred to it as a transitional season, slowly moulding his squad and most significantly dropping (and eventually selling) Chelsea's player of the year of the two previous seasons, Juan Mata. Chelsea went on to finish third in the 2013–14 Premier League, four points behind champions Manchester City.|$|E

2500|$|A minor {{controversy}} arose over Silverman's {{performance in}} the documentary film The Aristocrats (2005). The film shows her doing the Aristocrats joke [...] a sample of transgressive art told by numerous comedians since the vaudeville era [...] like it was an autobiographical account of {{her life as a}} child sex performer. [...] As part of the routine, she mentions that Joe Franklin, a New York radio and TV personality whose nostalgic programs aired from the early 1950s until shortly before his death in 2015, would ask her to perform privately for him in his apartment. Silverman looks at the camera and, in a deadpan voice, accuses Franklin of raping her. The film was edited {{in such a way that}} it appears as if Franklin knows what Silverman said about him. Later, after her clip, Franklin is shown stating, [...] "Sarah Silverman is a young lady to watch." [...] After the film came out, Franklin took offense at Silverman's using his name in the routine and considered suing her. A month later, The New York Times noted he remained undecided but had said, [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do is get Sarah better writers so she'd have funnier material." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ali was not {{originally}} {{a member of}} the Democratic party but changed parties after listening to Representative Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). Ali was [...] "so enamored of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions that he changed his party affiliation from Green to Democratic." [...] Ali soon became [...] "the first elected President of the District 39 Democratic Club". Ali's political activity first gained media attention when he [...] "was the Legislative District 39 Coordinator for the Howard Dean presidential campaign in 2003 and early 2004." [...] After Dean failed to win the primary, Ali supported the John Kerry and John Edwards presidential ticket. During that election season, Ali became a full-time campaign volunteer for Rep. Chris Van Hollen, because of Van Hollen's foreign policy positions and his stance on the Iraq War. During Van Hollen's 2004 reelection campaign, Ali said [...] "I'm really motivated against this war and have never felt so animated before. I thought, 'What is the most head-turning <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> possibly do?'" [...] and he [...] "bought 500 bumper stickers at a buck apiece and applied more than 400 to the car". It was noted that the family's other car was kept [...] "very pristine" [...] as [...] "That's the one his wife drives." [...] Later that year he was Co-Chair of the Montgomery County Democratic Spring Ball.

Ali hoped the event would [...] "allow people to start lasting friendships and show the ability of these groups to come together for a common good." [...] In 2005, Ali's political activities expanded when he helped form the [...] "Longdraft Road Coalition", an organization opposing the expansion of this [...] "quiet, residential two-lane road to a bustling four-lane byway." [...] Ali became [...] "co-chairman of the 180-person plus group" [...] whose efforts were largely viewed as successful. In September 2005, Ali also co-organized [...] "The 2nd annual Montgomery County Muslim-Jewish Day of Friendship".
