50|$|Ybt {{synthesis}} occurs by a mixed nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)/polyketide synthase (PKS) mechanism. Several enzymes, {{most notably}} the HMWP2-HMWP1complex, assemble salicylate, three cysteines, a malonyl linker group and three methyl groups into a four-ring structure made of salicylate, one <b>thiazolidine,</b> and two thiazoline rings with a malonyl linker between the thiazoline and the <b>thiazolidine.</b> YbtD, a phosphopantetheinyl transferase, adds phosphopantetheine tethers to the cysteine, salicylate and malonyl groups to HMWP1 and HMWP2. YbtS synthesizes salicylate from chorismate, which is then adenylated by YbtE and transferred to the HMWP2-HMWP1 assembly complex. HMWP2, which consists of two multidomain NRPS modules, accepts the activated salicylate unit through a carrier protein, then cyclizes and condenses two cysteines to form two thiazoline rings. A malonyl linker is added by the PKS portion of HMWP1, and YbtU reduces the second thiazoline ring to <b>thiazolidine</b> before cyclization and condensation of the final thiazoline ring on HMWP1’s NRPs domain. YbtT thioesterase may serve some editing function to remove abnormal molecules from the enzyme complex, and a thioesterase domain of HMWP1 releases the completed siderophore from the enzyme complex.|$|E

50|$|Since its {{discovery}} in 1967, serine protease DPP-4 {{has been a}} popular subject of research. Inhibitors of DPP-4 have long been sought as tools to elucidate the functional significance of the enzyme. The first inhibitors were characterized in the late 1980s and 1990s. Each inhibitor was important to establish an early structure activity relationship (SAR) for subsequent investigation. It {{should be noted that}} the inhibitors fall into two main classes, those that interact covalently with DPP-4 and those that do not. DPP-4 is a dipeptidase that selectively binds substrates that contain proline at the P1-position, thus many DPP-4 inhibitors have 5-membered heterocyclic rings that mimic proline, e.g. pyrrolidine, cyanopyrrolidine, <b>thiazolidine</b> and cyanothiazolidine.

This process is stimulated by the relatively slow modulation of scalar couplings and, for the systems studied, arises from slow on–off proton exchange of the amino nitrogen, a process influenced by solution temperature, acidity, and concentration. The mechanism is likely to be significant for many systems in which proton exchange occurs on the millisecond time scale, and misinterpretation of these cross-peaks may lead to erroneous conclusions should their true origins not be recognized...|$|R

40|$|Cystinosis is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} caused by malfunction of cystinosin and {{is characterized by}} accumulation of cystine. Cysteamine, the medication used in cystinosis, causes halitosis resulting in poor patient compliance. Halitosis is mainly caused by the formation of dimethylsulfide as the final product in the cysteamine metabolism pathway. We have synthesized carbohydrate-cysteamine <b>thiazolidines,</b> and hypothesized that the hydrolytic breakdown of cysteamine-thiazolidines can result in free cysteamine being released in target organs. To examine our hypothesis, we tested these analogs in vitro in patient-derived fibroblasts.

50|$|Since natural {{amino acid}} {{residues}} are usually present in large quantities, {{it is often}} difficult to modify one single site. Strategies targeting the termini of protein have been developed, because they greatly enhanced the site selectivity of protein modification. One of the N- termini modifications involves the functionalization of the terminal amino acid. The oxidation of N-terminal serine and threonine residues are able to generate N-terminal aldehyde, which can undergo further bioorthogonal reactions (shown in the first reaction in Figure 4). Another type of modification involves the condensation of N-terminal cysteine with aldehyde, generating <b>thiazolidine</b> that is stable at high pH (second reaction in Figure 4). Using pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), several N-terminal amino acids can undergo transamination to yield N-terminal aldehyde, such as glycine and aspartic acid (third reaction in Figure 4).|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "penam" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} the common core skeleton of a member of the penicillins. This core has the molecular formula R-C9H11N2O4S, where R is the variable side chain that differentiates the penicillins from one another. The penam core has a molecular weight of 243 g/mol, with larger penicillins having molecular weights near 450—for example, cloxacillin has a molecular weight of 436 g/mol. The key structural feature of the penicillins is the four-membered β-lactam ring; this structural moiety is essential for penicillin's antibacterial activity. The β-lactam ring is itself fused to a five-membered <b>thiazolidine</b> ring. The fusion of these two rings causes the β-lactam ring to be more reactive than monocyclic β-lactams because the two fused rings distort the β-lactam amide bond and therefore remove the resonance stabilisation normally found in these chemical bonds.|$|E
50|$|Most CPP-nucleic acid {{complexes}} {{that have}} been proposed so far are formed through covalent bonding. A range of CPP-nucleic acid complexes have been synthesized through different chemistries that are either stable or cleavable linkages. And {{the most widely used}} method in publication is cleavable disulfide linkages through total stepwise solid-phase synthesis or solution-phase or solid-phase fragment coupling. Some other strategies like stable amide, <b>thiazolidine,</b> oxime and hydrazine linkage have also been developed. However, those covalent linking methods are limited by the concern that the synthetic covalent bond between CPP and nucleic acid may alter the biological activity of the latter. Thus, a new non-covalent strategy requiring no chemical modification with short amphipathic CPPs, like MPG and Pep-1 as carriers has been successfully applied for delivery of cargoes. These non-covalent conjugates are formed through either electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions. With this method, cargoes such as nucleic acids and proteins could be efficiently delivered while maintaining full biological activity.|$|E
40|$|Recently we {{described}} some (thiazol- 2 -yl) hydrazones as antiprotozoal, antifungal and anti-MAO agents {{as well as}} Gcn 5 HAT inhibitors.

With the aim to identify HAT inhibitors more potent than the two prototypes, we synthesized several new (thiazol- 2 -yl) hydrazones including some related <b>thiazolidines</b> and pyrimidin- 4 (3 H) -ones, and we tested the whole library existing in our lab against human p 300 and PCAF HAT enzymes. Some compounds (1 x, 1 c', 1 d', 1 i' and 2 m) were more efficient than CPTH 2 and CPTH 6 in inhibiting the p 300 HAT enzyme. When tested in human leukemia U 937 and colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells (100 mu M, 30 h), 1 x, 1 i' and 2 m gave higher (U 937 cells) or similar (HCT 116 cells) apoptosis than CPTH 6, and were more potent than CPTH 6 in inducing cytodifferentiation (U 937 cells) ...|$|R
40|$|Cysteine {{methyl ester}} has been {{converted}} into a series of 2 -substituted methyl thiazolidine- 4 -carboxylates by reaction with carbonyl compounds including aromatic aldehydes and a- and P-oxoesters. These <b>thiazolidines</b> react with silver carbonate with the elimination of the elements of H 2 S and with the formation of transient 1 -substituted 2 -azadiene carboxylate esters. The Diels-Alder reactions of these azadienes have been shown to take place with both electron rich dienophiles (enamines) and with electron deficient dienophiles (enones). The cycloaddition reactions are regioselective but not stereoselective. Exceptionally, the intermediates act as dienophiles when reacted with cyclopentadiene. Some of the 2 -azadienes derived from oxoesters tautomerise to isolable enamines. A new example of intramolecular 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of a Schiff base of a S-allylcysteine methyl ester derivative is described. We have previously reported the generation of ethyl 2 -nitrosopropenoate 1 (1) and the analogous azo esters 2 (R = t-butoxycarbonyl, 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl, tosyl) (2). These transient heterodienes undergo cycloaddition reactions with a range of electron rich alkenes. We therefore set out to investigate methods of generation of 2 -azadienes having the general structure 3, which we hoped would also be useful as partners in the Diels-Alder reaction...|$|R
50|$|The {{chemical}} synthesis of large peptides is still limited by problems of low solvation during solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) or limited solubility of fully protected peptide fragments: even chemoselective ligation methods are hampered by self-association of unprotected peptide blocks. The elucidation {{of the relationship}} between preferred conformation of a growing peptide chain and its physicochemical properties reveals that β-sheet (beta-sheet) formation is often paralleled by significant decrease in solvation and solubility. Besides attempts to increase the solvation of peptides by external factors, few attempts, i.e. N-substituted Hmb amino acid derivatives and pseudoprolines (see figure on the top right) have been reported to modify the intrinsic properties of peptides responsible for aggregation and secondary structure formation. Pseudoprolines consist of serine- (Oxa) or threonine-derived oxazolidines Oxa(5-Me) and Cysteine-derived <b>thiazolidines</b> (THz) with Proline-like ring structure (see top right). Mutter and cooworkers have defined oxa- and thiaproline derivatives of serine, threonine, and cysteine with Ser(ψPro). Thr(ψPro), and Cys(ψPro), respectively, where the abbreviation ψPro indicates the relationship to proline (with heteroatomic ring substitution in position 4). Pseudoprolines with substitution in position 2 of the proline ring are named Ser/Thr/Cys-(ψR1,R2 Pro). Due to the preference for a cis-amide bond with the preceding residue of C2-substituted pseudoprolines, their incorporation results in a kink conformation of the peptide backbone, thus preventing peptide aggregation, self-association, or β-structure formation.|$|R
