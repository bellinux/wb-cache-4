25|$|Bercow's {{election}} as Speaker was controversial {{because he is}} believed to have had the support of very few MPs from his former party. Conservative MPs generally viewed Bercow with distrust because of his changing political views (having moved over the years from being very right-wing to become more socially liberal, leading to clashes with past party leaders), his acceptance of an advisory role from the Labour government (a party he had often been rumoured {{to be on the verge}} of joining), his general lack of good relations with fellow MPs from the Conservatives, and his vigorous campaigning for the Speaker's job. It has been speculated that he received the votes of as few as three of his fellow Conservative MPs. However, he received the votes of a large number of Labour MPs, many of whom were angered at the way they perceived Michael Martin to have been hounded out of the job and wanted his replacement <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> was not a favourite of the Conservative Party.|$|E
500|$|On August 13, 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice {{announced}} that Ripken {{had been named}} Special Sports Envoy for the US State Department {{and that he would}} be going to China in October: [...] "...we're just delighted that somebody of Cal Ripken's stature is going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> will go out and represent America so well and represent what we consider to be American values, but universal values; that hard work and diligence and the willingness to really put it all on the line every day is something that kids need to learn", said Rice. [...] "A Shortstop in China" [...] premiered on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network on May 8, 2009, chronicling Ripken's trip to China to share the game of baseball with youth and coaches while nurturing American-Chinese diplomacy. The documentary included footage from the 11 clinics Cal and former Oriole B.J. Surhoff held from Beijing to Guangzhou. The documentary also showed Ripken accepting his appointment from Rice and featured a variety of interviews, from Ripken's wife Kelly to former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Karen Hughes.|$|E

500|$|While On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was within}} its {{post-production}} stages, Richard Maibaum wrote initial treatments and a script for Diamonds Are Forever as a revenge-themed sequel with Irma Bunt and Marc-Ange Draco returning, and Bond mourning his deceased wife Tracy while Louis Armstrong's [...] "We Have All the Time in the World" [...] {{played in the}} background. When George Lazenby departed from the role prior to the film's release, a complete rewrite was requested, in addition to Maibaum's script failing to impress Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Following this, an original plot had as a villain Auric Goldfinger's twin, seeking revenge {{for the death of}} his brother. The plot was later changed after Broccoli had a dream, where his close friend Howard Hughes was replaced by an imposter. So the character of Willard Whyte was created, and Tom Mankiewicz was chosen to rework the script. Mankiewicz says he was hired because Broccoli wanted an American writer to work on the script, since so much of it was set in Las Vegas [...] "and the Brits write really lousy American gangsters"— but it had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> also understood the British idiom, since it had British characters. David Picker from United Artists had seen the stage musical Georgy! written by Mankiewicz, and recommended him; he was hired on a two-week trial and kept on {{for the rest of the}} movie. Mankiewicz later estimated the novel provided around 45 minutes of the film's final running time.|$|E
500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E
500|$|Lost {{was planned}} to be a multi-cultural show with an {{international}} cast. The producers thought it was essential that an Australian was cast for the part of Claire, and the Oceanic 815 was leaving from Sydney. Emilie de Ravin was working in Edmonton, so was unable {{to go to the}} auditions, which were being held in Los Angeles. From a video she sent to the producers, they were able to tell that de Ravin had the youth and sweetness required for the role, but also looked as though she had some life experience. Sayid was not in the original draft of the pilot episode, but executive consultant Jeff Pinkner had worked with Naveen Andrews on a short-lived ABC series called The Beast, and was keen to have him on Lost. The producers were surprised that Andrews was interested in the role. When they cast him, all Andrews was told was that Sayid was from Iraq and had been in the army. Yunjin Kim originally auditioned for Kate. At her audition she told the producers that she spoke fluent Korean, having been raised in South Korea, where she had starred in several films. The producers were impressed with Kim's performance and wrote her the character of Sun, who was planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> could not speak English, but after examining her relationship with her husband, the audience would learn that she does in fact speak it. Daniel Dae Kim was cast in the role of Jin, Sun's husband. Dae Kim described his audition as a [...] "really interesting experience". He found it especially hard as it was his first time acting in Korean, and he had not spoken in it regularly since being in high school, when he would talk to his parents.|$|E

500|$|Rose {{is used by}} Davies as an {{introduction}} to the shows mythos and fantasy elements. He later underlined similarities between Rose and Gwen Cooper—the leading lady he created for Torchwood— describing both as [...] "the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Like her successor Martha, Rose is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia makes the assumption that this is because characters from the capital of the country are [...] "relatable to all British people" [...] because they are seen as [...] "neutral". Rose is introduced alongside a supporting cast in the form of her boyfriend Mickey and mother Jackie which James Chapman cites as [...] "evidence of Davies' attempt to create a social context for the companion". Davies states that the inclusion of these two characters was part of his desire to [...] "make her real" [...] and to [...] "give her a life". He later stated that in giving Rose a mother, a boyfriend and a [...] "sad story with her father" [...] the character has [...] "her own mythology, to match the Doctor." [...] Lindy A. Orthia observes that Rose, like the other companions in Davies' era of Doctor Who, is [...] "drawn from a cosmopolitan vision" [...] in her case because of her class background. Orthia contends that whilst working-class companions had featured previously in the show [...] "none were unskilled workers nor chronically under- or unemployed like Rose, Jackie and Donna". Looking back at the two characters, Davies felt Jackie <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is [...] "holding Rose back" [...] right from the first episode due to her suggestions her daughter be content with menial employment. Piper states that this causes Rose to resent her mum somewhat, although she loves her.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{significant}} changes to this series saw the bungalow getting a garden, which replaced the basement set.

On Saturday the final Bungalow Head was a celebrity, and on Sunday it tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> the other Bungalow Heads knew (e.g. relative, teacher, etc.).

2500|$|As {{expressed}} in Sonnet 104, {{the figure of}} youth to whom the sonnets are directed towards is hinted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has had {{of at least three}} years. In attempts to match Shakespeare's references of time and known relationships, of who this figure of youth (and also W.H) [...] may be is William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, who Shakespeare may have dedicated his First Folio. While the connection seems strong, it is only speculation. Sonnet 13 shows the increasing amount of love that the speaker holds for the man and is more intimate than the previous sonnets. It is also the first of Shakespeare's sonnets where he refers to the young man as [...] "Love" [...] and [...] "My dear love." ...|$|E
2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. But {{what does it mean}} to have {{something}} like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a car or a bank account. It means <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "'I Won't Give Up' {{was written}} selfishly. As {{many of my}} songs are, I write {{for the purpose of}} {{understanding}} what the hell's going on in my life, my position in the world, processing that lesson and that miracle that I'm learning. Seeing it on the page, proving to myself that I understand the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that I can move on. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for.
