5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are too short <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>the</b> poison.

Larssen {{returned}} in 1920 as editor-in-chief. Georg Svendsen was the subeditor from 1918 until 1921, when Evald O. Solbakken {{started in the}} newspaper as subeditor.

At the time, nuclear weapons weighed several tons, {{and the need to}} carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers. They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast-radius.|$|E

5|$|Burnet's first book, Biological Aspects of Infectious Disease, was {{published}} in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to Harvard University <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>the</b> Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, {{as well as his}} sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at Fort Bragg, where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.|$|E
5|$|Cher Ami, a homing pigeon in World War I, {{was awarded}} the Croix de Guerre Medal, by France, with a palm Oak Leaf Cluster for her service in Verdun.

5|$|Delays {{in track}} laying and depot {{construction}} affected vehicle testing. By September 2009, construction {{was reported to}} be nine months behind schedule, and CAF was due <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>the</b> first trams from its factory in Spain. With key project dependency out of synchronisation, TIE held discussions with Transport for London about delivering the trams to Croydon to conduct operational tests on the Tramlink network. Tram vehicle testing commenced in March 2010 on the Siemens test track in Wildenrath, Germany. The tests included recreating the steep gradients of Leith Walk, and using weights to simulate the heavy passenger load expected during a Murrayfield match day.|$|E

We developed a method <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> hydrogels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> epicardium through the pericardial space. Our device creates a temporary compartment for hydrogel delivery and gelation using anatomic structures. The method minimizes risk to patients from embolization, thrombotic occlusion, and arrhythmia. In pigs there were no clinically relevant acute or subacute adverse effects from pericardial hydrogel delivery, making this a translatable strategy <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> biomaterials <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart...|$|R
5|$|Despite ongoing {{financial}} difficulties, Cerna {{graduated from}} university in 1906. His thesis was passed with a Magna cum laude qualifier. He was by then seriously ill with tuberculosis, and sought {{a change in}} climate. Cerna spent much of this period traveling through the Old Kingdom, and several times visited regions of the Southern Carpathians, in particular the area of RucÄr, the Bucegi Mountains, and the Jiu Valley. As CÄlinescu notes, he had bought himself a horse from a RucÄr local on credit, and failed <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>the</b> promised sum on time.|$|E
5|$|Even {{during the}} Cold War, the {{psychological}} {{impact of a}} battleship was significant. In 1946, USS Missouri was dispatched <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>the</b> remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the Balkan region. In September 1983, when Druze militia in Lebanon's Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS New Jersey stopped the firing. Gunfire from New Jersey later killed militia leaders.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{met with}} Arnold again in September 1943. He {{informed}} Arnold {{that there was}} now a second bomb shape under consideration, the Fat Man, and formally requested that further tests be carried out, that not more than three B-29s be modified to carry the weapons, and that the USAAF form and train a special unit <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>the</b> bombs. Arnold delegated responsibility for this to Major General Oliver P. Echols. In turn, Echols designated Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson as the Project Officer.|$|E
