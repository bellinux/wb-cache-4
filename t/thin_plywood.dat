25|$|The CL.II was a single-engined biplane, with an all-wooden structure. The {{fuselage}} {{was covered}} with <b>thin</b> <b>plywood</b> panelling and housed the crew of two in a single cockpit, with the observer's 7.92mm (.312in) machine gun being mounted on an elevated gun ring, giving a good field of fire, allowing downwards fire at targets on the ground. A tray {{large enough to hold}} ten stick grenades was attached to {{the left side of the}} fuselage. The single-bay wings were fabric-covered, with a swept upper wing.|$|E
25|$|In November 1916, Pfalz hired Rudolph Gehringer from Flugzeugbau Friedrichshafen GmbH. As Pfalz’s {{new chief}} engineer, Gehringer {{immediately}} commenced {{work on an}} original fighter design. The resulting D.III emerged in April 1917. Like the Rolands, the D.III used a plywood monocoque fuselage. Two layers of <b>thin</b> <b>plywood</b> strips were placed over a mold to form one half of a fuselage shell. The fuselage halves were then glued together, covered {{with a layer of}} fabric, and doped. This Wickelrumpf method gave the fuselage great strength, light weight, and smooth contours compared to conventional construction techniques. However, it also proved to be more labor-intensive and expensive. Furthermore, fuselages of the Wickelrumpf type proved to be liable to twisting or warping in service, affecting performance as well as causing control problems. This has been attributed to moisture absorption in damp front-line conditions or to the use of insufficiently seasoned wood.|$|E
25|$|Smaller much <b>thinner</b> <b>plywoods</b> {{and lower}} quality plywoods (see Average-quality plywood photo below and right) may only have their plies (layers) {{arranged}} {{at right angles}} to each other, though some better quality plywood products will by design have five plies in steps of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees), giving strength in multiple axes.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary kit {{and fully}} built houses are {{typically}} made of plywood or medium-density fiberboard (MDF.) Tab-and-slot kits use a <b>thinner</b> <b>plywood</b> and are {{held together by}} a system of tabs and slots (plus glue). These houses are usually light-weight and lower cost but often require siding, shingles, or other exterior treatments to look realistic. Kits made from heavier plywood or MDF are held together with nails and glue.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the later}} part of the twentieth century, {{there has been a}} bloom in the {{independent}} creation of unusually designed art boomerangs. These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects often do not look like boomerangs at all. The use of modern <b>thin</b> <b>plywoods</b> and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success. As long as there are somewhere in the object several airfoil contoured surfaces, whether wing shaped or not, these boomerangs can be thrown and will return. Designs are amazingly diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract. Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse.|$|R
2500|$|The DH.54 Highclere was {{designed}} to Air Ministry specification 40/22 for a larger version of the very successful DH.34 and the two aircraft had much in common, both in construction and general layout. Compared with the DH.34, the Highclere's passenger complement increased from nine to twelve, its all-up weight by 56% and its wing area by 70%. [...] They were both single-engined two-bay biplanes with fabric-covered wooden wings and with wooden-framed fuselages covered with <b>thin</b> <b>plywood.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} followed developing standard de Havilland practice, with spruce longerons cross-braced {{and covered}} in <b>thin</b> <b>plywood.</b> [...] The rudder and elevators were balanced and the fin and rudder had the familiar de Havilland shape. [...] The pilot sat directly below {{the leading edge of}} the wing and there was a dorsal observer/gunner's position. [...] Within the fuselage between them, and with three portholes each side, was a cabin for the navigator/bomb aimer. [...] The water-cooled 650hp (485kW) Rolls-Royce Condor III had a rectangular nose-mounted radiator, and drove a four-bladed propeller.|$|E
2500|$|The D.I had a {{semi-monocoque}} plywood fuselage, {{consisting of}} a single-layered outer shell, supported by a minimal internal structure. This was lighter and stronger than the fabric-skinned box-type fuselage then in common use, as well being easier to give an aerodynamically clean shape. At the same time its panelled-plywood skinning, done with mostly four-sided panels of <b>thin</b> <b>plywood</b> over the entire minimal fuselage structure, was less labour-intensive (and therefore less costly to manufacture) than a [...] "true" [...] monocoque structure. The Albatros D.I was powered by either a [...] Benz Bz.III or a [...] Mercedes D.III six-cylinder water cooled inline engine. The additional power of the Mercedes (Daimler) engine enabled twin fixed Spandau machine-guns to be fitted without any loss in performance.|$|E
50|$|Plywood {{footlocker}}s are {{a common}} type of footlocker used by the U.S. Army. They generally follow similar size and designs, undergoing only minor cosmetic changes in color and materials (from 1/2 in plywood to 1+1/4 in plywood, depending on war material needs and/or desire to reduce weight and cost of manufacture and cost of shipping). The corners are reinforced with straps of metal riveted to the locker, and had thick wooden handles on both sides for lifting by hand. After World War II, collapsible metal handles would replace the protruding wooden grips, so that each footlocker occupied less space and could be packed tighter for transportation. Each footlocker came with an internal 1/4 in (or <b>thinner)</b> <b>plywood</b> tray which could store {{some of the smaller}} items used by a soldier, and the larger items were kept below the tray.|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of new lining materials and composite structural products, modification of established products {{which lead to}} higher flammabilities, and greater difficulties in testing, and application of the ASTM E 84 test to materials {{for which it was}} never intended, have presented tunnel furnace operators with serious problems. In the case of <b>thin</b> <b>plywoods</b> and other semi-rigid lining materials (self-supporting across the width of the furnace), new methods of mounting may be required to assure both good reproducibility of results and a realistic appraisal of the behaviour of the material in an actual fire. In some cases {{it may be necessary to}} test such materials as part of a structure or assembly. ASTM E 84 has probably not attained its final and immutable form.

50|$|Henry L. Haskell {{formed the}} Haskell Manufacturing Company in 1916 to {{manufacture}} plywood. The multi-layered veneer wood panels were called haskelite. The <b>thinner</b> three-layered <b>plywood</b> could be molded into any shape desired. It {{was used in}} the construction of canoes, boats, trucks, buses, automobiles, and airplanes. The first plane made with moldable plywood was constructed with Haskelite, and was the Curtiss two-place fighter Whistling Bill.|$|R
2500|$|The Roland D.VI was {{designed}} by the Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft (L.F.G.), (whose aircraft were made under the trade name [...] "Roland" [...] after 1914 to avoid confusion with the Luftverkehrsgesellschaft m.b.H (L.V.G.)) late in 1917, with the prototype being the 1000th aircraft to be built by L.F.G., first flying in November 1917. The D.VI was a single bay biplane which discarded the L.F.G.-Roland patented Wickelrumpf (literally [...] "wrapped body"), or semi-monocoque fuselage, constructed with two layers of <b>thin</b> <b>plywood</b> strips, diagonally wrapped around a male form to create a [...] "half-shell", that used in previous L.F.G aircraft such as the Roland C.II, D.I and D.II in favour of the equally unusual (for aircraft use) Klinkerrumpf (or clinker-built) construction where the fuselage was built of overlapping thin strips of spruce over a light wooden framework. Visibility for the pilot was good, while the aircraft had above average manoeuvrability.|$|E
2500|$|The C.II {{had much}} lower drag than {{comparable}} aircraft of its time. [...] It featured a monocoque fuselage built with an outer skin of {{two layers of}} <b>thin</b> <b>plywood</b> strips {{at an angle to}} each other (known as a Wickelrumpf, or [...] "wrapped body" [...] design). This had both lower drag and better strength per weight than typical of the time, but it was relatively slow and expensive to build. [...] (This approach was further developed in the de Havilland Mosquito of World War II.) [...] The deep fuselage completely filled the vertical gap between the wing panel center sections, eliminating any need for cabane struts commonly used in biplanes, and gave the aircraft its [...] "whale" [...] nickname. Struts and wires were reduced, without suffering the weight penalty of cantilever wings, like those used on the pioneering all-metal Junkers J 1 of late 1915. [...] There was even some attempt to flair the wings into the fuselage, to eliminate dead air space, a feature prominently missing from the Schneider Trophy contestants of the following decade.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from their}} engines, the de Havilland DH.42 Dormouse and DH.42A Dingo I {{were very similar}} aircraft. The Dormouse was built to Air Ministry {{specification}} 22/22 as a two-seat reconnaissance fighter and the Dingo to Specification 8/24 for army cooperation. They were two-bay biplanes with unswept wings of constant chord, though the lower wing was slightly smaller in span and only about 73% of the chord {{when compared to the}} upper one. [...] The two trailing edges were in line and the trailing struts vertical, but the forward struts were forward-raked. Both wings carried unbalanced ailerons. The vertical tail had the characteristic DH shape, with a balanced rudder; the elevators were unbalanced. [...] The structure throughout was wood, with fabric covering on the wings and empennage, but with de Havilland's usual <b>thin</b> <b>plywood</b> cover on the fuselage. [...] There was a single axle undercarriage, with the main legs attached to the lower wing root and with bracing to the forward fuselage. [...] The pilot's cockpit was under the upper wing centre section and the gunner sat close behind at the trailing edge. [...] In the Dormouse, the pilot had an oval cutout in the wing for upward vision and the gunner a V-shaped notch in the trailing edge to ease his field of fire. [...] In the Dingo, the pilot's cutout was made smaller and circular, whilst the gunner's notch was increased to fuselage width and deepened to the rear wing spar, giving it a straight edge.|$|E

5000|$|Plywood is a sheet {{material}} manufactured from thin layers or [...] "plies" [...] of wood veneer that are glued together with adjacent layers having their wood grain rotated up to 90 degrees to one another. It is an engineered wood {{from the family}} of manufactured boards which includes medium-density fibreboard (MDF) and particle board (chipboard). All plywoods bind resin and wood fibre sheets (cellulose cells are long, strong and thin) to form a composite material. This alternation of the grain is called cross-graining and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes {{the strength of the}} panel consistent across all directions. There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced—this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, {{it is very hard to}} bend it perpendicular to the grain direction of the surface ply. Smaller <b>thinner</b> <b>plywoods</b> and lower quality plywoods (see Average-quality plywood photo below and right) may only have their plies (layers) arranged at right angles to each other, though some better quality plywood products will by design have five plies in steps of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees), giving strength in multiple axes.|$|R
50|$|A boomerang is {{traditionally}} a long wooden device, although historically boomerang-like devices {{have also been}} made from bones. Modern boomerangs used for sport are often made from <b>thin</b> aircraft <b>plywood,</b> plastics such as ABS, polypropylene, phenolic paper, or even high-tech materials such as carbon fibre-reinforced plastics. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs, such as the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumblestick, the boomabird and many other less common types.|$|R
50|$|In cabinet making, a {{web frame}} {{is the term}} for the {{internal}} structural frame of a cabinet which provides the support for drawers.

50|$|The H.IX was {{of mixed}} construction, {{with the center}} pod made from welded steel tubing and wing spars built from wood. The wings were made from two <b>thin,</b> carbon-impregnated <b>plywood</b> panels glued {{together}} with a charcoal and sawdust mixture. The wing had a single main spar, penetrated by the jet engine inlets, and a secondary spar used for attaching the elevons. It was designed with a 7g load factor and a 1.8× safety rating; therefore, the aircraft had a 12.6g ultimate load rating. The wing's chord/thickness ratio ranged from 15% at the root to 8% at the wingtips. The aircraft utilized retractable tricycle landing gear, with the nosegear {{on the first two}} prototypes sourced from a He 177's tailwheel system, with the third prototype using an He 177A main gear wheelrim and tire on its custom-designed nosegear strutwork and wheel fork. A drogue parachute slowed the aircraft upon landing. The pilot sat on a primitive ejection seat. A special pressure suit was developed by Dräger. The aircraft was originally designed for the BMW 003 jet engine, but that engine was not quite ready, and the Junkers Jumo 004 engine was substituted.|$|R
50|$|Investing $6,000 of poker winnings, Head {{rented the}} corner of an {{electrical}} shop and started work on a composite ski. The main portion of the ski was built of the standard laminate, but this left the edges of honeycomb exposed. For protection, he capped the sides with <b>thin</b> sheets of <b>plywood.</b> The ski was laid up in pieces {{and covered with a}} thermosetting shoemaker's glue. The glue required pressure and heat to bond, which normally required large moulds to provide the pressure. Head {{came up with the idea}} of placing the skis in a heavy rubber bag, pumping out the air to produce a vacuum to provide pressure, and then immersing the entire assembly in a barrel of boiling crankcase oil.|$|R
50|$|Construction was as per {{standard}} Fokker practice, {{with the}} wing being made {{almost entirely of}} wood with two main spars and light ribs covered in <b>thin</b> sheets of <b>plywood.</b> The fuselage was built up from welded steel tubes, largely cross-braced with wires. Fairings, the floor and an internal bulkhead separating the pilot from the cabin were wood. A triangular-shaped door gave the pilot access to the cabin. The tail was also built up from steel tubing but used no internal bracing. The main structural members were larger diameter tubes, while smaller tubes gave the structure a small degree of camber. The standard undercarriage consisted of a tailskid with divided main gear legs sprung with bungee cords and attached to the wings and the fuselage, but floats or skiis could also be fitted.|$|R
