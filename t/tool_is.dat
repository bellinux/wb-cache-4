5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of a {{graphical}} controller interface in the standard (non-server) Mac OS X distribution, it is possible to set up an Xgrid controller via the command line tools xgridctl and xgrid. Once the Xgrid controller daemon is running, administration of the grid with Apple's Xgrid Admin <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> possible. Some applications, such as VisualHub, provided Xgrid controller capability through their user interfaces.|$|E

50|$|An {{improvement}} on CAT <b>Tooling</b> <b>is</b> BT <b>Tooling,</b> which looks similar and {{can easily be}} confused with CAT tooling. Like CAT Tooling, BT Tooling comes {{in a range of}} sizes and uses the same NMTB body taper. However, BT <b>tooling</b> <b>is</b> symmetrical about the spindle axis, which CAT <b>tooling</b> <b>is</b> not. This gives BT tooling greater stability and balance at high speeds. One other subtle difference between these two toolholders is the thread used to hold the pull stud. CAT <b>Tooling</b> <b>is</b> all Imperial thread and BT <b>Tooling</b> <b>is</b> all Metric thread. Note that this affects the pull stud only, it does not affect the tool that they can hold, both types of <b>tooling</b> <b>are</b> sold to accept both Imperial and metric sized tools.|$|R

25|$|Parting: The <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> fed {{radially}} {{into the}} workpiece {{to cut off}} the end of a part.|$|E
25|$|The {{tools are}} usually mounted in a {{dedicated}} bore finishing machine, however {{they can also}} be mounted in a milling machine. In either case the tool, workpiece, or both are rotated and the <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> plunged into the bore and removed. The part is then transferred to the next station or a larger <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> mounted and a larger bore machined, and the process repeated until the desired bore geometry is reached. The number of tools required to achieve the desired bore size is dependent on the workpiece material, the amount of stock to be removed and geometrical requirements, with four to six tool pieces being common. Each <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> progressively larger than the last, but in diminishing increments; as the stock removal is reduced, so is the tool's diamond grit size.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{the severe}} surface/subsurface damage of Al 2 O 3 ceramic ground by diamond {{grinding}} wheel, the chemical-mechanical grinding (CMG) <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> studied in this paper. According {{to the principle}} of CMG, three types of CMG tools with different abrasives were developed. The chemical compositions of the grinding <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> selected and optimized considering the physicochemical characteristics of Al 2 O 3 ceramic. By comparing the surface roughness and material removal rate (MRR) of Al 2 O 3 ceramic respectively ground with SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3 and MgO grinding tools, the grinding performance of those grinding <b>tools</b> <b>were</b> evaluated. The experiment results showed that the grinding performance of SiO 2 grinding <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> the best. The surface roughness and MRR versus SiO 2 grinding <b>tool</b> <b>were</b> all better than other grinding tools, and can reach 28 nm and 15 µm/h respectively. The grinding performance of Fe 2 O 3 grinding <b>tool</b> <b>was</b> the worst...|$|R
