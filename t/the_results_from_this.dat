5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E

2500|$|Smog is {{a serious}} problem in many cities and {{continues}} to harm human health. Ground-level ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are especially harmful for senior citizens, children, and people with heart and lung conditions such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. It can inflame breathing passages, decrease the lungs' working capacity, cause shortness of breath, pain when inhaling deeply, wheezing, and coughing. It can cause eye and nose irritation and it dries out the protective membranes of the nose and throat and interferes with the body's ability to fight infection, increasing susceptibility to illness. Hospital admissions and respiratory deaths often increase during periods when ozone levels are high. There is a lack of knowledge on the long-term effects of air pollution exposure and the origin of asthma. An experiment was carried out using intense air pollution {{similar to that of the}} 1952 Great Smog of London. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> [...] experiment concluded that there is a link between early-life pollution exposure that leads to the development of asthma, Proposing the ongoing effect of the Great Smog.|$|E
2500|$|The regime {{shift that}} {{occurred}} in the 2006 election, however, can be traced to changes in popularity between the party - blocs prior to the campaign really started and to the timing of two extreme natural disasters that combined had a dramatic impact on the Swedish political landscape. In a dissertation from the Department of Government at Uppsala University, entitled [...] "Natural Disasters and National Election", PhD Lina M. Eriksson found in her research that the Indian Ocean’s 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami and 2005 Storm Gudrun (Erwin), which struck only two weeks following the tsunami, impacted on the 2006 historic regime shift {{that occurred in}} the 2006 Swedish parliamentary election. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> research show that the 2002-2006 incumbent Social Democratic Party's (S) poor crisis response to Gudrun, which is the hitherto most costly natural disaster in Swedish history, alone has an estimated effect of a magnitude that likely was crucial to the 2006 historic regime shift. In the abstract to the thesis one can read [...] "The 2002-2006 incumbent Social Democratic Party (S) received its lowest voter support since 1914 as roughly 150,000, or 8%, of the 2002 S voters went to the main opposition, the conservative Moderate Party (M). This became the most decisive factor in ousting S from power after 12 years of rule. As a result, the M-led Alliance (A) with the People's Party (FP), the Center Party (C), and the Christian Democrats (KD) won the election. Natural Disasters and National Election makes the novel contribution of proposing two natural disasters, the Indian Ocean’s 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami and 2005 Storm Gudrun (Erwin), which struck only two weeks following the tsunami, as major events that impacted government popularity in the 2006 election and contributed to the redistribution of voter support, within and across party-blocs. The core findings from this thesis show that the S government’s poor crisis response to Gudrun, which is the hitherto most costly natural disaster in Swedish history, alone has an estimated effect of a magnitude that likely contributed to the 2006 historic regime shift, while the tsunami also seems to have mattered. The tsunami is particularly interesting, as S’s poor international crisis response to the event constitutes the first natural disaster situation to knowingly have affected an election {{on the other side of}} the planet. Moreover, to some degree voters recognized the active opposition by C as effective representation and rewarded the party for its strong stance on the poor handling of both events by S. In fact, the active voice of C concerning these disasters likely helped move the party from the periphery of party politics to becoming the third-largest party in Swedish politics. In sum, this research investigates accountability and effective party representation via retrospective voting, which is an essential mechanism for the legitimacy of democracy. Findings suggest that the average Swedish voter indeed may be voting retrospectively to hold publicly elected officials accountable, which suggest a healthy status of the retrospective voting mechanism and Swedish democracy." [...] Part of the dissertation has also been published in Electoral Studies, which is to be considered the leading scientific journal in election research. In the article [...] long-term effects are also found over the 2010 and 2014 election, which implies that the Storm triggered long-lasting changes in voter support from the left to the right side of the political spectrum.

40|$|We {{examine the}} success of the {{privatization}} reform in China by evaluating the changes in performance of the State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) after the Split-Share Structure reform in 2005, considering the changes in ownership structure. This study investigates how the ongoing privatization process in China is affecting the performance of SOEs. Existing studies made in other economies confirm that private ownership has a positive impact on the performance of the SOEs in contrast to state ownership. The Split-Share Structure reform is the large event by the Chinese government in order to reach the establishment of a modern corporate system. The methodology utilized consists of a Random Effects panel analysis. The data covers annual data for 1135 firms listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange over a six-year period, ranging from 2003 to 2008. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> study shows that the state ownership ratio of Chinese SOEs have been decreasing after the reform was introduced in 2005. Further, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> implies significant improvements in performance of the SOEs after <b>the</b> reform. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> study also shows that private ownership is superior to state ownership in consideration to improvements in performance, since an increase in the state ownership ratio would lead to a decrease in the market value of the firm...|$|R
