As <b>the</b> lower <b>baseline</b> pixels belong to the lower edge of the word images, we first locate vertically the black–white transitions at the black pixels where the resulting image would emphasize <b>the</b> <b>baselines</b> of <b>the</b> text. Once the skew angle is determined using a randomized Hough transform, <b>the</b> <b>baselines</b> are extracted using y-intercept histogram.

5|$|Proposed {{transportation}} {{management strategies}} {{are aimed at}} keeping traffic into Aspen at <b>the</b> <b>baseline</b> 1993 level through 2015. There are three levels or strategic response: The first would be when that baseline is equaled or slightly exceeded. It would consist of promoting ride sharing and more extensive transit use, among other informational measures. At Level 2, when traffic reaches a few percentage points above that level, more transit service would be added, and parking rates raised slightly to fund the additional buses required to reduce headways. Level 3 would be implemented when traffic levels had exceeded <b>the</b> <b>baseline</b> by 5–10%, and would use more forceful measures such as steeper increases in parking fees, deliberately {{limiting the number of}} spaces available, and making some parts of downtown Aspen car-free zones.|$|E

5|$|Delambre used a {{baseline}} of about 10km in length along a straight road, located close to Melun. In an operation taking six weeks, <b>the</b> <b>baseline</b> was accurately measured using four platinum rods, each of length two toise (about 3.9m). Thereafter he used, where possible, the triangulation points used by Cassini in his 1744 survey of France. Méchain's baseline, {{of a similar}} length, and also on a straight section of road was in the Perpignan area. Although Méchain's sector was half the length of Delambre, it included the Pyrenees and hitherto unsurveyed parts of Spain. After the two surveyors met, each computed the other's baseline in order to cross-check their results and they then recomputed the kilometre. Their result came out at 0.144lignes shorter than the provisional value, a difference of about 0.03%.|$|E
5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against <b>the</b> <b>baseline</b> risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|Monotype later {{created a}} bold and bold italic (called a {{semi-bold}} in some digitisations) {{to match the}} roman and italic of the original release. (True bold type {{did not exist in}} Kis's time.) Released in 1967, Fleet Titling was a capitals-only alphabet intended to serve as a companion for titling use. It was created by Monotype's occasional collaborator John Peters, a Cambridge University Press designer who also worked as a private printer. Monotype used it for their logo and letterhead. More oddly, Monotype in the 1960s used Ehrhardt as a base for printing in the Initial Teaching Alphabet. This alphabet system, intended to be used to teach children to read, used alternative characters for different sounds spelled with the same letter, like t's and c's dropped below <b>the</b> <b>baseline</b> of the text.|$|E

An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military version like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the world's largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit on the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed correlations between tornadoes {{and patterns of}} lightning. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface and returns to <b>the</b> <b>baseline</b> level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have {{little or nothing to}} do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.|$|E
