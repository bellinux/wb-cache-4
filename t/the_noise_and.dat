Following complaints about <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> high crime levels generated by the fair, a group of residents bought the fairground in 1855, converting it into the park which remains today.|$|E
5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} due to <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> mess {{made and the}} smell of the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E

Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine.

5|$|Starting {{with the}} album Blood Fire Death, {{one of the}} first {{definitive}} Viking metal releases, Bathory incorporated a diverse range of musical elements. While retaining <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> chaos of previous recordings, the band took a more sorrowful and melodic approach, working in ballads based on Germanic and Norse folklore, shanty-like melodies and folk music elements such as bourdon sounds, Jew's harps, and fifes. Bathory added natural found sounds, such as ocean waves, thunder, and wild animal noises, in a style similar to that of musique concrète. Instruments were sometimes used to create onomatopoeic effects such as drum sounds imitating thunder or a sledgehammer. The songs typically featured multi-sectional formal structures, following a pattern of three instrumental sections– introduction, bridge, and finale– and two vocal sections– stanza and refrain.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a local access road and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E

METHODS: Different models were investigated either including <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> level <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> annoyance variables separately, or simultaneously, or together with an interaction term referring to <b>the</b> same <b>noise</b> source for <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> level <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> annoyance. RESULTS: Significant effect modification was found {{with respect to the}} association between aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> hypertension. <b>The</b> association was stronger in more annoyed subjects. No clear interaction was found with respect to road traffic <b>noise.</b> <b>The</b> comparison of the magnitude of the main effects (per standard deviation or inter-quartile range) of <b>noise</b> level <b>and</b> <b>noise</b> annoyance variables revealed stronger associations with hypertension for <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> levels. CONCLUSION: There is some indication that <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> level has a stronger predictive meaning for <b>the</b> relationship between <b>noise</b> exposure <b>and</b> hypertension than <b>the</b> reported <b>noise</b> annoyance (main effects). The results from the Hyena study support <b>the</b> hypothesis that <b>noise</b> annoyance acts as an effect modifier of the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> level <b>and</b> hypertension...|$|R
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>and</b> confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E

Children, the elderly and people with respiratory problems suffered most acutely. Roughly €25million (US$37.25million) was allocated by the government of the Canary Islands in relief and reconstruction funds. Of this total, €22.5million (US$33.5million) was used to repair infrastructure and utilities; €1.5million (US$2.2million) was used for agricultural relief; and €1million (US$1.5million) was used in home repairs. Due to the severity of crop losses, farmers would be given a grant from the government that would cover 50% of their losses, including infrastructural. A tax break was also given to most residents who suffered damage from Delta.|$|E
