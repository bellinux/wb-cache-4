5|$|It is {{generally}} accepted by historians that, although Otto failed, he deeply loved Greece {{as his own}} new homeland.

5|$|The western tomb {{was built}} {{subsequently}} {{to the eastern}} one and seems to have served to bury another woman. Builders graffiti uncovered during the Czech excavations demonstrate in all likelihood that the monument was built under Nyuserre, its owners possibly amongst the last members of the broader royal family <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> Abusir, the necropolis being abandoned by Nyuserre's successor Menkauhor.|$|E

He is buried with his three wives, although only two are depicted on the sarcophagus designed by Willem Boy. The king and his wives are interred in {{what was once the}} Chapel of the Virgin Mary. The only remaining indication of the original intention of the chapel are the painted yellow stars against a blue background on its vaulted ceiling, symbols of Saint Mary in Catholic tradition.|$|E
5|$|In Part Three, Henri Christophe {{has become}} the first King of Haiti and {{subjects}} the black population to worse slavery than that experienced under French rule. His regime carries out brutal torture and grips the city in fear. He is later tormented by thunder strikes and magical, ghostly appearances of previously tortured subjects. As the black population revolts against his rule, he finds himself alone and deserted. In this state he commits suicide by shooting himself. His body is taken <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> a fortress on a mountain and this becomes his mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli had a {{heart attack}} shortly after the Six Day War (5â€“10 June 1967). Feeling a pain in his chest he was taken to a {{hospital}} on 29 June. He died in Beirut on 30 June. According to Syrian historian Sami Moubayed, Quwatli died after learning of the defeat of the Syrian and Arab armies. The Ba'athist-dominated government refused to allow Quwatli's body <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> Damascus and only relented after diplomatic pressure from King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. An honorary funeral organized by the state was held for him on 1 July.|$|E

5|$|Starting 260million years ago, the yellowish-gray {{limestone}} of the fossil-rich Kaibab Limestone {{was laid}} {{down as a}} limy ooze in a tropical climate. During this time, sponges, such as Actinocoelia meandrina, proliferated, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> lime mud and their internal silica needles (spicules) dissolved and recrystallized to form discontinuous layers of light-colored chert. In the park, this formation {{can be found in}} the Hurricane Cliffs above the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center and in an escarpment along Interstate 15 as it skirts the park. This is the same formation that rims the Grand Canyon to the south.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, Crompton's textile sector {{had been}} closely linked {{with that of}} Rochdale and Saddleworth {{in the north and}} east; it was a woollen {{manufacturing}} district. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased, Crompton mirrored developments in Oldham and Manchester in the south and southwest, importing raw cotton and making cotton cloth. To ensure that the woollen trade was kept buoyant, a law existed from 1675 to 1814 to encourage Shaw and Crompton's wool production. It required that the deceased were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> woollen garments.|$|E
5|$|Bodies {{recovered}} were {{preserved and}} taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. A large temporary morgue {{was set up in}} a curling rink and undertakers were called in from all across Eastern Canada to assist. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim the bodies of their relatives. Some bodies were shipped <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Of the remaining 150 unclaimed bodies, 121 were taken to the non-denominational Fairview Lawn Cemetery; 19 were buried in the Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery, and 10 were taken to the Jewish Baron de Hirsch Cemetery. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered.|$|E

5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy {{as well as his}} son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Santiago's {{military}} prosecutor {{prohibited the}} unmarked bodies from being incinerated or removed, though Walkowitz and Knauer wrote in Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space {{that the military}} government dug up and hid hundreds of these bodies in 1982. Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought disclosure of the truth and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. The commission's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly after the coup, executed by gunshot, and presumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> Patio 29. Patio 29 was the largest of about twelve Pinochet era mass graves identified and searched.|$|E
5|$|In malignant-type {{smallpox}} (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remained almost {{flush with}} the skin {{at the time when}} raised vesicles form in the ordinary type. It is unknown why some people developed this type. Historically, it accounted for 5â€“10 percent of cases, and the majority (72 percent) were children. Malignant smallpox was accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasted 3â€“4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of toxemia. The rash on the tongue and palate was extensive. Skin lesions matured slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they were flat and appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buried</b> <b>in</b> the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contained little fluid, were soft and velvety to the touch, and may have contained hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox was nearly always fatal.|$|E
