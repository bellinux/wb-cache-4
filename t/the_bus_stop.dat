5|$|Tréluyer {{was delayed}} by slower traffic, {{allowing}} Conway to overtake him for fourth position before the Audi driver ran wide at <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane. Van der Garde's car's sustained a damaged mirror and was ordered by race control {{to have it}} repaired at his scheduled pit stop. Buemi closed the gap to Lucas di Grassi in Audi's No. 8 entry and attempted to pass him driving into Eau Rouge and Raidillon but di Grassi was able to pull away on the Kemmel Straight. Buemi moved to the outside line at Blanchimont and moved in front of di Grassi, who went through grass, at <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane for second place. Marino Franchitti's No. 67 Ford made contact with Aguas's car at Les Combes but both drivers were able to continue, although Augas lost the LMGTE Am lead. Conway locked his tyres and collided heavily with Victor Shaytar's delayed No. 37 SMP Racing car going into <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane while attempting {{to close the gap}} to di Grassi. Conway immediately drove into the pit lane for repairs to his car's front-end. Both Porsche cars made pit stops after 49 minutes which saw Jani taking over Lieb's driving duties while Hartley switched positions with Bernhard.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} pull away from Trulli. Although Button tried to pass Trulli on the fourth lap at <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane, he ran wide and lost third {{position}} to Michael Schumacher. On that lap, Alesi was the first driver to pit for dry tyres. By the beginning of the fifth lap Häkkinen increased his lead over Trulli to ten seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Button and Coulthard. Button attempted to overtake Trulli around the outside of <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane, but left the inside open for Schumacher to pass him for third place.

Lieb passed Tandy to take over second position, while Fässler moved to third, after passing Tandy at <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane at the first lap's conclusion. Tandy reclaimed third from Fässler shortly afterward. Team SARD Morand held the LMP2 lead before its car was overtaken by Tincknell and Bird on lap two. Duval moved in front of Wurz for fifth and the Toyota driver dropped to seventh. Jota Sport was issued with a drive-through penalty after its car was adjudged to have jumped the start and rejoined in sixth in LMP2, allowing Bird {{to the front of}} the category. Tandy drove to the inside of Estre to lap him, but made head-on contact with his car and went straight into the Pif Paf corner barrier. Both drivers continued, but Tandy drove into the pit lane for repairs, falling to the rear of the field. Fässler battled with Lieb for second as the two moved through slower traffic, but the Audi driver spun at <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane allowing Lieb to take over second.

5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's left-hand window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the left-hand turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E
5|$|The final {{practice}} session occurred in sunny weather conditions. Timo Bernhard set the fastest timed lap {{of the weekend}} so far at one minute and 56.456 seconds in the No. 1 Porsche, 1.6 seconds faster than the second quickest car driven by team-mate Jani. Loïc Duval made contact with Christian Ried's No. 78 Proton Porsche 911 RSR driving into <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane in the session's halfway period, damaging his vehicle's front-left quarter, but managed {{to return to his}} garage where it remained until the end of practice for repairs to its bodywork. René Rast was the fastest LMP2 driver in the No. 26 G-Drive Oreca with a time of two minutes and 7.341 seconds, four-tenths of a second quicker than Nelson Panciatici's No. 35 Signatech Alpine Oreca.

5|$|Buemi elected not {{to change}} tyres and gained the overall lead. Conway later served a drive-through penalty for his {{collision}} with Shaytar. The repairs to Van der Garde's vehicle meant he was stationary in his pit stall for four minutes which allowed Merhi to inherit fifth position in LMP2. Tréluyer reported to Audi that his car had no front downforce, while Buemi went off the track at Raidillon {{in his effort to}} push hard to extend his lead over Bernhard. Buemi was held up by one of the SMP entrants and an Aston Martin at Fagnes causing his advantage to be reduced to 1.015 seconds. The Toyota driver missed his braking point at <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane and went wide at La Source shortly afterwards, causing him to lose the first position to Bernhard. Buemi reclaimed the position at Eau Rouge but temporarily fell to second again after Bernhard overtook him on the Kemmel straight and retook the place before the entry to Les Combes. At Blanchimont corner, Bernhard avoided colliding heavily with the rear-end of Buemi's car after the latter slid while lapping Gulf Racing's Porsche entry.|$|E

Nixon attempts to escape with the videotape, and Jonathan chases out into the storm after him. The ship levitates off the ground and flies out of the storm cellar. Lana says goodbye to Whitney and drives home. On her way, storm winds force her off the road, right next to three tornadoes that have touched down. The students at the dance are alerted to the tornados that have been sighted, and Clark races off to make sure Lana is all right. The three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in Lana's direction. Clark arrives just as Lana, in the truck, is sucked into the tornado's vortex; Clark speeds into the tornado to rescue her.|$|E
5|$|During {{the yellow}} flag period, some cars elected to make pit stops, and Ricardo González spun the No. 43 RGR Sport Ligier. The No. 7 Audi rejoined the race after repairs to its floor which was damaged {{when the car}} drove over a kerb and its ducts {{required}} cleaning after rubber picked up from the circuit caused the vehicle to overheat. The entry rejoined in 15th place overall. The race restarted 12 minutes later with Davidson leading the field, ahead of the No. 8 Audi. Kobayashi immediately got ahead of Dumas to move into third position. Manor's No. 31 entry driven by Richard Bradley overtook the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports car of Chris Cumming at Eau Rouge for fourth place in LMP2. Nathanaël Berthon's No. 26 vehicle had its left-rear tyre punctured following contact with Abu Dhabi Proton's No. 88 Porsche at La Source, while Andy Priaulx in the No. 67 Ford passed Dempsey-Proton's No. 77 car for fifth place in LMGTE Pro. Berthon went off the track at <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane while attempting to drive into the pit lane.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen was five seconds ahead of Hamilton, but Hamilton began to close in on Räikkönen during the last stint {{as a result of the}} tyres better suiting his McLaren Mercedes. Heavy rain began to fall on lap41. Hamilton closed the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, still sixseconds ahead of Massa. Hamilton {{attempted}} to pass Räikkönen at <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>Stop</b> chicane, but he cut across the corner. Consequently, Hamilton led out of the chicane but allowed Räikkönen to re-pass him halfway down the straight. Hamilton then passed him again at the La Source hairpin under braking. Räikkönen tried to double-back on Hamilton to regain the position but the line was defended, resulting in Räikkönen touching his front wing on Hamilton's rear tyre. The rain started coming down more heavily and Nico Rosberg spun at Fagnes corner, rejoining in front of the two frontrunners and causing Hamilton to run onto the grass. At the next corner, Räikkönen spun and gave the lead back to Hamilton. Räikkönen then lost control of his Ferrari through the Blanchimont corner and collided with the barrier, ending his race.|$|E
