One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> is mentioned is that he lived for a time with the Corwid of the Free, the insane residents of the forests of Zenozoik. While he has turned away from his past life as a Corwid, his brothers and sisters still consider him as one. Ghat still harbors a sense of admiration for the single-mindedness of Corwids. Regardless, when he encounters them a fight ensues.|$|E

25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising {{is that it is not}} one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> comes to mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E

25|$|The Orthodox Church was an {{accepted}} institution under the Ottomans, {{in contrast to}} Catholicism which was associated with enemy Austria, and actually grew in size during Ottoman rule. This included the building of churches and monasteries. Its administration continued to function though in lesser degree, no longer being the state religion. One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Mehmet the Conqueror did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, Gennadius Scholarius. The Hagia Sophia and the Parthenon, which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium were converted into mosques, yet most other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. They were endowed with civil as well as ecclesiastical power over all Christians in Ottoman territories. Because Islamic law makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single millet, or nation. The patriarch (usually an ethnic Greek) as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made ethnarch, head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were {{under the control of}} Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. Mike Reiss, show runner of The Simpsons with Al Jean at the time, said Meyer wrote most of the episode by himself without help from the show's other writers. Few changes {{were made to the}} first draft that he pitched to the producers; it was near identical to the final script. The episode was inspired by the vocational tests taken by several members of the show's staff when they went to school; Reiss, for example, said he was told he would become a librarian. Jean said [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> sold us on doing the episode" [...] was the idea of Bart becoming a policeman. He said it was [...] "a funny, realistic depiction of what a kid like Bart might wind up to become, and it wasn't something you would immediately think of." [...] Jean said the episode deals with the emotion that many adults feel when they grow older and realize that {{they are not going to}} achieve the dreams they once had. [...] " [...] how people in life cope with that problem. Maybe Lisa, at eight years old, is a little bit young to worry about that, but that's what we were trying to explore here." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{island has}} been {{structured}} {{to provide a}} fair mix of puzzle solving, exploration, and narrative elements while avoiding a [...] "paradox of choice" [...] by giving the player too much freedom and not knowing where to go next. According to artist Luis Antonio, one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Blow wanted the player to see was the mountain to make them aware as this being their ultimate goal. The game initially started the player in an abandoned bunker converted to living space, but as it was originally arranged, the player would exit the bunker not facing the mountain. Though they attempted to move and rotate the bunker space around to meet Blow's goal, it was ultimately scrapped {{in favor of a}} simpler space with interior elements that fit with other portions of the game, and which the player would climb out into the external environment with the mountain in full view. This introductory area was also meant to serve as the game's tutorial, helping players to understand fundamental mechanics of one must switch between solving puzzles and exploring the environment to find others, and Thekla spent a great detail of time fine-tuning the details to be clear without verbal explanation. The team's artists worked to support Blow's objective of guiding the player by using contrasts of color and of natural and man-made structures to highlight areas that the player would be drawn towards. Blow wanted the game's art to start off with bright colors and high saturation, to present a type of optimism to the player, while later settings in the game would become less bright. He also wanted to make sure all elements of the game world stood out to avoid visual noise within the game that may have interfered with puzzle solving. To accomplish this, he and his team often had to review the game as if they were a new player to it, and identify what elements they were visually drawn to; this would often identify features of the island they had incorporated early on but were no longer appropriate for the final game.|$|E

500|$|Parenting {{is a large}} task within itself, {{and when}} a parent has a career as well, it can cause a double burden, or work–family conflict. Strain begins to develop when women and men find that the demands of their family are {{conflicting}} with the demands from their job. When one is faced with a double burden like this, it affects how decisions are made within a career and in a family; this burden could potentially effect when a couple decides to have children. 75% of all women who have jobs are in their childbearing prime. When the conflict between one's family and work presents itself, the unpaid work that is being done in the home may be cut down, because of the certain health effects, or {{as a solution to}} deal with the greater demands from the workplace. Social outings and visits, and family dinners are two of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> get cut back on due to the work/family conflict. In a study by Ari Väänänen, May V. Kevin, et al. found that if a man put a higher importance on their family, were more likely to stay home from work {{in order to deal with}} extreme family demands. Ways that the double burden can be lessened for is with hired help in the house, day-care facilities, and longer maternity leaves for women. For instance, in Norway women are allowed the options of 10months of maternity leave, where they will get 100% of their pay, or 12months leave, where they will only paid 80% of their earnings. Some companies are realizing the effect the double burden of work and a family is having on their employees and are offering flexible work schedules in order to help their employees cope. Not only do these flexible hours help the employee deal with their stress, but it also benefits the company because workers are happier, less likely to be absent, more productive, and the turnover rate is lower for the company. As Sophia Mwangi says, [...] "Parenthood is a joy. Let us never be burdened by it but let's celebrate the joy that it brings. Celebrate those first steps or words, the first school play, their graduation day, passing those exams, landing their first job, getting married, making you grandparents. Whatever it is, let's celebrate our children. It's not easy, but the art of juggling can always be mastered!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010, Ahern {{has said}} he would have no {{difficulties}} giving evidence to the investigation into banking, nor having his testimony heard in public. Saying he would appear if asked, Ahern defended his record while in government, attributing the crisis in banking to international factors and the banks’ over-exposure to borrowing on international markets. [...] "By and large we all know what happened. The banks borrowed money on the open market in the short-term. And as soon as things went, they had to pay that money up but they hadn’t got it to pay," [...] he said. [...] "That's what happened. I don’t think it will take too long [...] to write up what the position is." [...] He continued saying, [...] "The greater issue was the protection and the regulation of the bank rather than consumers’ interests." [...] Mr Ahern also said that people were [...] "jumping over developers" [...] but also needed to remember they employed 200,000 people. He said that one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Brian Cowen had done when he became minister for finance was to abolish many of the property tax incentives. He also stood over many of the incentives that benefited property developers. [...] "When they were brought in, the place was in a disastrous way. Look at the quays in Dublin. There were reports around for 40 years that said the quays needed something done about them and nothing happened until we brought in the urban renewal status and gave the tax incentives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that year, Consort Wu {{falsely accused}} Empress Wang {{and her mother}} Lady Liu of using {{witchcraft}} to try to regain Emperor Gaozong's favor. [...] Emperor Gaozong began discussions with the chancellors on deposing Empress Wang and replacing her with Consort Wu. [...] The chancellors, other than the senior general Li Ji, who refused to render an opinion (but later also stated to Emperor Gaozong {{that it was his}} own business and that he needed not ask anyone else) and Emperor Gaozong's powerful uncle Zhangsun Wuji, who showed disapproval by silence, were largely vocal in their opposition, with the strongest opposition from Chu Suiliang. [...] Meanwhile, Han also opposed the move, weeping bitterly during one meeting with Emperor Gaozong, causing Emperor Gaozong to remove him from the palace. [...] He later further submitted a petition, pointing out that Empress Wang was the wife Emperor Taizong selected for Emperor Gaozong and was not known for faults. [...] Emperor Gaozong did not listen and, after demoting Chu to be the commandant at Tan Prefecture (roughly modern Changsha, Hunan), in order to show the other chancellors what he was willing to do, deposed Empress Wang and replaced her with Consort Wu late in 655. [...] (The former Empress Wang and her ally Consort Xiao were later executed cruelly at the instigation of the new Empress Wu.) [...] One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> the new empress did as empress was to submit a petition praising Han and Lai for their faithfulness and requesting that they be rewarded—a petition that, however, made Han and Lai apprehensive that she was aware of their opposition of her, and Han offered to resign thereafter, an offer that Emperor Gaozong did not accept.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1978 US Open, Evert {{would play}} sixteen-year-old Pam Shriver in the final. [...] Shriver showed Evert {{she was to}} be taken seriously in the match by winning her first service game at 15 points for Evert, which was {{the first game of the}} match. [...] Evert would have a hard time shaking Shriver off during the first set because of mostly double {{faulting}} three-times in one game in the eight game of the set to allow Shriver to break back to level the set 4-games all. [...] Evert would lose the next game to go down 4 games to 5, which she said [...] "I was disgusted with those three double-faults...when I get nervous, serving is one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> goes. [...] But even at 5-4, I felt very confident. [...] I didn't think there was any way I could lose." [...] During the subsequent game, Evert would only lose one point on serve to get the match back level at 5 games-all. [...] In the critical 11-game, Evert would show why experience matters and broke the youngster's serve, which allowed Evert to win the opening set 7 games to 5. [...] Evert and Shriver would battle to an even 4-all in the second set before the youngster showed her inexperience by having a 40 to love game, and simply put Shriver could not close it out against the relentless effort of Evert. [...] The points after this was the following: Evert winning on a forehand return, then made a winning volley, then got deuce with a galloping forehand up the line, Shriver won the next point with a booming service to get the advantage with a volley, Shriver on game point lead her forehand astray, lastly Evert won the game by hitting two unreturnable returns. [...] In the tenth game of the set, Shriver tried her best by getting most shots back, but Evert still won the set 6 games to 4, which gave Evert her fourth US Open title in a row and first one on the hard DecoTurf. [...] Evert later said [...] "I felt hungary to win...When the chips were down, I went for passing shots and made them. [...] I hit the lines." ...|$|E
