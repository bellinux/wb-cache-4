The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in <b>the</b> <b>German</b> fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold {{and was forced to}} haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed. As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship from the rear of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> line. At around 23:30, <b>the</b> <b>German</b> fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, {{in the center of the}} 24-ship line.|$|E

5|$|By January 1943, the {{situation}} looked {{very good for}} the Soviet side. <b>The</b> <b>German</b> defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad had weakened <b>the</b> <b>German</b> front.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{for many}} Italians the name of Kesselring, whose {{signature}} appeared on posters and printed orders announcing draconian measures adopted by <b>the</b> <b>German</b> occupation, had become synonymous with the oppression and terror that had characterised <b>the</b> <b>German</b> occupation.

5|$|By {{virtue of}} geography, the Royal Navy could keep <b>the</b> <b>German</b> High Seas Fleet {{confined}} to the North Sea with relative ease, {{but was unable to}} break <b>the</b> <b>German</b> superiority in the Baltic Sea. Both sides were aware, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, that a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. <b>The</b> <b>German</b> strategy was, therefore, to try to provoke an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near <b>the</b> <b>German</b> coast, where friendly minefields, torpedo boats, and submarines could even the odds.|$|E

5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any notion that <b>the</b> <b>German</b> Empire has {{any place in}} dictating the terms of peace.

5|$|Some historians {{state that}} <b>the</b> <b>German</b> troops {{did not expect}} the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July.

5|$|The Belgian Army, the BEF and the French 1st Army, in a domino effect, was ordered/forced {{to retire}} on 16 May to avoid their {{southern}} flanks from being turned by <b>the</b> <b>German</b> armoured forces advancing through the French Ardennes and <b>the</b> <b>German</b> 6th Army advancing through Gembloux.

5|$|The plan {{to begin}} Operation Fredericus in April {{led to more}} forces being {{allocated}} {{to the area of}} <b>the</b> <b>German</b> 6th Army.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> viewed <b>the</b> British naval {{withdrawal}} and suspension of merchant traffic {{as a success}} {{but the lack of}} targets for <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> eliminated <b>the</b> need for Fighter Command to engage the Luftwaffe over <b>the</b> Channel. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> now had to fly into southern England, which put the Bf109, <b>the</b> best <b>German</b> fighter, at <b>the</b> limit of its endurance.

Đurišić considered the possibility of joining Lukačević in fighting <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> in anticipation of an Allied landing. However, because Lukačević was quickly defeated and no Allied landing occurred, Đurišić remained tied to <b>the</b> <b>Germans.</b> German intelligence closely tracked Đurišić's communications and movements, and German commands continued {{to make use of}} his forces. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> counted Đurišić's Chetniks as part of Army Group E in a survey of available forces dated 16 November 1944. In <b>the</b> survey, <b>German</b> forces in Montenegro at that time were estimated at 47,000 soldiers, including Đurišić's 10,000 Chetniks. On 21 October 1944, the Partisans took the Grahovo garrison after a five-day battle. On 6 November, the Partisans surrounded Cetinje, which was defended by <b>the</b> <b>Germans,</b> Black Shirts, and about 600 Chetniks. On 8 November, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> and Chetniks in Cetinje were reinforced with a formation of 800–1,000 Chetniks led by Đurišić, which eventually succeeded in breaking through the Partisan blockade.|$|R
