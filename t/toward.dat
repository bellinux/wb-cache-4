Around noon, Leibstandartes 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion was ordered to attack northward <b>toward</b> the Psel River to consolidate its front line with Totenkopf, while the division's panzer units were to attack <b>toward</b> Soviet positions northeast of the Oktyabrsky State Farm <b>toward</b> Prokhorovka.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Andres is {{one out of}} two {{tropical}} cyclones {{on record}} to strike El Salvador. The first named storm of the active 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Andres formed on June 1 {{off the coast of}} Mexico. It initially moved <b>toward</b> the coast, although a change in steering winds turned the storm <b>toward</b> Mexico and Guatemala. After passing just offshore, Andres again changed direction <b>toward</b> the southeast, gradually weakening in the process. On June 7, it turned <b>toward</b> and hit El Salvador before dissipating. The storm brought rainfall to coastlines along much of its path, destroying some houses and inflicted damage. Two fishermen were reported missing in Nicaragua due to high seas, and there were four deaths in El Salvador.|$|E
5|$|US113 {{serves as}} an {{important}} route carrying local and through traffic along with tourist traffic bound for the Delaware Beaches and Ocean City, Maryland to the east; as such the highway experiences congestion in the summer months when tourism to the beach areas is at its highest. Access from US113 to the beach areas is provided by US9 and DE404 <b>toward</b> Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, and Dewey Beach; DE26 <b>toward</b> Bethany Beach; DE54 <b>toward</b> Fenwick Island; MD90 <b>toward</b> northern Ocean City; US50 <b>toward</b> downtown Ocean City; and MD376 <b>toward</b> Assateague Island. US 113 {{also serves as a}} part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the beach communities to inland areas to the north. All of US113 is part of the National Highway System.|$|E

Biya began his administration by moving <b>toward</b> a more democratic government, but a failed coup d'état nudged him <b>toward</b> the leadership style of his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted <b>toward</b> life in water, and shifted their diets <b>toward</b> aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E
5|$|And the {{impressive}} personal {{qualities of the}} Communist leaders, their seeming sincerity, and the coherence and logical nature of their program leads me, at least, <b>toward</b> general acceptance of the first explanation – that the Communists base their policy <b>toward</b> the Kuomintang on a real desire for democracy in China under which there can be orderly economic growth through a stage of private enterprise to eventual socialism without the need of violent social upheaval and revolution.|$|E

5|$|Gustav moved erratically to the west-northwest <b>toward</b> the North Carolina-South Carolina border {{over the}} next two days, it slowly strengthened, {{acquiring}} more tropical characteristics. On September 10, a poorly organized band of stronger winds developed around the center, and Gustav was designated a fully tropical storm shortly before turning <b>toward</b> the north and brushing Cape Hatteras, then accelerating <b>toward</b> the northeast and away from the coast. On September 11, while under the influence of a non-tropical system over New England, Gustav quickly strengthened into a hurricane, in a process similar to the intensification of Hurricane Michael in 2000. Gustav reached its peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) later that day.|$|E
