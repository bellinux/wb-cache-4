5|$|Animals <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{the marsh}} rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but {{the species is}} known to eat many other animals, {{including}} fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most}} important predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Every three years, the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume.

In 2009, MoDOT calculated that as few as 38,152vehicles traveled along the highway at the northern terminus just north of the interchange with I-70, and as many as 75,647vehicles used the highway just east of the Grandview Triangle.

In 2011, WSDOT calculated that as few as 26,000cars used the spur at the continuation point from SR7, and as many as 72,000cars between the onramp from I-5 and SR509. The entire Tacoma Spur is listed on both the WSDOT List of Highways of Statewide Significance, which marks the highway as a critical to connecting major communities in the state, and the National Highway System, a system of roads <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the nation's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Every year, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume.

At this interchange, I-75 takes ramps to leave the Fisher Freeway and use the Chrysler Freeway, replacing I-375. I-375 is a four-lane freeway south of the I-75 interchange, where it widens to six lanes.

The Ohio Department of Transportation and West Virginia Division of Highways (ODOT and WVDOH) conduct surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume. This is {{expressed in terms of}} average annual daily traffic (AADT), a measure of average traffic volume for any day of the year. In 2012, they calculated that 26,500vehicles traveled along the highway at the eastern terminus in West Virginia, and 37,840vehicles used I-470 across the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge.

5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E
