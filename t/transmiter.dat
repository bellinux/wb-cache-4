The 3 D inversion of CSEM data in the near field using a single <b>transmiter</b> position suffers from critical sensitivity singularities. We proposed a robust inversion framework adapted to this ill-conditioned inversion problem. The framework relies specificaly on a robust Gauss-Newton solver, model parameter transformations to compensate the heterogeneous sensitivies, and on the reformulation of the near field CSEM data under the form of a pseudo-MT tensor. We describe the approach used for modeling and inversion implemented in our code POLYEM 3 D and show the advantages of pseudo-MT tensor formulation. The strategy have been tested on a pathologic synthetic case inspired from grayver et al (2013), and then was successfully applied to a real CSEM dataset acquired in the context of thermal water prospection in a noisy environnement...|$|E

40|$|In 2003 the ROSETTA space {{mission to}} Comet 46 P/Wirtanen will be {{launched}} by the European Space Agency (ESA). On board of the spacecraft {{there will be a}} Lander platform, which opens {{for the first time the}} possibility to carry out "in situ" measurements on a comet surface. The ROSETTA Lander experiment CASSE aims to investigate the outermost surface of the comet by means of transmitting, receiving and even passively monitoring acoustic waves in a frequency range from a few hundred to several kilohertz. In particular, by transmitting and recording compression and shear waves, the mechanical properties of the comentary surface will be investigated. To quarantee sufficient ground contact in any foreseeable surface topography, and in any composition of the material to be encountered, e. g. dust, sand, ice and mixtures of these materials, the acoustic transmitters (actuators), stacked piezoceramics, and triaxial commercial piezoelectric accelerometers as receivers, will be integrated in each of the three feet of the ROSETTA Lander. The Lander feet thus act as antennas for the transmitters and receivers. By switching different actuators and accelerometers, an analysis of the cometary surface material will become possible by direct foot to foot transmission of the acoustic signals. Further, an in-depth sounding will allow the detection of layered stuctures or embedded local inhomogeneities. The ground contact of the Lander will be strengthened by a harpoon providing a fixation force up to at least 5 N per foot. This paper describes the first design of the Lander feet incorporating piezoceramic composite stacks as sound <b>transmiters</b> and receivers, and the experiments to test their efficiency. In the first part of this paper, the results of acoustic wave propagation experiments in ice, sand and olivine dust, performed in the laboratory are reported. These experiments verify that a signal strength of at least 20 dB above noise can be expected for aacoustic wave propagation in cometary analogue materials. The second part of the paper deals with the outdoor experiments, performed with sensors integrated into the Lander feet prototypes and placed in a sand filled construction container. The experiments serve to estimate the minimal range of detectability of the sounding signals...|$|R

40|$|While {{noise is}} now {{considered}} a marine hazard that can directly affect cetaceans and induce a stranding, no clinical approach has yet introduced the detection of a possible hearing loss at a stranding site as a necessary practice. Here we present the second generation of an autonomous and portable auditory screening system for cetacean clinical and research purposes. This system is composed by two independent and autonomous modules that build a more versatile, lighter and interference isolated system. The improvement relies on the isolation between modules and their independency on many situations. The system is separated in two modules. The first one contains the low voltage biopotential amplification system and the acustic signal <b>transmiter.</b> The second module will activate only when needed for some frequencies and levels driving high voltage to the transducers thus avoiding interferences with the first module containing the low voltage amplifications system.

40|$|International audienceLand EM methods {{provide useful}} {{information}} in domains such as geothermal energy, CO 2 storage or water ressources managements. However, the targets are usually close from urban areas where anthropogenic noise {{such as high}} power lines, industries and railways prevents {{from the use of}} Magnetotelluric (MT). Controlled-Source EM (CSEM) is thus generaly prefered to MT. However, unlike for marine CSEM surveys used in oil prospection, logistical constrains on land surveys limit to the use of a few transmitters, usually 2 polarizations at a single position. Again due to noise constrains, it is usually prefered to place the <b>transmiter</b> close from the stations, which make impossible the use of CSAMT processing, as far field assumption is not respected. Thus the 3 D inverse problem associated to this kind of survey suffers from very high sensitivity heterogeneities and singularities, in particular {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>transmiter,</b> that prevents from good convergence of the inversion process. In order to achieve reliable local inversion with such pathologic sensitivities, several crucial aspect of the algorithm must be considered. Firstly, Gauss-Newton inversion must be prefered to a gradient-based method, and a very robust solver such as LSQR is necessary. Then a good parameterization must be chosen. Preconditionning of the system with model reparameterization must also be used to compensate for the sensitivity loss with depth. But we show that even with a Gauss-Newton resolution and efficient preconditionning of both data and model parameter, the inversion fails to converge to an accurate solution with single source position in cases where MT data inversion or CSEM with many transmiters provides sucessful results. In order to mitigate the sensitivity singularities, we propose to reformulate the CSEM inverse problem by recasting the data under the form of a pseudo-MT tensor. The associated sensitivities are a linear combinations of the common CSEM sensitivies for electric and magnetic fields. We show on a synthetic model that this formulation highly reduce the footprint of the tranmitter in the sensitivities even in the near field. It also provides a natural balance between the data and between the whole frequency range. Finaly the approach allows the inversion to converge to a reliable result. This approach has been successefully applied on a 3 D land survey in France with very complex geology, where the common CSEM inversion had provided biased results...|$|E
40|$|The {{blood cells}} of the pulmonate snail Biomphalaria tenagophila, an {{important}} <b>transmiter</b> of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni in Brazil, were examined by ligth and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Two hemocyte types were identified: hyalinocytes and granulocytes. Hyalinocytes are small young (immature), poorly spreading cells, which have a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio and are especially rich in free ribosomes. They {{do not appear to}} contain lysosome-like bodies and represent less than 10 % of the circulating hemocytes. Granulocytes are larger hemocytes which readily spread on glass surface and which strongly react to the Gomori substrate, indicating the enzyme acid phosphatase usually found in lysosomes. Ultra-structurally, they contain a well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, dictyosomes and some some lysosome-like dense bodies. Granulocytes do not exhibit a characteristic granular aspect and the few granules observed in the cytoplasm should correspond to a lysosome system. They were named granulocytes instead of amoebocytes to use the same terminology adopted for Biomphalaria glabrata in order to make easier comparative studies. This is a preface study for more specific investigations on the functional activities of the blood cells of B. tenagophila and their interactions with the trematode parasite...|$|E
40|$|MIMO OFDM {{is a key}} {{technique}} for achieving high capacity in future wireless communi-cation systems. The desired low-cost, low-power and fully integrated implementation of MIMO OFDM systems leads to the application of direct (up/down) conversion architec-ture, whose performance can be seriously limited by the RF impairment I/Q imbalance. Thus, the compensation of I/Q imbalance is a crucial issue {{in the implementation of}} MI-MO OFDM systems, which requires reliable parameter estimation. In this paper, we first present an overview of I/Q-imbalance compensation in MIMO OFDM systems. After-wards, we propose three preamble assisted schemes for efficient joint estimation of the MIMO channel and frequency-selective <b>transmiter</b> (Tx) and receiver (Rx) I/Q imbalance. Correspondingly, three advanced preamble designs are presented, incl. a preamble based on Time Domain Separation (TDS), a preamble based on Frequency Domain Separation (FDS) and a multi-functional preamble. All preamble designs allow low overhead and low Crest-Factor (CF). Based on these preamble designs, low complexity estimators are developed, which can achieve performance close to the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRL-B). Numerical simulation results and complexity analysis have verified the advantages of the proposed schemes over the existing schemes. Finally, we discuss how to select the most appropriate scheme- out of the proposed three- by considering a tradeoff between performance, complexity and overhead...|$|E

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is {{a modern}} remote sensing technique, which {{provides}} accurate and precise topographical information. LiDAR method, also known as Airbone Laser Scanning (ALS) uses electromagnetical radiation in the optical range. This system consists of a <b>transmiter</b> and receiver of a laser beam, a scanning device and a real-time positioning system. The transmitter emits pulses of light that reflects from the ground surface (including natural surface, buildings and vegetation) {{and goes back to}} the receiver. The measurement of the time between sending and registration of the beam is used to calculate the distance to the points located on the Earth (Wehr & Lohr 1999). These points form a "point cloud", which is positioned in 3 D spatial coordinate system. The density of these points could reach even 100 pts/m 2 (Jaboyedoff et al. 2012). Points corresponding to the forest canopy or buildings could be removed in post-processing. It allows to create Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which reflects morphology very accurately. Through this, application of the model facilitates searching and interpretation of morphological forms, including those hidden under the forest canopy (Van Den Eeckhaut et al. 2007). The aim {{of this study is to}} test the application of the LiDAR technique as a support in mapping of the mass movement's landforms, for instance: landslides, debris slides, etc. This landforms were observed at the Podhale Flysch Area by Mastella (1975). The basic research method was to analyse the terrain model generated from the LiDAR data in comparison with the older cartographic sources and field verification. The laser scanning was carry out in the 2010 and the acquired data was used to derive the DEM. This model was compared with the topographic map at a scale 1 : 10 000, detailed geological map of Poland at a scale 1 : 50 000 and the ortophoto at a scale 1 : 5 000. DEM's horizontal resolution is 1 m and this model covers almost 100 km 2 of the area among the villages of Biały Dunajec, Jurgów, Trybsz and Poronin. Analysing of the area was based on different ways of displaying. This allowed selection of three test areas (3 km 2 each) as examples of the territory where morphological forms are associated with mass movements occur. The obtained results allows precise delimitation, determination of surface and morphology of forms resulting from mass movements, which enabled more accurate mapping of these landforms, particularly in the area of dense vegetation cover. Moreover, a comparative analysis of LiDAR model with older cartographic sources can confirm or exclude the existence of areas considered as endangered of mass movements occurence. Airbone Laser Scanning method is therefore a perfect complement to the field studies in geology and geomorphology. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.
