5|$|According to the legend, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, {{was on a}} hunting {{expedition}} {{when he had a}} nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. <b>The</b> <b>fisherman</b> presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to <b>the</b> <b>fisherman,</b> naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). <b>The</b> <b>fisherman</b> raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). <b>The</b> <b>fisherman</b> was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, <b>the</b> <b>fisherman,</b> in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E

Thus, for any meaningful support programme for <b>the</b> artisanal small-scale <b>fishermen,</b> <b>the</b> perception of <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> about <b>the</b> cooperative organization must first be aligned rightly.

The Royal Manchester Institution was concerned that the painting would be damaged if moved, refusing {{to allow it to}} be used in the exhibition until Etty, and a number of influential friends, visited Manchester to beg them to release it. Etty died later that year, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices.

5|$|Beer, as {{he still}} named himself, studied with Antonio Salieri and the German master {{and friend of}} Goethe, Carl Friedrich Zelter. Louis Spohr {{organised}} a concert for Beer at Berlin in 1804 and continued his acquaintance with the lad later in Vienna and Rome. A portrait of Jacob commissioned by the family at this time shows him 'confidently facing the viewer, his hair romantically dishevelled… his left hand rests on the keyboard, and his right hand grasps a musical manuscript… plac its subject {{in the tradition of}} the young Mozart'. Beer's first stage work, the ballet Der Fischer und das Milchmädchen (<b>The</b> <b>Fisherman</b> and the Milkmaid) was produced in March 1810 at the Court Opera in Berlin. His formal training with the Abbé Vogler at Darmstadt between 1810 and 1812 was, however, of crucial importance, and at around this time he begins to sign himself 'Meyer Beer'. Here, with his fellow students (who included Carl Maria von Weber), he learnt not only the craft of composition but also the business of music (organising concerts and dealing with publishers). Forming a close friendship with Weber and other pupils, Meyerbeer established the Harmonischer Verein (Musical Union), whose members undertook to support each other with favourable press criticism and networking. On 12 February 1813 Beer received the first of the string of honours he was to accumulate throughout his life when he was appointed 'Court Composer' by Grand Duke Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt.|$|E

5|$|The {{interiors}} were {{filmed in}} two specially converted aircraft hangars near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk, which were leased for £1,500; this cost-measure resulted {{in much of}} the dialogue having to be re-recorded later, because the tin roofs of the hangars caused an echo. The exterior shots range from the Dunwich Coast (for the scene with <b>the</b> <b>fisherman)</b> to Langley Park outside London (for the scene where Stearne escapes capture). The tracking shot of the ambush after the opening credits was filmed at Black Park in southeast Buckinghamshire, a location frequently used by Hammer Film Productions. Lavenham Square (in Lavenham, Suffolk), site of the witch-burning scene, was the real Lavenham Market Square; the crew lowered TV antennas and telephone wires and Waddilove hired a cherry picker from a local utility company for £10, because the unit couldn't afford a camera crane. The countryside vistas seen in the chase scenes on horseback were shot on the Stanford Battle Area near Thetford, Norfolk— the producer, through connections with the government, was able to lease parts of the area. The church used in the film is St John The Evangelist in Rushford in Norfolk. The moat drowning and hanging scenes were filmed at Kentwell Hall, in Long Melford. The climax of the film was shot at Orford Castle, on the coast of East Anglia, which is an English Heritage property. Filming wrapped as scheduled on 13 November 1967.|$|E

40|$|When various {{developmental}} {{measures are}} being undertaken {{to increase the}} fish production in India, it is pertinent to examine if the fishing methods employed are quite efficient. In marine fishing, the efficiency of fishing methods in general depends {{on the ability of}} <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> to locate <b>the</b> fishing grounds where the fish are abundant and to catch them there. In case of some of the pelagic fisheries like Indian mackerel, in the exploitation of which <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> rely on <b>the</b> arrival of the fish shoals in the inshore area, the fishing efficiency will depend on the ability and skill of <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> to identify <b>the</b> time and period when the mackerel shoals are most abundant in the inshore waters and to concentrate most of their effort at the time to catch the fish. The present paper provides a method for measuring quantitatively the fishing efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> of <b>the</b> Karwar area with regard to the mackerel fishery. Though the results of the quantitative analysis will specifically relate to the efficiency of <b>the</b> Karwar <b>fishermen,</b> it is believed that the same will be applicable to <b>the</b> <b>fishermen</b> of <b>the</b> entire Mysore coast, if not the entire Indian coast...|$|R
25|$|A fishing rod's main {{function}} is to bend and deliver a certain resistance or power: While casting, the rod acts as a catapult: by moving the rod forward, the inertia {{of the mass of}} the bait or lure and rod itself, will load (bend) the rod and launch the lure or bait. When a bite is registered and <b>the</b> <b>fisherman</b> strikes, the bending of the rod will dampen the strike to avoid line failure. When fighting a fish, the bending of the rod not only enables <b>the</b> <b>fisherman</b> to keep the line under tension, but the bending of the rod will also keep the fish under a constant pressure which will exhaust the fish and enable <b>the</b> <b>fisherman</b> to actually catch the fish. Also the bending lessens the effect of the leverage by shortening the distance of the lever (the rod). A stiff rod will demand lots of power of <b>the</b> <b>fisherman,</b> while actually less power is put on the fish. In comparison, a deep bending rod will demand less power from <b>the</b> <b>fisherman,</b> but deliver more fighting power to the fish. In practice, this leverage effect often misleads fisherman. Often it is believed that a hard, stiff rod puts more control and power on the fish to fight, while it is actually the fish who is putting the power on <b>the</b> <b>fisherman.</b> In commercial fishing practice, big and strong fish are often just pulled in on the line itself without much effort, which is possible because the absence of the leverage effect.|$|E
