5|$|<b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> {{holds the}} most {{franchise}} records {{as of the}} end of the 2010 season, with 15, including best single-season batting average, most career hits, and most career triples. He is followed by Randy Jones, who holds thirteen records, including most career shutouts and the single-season loss record.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the first}} major league player to appear in more than 1,000 games at two {{different}} positions, registering 1,896 games in the outfield and 1,016 at first base. Since Musial's retirement in 1963, <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average. Hank Aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of 6,134 total bases.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and {{deciding}} game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb {{with the bases loaded}} and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field that <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> was unable to see. Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch, but was unable to prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home from third with the go-ahead run. The Tigers maintained their lead after that, giving Kuntz an unlikely game-winning RBI.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2007, Ripken {{was elected}} to the Hall of Fame, {{appearing}} on 537 out of 545 of the ballots cast (98.53%), eight votes short of a unanimous selection. His percentage is the fourth highest in history, behind Ken Griffey Jr. (99.32 percent), Tom Seaver who received 98.84 percent of the vote and Nolan Ryan who received 98.79 percent. <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> who was appearing on his first ballot as well, was chosen alongside Ripken. Both Hall of Fame-Elects were formally inducted on July 29, 2007. The induction ceremony was attended by a record 75,000 people including special guests of Ripken: John Travolta, Kelly Preston, Steve Geppi, and Ron Shapiro (Ripken's agent during his career).|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} McGwire and Sosa were honored, Cal Ripken, Jr. and <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> {{both of whom}} retired after the 2001 season, {{received}} the award and were honored at the 2001 MLB All-Star Game; Ripken {{was elected to the}} American League All-Star team as a starter at third base, while Gwynn was later added as an honorary member of the National League team. During the first inning of the game, Rodriguez, who had been elected the starter at shortstop—the position at which Ripken played for most of his career—switched positions with Ripken for the first inning of the game as a tribute. Including the presentation of the award to the Mariners following the season, the 2001 season's three awards are the most presented in a single year.|$|E
5|$|Among outfielders {{and among}} all Silver Slugger winners, Barry Bonds {{has won the}} most awards, winning twelve times between 1990 and 2004. All of his awards were won in the National League. Manny Ramirez leads the American League with eight wins. Ken Griffey, Jr., Vladimir Guerrero, and <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> have each won seven Silver Sluggers in the outfield; Juan González, Kirby Puckett, and Sammy Sosa have won six times. Two players have won five times (Albert Belle and Dave Winfield), and four-time winners include Andre Dawson, Matt Holliday, Dale Murphy, Gary Sheffield, and Ryan Braun. There have also been 7 three-time outfield winners and 18 two-time awardees. The most recent winners are Ryan Braun, Matt Kemp, and Justin Upton in the National League, and José Bautista, Curtis Granderson, and Jacoby Ellsbury in the American League.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman played shortstop collegiately at the University of Arizona and {{was drafted}} in the 11th round by the Cincinnati Reds. After not having much success batting, Hoffman was {{converted}} to a pitcher, as {{he was able to}} throw up to 95miles per hour (mph). The Marlins acquired him in the 1992 expansion draft, and he pitched in Florida until he was traded to the Padres mid-season in 1993 in a deal that sent star Gary Sheffield to the Marlins. Hoffman recorded 20 saves in 1994 in his first season as Padres closer, and in the following years, he became the face of the franchise after <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> retired. He collected at least 30saves each year for the next 14years, except for 2003 when he missed most of the year recovering from shoulder surgery. After San Diego did not re-sign him following the 2008 season, Hoffman pitched for two years with the Brewers before retiring after the 2010 season.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins {{was moved}} to second base in 1984. That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, {{and they wanted to}} get Martínez's bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins {{retained}} the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn.</b> During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record. In an August game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series of fights. Wiggins was hit with the first pitch of the game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, SDSU's {{baseball}} facility, Smith Stadium, was extensively renovated with $4 {{million from}} Padres owner John Moores. At Moores's request, the stadium was renamed <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> Stadium.|$|E
25|$|A public {{memorial}} service {{was held for}} Gwynn at Petco Park on June 26, 2014. The service was attended by 23,229 fans, who heard tributes to Gwynn from baseball and civic leaders, and from Gwynn's family. The Mountain West Conference posthumously renamed its baseball Player of the Year Award to the <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> Award. During the 2016 MLB All-Star Game in San Diego, it was announced that, going forward, the award given to the National League player with the best batting average would be officially known as the <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> Award.|$|E
25|$|Aurelio López pitched 2-1/3 {{innings of}} relief without putting a runner on {{base for the}} win. Despite {{allowing}} a rare run {{in the top of}} the 8th inning, Willie Hernández got the save as <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> flied out to Larry Herndon to end the game, sending Detroit into a wild victory celebration.|$|E
25|$|The initial plan, before Mike Cameron was acquired, {{was to have}} Kapler {{replace the}} non-tendered Kevin Mench as a {{right-handed}} option to share time with <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr., Gabe Gross, and Joe Dillon, in left field. With a focus on defense, Yost indicated in March that Gwynn and Kapler might have {{a leg up on}} Gross.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, Cobb tied a batting {{record set}} by Wee Willie Keeler, with four five-hit {{games in a}} season. This has since been matched by Stan Musial, <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> and Ichiro Suzuki. On May 10, 1924, Cobb was honored at ceremonies before a game in Washington, D.C., by more than 100 dignitaries and legislators. He {{received}} 21 books, one for each year in professional baseball.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on April 29 {{to begin a}} three-game series against the Padres. In the opener, solo homers by Uribe and Kemp and a game saving diving catch by <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr. helped the Dodgers pick up a 3–2 with. The Dodgers lost 5–2 the next day as wild pitch by Matt Guerrier and an error by Dioner Navarro let three costly runs score in the 8th to break the tie.|$|E
25|$|Dryer was a {{vegetarian}} for 10 years. In 1988, Dryer {{was inducted into}} the San Diego State University Aztec Hall of Fame. In 1997 Dryer received college football's ultimate honor in being voted to the College Football Hall of Fame and is one of only three SDSU Aztecs in the collegiate Hall of Fame. When voted into the San Diego Sports Hall of Fame in 1998, Dryer joined athletes such as Ted Williams, Dan Fouts, Dave Winfield, and <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> in receiving the preeminent recognition for a San Diego athlete.|$|E
25|$|Gwynn {{was married}} to Alicia Gwynn, and {{was the father of}} R singer Anisha Nicole and major league outfielder <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> Jr., whose major league debut (with the Milwaukee Brewers) and first major league hit on July 19, 2006 came 24 years to the day of his father's first major league hit—each Gwynn hit a double. Gwynn's brother, Chris, was also a major league outfielder. Both Chris and Tony Jr. played with the Padres during their careers. Until Gwynn's death he split time between homes in Poway, California and Fishers, Indiana.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home {{for their first}} homestand under the new ownership and beat the San Francisco Giants 9-1. The next night, Clayton Kershaw gave up a two-run homer to Brett Pill {{in the second inning}} before settling down to pitch eight strong innings, but the Dodgers were unable to get runs in against Ryan Vogelsong and lost 2–1. A three-run pinch hit triple by <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr. gave the Dodgers the lead in the series finale against the Giants and they held on to win 6-2. On May 11, Capuano improved his record to 5–0, while allowing just one run on four hits in seven innings. Mark Ellis, Juan Uribe and Andre Ethier provided the offense as each hit a home run in the clubs 7–3 win over the Rockies. Aaron Harang allowed just one run in eight innings on May 12 and <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr. came through again with a pinch hit RBI to drive in the winning run in the Dodgers 2–1 victory over the Rockies. The Dodgers completed the sweep of the Rockies thanks to a 3-RBI double by Bobby Abreu and a 3-run homer by A. J. Ellis that led the team to an 11–5 win in the series finale. Kershaw pitched seven scoreless innings to outduel Ian Kennedy on May 14, as the Dodgers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 3–1. Chad Billingsley struggled and the Dodgers had difficulty scoring in the finale of the homestand, losing to the Diamondbacks 5-1 and snapping their five-game winning streak.|$|E
25|$|Williams was {{an obsessive}} student of hitting. He famously used a lighter bat than most sluggers, because it {{generated}} a faster swing. David Halberstam's Summer of '49 recalls him warning teammates {{not to leave}} their bats {{on the ground as}} they would absorb moisture and become heavier. His biographer Leigh Montville relates the often told story that Hillerich & Bradsby presented Williams with four bats weighing 34 ounces and one weighing 33 1/2 ounces, and challenged him to identify the lighter bat, which he was consistently able to do. His devotion allowed him to hit for power and average while maintaining extraordinary plate discipline. In 1970 he wrote a book on the subject, The Science of Hitting (revised 1986), which is still read by many baseball players. Williams was known to discuss hitting with active players enthusiastically until very late in his life. A conversation with <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> was filmed for television.|$|E
25|$|Injuries and {{ineffective}} play by several bench players caused the Brewers to make several roster moves {{during the month}} of May. Mike Rivera returned from the disabled list on May 14 as Carlos Corporán was returned to the minors; Corporan appeared in only one game, where he caught the last two innings of a 15–3 blowout of the Cincinnati Reds on May 6 and singled off of regular Cincinnati shortstop Paul Janish in his only at-bat. The team suffered a significant setback on May 18 when starting second baseman Rickie Weeks suffered an injury to his left wrist, ending his 2009 season. For the time being, Craig Counsell and Casey McGehee are expected to replace Weeks in the lineup; Hernán Iribarren was called up from Nashville following the injury, but was returned to Nashville after only one series. Brad Nelson, who went hitless in 21 at-bats, declined a demotion to the minor leagues and became a free agent on May 15; top third base prospect Mat Gamel was called up to replace Nelson on the roster. On May 21, the Brewers traded Triple-A outfielder <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr. to the San Diego Padres in exchange for outfielder Jody Gerut; Chris Duffy was demoted to Nashville to make room on the roster for Gerut. Finally, on May 21 the team called up outfielder Frank Catalanotto, who had been signed to a minor league contract by the team earlier in the month.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{began their}} first roadtrip {{of the season}} in Colorado for a two-game series with the Rockies. Troy Tulowitzki hit a home run to key the Rockies 3–0 win in the opener and Billingsley {{struggled}} in the second game as the Rockies won 7–5. <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr. singled home the winning run {{in the bottom of the}} 11th as the Dodgers beat his former team, the San Diego Padres 4–2 to start their next series. The game had been suspended due to rain in the top of the ninth and was not finished till the following day. Kuroda pitched 8 2/3 scoreless innings in the second game of the series as the Dodgers won 4–0. John Ely made a spot start for the Dodgers on April 10 against the Padres, allowing two home runs while the Dodgers offense could only tally four singles in a 7–2 loss. Kershaw continued his dominance over the Giants in his next start, blanking them for 6 2/3 innings while the Dodgers opened a series in San Francisco with a 6–1 victory. The victory came with a cost, however, as starting shortstop and leadoff hitter Rafael Furcal suffered a broken thumb while stealing third base. He was placed on the disabled list and the team announced that he would need four to six weeks for total recovery. The Dodgers blew a three-run lead in the second game of the series, losing 5–4. Two solo homers by Pablo Sandoval and Mike Fontenot in the sixth inning off Ted Lilly led to a 4–3 defeat in the series finale.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers finally {{returned}} home on June 11 only to lose 3–2 to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, led by rookie outfielder Mike Trout, who was 2 for 4 {{with a home}} run and two RBI in the game. The Dodgers struggled against Angels starter Jerome Williams the next night, trailing 2–1 heading {{into the bottom of}} the eighth. However they battled back as Ethier hit a game-tying single and then Juan Rivera put the Dodgers ahead to stay with a three-run home run. Kenley Jansen picked up his 10th save in the 5–2 victory. The Angels took the final game of the series as Erick Aybar hit a tie-breaking home run off Jansen in the top of the ninth to give them the 2-1 win over the Dodgers. In the next game, on June 15 against the Chicago White Sox, Kershaw struggled, giving up 5 runs in his 6 innings of work but the Dodgers came back and won the game 7-6 thanks to a wild pitch by reliever Matt Thornton that pushed across the eventual winning run. The Dodgers again fell behind early the next day, then came back to tie the game. However, this time they lost 5-4. Chris Capuano struck out 12 in 8 innings of the series finale on Father's Day but left the game down 1–0. The Dodgers ralied to tie the game in the bottom of the 9th and won in the 10th after a triple by <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr. and a walk off single by Dee Gordon.|$|E
25|$|On October 19, the Dodgers {{announced}} that they had re-signed starting pitcher Ted Lilly to a three-year contract. On November 4, Jay Gibbons re-signed with the Dodgers for one-year. On November 15, the Dodgers re-signed starting pitcher Hiroki Kuroda to a one-year, $12 million, contract. On November 19, the Dodgers signed minor league catcher Héctor Giménez and added him to their 40-man roster. On November 26, the Dodgers completed their rebuilding of the starting rotation by signing veteran pitcher Jon Garland. On November 30, the Dodgers signed veteran infielder Juan Uribe to a three-year contract, intending to make him the new second baseman. Soon afterward, the Dodgers traded incumbent second baseman Ryan Theriot to the St. Louis Cardinals for relief pitcher Blake Hawksworth. On December 3, one day after releasing veteran Russell Martin, the Dodgers re-signed Catcher Rod Barajas to a one-year deal. Soon afterward, on December 9, the Dodgers finalized a deal to bring back pitcher Vicente Padilla with a one-year contract. Padilla was slated to compete with Garland for the fifth starter spot, and also to possibly pitch out of the bullpen. On December 11, the Dodgers signed outfielder <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr. to a one-year deal. On December 14, the Dodgers signed catcher Dioner Navarro to a contract, to compete with Barajas and A. J. Ellis for time behind the plate. The Dodgers added to the relief corps on December 16 by signing right-handed pitcher Matt Guerrier to a three-year contract. The Dodgers signed outfielder Marcus Thames on January 18.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} month of June where they left off in May, losing their fifth {{straight}} game. This time they committed four errors and were pounded by the Colorado Rockies 13–3 at Coors Field. In that game, the Dodgers set a Major League record by having five sons of former Major Leaguers in the lineup {{at the same time}} (<b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr., Jerry Hairston, Jr., Iván DeJesús, Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. The losing streak came to an end the next day, when they got a strong pitching performance from Aaron Harang and some timely hitting, including Bobby Abreu's first homer as a Dodger, in a 6–2 win. However, the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation the next day as they dropped the series finale to the Rockies 3–2. The Dodgers road trip continued on June 4 as they traveled to Citizens Bank Park to open a four-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Dee Gordon hit a triple to lead off the ninth against Phillies closer Jonathan Papelbon and then scored on a single by Elián Herrera to give the Dodgers the winning margin in the 4–3 victory. Herrera came through the next night as well, hitting a two-RBI double off Cliff Lee {{in the top of the}} eighth to give the Dodgers the go-ahead run in a 2–1 victory over the Phillies. Dee Gordon delivered a two-run single during the Dodgers three-run sixth inning on June 6 as they again came from behind to beat the Phillies, this time by a score of 6-5. Kenley Jansen picked up his third save in three days against the Phillies. The Dodgers, helped by three Phillies errors, swept the series with an 8–3 victory in the series finale. The victory was the 100th career win for pitcher Aaron Harang and the team's first ever four-game series sweep in Philadelphia. The Dodgers continued the lengthy road trip with a cross-country flight to Seattle to take on the Mariners in interleague play. In the opener Nathan Eovaldi pitched six scoreless innings before the Mariners got a run off of relief pitcher Scott Elbert. It was all they needed because Kevin Millwood and five relief pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Dodgers. This was the first official no-hitter against the Dodgers since Kent Mercker of the Atlanta Braves had done it on April 4, 1994. The Dodgers got back into the winning ways the next day as Clayton Kershaw stuck out a season high 12 batters in 7 innings and Jerry Hairston, Jr. hit a home run and had 5 RBI in the 8–3 win. Andre Ethier hit his fourth career grand slam to back Chad Billingsley's strong effort as the Dodgers closed out the lengthy road trip with an 8–2 victory over the Mariners. Billingsley allowed only one run in 7 innings while striking out 8.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{went back}} on the road to face the first place Milwaukee Brewers. Ted Lilly was again sharp, {{allowing}} just two hits in seven innings of work, but one of the hits was a solo home run by Ryan Braun. The Brewers added two more solo shots off Dodger relievers in the eighth and won 3-0 as the Dodgers hit into 4 double plays and a triple play and were unable to score against Randy Wolf. The Dodgers had another strong pitching performance from their starter the next day, as Chad Billingsley allowed only one run in seven innings of work, but the Dodgers were unable to solve Yovani Gallardo and the game was tied at 1-1 entering the bottom of the ninth. However, relief pitchers Hong-Chih Kuo and Mike MacDougal were unable to record an out in the inning and the Brewers recorded the 2-1 walk-off win on Mark Kotsay's bases loaded pinch-hit single. The Brewers won another pitching duel from the Dodgers the following day 3-1 despite another strong start by rookie Nathan Eovaldi. <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr. hit his first home run since July 17, 2010 for the Dodgers lone run of the game. Clayton Kershaw helped the Dodgers avoid a sweep by pitching eight shutout innings to pick up his 15th win as the Dodgers won 5-1 on August 18. Kershaw became the first Dodger pitcher to pick up his 15th win before September since Hideo Nomo in 2003. Hiroki Kuroda finally got some run support, picking up the win in the Dodgers 8-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies on August 19. Rod Barajas hit a three-run homer in the third inning as Kuroda allowed two runs in six innings for his seventh consecutive quality start since the all-star break. The Dodgers blew an extra inning lead and lost to the Rockies 7-6 in 13 innings the next day. They had taken the lead {{in the top of the}} 12th on a solo homer by Aaron Miles and an inside the park homer by Trent Oeltjen, but rookie closer Javy Guerra blew his first save of the season. A walk-off single by Dexter Fowler in the 13th ended the game. Oeltjen's inside the park homer was the 1st by a Dodger since Blake DeWitt on May 6, 2008. James Loney had 4 hits in 4 at-bats on the 21st, including his 6th homer of the season. Chad Billingsley struck out 7 and only allowed 3 hits in 7 2/3 innings, but was victimized by two 2-run homers by Carlos González and Seth Smith and the Dodgers dropped the finale against the Rockies 5-3. With the win, the Rockies broke a 17-game losing streak in Sunday games, a Major League record. The Dodgers next started a three-game series on the road against the St. Louis Cardinals. Chris Carpenter blanked the Dodgers through eight innings, but the Dodgers rallied in the ninth as Aaron Miles hit an RBI triple off Fernando Salas to tie the score at one and then Rod Barajas hit a grounder to short that former Dodger Rafael Furcal bobbled to allow Miles to score with the winning run. Kershaw picked up his 16th win the next night, pitching six scoreless innings in the Dodgers 13-2 win over the Cardinals. Matt Kemp and Aaron Miles hit solo homers and Rod Barajas hit two homers as the Dodger offense had a rare outburst of power. The Dodgers won the final game of the series 9-4 thanks to a six run third inning and another effective performance by Hiroki Kuroda. The offensive outburst included the first career home run by A. J. Ellis as the Dodgers picked up their first series sweep of the Cardinals on the road since 1993. The Dodgers also moved ahead in the lifetime series with the Cardinals 1,002 wins to 1,001 for the Cards.|$|E

500|$|The Phillies {{announced}} their opening-day roster on March 29, near the deadline. Since {{they did not}} need a fifth starter for two weeks, four starters, eight relievers, two catchers, six infielders and five outfielders made up the roster. Two players who {{did not expect to}} make the team when they began spring training were left-handed reliever Mario Hollands (who said he was in [...] "shock" [...] when he heard the news) and outfielder <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr., ending a [...] "long road back to the majors".|$|E
500|$|Bagwell {{played in}} 110 {{games in the}} 1994 season, batting [...]368 with a [...]750 SLG, 1.201 OPS, 39 HR, 116 RBI, 104 runs scored, 300 total bases and 213 {{adjusted}} OPS (OPS+) in 400 at bats. [...] He led the major leagues in SLG, OPS+, RBI, and total bases, and the NL in runs scored and OPS, but fell short of winning the batting Triple Crown, finishing second for the batting title to <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> who, after batting [...]394, had the highest average {{in the major leagues}} since Ted Williams in 1941. [...] Bagwell finished second in HR to Matt Williams, who hit 43.|$|E
500|$|With {{his team}} facing a 5–4 deficit, Craig belted the game-winning grand slam against the {{division}} rival Reds on August 26. [...] The final outcome was 8–6. [...] It {{was his first}} career grand slam, boosting his totals to seven hits in ten bases-loaded at-bats to go with 20 RBI to that point in the season (14 for 31, [...]452 batting average for his career). [...] He was also batting [...]452 {{with runners in scoring}} position – again leading the Major Leagues – and it was the third-highest of all time for a single season, after George Brett (.469, 1980) and <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> (.459, 1997).|$|E
500|$|Hershiser {{had ended}} Padres catcher Benito Santiago's 34-game hitting streak {{the year before}} and the Padres were eager to snap Hershiser's streak. Santiago's streak was an MLB record for a catcher, an MLB record for a rookie and a team record for the Padres. No one who has started a hitting streak at age 22 or younger has matched the streak since. According to <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> [...] "We wanted so badly to put a run on the board...Maybe, we tried a little too hard. You {{have to give the}} man credit. He didn't give me one decent pitch to hit all night. He put {{everything}} right where he wanted it to go." ...|$|E
500|$|After their 4–2 home stand, the Phillies {{traveled}} to Atlanta {{to play the}} Braves. The series' first game lasted 13 innings, with the Phillies scoring five runs {{in the top of}} the 13th for a 6–1 win. Aaron Altherr, called up to replace <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr. (on the bereavement list after the death of his father, Hall of Famer <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn),</b> pinch-hit in the bottom of the 12th inning for his major-league debut. Kendrick started for the Phillies in game two of the series, [...] "assertive" [...] overcoming his previous first-inning struggles and allowing two runs in seven innings for a 5–2 win. The team swept the Braves, winning the final game of the series 10–5; Marlon Byrd had three RBIs and a home run, but backup catcher Wil Nieves (who had three hits in the game) hurt his leg rounding first base after hitting a ground rule double. The Phillies called up Cameron Rupp as backup catcher, demoting Altherr while Nieves recovered. They then {{traveled to}} St. Louis for a four-game series with the Cardinals. Buchanan started for the Phillies in the [...] "best performance of his young career", pitching 7 innings and allowing one run in a 4–1 victory. Ryan Howard hit a home run, his 14th of the season, in his hometown. Brignac injured his ankle in a slide; he went on the DL, and Asche returned from the list. The next day, Burnett pitched the Phillies to their ninth win (5–1) in 11 games. They split the series, losing the last two games: a June 21 pitchers' duel between Hamels and Adam Wainwright (the 4–1 loss ended the Phillies' five-game winning streak) and a 5–3 loss the following day, with Kendrick giving up four runs in one inning.|$|E
500|$|Wiggins enjoyed stubbornly {{engaging}} in debates with his teammates, particularly Padres teammate Eric Show, just to provoke reactions from them. <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> suggested that Wiggins was sometimes misunderstood. [...] "To not like Alan Wiggins, {{is to not}} know Alan Wiggins," [...] Gwynn said. Wiggins' agent, Tony Attanasio, said that Wiggins became deeply depressed in Baltimore. He had always been reserved and {{had a difficult time}} trusting other people. Attanasio said that Orioles players often actively avoided Wiggins. While Wiggins enjoyed reading books and newspapers, Attanasio said that teammates were turned off by his intellect. The Orioles once gave an IQ test, and Wiggins scored higher than everyone except for Weaver. According to Attanasio, players in Baltimore also resented Wiggins because he replaced Rich Dauer, who had been a well-liked member of the team. Lee Lacy was one of his only friends in Baltimore.|$|E
500|$|On April 28, 2007 in a 3–2 {{win over}} the Dodgers, Hoffman earned a save and pitched in his 803rd game for the Padres, {{breaking}} the MLB record for games pitched for one team. The record was previously held by both Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators and Elroy Face of the Pittsburgh Pirates. [...] On June 6 against the Dodgers, Hoffman became the first pitcher in MLB history to log 500 saves after the Padres' 5–2 victory. Hoffman was awarded the MLB Delivery Man of the Month for May after converting all 11 of his save opportunities and allowing no earned runs in 13 games. On July 1, Hoffman {{was named to the}} NL All-Star Team for the sixth time in his career. [...] On September 8 against the Colorado Rockies, Hoffman struck-out Todd Helton swinging on a 74-mph change-up for his 1,000th career strikeout, becoming the eighth reliever to reach the mark. On September 27, Hoffman picked up his 40th save of the 2007 season, marking his ninth season with 40 saves, a Major League record. On September 29, one strike away from clinching the Padres third consecutive playoff berth, Hoffman surrendered a tying, two-out triple in the ninth inning to <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn,</b> Jr., son of legendary Padres Hall of Famer <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn.</b> The Padres would lose 4–3 in the 11th inning to the Milwaukee Brewers. On October 1, in the Padres' wild card tie-breaker game against the Rockies, Hoffman blew his second straight save opportunity and his team's 8–6 lead in the 13th inning. He took the loss when he allowed the game-winning run to score on a sacrifice fly. For the season, he converted 42 saves in 49 opportunities while posting a 4-5 mark and 2.98 ERA. [...] His 42 saves were the third most in the NL. A couple of weeks {{after the end of the}} season, Hoffman had minor arthroscopic surgery on his pitching elbow to remove bone chips. [...] He said it was unrelated to his pitching performance at the end of the season.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{unconfirmed}} stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn)</b> once {{offered him a}} seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, [...] "Ten years? What are you talking about? Rickey got 16, 17 years." [...] One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player. While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson {{was said to have}} commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, [...] "That was me." [...] The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, {{as well as with the}} 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 2003 season, {{he worked}} with <b>Tony</b> <b>Gwynn</b> on skills at the plate, {{predominantly}} using the whole field and being more of a [...] "slap hitter". However, he began the season slowly, sustaining a hamstring injury in spring training that hindered his progress, and ultimately struggling at the plate early in the season, causing manager Larry Bowa to drop him in the lineup. Throughout the season, he sought to maintain the focus that he admitted to having lost the previous season, and he eventually rebounded to post a [...] "respectable" [...] stat line – a [...]263 batting average with eight home runs and 62 RBIs, although he stole what {{at the time was}} a career-low 20 bases. Among his season highlights were a game-winning RBI against John Smoltz in June, and stealing his 100th career base in September, both of which occurred in games against the Atlanta Braves.|$|E
