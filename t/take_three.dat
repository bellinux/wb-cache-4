5|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is an effort}} to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce gender bias and inequity. Feminist macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal austerity, deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, international trade and more. In general, these modifications <b>take</b> <b>three</b> main forms: gender disaggregation, the addition of gender-based macroeconomic variables, {{and the creation of a}} two-sector system.|$|E
5|$|Home {{propagation}} is best {{performed by}} using offset bulbils. Commercially, only cultivars that produce {{at least three}} bulbils on the mother bulb are used for this form of propagation. Plants grown from this method <b>take</b> <b>three</b> to four years to bloom.|$|E

5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in full sun or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds <b>take</b> <b>three</b> to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
5|$|For the new attack, Nelson was to <b>take</b> <b>three</b> {{ships of}} the line, three frigates, {{including}} Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, {{a combination of}} strong currents and heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|In 1729, the Royal Naval Academy in Portsmouth– {{renamed the}} Royal Naval College in 1806– was founded, for 40students aged between 13 and 16, who would <b>take</b> <b>three</b> years to {{complete}} a course of study defined in an illustrated book, and would earn two years of sea time {{as part of their}} studies. The rating of midshipman-by-order, or midshipman ordinary, was used specifically for graduates of the Royal Naval College, to distinguish them from midshipmen who had served aboard ship, who were paid more. The school was unpopular in the Navy, because officers enjoyed the privilege of having servants and preferred the traditional method of training officers via apprenticeship.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 {{the site}} was bought by {{property}} developers Regalian Properties. A competition to develop {{the site was}} won by architect Terry Farrell, with an urban village as Farrell's original proposal. A scheme of office blocks was subsequently developed for the site, with a government agency as their occupier. The building had been sold for £130million in 1989, with construction planned to <b>take</b> <b>three</b> years, built by John Laing. SIS ultimately became the occupiers of the building. Farrell's design for the SIS building was influenced by 1930s industrial modernist architecture such as Bankside and Battersea Power Stations and Mayan and Aztec religious temples.|$|E
5|$|McCool was rested as the Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval and won by an innings. McCool {{returned for}} the next match, which was Cambridge University. After going wicketless for 31 runs in the first innings, he did not bat as Australia declared at 4/414 in reply to the hosts’ 167. In the second innings, McCool took the first four wicketsincluding two stumpings by Ron Saggersto leave the hosts at 4/73.

5|$|The most {{stringent}} {{tests are}} reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may <b>take</b> <b>three</b> or four years to complete.|$|E

Fleming worked full-time for the paper until December 1959, but continued to write articles and attend the Tuesday weekly meetings until at least 1961.|$|E

5|$|A {{shortage}} of transport aircraft {{meant that it}} would <b>take</b> <b>three</b> days to transport the division to Arnhem. The plan called {{for the majority of}} the 1st Airlanding Brigade and the 1st Parachute Brigade to land on day one. The parachute brigade would head for Arnhem and capture the bridges over the Lower Rhine while the airlanding brigade secured drop zones for units arriving on the second and third days. When all the division's units had arrived the brigade would take up defensive positions to the west of Arnhem. The 1st Airlanding Brigade units arriving on the second lift were to be two companies plus one mortar, one machine gun and one anti-tank platoon of the Staffords, along with three platoons and sections from the mortar, machine gun and anti-tank platoons of the KOSB. The Borders contingent amounted to a further eight platoons.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} toss, the Australians made all their {{runs on the}} first day, with centuries for Hassett (103), Harvey (126) and Johnson (113*) and 99 for Hamence. The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket, through Hassett and Barnes, who was {{replaced}} by Harvey after retiring ill. The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries, and were keen to see Hamence do the same. The {{rest of the team}} left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone, only to see him stumped for 99, his highest score for the season. On the Monday, the second day, on a pitch that was taking spin, Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total. McCool took 4/21 and 4/23, and Johnston also took eight, including 5/34 in the second innings. He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner, and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast-medium bowler to <b>take</b> <b>three</b> wickets in four balls.|$|E

5|$|Denis Compton hit a {{cautious}} 62, but Middlesex lost wickets regularly {{to fall from}} 1/78 to 203 all out. Five bowlers shared the wickets, Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece. At one stage, Australia were 53/3, but Morris (109) and Loxton (123) put on a partnership of 172. No other batsman bettered Hamence's 30, and Jim Sims took 6/65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46. Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings, with only John Dewes (51) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists, while eight managed only single figures. Five bowlers shared the wickets, and McCool {{was the only one}} to <b>take</b> <b>three.</b> McCool and Ring made the 22 required for victory in four overs.|$|E
5|$|Early {{estimates}} on {{rebuilding the}} damaged {{section of the}} Pentagon were that it would <b>take</b> <b>three</b> years to complete. However, the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the one-year anniversary of the attack.

An outdoor memorial, commissioned by the Pentagon and designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman, was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11, 2008. Since September 11, American Airlines continues to fly from Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. As of August 2016, flight number 77 has been renumbered to 2636, now using a Boeing 737-800, departing at 7:40 in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is serotinous—it accumulates a canopy seed bank that is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants <b>take</b> <b>three</b> to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire.|$|E
