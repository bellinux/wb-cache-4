5|$|Good husbandry, proper feeding, and hygiene are {{the main}} {{contributors}} to animal health on the farm, bringing economic benefits through maximised production. When, despite these precautions, animals still become sick, they are treated with veterinary medicines, by the farmer and the veterinarian.

5|$|By law, a valid unexpired Lebanese {{passport}} or Identity card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (transl. Bitakat Al Hawiya); French: Carte D'identité) is conclusive (and {{not just}} prima facie) proof of Lebanese citizenship, {{and has the}} same force and effect as proof of Lebanese citizenship as certificates of naturalization or of citizenship, if issued to a Lebanese citizen for the full period allowed by law. The Lebanese law does not prohibit Lebanese citizens from holding passports of other countries, though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> use their Lebanese passport to enter and leave the country. An expired Lebanese passport can still be used {{to return to the}} Republic of Lebanon at any port and port personnel are obliged by law to allow the passage of the bearer without any delay or hindrance. Lebanese passports are property of the Republic of Lebanon and must be returned to the Lebanese Government upon demand.|$|E
5|$|Cadets that {{transfer}} to the senior member side {{between the ages of}} 18 and 20 receive the grade of flight officer (if the highest cadet award earned was the Mitchell), technical flight officer (if the highest cadet award earned was the Earhart) or senior flight officer (if the highest cadet award earned was the Spaatz). If the cadet waits until their 21st birthday, at which point <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> {{transfer to}} the senior member program, they are eligible for the grade of second lieutenant (if the highest cadet award was the Mitchell), first lieutenant (if the highest cadet award was the Earhart), or captain (if the highest cadet award was the Spaatz).|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a yield sign ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E
60|$|Some of the Reverend Frank Milvey's brethren {{had found}} {{themselves}} exceedingly uncomfortable in their minds, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> bury the dead too hopefully. But, the Reverend Frank, inclining {{to the belief}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> do one or two other things (say out of nine-and-thirty) calculated to trouble their consciences rather more if they would think as much about them, held his peace.|$|R

5|$|Like all fairywrens, {{the splendid}} fairywren {{is an active}} and restless feeder, {{particularly}} on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement {{is a series of}} jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. However, splendid fairywrens are stronger fliers than most other fairywrens. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E

5|$|Sections 21–23 {{cover the}} review of agents and the {{liability}} of trustees for agents actions. Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the trustees appoints agents, nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument. Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers, with the duty consisting of three elements. Firstly, trustees are required {{to make sure that}} agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do. Secondly, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it. Thirdly, trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it. Section 23 establishes trustees' liability for the actions of agents; a trustee is liable for negligence if he violates the general duty of care set out in Section 1, but not otherwise.|$|E

Most of the structures in the encampment, described by The Miami Herald as a [...] "shantytown", were tents, improvised wood, or cardboard structures. Some had plumbing and cooking capacities, and residents of the colony shared generators for electricity, only used to recharge cell phones and the tracking devices <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> wear.|$|R
5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), goosefoot (Chenopodium) and new shoots of samphire. During spring and summer, birds {{are active in}} bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays.

5|$|In Key Stage 4 (Years 10 and 11), pupils study a core {{curriculum}} comprising English, mathematics, science, PE, RE and citizenship. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> take GCSEs in English, mathematics and science, alongside two option blocks, plus either a {{modern foreign language}} or a vocational course. English Language is taught in Year 10 and Literature the following year. Mathematics in taken by all pupils; they may opt-in for a GCSE in Statistics in Year 10, and the most able pupils may take Further Maths at GCSE in Year 11. Science courses are based on ability; pupils may study for three separate science qualifications, a dual or single award in Science or BTEC Applied Science. pupils may choose a modern foreign language (French, Spanish or German), a humanity (history or geography), computing or separate sciences (biology, chemistry and physics) for their options {{as part of the}} English Baccalaureate. Additionally, the school offers six technology courses at GCSE (electronics, food technology, graphics, product design, resistant materials and textiles), as well as art and design, drama, music, PE, RE and child development GCSE qualifications. Vocational courses are also offered at Level 2, including applied business, construction, engineering, health and social care, ICT, music, performing arts, and travel and tourism. Pupils also participate in work-related learning.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E
5000|$|The {{mid-19th century}} {{witnessed}} a [...] "mass-migration" [...] from England to its colonies. In response, the Church of England sent clergy, but {{the demand for}} them to serve overseas exceeded supply. [...] Colonial bishoprics were established, but the bishops were without clergy. The training of missionary clergy for the colonies was “notoriously difficult” because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> have not only “piety and desire,” <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> have an education “equivalent {{to that of a}} university degree.” The founding of the missionary college St. Augustine’s provided a solution to this problem.|$|R
