We made Brian do it." [...] McCartney stated: [...] "I do feel sorry for him, because of what he could have been on to." [...] Harrison said: [...] "We weren't very good at telling Pete he had to go," [...] and [...] "Historically it may look like we did something nasty to Pete and it may have been <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> handled it better." [...] Starr, on the other hand, feels he has no apology to make: [...] "I never felt sorry … I was not involved." [...] In 1968, authorised Beatles biographer Hunter Davies wrote: [...] "But for the sake of Pete's career, whatever happened to the Beatles afterward, the handling and especially the announcing of the sacking might have been done more neatly and cleanly. He could have been fixed up with a job in another group before the news was announced." [...] Over twenty years later Mark Lewisohn concluded that [...] "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete, who had served the group unstintingly from their hapless, drummerless Silver Beatles days through three lengthy Hamburg seasons and over 200 Cavern Club performances. He had shared in the heartaches and the headaches, had controlled the Beatles' bookings before Epstein took over, and had made his home – the Casbah – their home. The Beatles had had two years in which to dismiss him but hadn't done so, and now – as they were beginning to reap the rewards for their long, hard slog, with money rolling in and an EMI contract secured – he was out. It was the most underhand, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power." ...|$|E

Janine said: [...] "We didn't use the parental authority <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> had over her. It was a request that I addressed to her. Gently.

2500|$|Smart Bomb Interactive {{stated that}} the {{inspiration}} for Flying Ace came from their well received 2006 title, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron. [...] "We were {{very proud of that}} game and it was a critical success, but the budget and time constraints that came from the publisher [...] left us feeling <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done a lot more. So we went to United Media and representatives of the Schulz family, and we licensed the property ourselves" [...] stated Clark Stacey, Vice President for Smart Bomb Interactive. [...] "But of course, it was Charles M. Schulz’s original strips of Snoopy as the World Famous WWI Flying Ace that are the ultimate inspiration" [...] added Stacey.

2500|$|In contrast, British Prime Minister Edward Heath {{decided to}} {{negotiate}} with the hijackers, ultimately agreeing to release Khaled and others in exchange for hostages.

'I think your government would want to weigh very, very carefully the kind of outcry that would occur in this country against your taking this kind of action.' Greenhill replied: 'Well, they do, Joe, but there is also an outcry in this country,' expressing concern that 'Israel won't lift a bloody finger and ... our people get killed.

2500|$|Powell said, [...] "In {{the minds}} of the Russians the {{inevitable}} commitment of the United States in such a war would have come not directly or necessarily from the stationing of American marines in Germany, but, as it came in the previous two struggles, from the ultimate involvement of the United States in any war determining the future of Europe". Thatcher's belief in the nuclear hypothesis [...] "in the context of the use of American bases in Britain to launch an aggressive attack on Libya, that it was 'inconceivable' <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> refused a demand placed upon this country by the United States. The Prime Minister supplied the reason why: she said it was because we depend for our liberty and freedom upon the United States. Once let the nuclear hypothesis be questioned or destroyed, once allow it to break down, and from that moment the American imperative in this country's policies disappears with it".|$|E
2500|$|Produced by C. B. Cochran, {{the play}} premiered on 18 August 1930, at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh, {{directed}} by Coward and starring Coward as Elyot, Adrianne Allen as Sybil, Gertrude Lawrence as Amanda, and Laurence Olivier as Victor. [...] Sets and costumes {{were designed by}} Gladys Calthrop. [...] After successfully touring Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Southsea for five weeks, the production opened the new Phoenix Theatre in London on 24 September 1930. A week after the play opened, Heinemann published the text; a week later, HMV issued recordings of scenes from the play performed by Coward and Lawrence. [...] Coward disliked appearing in long runs, and the London run was therefore a limited three-month season. It sold out within a week and was still playing to packed houses when, despite [...] "the gratifying knowledge <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> run on for another six ," [...] it ended on 20 December 1930.|$|E
