The mode builds storylines, and integrates cut scenes and rivalries between wrestlers based on the matches that are wrestled. These cut scenes appear randomly before, during, and after the match. In WWE '12, championships {{was not able to}} be toggled on and off from most wrestlers. WWE '13 introduced the option to <b>toggle</b> <b>on</b> and off rivalries injuries and tag team changes also crowd reactions. WWE 2K14 was the last title to use the method of created arena before it was removed in WWE 2K15. In WWE 2K15, secret hints had to be unlocked through actions in this mode; they were 300 to collect. WWE 2K16 allows wrestlers to be branded by multiple promotions. WWE 2K17 replicates real television with a promo engine. WWE 2K18 has remade Universe Mode from scratch as a new goal system is put in place and draft system has been removed as player can reshuffle them.|$|E
2500|$|Clones are {{computers}} that imitate C64 functions. In {{the middle of}} 2004, after an absence from the marketplace of more than 10 years, PC manufacturer Tulip Computers BV (owners of the Commodore brand since 1997) announced the C64 Direct-to-TV (C64DTV), a joystick-based TV game based on the C64 with 30 video games built into ROM. Designed by Jeri Ellsworth, a self-taught computer designer who had earlier designed the modern C-One C64 implementation, the C64DTV was similar in concept to other mini-consoles based on the Atari 2600 and Intellivision which had gained modest success earlier in the decade. The product was advertised on QVC in the United States for the 2004 holiday season. By [...] "hacking" [...] the circuit board, {{it is possible to}} attach C1541 floppy disk drives, hard drives, second joysticks, and PS/2-keyboards to these units, which gives the DTV devices nearly all the capabilities of a full Commodore 64. The DTV hardware is also used in the mini-console Hummer, sold at RadioShack in mid-2005. In 2015, a Commodore 64 compatible motherboard was produced by Individual Computers. [...] Dubbed the [...] "C64 Reloaded", it is a modern redesign of the Commodore 64 motherboard revision 250466 with a few new features. The motherboard itself is designed to be placed in an empty C64 or C64C case already owned by the user. Produced in limited quantities, models of this Commodore 64 [...] "clone" [...] sports either machined or ZIF sockets in which the custom C64 chips would be placed. [...] The board also contains jumpers to accept different revisions of the VIC-II and SID chips, as well as the ability to jumper between the analogue video system modes PAL and NTSC. [...] The motherboard contains several innovations, including selection via the RESTORE key of multiple KERNAL and character ROMs, built-in reset <b>toggle</b> <b>on</b> the power switch, and an S-video socket to replace the original TV modulator. [...] The motherboard is powered by DC-to-DC converter that uses a single power input of [...] from a mains adapter to power the unit rather than the original and failure prone Commodore 64 power supply brick.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Qianlong the Admonitions Scroll {{remained}} in the imperial palace at Beijing, but when the building the [...] "Four Beauties" [...] were housed in {{was in need of}} repairs the Empress Dowager Cixi (de facto ruler of China from 1861 to 1908) ordered the four paintings to be transferred to the Summer Palace {{to the west of the}} city. [...] In 1899 the Boxer Rebellion broke out, and the following summer an international force was sent to quell the rebellion and relieve the siege of Western legations in Beijing. [...] After the suppression of the Boxers, there was a considerable amount of looting throughout the capital, and during this time of chaos Captain Clarence A. K. Johnson (1870–1937) of the 1st Bengal Lancers, who was stationed at the Summer Palace, somehow managed to acquire the Admonitions Scroll. [...] His family later claimed that he was given the scroll as a reward for escorting a [...] "lady of high birth" [...] and her family to safety, but this story has never been corroborated. [...] Johnson did not realise the value of the scroll, but when he returned to London in 1902 he took it to the British Museum to have the jade <b>toggle</b> <b>on</b> it valued. [...] The keeper of the department of Prints and Drawings, Sidney Colvin (1845–1927), and his assistant, Laurence Binyon (1869–1943), recognised the significance of the painting, and in 1903 the British Museum purchased it from Johnson for the sum of £25. [...] By 1910 the scroll had been examined by a number of experts in Oriental art, and it had been recognised as an ancient masterpiece of Chinese art, and in 1912 the British Museum commissioned the printing of one hundred woodblock colour print facsimiles of the painting by Sugizaki Hideaki (杉崎秀明) [...] and Urushibara Mokuchu (漆原木虫). [...] In 1914–1915 the scroll was dismantled, and remounted on two long stretchers, one containing the nine scenes of the original painting, and one containing all the other sections, except for the Zou Yigui painting, which was mounted separately as an album leaf. [...] Since 1914 the painting has been housed in the North Wing of the British Museum, although it is only occasionally put on public display due to its sensitivity to light.|$|E

The Favourite Male and Female Character awards and Favourite Onscreen Couple award were dropped last year so that viewers can focus on the online voting of the Top 10 awards, and the Social Media Award was scrapped.

50|$|Transmission of a byte is {{accomplished}} by dividing it into two nibbles of four bits each. Each nibble is transmitted by setting the four data lines according to the four nibble bits and then toggling the acknowledge line. This toggle indicates the receiving host that the nibble {{is ready to be}} read. Once the receiving host has read the nibble, it toggles its synchronization line to tell the transmitter that the nibble has been read and that a new one may be sent. Both hosts use a <b>toggle</b> <b>on</b> their acknowledge lines to indicate that the read or write operation has been performed. As a result, each host has to wait for a toggle from the other host before proceeding with a new operation.|$|E

5000|$|The NES Advantage {{features}} adjustable turbo {{controls for}} the A and B buttons {{which could be}} toggled on or off with a button; users can adjust {{the rate of the}} turbo (i.e., how quickly the A or B button is pressed) by adjusting the respective turbo dials located above each button. The Advantage features a pseudo-slow motion feature, which users can <b>toggle</b> <b>on</b> and off by pressing the [...] "slow" [...] button. However, the slow motion feature does not work with all games, including games compatible with the NES Zapper or R.O.B. accessories. The slow button works by very rapidly pressing a virtual start button, which could lead to problems when the player attempts to do an action while the game is paused (e.g., jumping or firing). This feature was not compatible with games with start menus or pause screens. The slow motion feature was unique at release, though it became a popular feature on later controllers. The controller has two wires to plug into both controller ports. By toggling a switch between [...] "Player 1" [...] and [...] "Player 2", the Advantage can be shared with another player for games where two players alternate gameplay.|$|E
5000|$|Non-final {{legs of a}} multi-leg move {{also have}} the option to end on an {{occupied}} square without disturbing its contents. To indicate this the modifier p is used, and thus has a slightly different meaning than on final legs; the traditional meaning can then be seen as shorthand for paf. To make the a notation more versatile, it can also be used when the moves of the two legs are not exactly congruent: g is an alternative to indicates a non-final leg to an occupied square, but in contrast to p it specifies a 'range toggle', converting a mentioned rider move into the corresponding leaper move (e.g. R <-> W) for the next leg, and vice versa (making the traditional g shorthand for gaf). A similar range <b>toggle</b> <b>on</b> reaching an empty square can be indicated by y, to indicate a slider spontaneously turns a corner after starting with a leap. Continuation directions will allways be encoded in the 8-fold (K) system, even when the initial leg only had 4-fold symmetry. Mention of an intermediate direction on a 4-fold-symmetrical move would then swap orthogonal moves to the corresponding diagonal moves, (e.g. W <-> F) and vice versa. (So mafsW is the Xiangqi horse, move to an empty W-square, and continue one F-step at 45 degree, and yafsW is the gryphon.) ...|$|E
