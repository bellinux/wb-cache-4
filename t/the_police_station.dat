5|$|JNA and Croatian sources {{disagree}} on events immediately following {{arrival of the}} JNA in Dalj. While the JNA claimed it requested a cessation of the fire only to be refused by the defenders of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>station,</b> Croatian sources claim the JNA demanded the unconditional surrender of {{the police and the}} ZNG, and were refused by the Croatian force. Both versions agree that the combat resumed until approximately 10a.m., when three tank main gun rounds, fired by the JNA, hit <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>station.</b> While the JNA reported there were no Croatian policemen or ZNG troops captured alive, contradicting its own report stating that the Croatian force located outside <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>station</b> accepted cessation of hostilities, the Croatian sources claim that those who surrendered were killed after their capture. Overall, 39 were killed in the fighting for <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>station</b> in Dalj—20 policemen, 15 ZNG troops and four civil defencemen.|$|E

5|$|The ground {{offensive}} in Glina commenced {{with a single}} SAO Krajina soldier tasked with firing on a JNA armoured vehicle from an area close to <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>station.</b> This attempted false flag attack was designed to make the vehicle crew believe {{that they were being}} fired on by the Croatian police, inducing them to fire at <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>station.</b> The original shooter was observed by the police and shot at from the station, which was in turn fired upon by the JNA. A JNA colonel at the scene then threatened to use force against the Serb rebels unless they left the scene.
