5|$|After the {{revolution}} in Russia in 1917, the communist movement gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the First Red Scare of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US. In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union</b> (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 expelling communists from its leadership ranks.|$|E

Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Liberties</b> <b>Union,</b> its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government.
