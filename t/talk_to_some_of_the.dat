2500|$|With time, Logroño {{was given}} the chance to do a {{political}} satire show on television station WAPA-TV, which was called [...] "Politiqueando", in 1996. As means to promote the television program, Logroño staged short on-air telephone calls to Salsoul, a Puerto Rican radio station. The early evening disc-jockey, Fernando Arévalo, would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters of the show, namely a cat puppet of Logroño's called Polito Garrapatoso, as well as to Don Eleuterio, for no longer than five minutes. Success from these phone calls was such that audiences demanded a longer treatment. Agitando El Show was then born, giving Eleuterio ten, and later twenty minutes of airtime. Eventually the program grew in length, and Don Eleuterio was given a full hour of airtime daily. The program's name, [...] "Agitando", means [...] "Shaking (people up)", as to depict the expected uproar from segments of the audience whenever Don Eleuterio went on the air.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{five days}} after the shootings, 100,000 people {{demonstrated}} in Washington, D.C., against the war and the killing of unarmed student protesters. Ray Price, Nixon's chief speechwriter from 1969 to 1974, recalled the Washington demonstrations saying, [...] "The city was an armed camp. The mobs were smashing windows, slashing tires, dragging parked cars into intersections, even throwing bedsprings off overpasses into the traffic down below. This was the quote, student protest. That's not student protest, that's civil war." [...] Not only was Nixon taken to Camp David for two days for his own protection, but Charles Colson (Counsel to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973) stated that the military was called up to protect the administration from the angry students; he recalled that [...] "The 82nd Airborne was {{in the basement of the}} executive office building, so I went down just to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guys and walk among them, and they're lying on the floor leaning on their packs and their helmets and their cartridge belts and their rifles cocked and you're thinking, 'This can't be the United States of America. This is not the greatest free democracy in the world. This is a nation at war with itself.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Clavijo's {{visit to}} Samarkand {{allowed him to}} report to the European {{audience}} on the news from Cathay (China), which few Europeans had been able to visit directly in the century that had passed since the travels of Marco Polo. Clavijo's account reported, even if in a garbled form, on the recent civil war between the descendants of the Hongwu Emperor. The Spanish were able to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese visitors, and learned about the caravan routes between Samarkand and Cambalu (Beijing). Besides telling the European readers about the Cathayan capital Cambalu, which he was told was [...] "the largest city in the world", and the mighty armies of that country, Clavijo also—mistakenly—reported that the new emperor of Cathay had converted to Catholicism. Thus his report served as one of the factors supporting the European belief in the widespread presence of Christianity in Cathay, which was to persist until the early 17th century and {{to be one of the}} reasons for sending the famed Bento de Góis expedition in 1603.|$|E

50|$|He won {{prominence}} {{with his}} scoop {{report on the}} bombing of Guernica on 26 April 1937. His telegram to London described German bomb casings (inscribed with the words Rheindorf 1936, with the German eagle insignia), {{and the use of}} thermite as an incendiary to create a firestorm {{in the center of the}} town. High explosive bombs were used to create blast damage to wooden structures, which could then be ignited more easily by the incendiaries. His reporting did much to inspire Pablo Picasso to record the atrocity for posterity in his massive painting. It also alerted western governments to the way the Germans were preparing to use terror bombing as a way to intimidate civilians. His reports were directly contradicted by the Nationalists, who said that the damage was caused by the Government forces themselves, a common ploy by fascist and nazi propagandists. Steer responded to such reports by providing details of the damage in the town (such as bomb craters) and the Luftwaffe aircraft used in the attack, such as Heinkel He 111 bombers. Although he was not an eye-witness to the bombing itself, he arrived soon afterwards, and so was able to see the effects and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survivors. He was one of the last journalists to leave Bilbao as the Nationalists advanced, and fled to Santander to the west.|$|E
