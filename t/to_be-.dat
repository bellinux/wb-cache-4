500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{said that}} the live CD proved that Madonna is a better singer. A {{reviewer}} from The Buffalo News {{was impressed with the}} release, saying that [...] "This is exactly what you'd expect it <b>to</b> <b>be–</b> a live document of Madonna's most recent tour, which means, essentially, a tour through the dance-based pop music of the past 20 years." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide website explained that [...] "though parts of I'm Going to Tell You a Secret frustrate, it remains a reasonably entertaining program. It probably will be most interesting for Madonna's most serious fans, though. Those in search of the broader titillation of Truth or Dare will leave disappointed." [...] He added that most of the shots in the DVD seemed accurate, time-and-again a softness crept up in the wide angle shots. Jacobson found the performance s shots to be compelling and gave the sound of the DVD a rating of B+. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award at the 49th ceremony in the category Best Long Form Music Video.|$|E
500|$|The G-spot being {{analogous}} {{to the base of}} the male penis has additionally been theorized, with sentiment from researcher Amichai Kilchevsky that because female fetal development is the [...] "default" [...] state in the absence of substantial exposure to male hormones and therefore the penis is essentially a clitoris enlarged by such hormones, there is no evolutionary reason why females would have an entity in addition to the clitoris that can produce orgasms. The general difficulty of achieving orgasms vaginally, which is a predicament that is likely due to nature easing the process of child bearing by drastically reducing the number of vaginal nerve endings, challenge arguments that vaginal orgasms help encourage sexual intercourse in order to facilitate reproduction. Supporting a distinct G-spot, however, is a study by Rutgers University, published in 2011, which was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain; the scans indicated that the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall– where the G-spot is reported <b>to</b> <b>be–</b> when several women stimulated themselves in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) machine. Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings, stated that he feels that [...] "the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing" [...] and that it is [...] "a region, it's a convergence of many different structures".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the death}} of Joseph Smith, the First Presidency had made nearly all the major {{decisions}} and led the Church of Christ both naturally and spiritually. [...] On June 1, 1841, Sidney Rigdon had been ordained by Joseph Smith as a [...] "Prophet, Seer and Revelator"—which was one of the same ecclesiastical titles held by Smith. The Church of Jesus Christ maintains that as First Counselor to Smith, Rigdon should naturally have been the leader of the church after Smith's death. With this understanding, The Church of Jesus Christ actively opposes the opinion that the Quorum of Twelve had the right to lead the church. The Church of Jesus Christ argues that Rigdon should have been allowed to be what he claimed <b>to</b> <b>be—</b> a [...] "guardian" [...] over the church until proper proceedings could decide the next president— and that proceedings which resulted in Brigham Young leading the church constituted a procedural violation.|$|E

In addition <b>to</b> <b>be-ing</b> important <b>to</b> neurobiologists, accurate segmentation {{is a vital}} component of an automated image processing system. Due {{to the complexity of}} the data, par-ticularly the extreme irregularity in neural cell shape, generic segmentation techniques do not perform well. This paper presents a novel segmentation tech-nique for segmenting neural cells in three dimensional images. Accuracy rates of over 90 % are reported on a data set of 100 images containing over 130 neural cells and subsequently validated using a novel data set of 64 neurons. ...|$|R

[...] Commenting on Komisaruk's research and other findings, Emmanuele Jannini, a professor of endocrinology at the University of Aquila in Italy, acknowledged a series of essays published in March 2012 in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, which document evidence that vaginal and clitoral orgasms are separate phenomena that activate different areas of the brain and possibly suggest key psychological differences between women.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the feasibility of Cerenkov luminescence (CL) imaging of patients undergoing diagnostic 18 F-FDG scans to detect nodal disease. Methods: Patients undergoing routine 18 F-FDG PET/CT for various malignancies consented <b>to</b> <b>be-ing</b> scanned for CL. White-light and Cerenkov images (5 -min acqui-sition) of the surface of the patient contralateral to and at the site of nodal 18 F-FDG uptake were acquired using a cooled, intensified charge-coupled-device camera. Results: The camera demon-strated linear correlation between activity and counts into the low nanocurie range using 18 F-FDG. Imaging of patients revealed the presence of 18 F-FDG uptake in nodes that demonstrated uptake on PET. A correlation between maximum standardized uptake value from PET and counting rate per area on the CL imaging was estab-lished. Conclusion: CL imaging with diagnostic doses of 18 F-FDG is feasible and can aid in detecting disease in the clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{discussed}} {{in this study is}} scheduling problems in sup-ply chains. The constituents of a supply chain need to cooperate, rather than compete, in order to achieve maximum benefits. In order to analyze this, it is essential to have a concise but comprehensive formulation of this problem. This formulation, in addition <b>to</b> <b>be-ing</b> computationally viable, must account for special characteristics of supply chains. It is argued that lot streaming provides an appropri-ate paradigm for scheduling problems in supply chains.

The capability of event-time modeling in representing lot stream-ing problems is illustrated in the context of single job lot streaming problems.
