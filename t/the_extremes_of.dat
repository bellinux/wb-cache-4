5|$|Traversing <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> California, {{from the}} Mojave Desert to the Sierra Nevada, El Camino Sierra has been advertised {{to the world}} as a highway to {{showcase}} the natural beauty of California as far back as 1910. Though most of Sierra Highway was bypassed in the early 1970s with freeways, the road is still well known. The portion through the San Gabriel Mountains is noted as the primary filming location for the film Duel.|$|E

5|$|Between <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> {{bicycles}} with classical {{front-wheel steering}} {{and those with}} strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the General Assembly's {{attempt to}} promote peace and unity, two {{distinct}} factions, the Old School and the New School, developed through the 1820s over {{the issues of}} confessional subscription, revivalism, {{and the spread of}} New England theology. The New School faction advocated revivalism and New England theology, while the Old School was opposed to <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession. The ideological center of Old School Presbyterianism was Princeton Theological Seminary, which under the leadership of Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge became associated with a brand of Reformed scholasticism known as Princeton Theology.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

5|$|T.F. Tout, in 1914 one of {{the first}} historians to make a {{thorough}} academic study of the period, considered Pembroke the one favourable exception in an age of small-minded and incompetent leaders. Tout wrote of a 'middle party', led by Pembroke, representing a moderate position between <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> Edward and Lancaster. This 'middle party' supposedly took control of royal government through the Treaty of Leake in 1318. In his authoritative study of 1972, J.R.S. Phillips rejects this view. In spite of misgivings with the King’s favourites, Pembroke was consistently loyal to Edward. What was accomplished in 1318 was not the takeover by a 'middle party', but simply a restoration of royal power.|$|E

25|$|The {{margin of}} error for a {{particular}} individual percentage will usually be smaller than the maximum {{margin of error}} quoted for the survey.

25|$|To analyze <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> {{existence}} and non-existence, Ju Mipham advises students to contemplate and establish {{the lack of}} inherent {{existence and}} then contemplate the extreme of non-existence. In contemplating step by step and enumerating the conceptual extremes, a student progresses toward the ultimate. When all extremes have been analyzed, they reach the non-enumerative (true) ultimate.|$|E
25|$|The average {{workplace}} is about midway between <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> high threat and high opportunity.

25|$|The {{middle class}} {{is perhaps the most}} vaguely defined of the social classes. The term can be used either to {{describe}} a relative elite of professionals and managers – also called the upper middle class – or {{it can be used to}} describe those in-between <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> wealth, disregarding considerable differences in income, culture, educational attainment, influence, and occupation.|$|E
25|$|Changmarín's {{political}} activism reached an important moment {{in his life}} with {{the foundation of the}} Panamanian Communist Party (Partido del Pueblo) in 1950. Since communism was outlawed at that time by Panamanian law, this initiative was forced to be conducted secretly. The Panamanian government reacted to the growing dissent and communist organization in the countryside by increasing repression, reaching <b>the</b> <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> perpetrating political assassinations and disappearances.|$|E

Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a passive crossover network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.|$|E
