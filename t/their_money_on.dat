5|$|Within {{the diocese}} of Constance, Bernhardin Sanson was {{offering}} a special indulgence for contributors to the building of St Peter's in Rome. When Sanson arrived {{at the gates of}} Zurich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with <b>their</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> false pretences. This was over a year after Martin Luther published his Ninety-five theses (31 October 1517). The council of Zurich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.|$|E

25|$|Some Neo-Marxists {{believe that}} it would {{actually}} be best for periphery countries to cut all economic and political ties with the core countries. This would, in their opinion, allow the periphery countries to develop and industrialize {{at their own pace}} instead of being exploited and driven by core countries demands. Doing this would allow these countries to spend <b>their</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> industrializing and bettering themselves, rather than importing goods from core countries. It also would allow these countries to become more independent from the core countries, causing them to move to semi-peripheral status.|$|E

500|$|After {{their first}} couple of seasons in New York City, team {{ownership}} infrequently invested in new players. The ownership group of Farrell and Devery spent <b>their</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> personal pursuits such as gambling, leaving them with little to put into the team. New York's star player, Chase, consorted frequently with gamblers. Author Jim Reisler dubbed him [...] "the most crooked player to ever play the game" [...] because of reports that he took part in game fixing. The club also had difficulty drawing fans to Hilltop Park. Appel wrote that [...] "maybe {{the best thing you}} could say about the ballpark was that it never burned down."

500|$|In 1859, Edwin Drake {{successfully}} drilled {{the first}} oil well {{along the banks}} of Oil Creek, outside of Titusville in Crawford County. Within a half year, over 500wells were built along Oil Creek, in the [...] corridor from Titusville to the creek's mouth at the Allegheny River in Oil City. Other wells were drilled down the Allegheny towards Franklin and upriver to Tionesta in Forest County. Pithole Creek did not attract the same attention from speculators and investors, who preferred to risk <b>their</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> the tried-and-true method of drilling on flatter terrain near large rivers like the Allegheny and Oil Creek, rather than gamble on rougher terrain. In January1864, Isaiah Frazier leased two tracts of land, totaling , from Thomas Holmden, a farmer along Pithole Creek. Frazier, James Faulkner Jr., Frederick W. Jones and J. Nelson Tappan formed the United States Petroleum Company in April1864 and started drilling what was dubbed the United States Well, or Frazier Well, in June. On January 7, 1865, the Frazier Well struck oil.|$|E

Stan {{believes}} Sparky to be the toughest dog in South Park; but, when Sparky suddenly jumps on top of another male dog and begins humping him energetically, Cartman declares that Sparky is homosexual. At football practice for the school's team, the South Park Cows, Stan's Uncle Jimbo and his friend Ned show up and ask Coach Chef whether the boys can beat the betting spread of 70 points for the Cows' game against the Middle Park Cowboys. Impressed by a play from Stan, who is the quarterback and star of the team, Jimbo and Ned go to the bookmaker, where Jimbo bets $500 on the Cows.

500|$|Addressed to mothers, young women, and teachers, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters {{explains}} how to educate {{a woman from}} infancy through marriage. Its twenty-one chapters are not arranged in any particular order and cover {{a wide variety of}} topics. The first two chapters, [...] "The Nursery" [...] and [...] "Moral Discipline", offer advice on shaping the child's [...] "constitution" [...] and [...] "temperament", arguing that the formation of the rational mind must begin early. These chapters also offer specific recommendations regarding the care of infants and endorse breastfeeding (a hotly debated topic in the 18th century). Much of the book criticizes what Wollstonecraft considers the damaging education usually offered to women: [...] "artificial manners", card-playing, theatre-going, and an emphasis on fashion. She complains, for example, that women [...] "squander" [...] <b>their</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> clothing, [...] "which if saved for charitable purposes, might alleviate the distress of many poor families, and soften the heart of the girl who entered into such scenes of woe". She contrasts this common but ineffectual education with one based on early childhood reading, benevolence, and love. Wollstonecraft also delves into a description of social issues, addressing the [...] "Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left without a Fortune" [...] in addition to the [...] "Treatment of Servants". Religious faith plays a prominent role in Wollstonecraft's educational plan; she advocates Sabbath observance and describes the [...] "Benefits which arise from Disappointments", that is, the benefits which arise from suffering sent by God.|$|E

2500|$|The early {{influx of}} Filipinos into the United States was {{in large part}} due to social {{programs}} such as the pensionando program and the necessity for labor in certain areas such as California and Alaska. Laborers and farmers who migrated from the Philippines were known as the [...] "Manong" [...] Generation, an Ilocano term referring to an elderly person. [...] Filipino migrant workers began coming to the U.S. around the start of the 20th century; they were mostly men who worked in either California or Alaska. Some had worked in the sugar planations of Hawaii as well, but this occurred before Hawaii became a state. These men were referred to as the “Manong” generation, which is an Ilocano term designated for elderly people. For many Filipino laborers and workers during this time period, there was an emphasis on dressing well. This happened for multiple reasons. First, Filipino laborers looked to disassociate themselves from lower class citizens. Another reason included the desire to emulate Hollywood actors during the 1920’s and 1930’s. Filipinos were unable to rent or own homes in cities such as Los Angeles, so they spent <b>their</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> other things such as clothing. In living spaces, Filipinos were confined to upwards of fifteen to twenty tenants in a single room to save money. This allowed for Filipinos to spend <b>their</b> <b>money</b> <b>on</b> clothing instead of rent and other possessions instead. Also, Filipinos were portrayed as weak, submissive, unassertive, and eager to please; dressing well was perceived to counter those stereotypes. Despite earning meager wages, Filipino laborers bought nice clothing as a means to appear nicer than their pay would suggest. Lastly, another reason for the desire to dress well was to impress relatives back in the Philippines. Filipino laborers sent pictures of themselves in their suits in order to give them the impression they were quite successful in America.|$|E
