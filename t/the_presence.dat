40|$|The {{current study}} had a {{multi-purpose}} and complementary research agenda {{focusing on the}} predictive power of teaching, cognitive and social presence on intrinsic, extraneous and germane cognitive load. More specifically, this study investigated the predictive relationships between <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> and cognitive load types through multiple regression analyses. This provided insights into the predictive validity of <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> with regard to cognitive load. Five graduate-level fully online courses delivering instruction {{in the field of}} learning, design and technology comprised the research context. Data from 103 graduate students were used for multiple regression purposes. Results revealed that (a) <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> can significantly predict extraneous and germane load with and without perceived learning and satisfaction; (b) <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> can significantly predict intrinsic load as a group without controlling for perceived learning and satisfaction, and together with perceived learning and satisfaction after controlling for it; (c) cognitive <b>presence</b> is <b>the</b> best predictor of both intrinsic and germane load with increased cognitive presence associated with increased intrinsic and germane load; (d) teaching <b>presence</b> is <b>the</b> best predictor of extraneous load with increases in teaching presence associated with decreases in extraneous load; and (e) perceived learning and satisfaction are significant predictors of extraneous and germane load especially while showing a strong trend to be significant predictors of intrinsic load. Overall, the current results suggested a strong and joint predictive power of <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> on cognitive load with or without perceived learning and satisfaction. All of <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> may not strongly relate to or predict cognitive load types individually though. This may imply a strong interrelation among <b>the</b> <b>presences,</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> can work quite effectively all together in relation to cognitive load. Perceived learning and satisfaction appear to be strong collaborators with <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> as well. All these insights warrant future research in different learning contexts, possibly integrating other potential variables as well, which would foster cross-validation...|$|R
