Exceptions are the Rita Atkinson Residences, which houses 450 graduate students in a nine-story, two-tower structure, and the Club Med dining facility {{at the base of}} the telemedicine building. The campus features two Stuart Collection works. Terrace, by Jackie Ferrara, consists of three tiled terraces which flow into one another to connect both wings of the Cellular and Molecular Medicine facility. It is the ninth work in the collection. The fourteenth work, Standing by Kiki Smith, is a nude bronze woman raised on a concrete eucalyptus trunk <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> from her hands to its roots. It was the artist's first permanent outdoor sculpture.|$|E
500|$|The general {{opinion of}} Fountain of the Great Lakes was {{positive}} with some describing it as a cultural achievement for Taft and Chicago. The detractors conceded that as a figural composition, it was ideal in an Old World way. [...] Critics voiced concern over the sculpture's confusion and decorum. [...] One of the basic problems for the critics was the propriety of the symbolism of artistic and attractive bronze figures posed as bodies of water. [...] There had for some time been discussion of the depictions representing relative elevations and the flows of the waters as they seem to do. There were grumblings for closer association of the figures to the lakes by use of physical features, directional orientation and definite contours. [...] Harriet Monroe, a general supporter of Taft's artistic efforts, was disappointed in the lack of representative geographic configuration {{and the lack of}} spirit of the lakes as inland seas. [...] With respect to this specific piece she had gone from being an ardent supporter who felt the model was [...] "stupendous" [...] to finding herself in [...] "doubt" [...] about the work. [...] Taft's human form depictions of the lake failed to capture the imagery of contemporary literature as it related to the power and fury of nature and the heroism of those struggling against those forces in works such as those of Hamlin Garland, Charles Eugene Banks, Willa Cather, or Robert Morss Lovett. [...] Taft's representations of Lakes with quiet <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> was in keeping with his general theme of quiet dignity for public sculpture. [...] On the day of the dedication the Chicago Daily News expressed this point with a photomontage juxtaposition of Taft's fountain and Lake Michigan in all its fury.|$|E
60|$|The {{church bell}} was tolling; {{they could see}} the little {{congregation}} pass across the churchyard into that weekly dream they knew too well. And presently the drone emerged, mingling with the voices outside, of sighing trees and <b>trickling</b> <b>water,</b> of the rub of wings, birds' songs, and the callings of beasts everywhere beneath the sky.|$|E

60|$|It was {{the first}} time the reporters had been honoured with {{admission}} to the sacred precincts. The room was in dusky twilight, flecked with gleams of the polished, fine woods and burnished glass and metal that the Creoles love. From the little courtyard a tiny fountain sent in an insinuating sound of <b>trickling</b> <b>waters,</b> to which a banana plant by the window kept time with its tremulous leaves.|$|R
50|$|The Eye that Cries {{is located}} {{in the middle of a}} {{labyrinth}}. The labyrinth itself is composed of tens of thousands of rocks. Each individual rock is inscribed with a name, age, and year of death of a victim of Peru's decades of internal conflict. The sculpture is representative of Pachamama, which in Quechua means Mother Earth. In the center of the sculpture, a small stone that takes the form of an eye continuously <b>trickles</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|Here in {{the green}} and golden woods rose before him a rugged, giant rock, moss-stained, and gleaming with <b>trickling</b> <b>water.</b> Tangled ferns dressed in autumn's russet hue lay {{at the base of}} the green-gray cliff, and circled a dark, deep pool dotted with yellow leaves. Half-way up, the {{perpendicular}} ascent was broken by a protruding ledge upon which waved broad-leaved plants and rusty ferns. Above, the cliff sheered out with many cracks and seams in its weather-beaten front.|$|E
60|$|But don't give in yet. Try, now, {{to imagine}} this sudden {{transformation}} wrought, perhaps, {{in a few}} days to the slow music of southern zephyrs, bearing on their wings light, and heat, and sunshine. Your ear is surprised--absolutely startled--by the sound of <b>trickling</b> <b>water.</b> Old memories that you thought were dead come back in the trumpet of the wild-goose, the whistling wing of the duck, the plaintive cry of the plover. Your nose--ah! your nose cocks up and snuffs a smell--pardon!-- a scent. It is the scent of the great orb on which you stand, saturated at last with life-giving water, and beginning to vivify all the green things that have so long been hidden in her capacious bosom.|$|E
60|$|Water! {{where was}} water to come from? The river was frozen {{almost to the}} bottom. Ice six feet thick covered the lakes and ponds. The sound of <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> had not been heard for months. It had become an ancient memory. Water! why, it cost our cook's {{assistant}} a full hour every day {{to cut through the}} result of one night's frost in the water-hole before he could reach the water required for daily use, and what he did obtain had to be slowly dragged to the fort by that slowest of creatures, an ox. Nevertheless there was water. In the warmest corner of the kitchen--at that hour about zero--there stood a water-barrel.|$|E

60|$|After {{descending}} {{into the}} saddle between the two peaks we found the ascent very laborious, the slope being so steep, as often to necessitate hand-climbing. Besides a bushy vegetation the ground was covered knee-deep with mosses on a foundation of decaying leaves and rugged rock, {{and it was a}} hard hour's climb to the small ledge just below the summit, where an overhanging rock forms a convenient shelter, and a little basin collects the <b>trickling</b> <b>water.</b> Here we put down our loads, and in a few minutes more stood on the summit of Mount Ophir, 4,000 feet above the sea. The top is a small rocky platform covered with rhododendrons and other shrubs. The afternoon was clear, and the view fine in its way--ranges of hill and valley everywhere covered with interminable forest, with glistening rivers winding among them.|$|E
60|$|He grew breathless, {{but he did}} not slacken the pace. He went straight, {{splashing}} through <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> {{and into}} pools, while he strained his eyes for the first glimpse of the sloop, but he could only see the mist which hid the sand thirty or forty yards in front of him. At last he made out a strip of something solid low down ahead and then {{what seemed to be a}} mast, and a few moments later he stopped at the water's edge. There was nothing but water in front of him and it was no longer quite smooth. Little ripples ran along the sand, and one broke about his feet while he gazed at them. It did not recede but splashed on, and when he looked around there was at least a yard of water behind him. Then he struggled with a paralyzing sense of dismay, and strove to keep his head. It was necessary to think and think very hard.|$|E
6000|$|The {{familiar}} {{smell of}} drugs, {{the sound of}} the <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> in the soda fountain roused Hodder to reality, to action, and he hurried into the telephone booth, fumbled in the dog-eared book, got Dr. Jarvis's number and called it. An eternity seemed to elapse before he had a reply, heard his coin jangling in the bog, recognized the voice of the great doctor's secretary. Yes, the doctor was in would he speak to Mr. Hodder, of St. John's?... An interval, during which Hodder was suddenly struck with this designation of himself. Was he still of St. John's, then? An aeon might have elapsed since he had walked down the white marble of its aisle toward the crouching figure in the pew. He was not that man, but another--and still Mr. Hodder, of St. John's.... Then he heard the specialist say, [...] "Hello, Mr. Hodder, what can I do for you?" [...] Heard his own voice in reply, explaining the case. Could the doctor find time? The doctor could: he was never too busy to attend to the poor,--though he did not say so: he would be there--by half-past six. The rector hung up the receiver, opened the door of the booth and mopped his brow, for the heat was stifling.|$|E

60|$|Now {{he paused}} before an entrance-way and listened and then, noiselessly as the {{moonlight}} upon the <b>trickling</b> <b>waters,</b> he {{merged with the}} shadows of the outer porch. At the doorway leading into the interior he paused again, listening, and then quietly pushing aside the heavy skin that covered the aperture he passed within a large chamber hewn from the living rock. From the far end, through another doorway, shone a light, dimly. Toward this he crept with utmost stealth, his naked feet giving forth no sound. The knotted club that had been hanging at his back from a thong about his neck he now removed and carried in his left hand.|$|R

60|$|We now {{had seven}} or eight days of hot and dry weather, which reduced the little river to a {{succession}} of shallow pools connected by the smallest possible thread of <b>trickling</b> <b>water.</b> If there were a dry season like that of Macassar, the Aru Islands would be uninhabitable, {{as there is no}} part of them much above a hundred feet high; and the whole being a mass of porous coralline rock, allows the surface water rapidly to escape. The only dry season they have is for a month or two about September or October, and there is then an excessive scarcity of water, so that sometimes hundreds of birds and other animals die of drought. The natives then remove to houses near the sources of the small streams, where, in the shady depths of the forest, a small quantity of water still remains. Even then many of them have to go miles for their water, which they keep in large bamboos and use very sparingly. They assure me that they catch and kill game of all kinds, by watching at the water holes or setting snares around them. That would be the time for me to make my collections; but the want of water would be a terrible annoyance, and the impossibility of getting away before another whole year had passed made it out of the question.|$|E
50|$|Species in {{the genus}} Pomatiopsis are amphibious, living in humid habitats, on marshy ground and in {{periodically}} flooded soil (Pomatiopsis californica and Pomatiopsis lapidaria), in <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> (Pomatiopsis binneyi) and on mud of streams (Pomatiopsis cincinnatiensis).|$|E
50|$|Once the {{procession}} had passed, the structure became a simple water fountain for the neighborhood, with taps, ornamented with lion heads, permanently <b>trickling</b> <b>water.</b> The upper {{floor of the}} fountain was eventually turned into a residence, with windows and a chimney.|$|E
50|$|This {{waterfall}} {{is spectacular}} {{in that it}} is completely frozen throughout the year, except the <b>trickle</b> of <b>water</b> flowing from melting glacier above it for a short period in summer. The said waterfall is one of its own in the world.|$|R

Also discussed are a fundamental study of CELSS gas monitoring, the application of catalytic wet oxidation to CELSS, a large-scale perspective on ecosystems, Japanese CELSS research activities, the use of potatoes in bioregenerative life-support, wheat production in controlled environments, and a <b>trickle</b> <b>water</b> and feeding system in plant culture...|$|R
60|$|There was a <b>trickling</b> of <b>water</b> {{into the}} butt, {{a burst of}} rain-drops {{sputtering}} on to her shawl, and {{the light of the}} lantern swinging, flashing on a wet pavement and the base of a wet wall. Otherwise it was black darkness: one breathed darkness.|$|R
50|$|Sparging is <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> {{through the}} grain to extract sugars. This is a {{delicate}} step, as the wrong temperature or pH will extract tannins from the chaff (grain husks) as well, resulting in a bitter brew. Typically, 1.5 times more water is used for sparging than was for mashing. Sparging is typically conducted in a lauter tun.|$|E
5000|$|Laguindingan used to {{be called}} [...] "Daligdigan" [...] coined from the words [...] "daligdig", meaning <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> from Soloan Creek, and [...] "digan", a buri plant, which was used by the early {{settlers}} as roofing and walling materials. The name later evolved into [...] "Laguindingan" [...] because it is easier to pronounce and has a melodious sound.|$|E
50|$|According to Arnold Houbraken he was {{the teacher}} of Isaac Koene, and, {{assuming}} Houbraken meant Isaack when {{he referred to the}} father of Jacob, he was a woodworker specialized in making fancy ebony frames for mirrors and paintings. Isaack sent his sons to learn Latin and medicine, and they both became landscape painters, specialized in ruis-daal, or <b>trickling</b> <b>water</b> through a dale, after their name.|$|E

50|$|Although much {{progress}} has been made in high-energy, quantum, and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving complexity, chaos, or turbulence are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in <b>trickling</b> <b>water,</b> the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes, and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic concept}} behind air {{conditioning}} {{is said to}} have been applied in ancient Egypt, where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with <b>trickling</b> <b>water.</b> The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate. In Ancient Rome, water from aqueducts was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them. Other techniques in medieval Persia involved the use of cisterns and wind towers to cool buildings during the hot season.|$|E

50|$|Historians of {{the period}} record the {{occurrence}} of a seven-year famine which devastated the crops and ruined the country.
