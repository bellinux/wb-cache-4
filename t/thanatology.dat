25|$|At {{about the}} same time that Saunders was {{disseminating}} her theories and developing her hospice, in 1965, Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler Ross also began to consider the social responses to terminal illness, which she found inadequate at the Chicago hospital where her American physician husband was employed. Her 1969 best-seller, On Death and Dying, was influential on how the medical profession responded to the terminally ill, and along with Saunders and other <b>thanatology</b> pioneers helped to focus attention on the types of care available to them.|$|E
50|$|Metchnikoff {{chose to}} focus on two new areas of study, {{gerontology}} and <b>thanatology.</b> Contrary to gerontology, <b>thanatology</b> took about 47 years for most people to accept it as a science. Therefore, the science of <b>thanatology</b> is fairly new for the most part. The altered viewpoints people developed {{when it came to}} viewing and coping with death was one reason that <b>thanatology</b> became more accepted across societies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thanatology</b> is {{a section}} of Forensic Sciences. The {{biological}} study of death helps explain what happens, physically, to individuals {{in the moment of}} dying and after-death bodily changes, so that the events that took place at the time of death and post-mortem can be clarified. In Psychiatry, the medical application of psychological principles and therapeutic drugs, is also involved; many licensed psychiatrists are required to take courses on <b>thanatology</b> during training. Medical ethics are also an important area of study, especially on the issue of euthanasia ("right to die").|$|E

50|$|As an {{interdisciplinary}} study, <b>thanatology</b> relies on collaboration with many different fields of study. Death {{is a universal}} human concern; it has been examined and re-examined {{in a wide variety}} of disciplines, dating back to pre-history. Some of these fields of study are academic in nature; others have evolved throughout history as cultural traditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thanatology</b> is the {{scientific}} study of death. It investigates the mechanisms and forensic aspects of death, such as bodily changes that accompany death and the post-mortem period, as well as wider psychological and social aspects related to death. It is primarily an interdisciplinary study offered as a course of study at numerous colleges and universities.|$|E
50|$|However, this is {{only one}} of several {{important}} books in the field of <b>thanatology.</b> Other key texts include The Experience of Death by Paul-Louis Landsberg, the sections on temporality and death from Martin Heidegger's Being and Time, as well as works of a fictional nature, such as Leo Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich and As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner.|$|E
5000|$|In most cases, <b>thanatology</b> is not {{directly}} related to palliative care, which aims to provide treatment for dying individuals and their families.

50|$|<b>Thanatology</b> is the {{academic}} and scientific study of death among human beings. It investigates the circumstances surrounding a person's death, the grief experienced by the deceased's loved ones, and larger social attitudes towards death such as ritual and memorialization. It is primarily an interdisciplinary study, frequently undertaken by professionals in nursing, psychology, sociology, psychiatry, social work and veterinary science. It also describes bodily changes that accompany death and the after-death period.|$|E

5000|$|Death {{education}} is education about death {{that focuses on}} the human and emotional aspects of death. Though it may include teaching on the biological aspects of death, teaching about coping with grief is a primary focus. Death {{education is}} formally known as <b>thanatology.</b> <b>Thanatology</b> stems from the Greek word thanatos, meaning death, and ology meaning a science or organized body of knowledge. [...] A specialist in this field is referred to as a thanatologist. Death education refers to the experiences and activities of death that one deals with. Death education also deals with being able to grasp the different processes of dying, talk about the main topics of attitudes and meanings toward death, and the after effects on how to learn to care for people that are affected by the death. The main focus in death education is teaching people how to cope with grief. Many people feel death education is a taboo and instead of talking about death and grieving, they hide it away and never bring it up to others. With the right education of death, the less of a taboo it will be.|$|E

A second book with its elaboration, Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated, was published in 2008. Both books were authored by Hossain. Later the journal Death Studies and Royal College of Psychiatrists reviewed these publications for the readerships in Scientific <b>Thanatology</b> and Spiritual Psychiatry. [...] After the analyses of the reviewers were published, the Royal College of Psychiatrists at London published the theory itself as the short article Facing the Finality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses and the Taylor & Francis publication Journal of Loss and Trauma did the same in its article [...] "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses".|$|E
50|$|In {{the last}} few years before his death, de Silva focused his study towards the study of human death, namely, the field of <b>Thanatology.</b> His quest was {{motivated}} mainly by the death of his wife Lakshmi in December 1980, but also by his curiosity about the meaning of resurrection. With this frame of mind, de Silva studied the beliefs and practices of people with respect to death, such as the phenomenon of mediums, with help from Buddhist exponents of reincarnation. Although traces of his findings can be seen in his last writings, de Silva died before completing his study. His last findings were published posthumously by his friend and colleague, Fr. Aloysius Pieris S.J., in the paper Buddhism and Christianity Relativised, which appeared in volume 9 of the Dialogue journal.|$|E
5000|$|There is also {{a branch}} of <b>thanatology</b> called music-thanatology which focuses {{on the use of}} [...] "music vigils" [...] to help the {{individual}} and their family. A vigil consists of one or a team of music-thanatologists who visit the dying person. They play the harp and sing music based on changes that they observe in patient physiology as well as in interpersonal family dynamics. The music tends toward the meditative, and can be very helpful to the patient and others that are present. Often after a vigil, the dying person is more relaxed, less agitated, and is in less pain. Most music-thanatologists are certified by the Music-Thanatology Association International, and they use the initials [...] "CM-Th" [...] to designate certification by this professional organization. Many hospitals and hospices now have professional music-thanatologists on their staff.|$|E
50|$|Ufema {{founded a}} private death-counseling {{practice}} in Harrisburg which closed {{after one year}} of operation because of financial difficulty. She opened the counseling center, Hospice of Lancaster County, in March 1980. She interviewed patients and established a team of medical and other personnel who oversaw volunteers and directed support groups who dealt with the patients' families. Ufema's work nationally took time away from her work in Lancaster, and {{she was asked to}} resign her position in October 1982. She acquired the York House Hospice for terminally ill patients with AIDS in June 1991 which began operating six months later. Following a recommendation made by Ufema, the hospice was closed on November 22, 1996, after it suffered from financial difficulties. She worked for Upper Chesapeake Medical Center/Harford Memorial Hospital as their Clinical Specialist in <b>Thanatology</b> before her retirement.|$|E
50|$|The {{roles of}} a funeral {{director}} and an embalmer are different. A funeral director arranges {{for the final}} disposition of the deceased, and {{may or may not}} prepare (including embalming) the deceased for viewing (or other legal requirements). An embalmer is someone who has been trained in the art and science of, and {{may or may not have}} any contact with the family, although many people fill both roles. The term mortician is becoming outdated, but may refer to a someone who is a funeral director, an embalmer, or in some cases, both. Embalming training commonly involves formal study in anatomy, <b>thanatology,</b> chemistry, and specific embalming theory (to widely varied levels depending on the region of the world one lives in) combined with practical instruction in a mortuary with a resultant formal qualification granted after the passing of a final practical examination and acceptance into a recognized society of professional embalmers.|$|E
5000|$|Following World War II, {{the world}} was haunted with the {{memories}} of the many casualties. During this period of reflection many existential philosophers began considering life-and-death issues. One in particular was Herman Feifel, an American psychologist who is considered the pioneer of the modern death movement. [...] Feifel broke the taboo on discussions of death and dying with the publication of his book The Meaning of Death. [...] In this book, Feifel dispelled myths held by scientists and practitioners about death and the denial of its importance for human behaviour. It earned wide attention and became a classic in the new field, including as it did contributions from eminent thinkers such as psychiatrist Carl Jung, theologian Paul Tillich and philosopher Herbert Marcuse. Through The Meaning of Death, Feifel was able to lay the foundation for a field that would eventually be known as <b>Thanatology.</b> The field was to improve death education and grief counselling by the use of valid death-related data, methodology and theory.|$|E

5000|$|Research on near-death {{experiences}} {{is mainly}} {{limited to the}} disciplines of medicine, psychology and psychiatry. Interest in this field of study was originally spurred {{by the research of}} such pioneers as Elisabeth Kübler-Ross (psychiatrist) and Raymond Moody (psychologist and M.D.), but also by autobiographical accounts, such as the books of George Ritchie (psychiatrist). Kübler-Ross, who was a researcher in the field of <b>Thanatology</b> and a driving force behind the establishment of the Hospice System in the United States, reported on her interviews {{for the first time in}} her book [...] "On Death and Dying. What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families"(1969). Raymond Moody, on the other hand, got interested in the subject at the start of his career. In the mid-seventies, while doing his medical residency as a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia, he conducted interviews with Near-Death Experiencers. He later published these findings in the book Life After Life (1976). In the book Moody outlines the different elements of the NDE. Features that were picked up by later researchers. The book brought a lot of attention to the topic of NDEs.|$|E
50|$|She disseminated her {{philosophy}} internationally in {{a series}} of tours of the United States that began in 1963. In 1967, Saunders opened St Christopher's Hospice. Florence Wald, the dean of Yale School of Nursing who had heard Saunders speak in America, spent a month working with Saunders there in 1969 before bringing the principles of modern hospice care back to the United States, establishing Hospice, Inc. in 1971. Another early hospice program in the United States, Alive Hospice, was founded in Nashville, Tennessee, on November 14, 1975. By 1977 the National Hospice Organization had been formed, and by 1979, a president, Ann G. Blues, had been elected at the national meeting in Washington DC and principles of hospice care had been addressed. At about the same time that Saunders was disseminating her theories and developing her hospice, in 1965, Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler Ross also began to consider the social responses to terminal illness, which she found inadequate at the Chicago hospital where her American physician husband was employed.
