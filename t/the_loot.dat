5|$|Pike rides {{off with}} Dutch Engstrom, {{brothers}} Lyle and Tector Gorch, and Angel, the only survivors. They are dismayed when <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> from the robbery {{turns out to}} be a decoy: steel washers instead of silver coin. The men reunite with old-timer Freddie Sykes and head for Mexico.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E

5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to Topsail Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard. Bonnet reinforced the Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in Topsail Island.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archer is {{confined}} in a Cargo bay, and the aliens are unconvinced that Enterprise carries no currency or valuable materials. They set-off {{to find the}} vault themselves, leaving Krem and Archer to transfer <b>the</b> <b>loot.</b> Archer sees Tucker and sends him to the launch-bay to retrieve the Ferengi's hypospray. Doing so, Tucker revives Sub-Commander T'Pol, and they {{try to find a}} way to stop the Ferengi. She assumes the gas-machine was intentionally placed on the surface as a 'Trojan Horse'. In Sickbay, three of the four Ferengi search for the non-existent vault, and T'Pol uses a PADD to distract and then start an argument between them.|$|E
5|$|In {{this region}} Cofresí's {{influence}} extended to {{government and the}} military, with the Ramírez de Arellano family involved in the smuggling and sale of his loot. On land <b>the</b> <b>loot,</b> hidden in sacks and barrels, was brought to Mayagüez, Hormigueros or San Germán for distribution. When Beluche returned to Colombia, he published an article critical {{of the situation in}} the press. La Gaceta de Puerto Rico countered, accusing him of stealing Bonne Sophie and connecting him to the pirates.|$|E

5|$|Attacks on two brigantines were {{reported}} by Renato Beluche on February 12, 1824, and published in El Colombiano several days later. The first was Boniton, captained by Alexander Murdock, which sailed with a load of cocoa from Trinidad and was intercepted en route to Gibraltar. The second, Bonne Sophie, sailed from Havre de Grace {{under the command of}} a man named Chevanche with dry goods bound for Martinique. In both cases, the sailors were beaten and imprisoned and the ships plundered. The ships were part of a convoy escorted by the Bolívar off Puerto Real, Cabo Rojo, and Cofresí captained a ship identified by Beluche as a pailebot (a small schooner). Although Bolívar could not capture her, her crew described the vessel as painted black, armed with a rotating cannon and having a crew of twenty unidentified Puerto Rican men. Cofresí was presumably leading the vessels to dock at Pedernales, where Mendoza and his brother could facilitate the distribution of loot with the aid of official inertia. From there, other associates usually used Boquerón Bay for transportation and ensured that <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> reached stores in Cabo Rojo and nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|Silver forces Jim {{to use the}} map, {{directing}} them to {{a portal}} that opens on any location in the universe, which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal {{to the center of}} Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a space station built eons ago that Flint commandeered to stow his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect <b>the</b> <b>loot,</b> Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. As the planet begins to fall apart, Silver, trying to hold onto a boat-load of gold, opts to let it go to save Jim. The survivors escape to the Legacy, which is damaged and unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the Legacy towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the Legacy safely clear the destruction.|$|E
25|$|Bolgios inflicted {{heavy losses}} on the Macedonians, whose young king, Ptolemy Keraunos, was {{captured}} and decapitated. However, Bolgios' contingent was repulsed by the Macedonian nobleman Sosthenes, and satisfied with <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> they had won, Bolgios' contingents turned back. Sosthenes, in turn, was attacked and defeated by Brennus and his division, who were then free to ravage the country.|$|E
50|$|Suffering {{from hunger}} and having been refused {{supplies}} by the Indian Agent meant to attend their well being, some of <b>the</b> party began <b>looting</b> <b>the</b> abandoned buildings. The {{identity of the}} looters is disputed. Some reports claimed Poundmaker's people were responsible, but one observer alleged that most of <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> had already been done by whites. Oral history accounts claim that <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> was done by Nakoda people, and that Poundmaker {{did his best to}} stop it. Either way, Poundmaker's people left the next day.|$|R

50|$|The decade {{previous}} to {{the famine}} was noted for <b>the</b> <b>looting</b> raids {{conducted by the}} Maratha bargis (bargir) mostly from Nagpur. They looted whatever they could and laid waste what they couldn't. Money, gold, food, temples, idol ornaments...nothing was spared by these Maratha. <b>The</b> <b>looting</b> were mainly in those areas which were later most hard-hit by the famine.|$|R
25|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> {{from these}} cities was Briseis, from Lyrnessus, who {{was awarded to}} him, and Chryseis, from Hypoplacian Thebes, who was awarded to Agamemnon. Achilles {{captured}} Lycaon, son of Priam, while he was cutting branches in his father's orchards. Patroclus sold him as a slave in Lemnos, where he was bought by Eetion of Imbros and brought back to Troy. Only 12 days later Achilles slew him, {{after the death of}} Patroclus.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish {{infantry}} was to {{join the}} Polish army, the reiters were to swear never {{to fight against the}} Polish king, with volunteers also allowed {{to join the}} Polish army, and the Swedish loot from nearby lands was to be returned to the owners (this caused some annoyance within the Polish army, whose soldiers preferred to continue fighting to take <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> for themselves). Eventually, about 500 reiters and 800 infantry joined the Polish army; about 250 reiters left for the Polish borders.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s, after James' death, the James Gang {{became the}} subject of dime novels that {{represented}} the bandits as pre-industrial models of resistance. During the Populist and Progressive eras, James became an icon as America's Robin Hood, standing up against corporations in defense of the small farmer, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. But {{there is no evidence that}} he shared <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> of his robberies with anyone other than his gang members; they enjoyed the riches with him.|$|E

25|$|The victors {{divided the}} {{enormous}} wealth of Pegu, accumulated {{over the past}} 60 years as the capital of Toungoo Empire. The gold, silver and precious stones were equally divided. The Arakanese share also included several brazen cannon, 30 Khmer bronze statues, and a white elephant. Toungoo forces returned home with their share of <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> on , leaving the Arakanese {{in charge of the}} city. A month later, the Arakanese forces burned down the entire city, including the Grand Palace of King Bayinnaung.|$|E
25|$|The Muslim army led by Malik Kafur pursued two violent campaigns {{into south}} India, between 1309 and 1311, against three Hindu kingdoms of Deogiri (Maharashtra), Warangal (Telangana) and Madurai (Tamil Nadu). Thousands were slaughtered. Halebid temple was destroyed. The temples, cities, and villages were plundered. <b>The</b> <b>loot</b> from south India was so large, that historians {{of that era}} state a {{thousand}} camels had to be deployed to carry it to Delhi. In the booty from Warangal was the Koh-i-Noor diamond.|$|E
25|$|Every {{continued}} in pursuit {{and managed to}} overhaul Ganj-i-Sawai, which resisted strongly before eventually striking. Ganj-i-Sawai carried enormous wealth and, according to contemporary East India Company sources, was carrying a relative of the Grand Mughal, {{though there is no}} evidence to suggest that it was his daughter and her retinue. <b>The</b> <b>loot</b> from the Ganj-i-Sawai had a total value between £325,000 and £600,000, including 500,000 gold and silver pieces, and has become known as the richest ship ever taken by pirates.|$|E
50|$|In {{the night}} of 29 June Farnese managed {{to get into the}} city while the {{exhausted}} defenders were asleep. Since the city had not surrendered after the walls had been breached, 16th-century law of war gave the victors <b>the</b> right to <b>loot</b> <b>the</b> conquered city. <b>The</b> Spanish <b>looted</b> <b>the</b> city for three days during which time many civilians lost their lives. <b>The</b> <b>looting,</b> although in later centuries greatly exaggerated, was particularly violent, perhaps because Farnese was in bed with fever during those three days.|$|R

25|$|The Ghaznavid conquests were {{initially}} {{directed against the}} Ismaili Fatimids of Multan, who were engaged in an ongoing struggle with the Abbasid Caliphate in conjunction with their compatriots of the Fatimid Caliphate in North Africa and the Middle East; Mahmud apparently hoped to curry the favor of the Abbasids in this fashion. However, once this aim was accomplished, he moved onto the richness of <b>the</b> <b>loot</b> of wealthy temples and monasteries. By 1027, Mahmud had captured parts of North India and obtained formal recognition of Ghazni's sovereignty from the Abbassid Caliph, al-Qadir Billah.|$|E
25|$|Again, as with Ohthere, Sami {{people and}} Kvens are not {{discussed}} at the same time. The saga tells how Norwegians taxed the Sami people, {{but there is no}} indication in the saga that the Kvens would have competed with the Norwegians for control of the Sami or lived near or among them. Much debate has taken place concerning whether the saga provides truthful information of Iron Age Kvenland by mentioning that the Kvens had a real-sounding 'king' and a 'law' to divide <b>the</b> <b>loot.</b> The saga places the confrontation of Norwegians and Karelians in the 9th century.|$|E
25|$|The triumphant English and French then looted {{the vessels}} and {{buildings}} ashore {{for the next}} eighteen days {{as well as the}} two galleons they seized from two merchant vessels. <b>The</b> <b>loot</b> was considerable—200 sacks of anil (dye), 3,000 hides and the artillery of the two captured galleons, together with the miscellaneous goods from the town. The Rosario was considerably damaged from the battering it had suffered from Nepture and Archangel in supporting the final attack. Newport decided to burn her as she was too damaged to be towed away, leaving the prize goods to be carried in the Bautista.|$|E
