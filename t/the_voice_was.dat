25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> useless against targets who cannot {{hear the}} speaker; both Baron Harkonnen in Dune and House Corrino in Children of Dune employ deaf people to guard Jessica, {{knowing that she}} cannot control them via <b>the</b> <b>Voice.</b> <b>Being</b> a {{manipulation}} of the target's subconscious mind, <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> of limited utility against an extremely disciplined mind, such as a Reverend Mother or a strong Mentat; if the target understands what <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> and how it works, and is aware that it is being used, he may resist it. One trained {{in the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> may easily detect its use by others, even subtly. In Dune Messiah, Paul trains some guards to resist <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> so that he may imprison Bene Gesserit. By the time of Children of Dune, Gurney Halleck has also been trained by Jessica to resist <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> completely.|$|R

25|$|Watson's {{debut album}} titled <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in May 2001; four others followed. However, an album planned for November 2006 was delayed {{due to the}} removal of a benign pituitary tumour. This album, titled That's Life, was eventually released on 5 March 2007.|$|E
25|$|The tone of <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> warm, lyrical, intense; it swirled and flared like a {{flame and}} filled the air with melodious reverberations like a carillon. It was by any {{standards}} an amazing phenomenon, or rather {{it was a great}} talent that needed control, technical training and strict discipline in order to shine with all its brilliance.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> an English {{translation}} of the Bible developed by Thomas Nelson (a subsidiary of News Corp) and the Ecclesia Bible Society. <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> a modern language, dynamic equivalent translation.

5000|$|The credits do {{not mention}} the actress {{providing}} <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Tony's wife in his dream, though the writers have stated <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> of a generic New Jersey actress and {{not intended to be}} anyone previously featured on the series.

25|$|Do {{you know}} how offhand that comment was and how many times I’ve had to face it since? I did say that. It was kind of true, {{but it was also}} a bit tongue-in-cheek. We were kind of told that might be the reason. It’s a six-minute song, which {{requires}} maturity for listening. What they specifically said, apparently, was that <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> too mature. I don’t know if that means I sound old or I sound intelligent. I’m going to hope that it’s the latter.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the BBC out-bid ITV for {{the rights}} to The Voice UK, which had already proved to be popular in other countries. The BBC paid £22 million {{for the rights}} to {{broadcast}} the show in the UK for two years. The Voice UK achieved good ratings for the BBC but ratings dropped {{towards the end of the}} first series and the second series. In 2013, <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>was</b> rescheduled to avoid a clash, and as a result, ratings have improved. In November 2015, it was announced that The Voice would be moving to ITV from 2017.|$|E
25|$|French opera was now {{established}} as a distinct genre. Though influenced by Italian models, tragédie en musique increasingly diverged from the form then dominating Italy, opera seria. French audiences disliked the castrato singers who were extremely popular {{in the rest of}} Europe, preferring their male heroes to be sung by the haute-contre, a particularly high tenor voice. Dramatic recitative {{was at the heart of}} Lullian opera, whereas in Italy recitative had dwindled to a perfunctory form known as secco, where <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> accompanied only by the continuo. Likewise, the choruses and dances that were such a feature of French works played little or no part in opera seria. Arguments over the respective merits of French and Italian music dominated criticism throughout the following century, until Gluck arrived in Paris and effectively fused the two traditions in a new synthesis.|$|E

500|$|... "Pinkeye" [...] {{included}} the first appearance of Principal Victoria, {{the principal of}} South Park Elementary. Her appearance is based on Comedy Central executive Debbie Liebling, {{who served as a}} South Park producer {{at the time of the}} episode's broadcast. Unlike Liebling, however, Principal Victoria spoke with a thick Minnesotan accent; <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> chosen simply because it was an accent voice actress Mary Kay Bergman could do particularly well.|$|E
500|$|Alex Borstein voices Lois Griffin, Asian {{correspondent}} Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown and Lois' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein {{was asked}} to provide a voice for the pilot while {{she was working on}} MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was [...] "really sight unseen". At the time, Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redhead mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> originally slower (and deeper for the original series), but when MacFarlane heard it, he replied [...] "Make it a little less fucking annoying ... and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{team made}} two minor {{changes to the}} design: they removed Davros' {{microphone}} and completely redesigned Davros' headpiece. The team felt that the microphone was redundant because Davros did not [...] "speak in a whisper and need something to make him more audible", and originally intended to leave Bleach's voice unaltered in post-production: the decision to treat <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> not made until late May 2008; and Gorton thought the original headpiece [...] "always seemed particularly weak" [...] for [...] "such a powerful character". After he was informed that the production designer for Genesis of the Daleks wanted the headpiece to resemble a medical brace, Gorton redesigned it to appear to be [...] "screwed directly into [...] head".|$|E

500|$|On January 24, {{an audio}} tape {{said to be}} from Osama bin Laden praised the bombing attempt and warned of further attacks against the United States, but did not claim {{responsibility}} for it. The short recording, which was broadcast on Al Jazeera television, said: [...] "The message delivered to you through {{the plane of the}} heroic warrior Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was a confirmation of the previous messages sent by the heroes of the September 11." [...] An adviser to the U.S. President said he could not confirm whether <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> that of bin Laden. In the past, the CIA has usually confirmed Al Jazeera reports on tapes attributed to bin Laden.|$|E
500|$|Stanton himself {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Crush the sea turtle. [...] He originally did the voice for the film's story reel, and assumed they would find an actor later. [...] When Stanton's performance became popular in test screenings, he decided to keep his performance in the film. [...] He recorded all his dialogue while lying on a sofa in Unkrich's office. Crush's son Squirt was voiced by Nicholas Bird, the young son of fellow Pixar director Brad Bird. [...] According to Stanton, the elder Bird was playing a tape recording of his young son around the Pixar studios one day. [...] Stanton felt <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> [...] "this generation's Thumper" [...] and immediately cast Nicholas.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{had written}} the opening concert scene without a {{specific}} band in mind. Green Day were cast in that role having requested to guest star in the show. Tom Hanks also appears as himself in the film and accepted the offer after just one phone call. Everybody Loves Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal provides {{the voice of the}} father in the [...] "new Grand Canyon" [...] commercial with Hanks. Due to time restraints, several guests who had recorded parts were cut from the film. Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut. Edward Norton recorded the part of the man who gets crushed as the dome is implemented, performing a Woody Allen impression. The staff felt <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> too distracting, so Castellaneta re-recorded Norton's dialogue with a different voice. Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich also recorded cameos, but their scenes were cut. Kelsey Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob, who was to appear at several different points, but these scenes were also cut. Johnny Knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star.|$|E

She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was [...] "really sight unseen". At the time, Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> originally slower, but when MacFarlane heard it, he replied [...] "Make it a little less [...] annoying...and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours". Seth Green was chosen to play Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman. Green stated that he did an impression of the [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition. His main inspiration for Chris' voice came from envisioning how [...] "Buffalo Bill" [...] would sound if he were speaking through a public address system at a McDonald's. Lacey Chabert was cast as Meg Griffin. Chabert voiced Meg Griffin for the first production season (15 episodes), but due to a contractual agreement was never credited. Chabert left the series because of time conflicts with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five, and was replaced by Mila Kunis.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} eight episodes [...] "Instinct" [...] and [...] "Bloodline", Tess learns about Krypton {{and the name}} [...] "Kal-El", though she does not {{attribute}} any of the information directly to Clark. In [...] "Bulletproof", it is revealed that Tess knows where Lex is. Here, Lana informs Tess that Lex surgically implanted a nano-transmitter into Tess's optic nerve {{so that he could}} keep an eye on everything she is doing. Visibly upset by this, Tess places a jamming device into her necklace to disrupt the signal, but not before telling Lex that she will cut him off from the outside world and sell off everything that he owns. In the episode [...] "Requiem", it is revealed that Tess sold controlling interest in LuthorCorp to Queen Industries. In [...] "Turbulence", Tess tries to get Clark to reveal his powers after she read one of Lionel Luthor's journals that identified Clark as [...] "The Traveler", but her effort failed. In the episode [...] "Eternal", it is shown that Tess has the Kryptonian orb that brought down the Fortress of Solitude, and in [...] "Injustice" [...] a disembodied voice emanates from the orb revealing that Tess's recent actions to get Clark to reveal his powers and kill Doomsday are because <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> instructing her to do so. In the season eight finale, the orb activates itself and transports Zod to Smallville.|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something I think is a great thing to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E
