25|$|When kept as a talisman, a {{horseshoe}} is said {{to bring}} good luck. Some believe that to hang it with the ends pointing upwards is good luck as it acts as a storage container of sorts for any good luck <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> floating by, whereas to hang it with the ends pointing down, is bad luck as all the good luck will fall out. Others believe that the horseshoe should be hung the other way (with the ends pointing down), as it will then release its luck to the people around it. A stylized variation of the horseshoe is used for a popular throwing game, horseshoes.|$|E

25|$|The much fainter {{red dwarf}} Proxima Centauri, or simply Proxima, is about 13,000 astronomical units (AU) away from Alpha Centauri AB. This is {{equivalent}} to —about 5% the distance between Alpha Centauri AB and the Sun. Due to the large distance between Proxima and Alpha, it was long unknown whether they were gravitationally bound. The true orbital speed is necessarily small, and {{it was necessary to}} measure the speeds of Proxima and Alpha with a great precision. Otherwise it was impossible to ascertain whether Proxima is bound to Alpha or whether it is a completely unrelated star <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> undergoing a close approach at a low relative speed. Probability suggested that such low speed approaches would be rare and unlikely, but it could not be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{a variant}} has emerged, {{producing}} what {{is sometimes called}} the steam bagel. To make a steam bagel, the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system. In commercial bagel production, the steam bagel process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam bagel is {{not considered to be}} a genuine bagel by purists, as it results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shaped like a bagel. Steam bagels are considered lower quality by purists as the dough used is intentionally more alkaline. The increase in pH is to aid browning, since the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} of statistical learning was first discovered {{in the context of}} language acquisition and there is much evidence of its role in that purpose, work since the original discovery has suggested that statistical learning may be a domain general skill and is likely not unique to humans. For example, Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, and Newport found that both adults and infants were able to learn statistical probabilities of “words” created by playing different musical tones (i.e., participants heard the musical notes D, E, and F presented together during training and were able to recognize those notes as a unit at test as compared to three notes that had not been presented together). In non-auditory domains, there is evidence that humans are able to learn statistical visual information whether that information is presented across space, e.g., or time, e.g.,. Evidence of statistical learning has also been found in other primates, e.g., and some limited statistical learning abilities have been found even in non-primates like rats. Together these findings suggest that statistical learning may be a generalized learning mechanism <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> utilized in language acquisition, rather than a mechanism that is unique to the human infant’s ability to learn his or her language(s).|$|E

Young and Sick, who also designed artwork for Torches, designed the mural. The painting took over ten days to complete. Although Young and Sick designed the mural, the actual painting was done by artists LeBA and Vyal {{under the guidance of}} Danial Lahoda, the owner and director of LALAarts. Foster explained that the mural wasn't intended to be a promotion for the album cover: [...] "it's meant to be a piece of art for the city <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an album cover." [...] On January 23, 2014, the band played a free show in front of the mural. Following some legal controversy, the Supermodel mural was later painted over.|$|E
2500|$|The early RiffTrax {{were almost}} all solo efforts on Mike's part, {{but it soon}} became {{apparent}} {{that there was a}} strong demand for them, and Nelson was quickly able to recruit more riffers for the project. Most official RiffTrax (not counting fan-made iRiffs and the spin-off RiffTrax Presents series) have a stable cast of Mike and former Mystery Science Theater 3000 co-stars Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, a line-up <b>that</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> identical to that of The Film Crew and the last three seasons of MST3K. That said, the guest slots vary often; other MST3K alumni have been featured, such as Mary Jo Pehl and Bridget Nelson, in addition to Internet personalities Richard Kyanka (of Something Awful fame), Josh Fruhlinger (writer of The Comics Curmudgeon) and Chad Vader, as well as actors Neil Patrick Harris, Fred Willard, and Joel McHale, and parodist [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic. Nelson has said {{that he would like to}} bring in other guests. The enthusiasm of guest riffers for the project led to the establishment of RiffTrax Presents, a series of tracks exclusively hosted by guest riffers and sanctioned by Nelson. The success of the guest format is such that [...] "Three Riffer Editions" [...] of some films previously solo riffed by Mike have been produced for the VOD service, which feature new riffs by Mike in conjunction with Murphy and Corbett, and Mike has ceased producing solo riffs since 2007. Most recent works created by Rifftrax are crafted by a small team of writers; longer works are divided into 20 to 30 minute sections for each writer to rewatch and develop riffs for before assembling the entire work.|$|E
