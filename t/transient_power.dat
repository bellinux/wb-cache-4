40|$|Many erbium doped fiber {{amplifier}} (EDFA) based multi-wavelength optical networks employ {{techniques such}} as burst-switching or packet switching where the time interval between traffic blocks can be long enough to induce EDFA optical <b>power</b> <b>transients.</b> The optical <b>power</b> <b>transients</b> are created by abrupt changes in the average input power to the EDFAs and can adversely affect {{the performance of the}} network. To mitigate the effects of EDFA optical <b>power</b> <b>transients</b> on optical networks, a method based on power shaping where heads and tails are joined to {{the beginning and end of}} a traffic block is proposed. A head (tail) gradually increases (decreases) the channel power by employing a pseudo-random bit sequence in which the probability of a “ 1 ” (“ 0 ”) increases from 0 to 0. 5. Theoretical and experimental results both show that EDFA optical <b>power</b> <b>transients</b> can be significantly reduced with adequate shaping periods. For a linear shaping profile, drop transient deviation was reduced by. 5 dB while add transient deviation was reduced by. 71 dB. Power shaping is an economical means of suppressing EDFA optical <b>power</b> <b>transients</b> compared to other physical layer approaches that require the addition of specialized components and can be applied to EDFAs as well as other solid-state and Raman optical amplifiers...|$|R

A comprehensive large-signal numerical model of FRAs, which incorporates time variation effects, and downstream and upstream propagations of multiple signals, pumps, and {{amplified spontaneous emission}} components, is developed and used for the theoretical analysis. The effect of pumping schemes, input signal power, pump power, the length and type of Raman fiber, {{and the number of}} added or dropped channels on the dynamics of surviving channel power fluctuations is studied.

40|$|Abstract—The {{evaluation}} of electromagnetic <b>transients</b> in over-head <b>power</b> lines due to nearby lightning return strokes requires accurate {{models for the}} calculation of both the incident lightning electromagnetic pulse (LEMP) {{and the effects of}} coupling of this field to the line conductors. Considering also the complexity of distribution networks in terms of their topology and the presence of power system components and protection devices, the imple-mentation of the LEMP-to-transmission-line coupling models into software tools used to represent the transient behavior of the entire network is of crucial importance. This paper reviews the most sig-nificant results obtained by the authors concerning the calculation of lightning-induced voltages. First, the theoretical basis of ad-vanced models for the calculation of LEMP-originated <b>transients</b> in overhead <b>power</b> lines is illustrated; then, the relevant experi-mental validation using: 1) reduced-scale setups with LEMP and nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) simulators and 2) full-scale setups illuminated by artificially initiated lightning are reported. Finally, the paper presents comparisons between simulations and new experimental data consisting of measured natural lightning-induced voltages on a real distribution network in northern Italy, correlated with data from lightning location systems.

50|$|Compared to static CMOS, all {{variants}} of nMOS (and pMOS) are relatively power hungry in steady state. This {{is because they}} rely on load-transistors working as resistors, where the quiescent current determines the maximum possible load at the output {{as well as the}} speed of the gate (i.e. with other factors constant). This contrasts to the power consumption characteristics of static CMOS circuits, which is due only to the <b>transient</b> <b>power</b> draw when the output state is changed and the p- and n-transistors thereby briefly conduct at the same time. However, this is a simplified view, and a more complete picture has to also include the fact that even purely static CMOS circuits have significant leakage in modern tiny geometries, as well as the fact that modern CMOS chips often contain dynamic and/or domino logic {{with a certain amount of}} pseudo nMOS circuitry.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThis report {{describes}} {{the effect of}} optical delay on {{the suppression of the}} <b>power</b> <b>transient</b> excursion in a combined gain-controlled erbium-doped fiber amplifier with an internal optical feedback loop (OFL). A simple homogeneous model showed that the optical delay caused a phase change in the oscillation of the surviving and laser channels, which resulted in a reduction of the overall <b>power</b> <b>transient</b> excursion. In addition to the reduction, a real system with a 1528. 7 -nm OFL shifted the oscillation upward or downward according to channel removal or addition, whereas another one with a 1560. 9 -nm OFL did not. This different transient behavior reflected a control-wavelength dependence on optical automatic gain control, where spectral-hole burning dominated over relaxation oscillation for 1528. 7 nm, and vice versa for 1560. 9 nm.

The proposed analysis of time-frequency wavelet decompositions has been found to improve the identification accuracy of the frequencies associated to the characteristic patterns of a fault location with respect to a sole frequency-domain wavelet analysis. Several laboratory fault tests, carried out by means of a reduced-scale model of a distribution feeder, are used to illustrate the characteristics and assess the performances of the proposed improved procedure.
