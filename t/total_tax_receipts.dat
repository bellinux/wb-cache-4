40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study the collect impact and the effects on some {{fundamental}} variables of the new indirect tax on retailer sales of some fuels that has been implemented by the regional governments (Impuesto sobre las Ventas Minoristas de Determinados Hidrocarburos (IVMH)). The methodology we use is based on a price model applied to a regional social accounting matrix (SAM) where we introduce the new tax. The reason why the SAM model is used is because the new tax is contributing to the regional tax collection and so a model with a regional perspective was needed. The database used in the analysis is the SAMAND 95 (Social Accounting Matrix of Andalusia, Spain, for 1995). The main results of the paper show that the IVMH has lightly inflationary effects on the consumer prices and lightly deflationary effects on the production prices.

The Wildlife Restoration Program was established in 1938 following the passage of the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, now referred to as the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act. The Sport Fish Restoration Program was established in 1950 by the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act. Since their inception, according to the Service, these programs have provided more than $ 9. 5 billion in grants to states and U. S. territories through fiscal year 2005. In 1999 and 2000, GAO identified several instances of mismanagement in these grant programs. Following GAO's work, Congress and the Service acted to improve the programs. In 1999 and 2000, GAO testified on the Service's management and oversight of funds used to administer the Wildlife and the Sport Fish Restoration programs. These testimonies identified several instances of mismanagement of administrative funds. For example, in administering these programs, the Service did not have criteria for selecting some grant recipients, failed to provide adequate oversight of grantees, and did not maintain adequate grant files. In addition, GAO found that grant transactions could not be reconciled between regional and headquarter financial systems, resulting in millions of dollars in discrepancies. In response to our work and the work of others, Congress enacted the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act (Improvement Act) in November 2000. The Improvement Act amended the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act by specifying, among other things, how administrative funds should be used and setting levels for how much the Service can spend on administration of the programs. Before the Improvement Act, the maximum amount of administrative funds {{that could be used for}} implementing the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration programs was calculated as a percentage of the <b>total</b> <b>tax</b> <b>receipts</b> for each program. On the basis of these calculations, in 2000, over $ 16 million was made available for administration of the Wildlife Restoration Program and about $ 15 million was made available for administration of the Sport Fish Restoration Program. Since the Improvement Act, funds for administrative costs were fixed in 2001 through 2003 and, thereafter, have been determined by a formula that limits the annual funds available for administrative activities. In fiscal year 2005, the Service spent about $ 8. 6 million per program on administration [...] about one-half of what was previously spent.

There is, however, no direct connection between the taxes {{collected by the}} Treasury Department and the gallons of on-highway fuel use, which can lead to a discrepancy between these totals. This study was conducted to determine how much of a discrepancy exists between the total fuel usages estimated based on highway revenue funds as reported by the Treasury Department and the total fuel usages used in the apportionment of the HTF to the States. The analysis was conducted using data from Highway Statistics Tables MF- 27 and FE- 9 for the years 1991 - 2001. It was found that the overall discrepancy is relatively small, mostly within 5 % difference. The amount of the discrepancy varies from year to year and varies among the three fuel types (gasoline, gasohol, special fuels). Several potential explanations for these discrepancies were identified, including issues on data, tax measurement, gallon measurement, HTF receipts, and timing. Data anomalies caused by outside forces, such as deferment of tax payments from one fiscal year to the next, can skew fuel tax data. Fuel tax evasion can lead to differences between actual fuel use and fuel taxes collected. Furthermore, differences in data collection and reporting among States can impact fuel use data.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} oil price movements on the UK economy. To this end, it is composed of three chapters which use different approaches {{in order to assess}} the causes and the consequences of oil price shocks on the main UK macroeconomic fundamentals. In Chapter 1, we analyse the impact of oil price fluctuations on the UK economy using a two-stage method. This empirical strategy allows us to decompose oil price changes depending on the underlying source of the shock. In line with previous studies, our results show that, since the mid- 1970 s, oil price movements have been mainly associated with shocks to oil demand rather than oil supply. We contribute to previous literature by finding that the consequences of oil price changes on UK macroeconomic aggregates depend on the different types of oil shocks. Thus, for instance, increases of global real economic activity do not depress the domestic economy in the short run. Conversely, shortfalls in crude oil supply cause an immediate fall of UK GDP growth. As a consequence, the Bank of England sets the nominal interest rate depending {{on the nature of the}} shock hitting the oil market. Our results also show that domestic inflation increases following a rise in the real oil price. Finally, we find that in response to oil price increases, although UK macroeconomic fundamentals worsen, the government deficit reduces. In Chapter 2, we develop and estimate, using Bayesian methods, an open economy two-bloc DSGE model in order to analyse the responses of the UK economy and the rest of the world to different sources of oil price shocks. We consider the period in which the UK was a net oil exporter that also corresponds to the Non-Inflationary, Consistently Expansionary (NICE) decade (1990 - 2005). In line with previous literature, our findings confirm that global oil shocks are mainly responsible for UK oil price changes. Our impulse response analysis shows that a drop in the oil price stimulates UK GDP and reduces domestic inflation inducing the BoE to lower the nominal interest rate. In contrast to previous studies, we find that the UK exchange rate responds differently according to the source of oil price shocks. In particular, a positive shock to foreign oil intensity induces an appreciation of the Pound. Conversely, a positive shock to foreign oil supply causes a depreciation of the British Sterling. Generally, a fall in the oil price worsens the UK trade balance, since UK is a net oil exporter. Finally, our historical decomposition analysis contributes to previous literature by showing that episodes of sharp increases in the oil price are associated with falls in the UK output and rises in the domestic inflation. In Chapter 3, we study the main transmission channels of oil price fluctuations for the UK economy and the consequences of oil price changes on its public finances. Our model is estimated with Bayesian techniques over the same sample period as in Chapter 2. In line with previous literature, our results show that foreign oil demand and supply shocks are the main factors explaining the UK oil price volatility. In contrast to existing studies we find that the variation of UK government debt is broadly explained by oil price fluctuations related to changes in the foreign oil intensity. We extend the previous literature by estimating the parameters of several fiscal policy rules. In particular, we find that the response of petroleum revenue tax to oil price changes is stronger than the response of fuel duty tax to domestic oil demand. In line with Chapter 2, our impulse response analysis indicates that a decrease in the oil price positively affects the UK economy inducing an increase in its GDP and a fall in the domestic inflation. However, the drop in the oil price generates a negative effect on the UK trade balance. In contrast to Chapter 2, we find that a positive foreign oil intensity shock causes depreciation in the Pound. The latter effect occurs as the decrease in the UK VAT causes a reduction in the price of domestic consumption goods. Finally, we are able to quantify the size of the responses of UK public finances to oil price shocks. Our results indicate that a fall in the oil price induces a reduction in UK <b>total</b> <b>tax</b> <b>receipts</b> and, in turn, causes the rise in the government debt. Thus, for example, we find that a positive shock to foreign oil intensity increases UK government debt by £ 700 millions during the first year and £ 1100 millions in four years...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe Connecticut {{sales tax}} {{is the most}} {{important}} single revenue producing measure in Connecticut's fiscal history. It has also proved {{to be one of the}} most controversial pieces of tax legislation adopted in Connecticut's history. My purpose has been to evaluate the sales tax as a measure designed to produce the needed additional revenue with the least amount of inequity to consumers and business in additional burdens, and with the least amount of administrative expense to the state. It is the tax that was chosen by the representatives of the people and may be considered to have a general public support from the beginning although the early support was by no means unanimous. In Chapter 1, I present the background need for additional revenue in terms of the expanding expenditures of the state. The objects of these increasing expenditures were highways, charities, and education. Relief expenditures also held an important position in the 1930 's. In the post war period capital outlay expenditures, neglected during the war, and rising prices made expenditures increase. These increases indicated revenue needs. The second part of the Chapter 1 is an attempt to indicate the need for additional revenue in terms of Connecticut general budget balance and general fund balance. Accounting concepts developed by the Bureau of the Census were used. It is felt that this approach helps to bring out more clearly the revenue inadequacies of the state. The last section of Chapter 1 deals with the Connecticut revenue system. The percentages that various taxes are of the <b>total</b> <b>tax</b> <b>receipts</b> are indicated for selected years showing the relative revenue importance of the various taxes. The analysis of the Connecticut revenue system indicates the need for broadening the revenue base. The results of this achievement through the sales tax are indicated. Chapter 2 deals with the history of the Connecticut sales tax from its passage in May of 1947 to February of 1951. The history of the tax traces three threads of development. There is the legislative history which deals with the original passage of the sales tax bill, pressures for modification by various groups, the hearings before the Finance Committee preparatory to the special session of the legislature in 1948, the Saxon Report presented for consideration by the legislative finance committee, the special session with its resulting amendments, and the renewal of the sales tax vs. income tax controversy in the legislative session of 1949. This legislative history is a study in partisan politics and the basic theme is income vs. sales tax controversy. A second thread of historical development is the early community and public antagonism developing into final public acceptance. The third historical thread is that of the development of the administrative machinery for carrying out the act. Education of the public to final acceptance of an initially unpopular law may be seen in the campaign carried on by the state tax department and the press in bringing clarity to the sales tax act. It is indicative of the selling job a tax administrator has when new legislation is imposed. It has been my intent to present the arguments by the opposing sides in the controversy with as little injection of critical comment as possible. The hope is that enough of the logic or lack of logic to the various arguments is evident to present the true nature of the alternative and the extent of the correctness of the peoples' choice. Chapter 3 presents a general comparison of the Connecticut two percent tax with the sales tax of the other sales tax states. A comparison is made as to type, basis, and rates. A second comparison deals with the exemptions of particular commodities under state sales taxes. A comparison of exemptions of sales to certain types of buyers and a comparison of exemptions of commodities subject to excises are also presented. Finally a comparison of exemptions of specific transactions is shown. The Connecticut tax is also compared with the taxes of certain selected states such as California, on which the Connecticut tax was modeled; Rhode Island, Maryland, Tennessee, and Florida which are with Connecticut the "new" sales tax states, and New York City which is within the same region. The major provisions of the Connecticut tax are explained, and attention is given to its scope, measure, rates, major exemptions, and revenue importance. A comparison of revenue returns under a one, two, and three percent rate is shown as well as the tax productivity of various types of retail business. Chapter 4 describes the administrative machinery of the state sales tax and use tax devision. The cost of administration is compared under the one, two, and three percent rates. This was possible because the three rates were all in effect during the first four years of operation. The administrative problems of the use tax are discussed as well as the administrative problems connected with certain exemptions. Chapter 5 deals with the economic aspects of the Connecticut sales tax. The problem of shifting and incidence as affected by the "separate charge" provision is discussed. Consideration is also given to aspects of shifting through cost structure of retail business. Burden and regressivity are the major subject of attention in the remainder of the chapter. A comparison is made of the regressivity evidenced when different sets of income expenditure data are used as a basis for applying the tax. Data from the following three studies, the 1941 "Study of Family Expenditure" by the National Resources Planning Board based on 1935 - 36 data on consumer purchases, the study on "Family Income and Expenditures in 1947 " by Helen M. Humes, and the study of 1941 by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics on "Family Spending and Saving in Wartime," showed comparable results. The effect of exemptions on reducing the amount of regressivity was shown. By combining the percentage of income tax taken by the two percent tax and the gasoline and cigarette taxes and indication of the heightened regressivity which results from adding the sales tax to excises and other proportional taxes is evident. Chapter 6 draws the following conclusions: The Connecticut sales tax was a temporary measure designed to meet the need for increased revenue. It has met that need and achieved public acceptance in its four years of existence. Since revenue needs to continue to expand, the sales tax will become a permanent addition to the revenue system. It may be adjusted by and increase to three percent to meet the increasing demands for additional revenue and/or other sources will be tapped to provide the additional revenue. The future may possibly see an income tax added to the state tax system to provide the needed revenue. The Connecticut sales tax represent a recent trend in sales tax development which does not recommend itself to ease of administration. This trend is illustrated by the increase in number of exemptions included under the Connecticut tax. The exemptions which pose the greatest administrative problems and at the same time accomplish little in the way of added equity should be either modified or withdrawn. An extension of the tax to gasoline and cigarettes would be desirable. The exemption of children's clothing, which does little to reduce the regressivity and poses a major administrative problem, should be dropped. The withdrawal of the exemption on restaurant meals and on domestic fuel would accomplish much in the way of administrative simplicity and add noticeably to revenue receipts. The addition of tools and machinery sold to industrial and farm users to the exemption list would make the incidence clearer and more directly to the consumer. The exemption of food should be retained if the rate remains at two percent or moves upward. In the light of revenue needs and for the achievement of administrative simplicity, the exemptions should be reduced. The incidence of the Connecticut sales tax is essentially on the consumer. This result is accomplished by complete shifting under the separate charge provision. The tax is regressive and the regressivity is modified somewhat by the exemptions. Though the regressivity is not particularly serious in itself, it adds to the burden of an already regressive state and local tax system. If the rate is increased to three percent the burden will noticeably increase, and the removal of exemptions on domestic fuel and restaurant meals perhaps should be foregone. Maintaining or reducing the rate with a reduction of exemptions would be preferable. The burden on business is negligible at the present rate and generally diffused. An increase in rate would increase the competitive disadvantage of retailers competing with out-of-state firms. The Connecticut sales tax has proven itself as an outstanding and fairly stable revenue producer. Recognizing the inequity in burden on the lower income groups, popular approval and ease of payment may well outweigh this disadvantage. Any increase in rate, however, should be made only after a complete and careful evaluation of possible alternative measures...|$|E
40|$|During the 1970 s and 1980 s, many {{developing}} countries enacted value-added taxes (VATs) {{as a part of}} their fiscal structures. The productivity of this source of revenue has depended in large part on the facility with which the tax can be administered. Single rate VATs have proved easier to administer than those with multiple rates. Exemptions and zero-rating tend to complicate administration. Because small taxpayers are so numerous in developing countries and administrative resources so limited, the treatment of small taxpayers has required special attention. The difficulty of taxing services has led most developing countries to omit all but a few services from the tax base.
