5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of <b>test</b> <b>time</b> in total.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient <b>test</b> <b>time,</b> and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E

According to Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1946–47, the aircraft was shipped to the U.S.A. after 86 hours <b>test</b> <b>time</b> in December 1941.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{improved}} method of back-ground calibration that reduces production <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> of mixed-signal ICs. Production <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> typically consists of “calibra-tion convergence time ” + “functional <b>testing</b> <b>time</b> after calibration convergence”. The method that is proposed here reduces average calibration convergence time. This method {{does not require}} extra ADC operation for functional testing after calibration convergence, and can be implemented with little additional on-chip test-support circuitry when testing is performed by ATE (Automatic Test Equipment). As an application of this method, we discuss background calibration of pipelined ADCs and present simulation results that demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing <b>testing</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R

For instance, low power and high performance oscillators are not built with the same die. In addition, high precision oscillators often require more careful calibration than lower precision oscillators.|$|E

2500|$|This sonnet is a {{continuation}} of Sonnet 64, and is an influential poem on the aspect of Time's destruction. Shakespeare also offers an escape from Time's clasp in his end couplet, suggesting that the love and human emotion he has used through his writing will <b>test</b> <b>Time</b> and that through the years the black ink will still shine bright. [...] Shakespeare begins this sonnet by listing several seemingly vast and unbreakable things which are destroyed by time, then asking what chance beauty has of escaping the same fate. [...] A main theme is that many things are powerful, but nothing remains in this universe forever, especially not a fleeting emotion such as love. [...] Mortality rules over the universe and everything is perishable in this world, so it is only through the timeless art of writing that emotion and beauty can be preserved.|$|E
2500|$|Most glucometers today use an {{electrochemical}} method. Test strips {{contain a}} capillary that sucks up a reproducible amount of blood. The glucose {{in the blood}} reacts with an enzyme electrode containing glucose oxidase (or dehydrogenase). The enzyme is reoxidized with an excess of a mediator reagent, such as a ferricyanide ion, a ferrocene derivative or osmium bipyridyl complex. The mediator in turn is reoxidized by reaction at the electrode, which generates an electric current. [...] The total charge passing through the electrode {{is proportional to the}} amount of glucose in the blood that has reacted with the enzyme. The coulometric method is a technique where the total amount of charge generated by the glucose oxidation reaction is measured over a period of time. The amperometric method is used by some meters and measures the electric current generated at a specific point in time by the glucose reaction. This is analogous to throwing a ball and using the speed at which it is travelling at a point in time to estimate how hard it was thrown. The coulometric method can allow for variable test times, whereas the <b>test</b> <b>time</b> on [...] a meter using the amperometric method is always fixed. Both methods give an estimation of the concentration of glucose in the initial blood sample.|$|E

[...] Ray Proenneke flew in many US west coast meets and contests in the early 1960s and won the Torrey Pines meet in 1964. Bud Brown flew several regional contests in the US midwest in the late 1960s, placing 7th, winning the handicap trophy, in the Wright Memorial Meet of 1967. In the 1968 Region 6 Contest Bud flew to 11th overall, but once again won the handicap trophy. In 1967, Peter Newgard flew his Cherokee to first place in the 25:1 glide ratio and under category at the US Region 11 contest. Carl Herold won the 1976 US Region 11 Sports Class contest in a borrowed Cherokee II. [...] In the 1978 US Region 4 Sports Class contest, Ted Garnett came in first in his Cherokee II. Dean Gradwell placed 5th in the US Region 11 Sports Class in 1983, winning one day's competition. Tony Condon placed 3rd in the 2011 US Region 10 Soaring Championships flying his Cherokee II, winning two days.
