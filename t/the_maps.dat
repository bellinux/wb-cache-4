5|$|During {{the middle}} of the 20th century, {{examination}} of <b>the</b> <b>maps</b> and photographs from the previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated, and in many cases disappeared altogether. Repeat photography of the glaciers, such as the pictures taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat.|$|E

5|$|Even <b>the</b> <b>maps,</b> {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated.

In the end the cost, as well as the shading of <b>the</b> <b>maps,</b> which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E

5|$|Map-making in China {{preceded the}} Han dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps from the State of Qin (found in Gansu, {{displaying}} the region about the Jialing River) show the measured distance between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues {{that these are}} to be considered the first known economic maps (as they predate <b>the</b> <b>maps</b> of the Roman geographer Strabo, c. 64 BCE– 24 CE). Maps from the Han period have also been uncovered by modern archaeologists, such as those found with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts at Mawangdui. In contrast to the Qin maps, the Han maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of map symbols, cover a larger terrain, and display information on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps. One of <b>the</b> <b>maps</b> discovered at Mawangdui shows positions of Han military garrisons which were to attack Nanyue in 181 BCE.|$|E
5|$|The atlas {{includes}} further 28 maps: 16 of Britain, 4 of Denmark and {{one each}} of the polar regions, Iceland, Norway with Sweden, Prussia, Livonia, Russia, Lithuania, Transylvania and Crimea. This collection of maps is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth of England and in the preface Mercator acknowledges the information he received from English mariners through Rumold who {{had spent much of}} his working life in London. The full atlas included all <b>the</b> <b>maps</b> of the previous two collections, making in all 102 new maps by Mercator. His heirs added 5 introductory maps before publication: world map and Europe by Rumold, Africa and Asia by grandson Gerard and America by grandson Michael. Nevertheless the atlas was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. <b>The</b> <b>maps</b> are in a variety of projections.|$|E

30|$|The {{first step}} of trace {{processing}} is filtering. The filtered trace is then addressed to <b>the</b> <b>Map</b> Matching, where GPS points are matched to <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> {{in order to find}} the existing segments on <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> <b>The</b> matched points of the trace are used to update the existing segments on <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> which thus improves road precision. The non-matched points of the trace are aggregated on to <b>the</b> <b>map,</b> creating new roads (or trajectories). Two databases are then generated from this process; <b>the</b> <b>map</b> database and <b>the</b> statistics database. These databases serve to provide data for external services such as route planning and traffic analysis. For more information on the YouTrace project, please refer to [7]. As can be understood, <b>the</b> <b>Map</b> Matching is a key element for YouTrace, which is entirely responsible for finding the parts of the trace that already exist on <b>the</b> <b>map.</b> This allows for the distinction between the parts that should be aggregated and those that should be updated, therefore the quality of <b>the</b> final <b>map</b> is dependable {{of the quality of the}} match.|$|R

The authorship of <b>the</b> <b>map</b> has also been debated, while <b>the</b> <b>map</b> is commonly attributed to Tasman, it is now thought to have been the result of a collaboration, probably involving Franchoijs Visscher and Isaack Gilseman, who took part in both of Tasman’s voyages. Whether <b>the</b> <b>map</b> was produced in 1644 is also subject to debate, as a VOC company report in December 1644 suggests that at that time no maps showing Tasman’s voyages were yet complete.|$|R

5|$|Arkham Asylum {{features}} {{a series of}} challenge maps separate from the game's story mode that are unlocked while playing, and others are available as optional downloadable content (DLC). <b>The</b> <b>maps</b> focus on the completion of specific goals, such as eliminating successive waves of enemies in combat, and subduing patrolling enemies while using stealth. The methods and variety of abilities used to achieve these goals earn an overall performance score that is ranked online against other players. On the PlayStation 3, the Joker is a playable character in the combat and stealth challenge maps via optional DLC; he must confront the asylum guards and police commissioner James Gordon. The Joker has his own combat abilities and weapons, such as a handgun, exploding chattering teeth, and x-ray glasses which allow him to see opponents through walls.|$|E

Their firm, Sargent, Farsari & Co., dealt in smokers' supplies, stationery, visiting cards, newspapers, magazines and novels, Japanese and English conversation books, dictionaries, guidebooks, maps, and photographic views of Japan. The creator of these photographs remains unknown, but Farsari was the maker of {{at least some of}} <b>the</b> <b>maps,</b> notably of Miyanoshita (in the Hakone resort area) and Yokohama.
