500|$|To Steinhauer's {{apparent}} surprise, Lody appeared nonchalant {{about the}} danger {{that he was about}} to go into. [...] "Well, after all, one might as well die that way as any other," [...] Lody said, according to Steinhauer; [...] "I shall be rendering the Fatherland a service and no other German can do more than that." [...] At a final meeting at the Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody [...] "only laughed at me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> fears were groundless." [...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E
500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, and one of my colleagues <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kim began skating {{at the age}} of 6. Her {{coach at}} the time, Ryu Jong-hyun, {{strongly}} suggested to Kim's mother that Kim should continue to skate, predicting that she would become a world-class figure skater in the future. In a 2011 interview, she gave credit to her coaches for noticing her aptness for skating, stating, [...] "My coaches have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> muscles and body structure are perfect for skating. I was born with a good instrument, maybe more so than the talent. I was lucky my coaches noticed early on and helped me develop that. A lot of people don't know they are born that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{met him at}} the Blackboard Café in Bakersfield, California, {{which was}} the place to go in '61. [...] He was already famous for not showing up or showing up drunk, and he showed up drunk. [...] I was onstage - I think I was singing Marty Robbins' 'Devil Woman' - and he kicked the doors of the office open and said 'Who the fuck is that?' [...] It was one of the {{greatest}} compliments of my entire life when George Jones said I was his favorite country singer...In 1967, I released a ballad called [...] "I Threw Away The Rose" [...] and he was so impressed he actually jumped ship and left his tour, rented a Lear Jet and came to Amarillo, Texas. [...] He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> low note changed his life. [...] He also folded my steel guitarist Fuzzy Owen in a rollaway bed and rolled him out on the street. [...] That was the pinnacle." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by the Sunday Times on 23 July 1989, Allan recalled a significant episode when Terre'Blanche had drunkenly hammered on her flat door and eventually slept on the doorstep {{and that she had}} to step over him the next morning. Despite her objections, her editor, Myburgh, insisted on publishing answering machine messages allegedly by Terre'Blanche, accompanied by a denial by Allan of counter claims that he had made against her. Allan recounted conversations with her editor [...] "After the bomb he said, 'Right, we'll publish the tapes.' I said I didn't think that would be wise, as the security police had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> life would be in danger. He said, 'We're going to blow them out of the water.'" [...] She had just emerged from a course of traction for her seized back, and was then rushed to hospital with a bleeding ulcer because of the stress. Allan fled to Britain permanently for security reasons in the same week that the transcripts were published. The tapes were the Sunday Times lead story published on 30 July 1989 with the front-page headline 'JANI: MY ET TAPES'.|$|E

6000|$|... "Because I {{would not}} have you think so,--if I could help it. I {{did not intend to}} be rough with you. When you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>my</b> life was disreputable--" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{ought to}} have remembered this, after what he had already <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>My</b> {{intelligence}} brightened a little as I went on.|$|E
6000|$|C. I {{never did}} {{think much of}} Dr. Brownlow. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> {{palpitations}} were nothing but indigestion, and I am sure they were not! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Till you murder me. Oh! {{it is in}} your mind. Do you {{remember}} the angel who spoke {{with me in the}} fire and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> husband was not dead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would tell the jury," [...] said the counsel for defense after the witness had been sworn, [...] "just what you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>my</b> office {{yesterday}} afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{that you}} have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> hitherto, <b>my</b> good M. Fourier, {{concerns}} His Majesty and the security of his throne. I cannot help wondering {{how much of this}} news has reached him by now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is true that}} folk have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>my</b> capon stewed in milk, such as we had to-night--Why, lad, what is {{the matter}} with your doublet? You fidget me by {{continually}} rubbing at it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{first words}} to me--they were of my mother. None else {{but the man}} who loved her as she has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> father did would have thought first of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> coming {{would take}} you back thirty-three years," [...] Joan {{reminded}} him. [...] "It makes us about the same age. I shall treat you as just a young man." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> nothing; <b>my</b> {{father is}} {{too much of a}} soldier, and too little used to have a family around him, to talk of such matters. Is it {{forbidden}} to say whither we are bound?" ...|$|R

6000|$|This she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to <b>my</b> nose. And {{the fat man}} murmured bitterly già! già!--ay! ay! Her {{impertinence}} and the fat man's quiet bitterness stirred my bile. Has {{not this}} song been sung at me once too often, by these people? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>my</b> dear, {{because you}} thought it would not matter much with me, and I {{appreciate}} the compliment. I can do nothing for you. I am not near enough to those who wear wigs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] said Marston in a {{surprised}} voice. [...] "We are partners {{for good and}} bad, and Mabel is Flora's friend. When we started for Africa, she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> job was to stand by you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My mother, frequently--I {{have seen}} the tears start into {{her eyes as she}} gazed at me, and she has often <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>my</b> family name ought to have been Mordaunt, so much do I {{resemble}} her father." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{heard me}} respectfully but without much heeding these words, which I spoke a little turned from him, already {{on my way}} to the door; he was observing (this they {{afterwards}} <b>told</b> <b>me)</b> <b>my</b> height and figure, which seemed to catch his attention all at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God, no!" [...] she cried. [...] "You {{are sure}} this is the man?" [...] she went on, her voice shaking with fierce excitement. [...] "There is no one else--hurt? No one else stabbed? This is the man they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> was <b>my</b> husband?" ...|$|R
