25|$|Is <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, who had {{the opportunities}} which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Love began {{composing}} {{an album}} with songwriter Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever {{wanted to have a}} glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> out there who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was my one true piece of shit. It has no cohesive thread. I just hate it", she said in a 2014 interview. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: [...] "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." ...|$|E

500|$|Once {{the first}} leg of the tour proper began at San Jose, California on April 1, the {{consistent}} show opener was [...] "Badlands" [...] – whose ending, or false ending, was framed with a recurrence of the Magic Tour's question of [...] "Is <b>there</b> <b>anybody</b> alive out there?" [...] – several things became apparent. [...] Typical shows contained only three songs from Working on a Dream: [...] "Outlaw Pete" [...] (initially accompanied by a fog machine), [...] "Working on a Dream", and [...] "Kingdom of Days". [...] This was in stark departure from all previous Springsteen tours, when material from newly released albums was heavily featured. [...] One other recently released Springsteen song, [...] "The Wrestler", was also included in about half the set lists, although it did not share the new album's romantic pop style. [...] Of the other Working on a Dream songs, a couple were never attempted in private rehearsal; some others were rehearsed privately but not publicly; [...] "This Life" [...] and [...] "Surprise Surprise" [...] did not survive past the first Asbury Park rehearsal show; [...] "Good Eye" [...] did not survive past the first proper show; and [...] "My Lucky Day" [...] was played in the first three shows before being dropped. [...] The disappearance of [...] "This Life" [...] and [...] "My Lucky Day" [...] were especially notable, given the former had an elaborate, extended multi-part Beach Boys-style [...] "Ba ba ba" [...] outro section featuring King and Mizelle in its one rehearsal performance, and that the latter was the album's second single. [...] Nor was the prior album, Magic, given any due, with only [...] "Radio Nowhere" [...] included. Set lists relied mostly upon Springsteen material up through 1984's Born in the U.S.A., 2002's The Rising, and a few scattered selections from other periods.|$|E
2500|$|Two further singles from Human Frailty were released, [...] "Everything's on Fire" [...] in August and [...] "Is <b>There</b> <b>Anybody</b> in There?" [...] in October, both {{reached the}} top50 in New Zealand (No.44 and 41 respectively) {{but not in}} Australia. The album {{included}} a cover version of a track originally recorded by Sardine v, [...] "Stuck on You", written by Ian Rilen and Stephanie Falconer aka Stephanie Rilen.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{version of}} [...] "Throw Your Arms Around Me" [...] was {{recorded}} for the album and was issued as its second single, which peaked at No.49 in Australia in May 1986. Eventually it {{became one of}} their most popular songs, voted in the Top5 on the Triple J Hottest 100 for 1989, 1990, and 1991. Two further singles from Human Frailty were released, [...] "Everything's on Fire" [...] (August 1986) and [...] "Is <b>There</b> <b>Anybody</b> in There?" [...] (October), both reached the top50 in New Zealand but not in Australia. The band had signed a parallel deal with I.R.S. Records for North America, which released the album there in July 1987.|$|E

2500|$|Human Frailty is {{the fourth}} studio album by Australian rock band Hunters & Collectors, which was {{released}} on 7 April 1986. It was a commercial and critical success. The album peaked at No.10 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart and No.5 on the New Zealand Albums Chart. Four singles were issued from the album, [...] "Say Goodbye", which reached No.24 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart; [...] "Throw Your Arms Around Me" [...] (a re-recorded version of a previous single), No.49; [...] "Everything's on Fire", No.78; and [...] "Is <b>There</b> <b>Anybody</b> in There", which did not chart in Australia but did reach No.41 on the New Zealand Singles Chart.

2500|$|From the mid-1990s, Bambaataa {{returned}} to his electro roots. [...] In 1998, he produced a remix of [...] "Planet Rock" [...] combining electro and house music elements, called [...] "Planet Rock '98," [...] which is regarded as an early example of the electro house genre. In 2000, Rage Against the Machine covered his song [...] "Renegades of Funk" [...] for their album, Renegades. The same year, he collaborated with Leftfield on the song [...] "Afrika Shox," [...] the first single from Leftfield's Rhythm and Stealth.
