500|$|Moore {{performed}} {{his first}} solo show {{at a small}} club in Istanbul on March 23, 2007. The hour-long show consisted primarily of material from Graveyard Mountain Home, which was accompanied by projections of the corresponding scenes from Age 13. [...] "I {{thought that it would}} be good for the first show <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of small and comfortable... so I thought we [...] just have a hundred people," [...] Moore said. [...] "Everybody can see, everybody can be comfortable and sort of enjoy themselves. And if something goes horribly wrong, it only happens in front of a hundred people." [...] Moore hoped the show would form the basis of more elaborate, longer shows. He planned on playing more shows in Turkey, before touring Europe and the rest of the world.|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|Caesar's niece, Atia, {{was portrayed}} by actress Polly Walker. According to Heller, while most auditioning actresses {{assumed that the}} {{character}} was the series' villainess, Walker made [...] " [...] bigger than life but completely real...She could read the phone book {{with that kind of}} brio and joy." [...] Rather than a villain, Heller wrote her to be [...] "a real life force. Everything she's doing is for the good of her family, her children. No matter how evil it gets, it's always for good reason." [...] Walker was pleased with her [...] "very complex character. I found it exciting to play such massive emotions and deal with such interesting, to say the least, situations. I saw it as a huge challenge, and I have huge admiration for this character. A lot of people might consider her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of evil or bad, but I think she's wonderful. She's just a survivor, doing what she's got to do." ...|$|E

Inside the separation chamber, air drag on the objects supplies an upward force which counteracts {{the force of gravity}} and lifts the material <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sorted</b> up into the air. Due to the dependence of air drag on object size and shape, the objects in the moving air column <b>are</b> <b>sorted</b> vertically and can be separated in this manner.|$|R
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek {{a couple of years}} ago have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also had the feeling that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the film}} was released, the {{distributor}} did not promote it heavily, and most reviewers disliked it. Because {{the film was}} X-rated, The New York Times refused to run the film's advertisement. [...] This was a somewhat awkward situation, as the ad included a positive review from The New York Times. According to Swenson, [...] "it didn't have a big following, ... {{but it is still}} in video stores." [...] The film played for about two weeks in New York City. Jerry Beck wrote a review in which he called the film [...] "raunchier than Ralph Bakshi's films." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the humor of the film [...] "is good, but the design and drawing is downright awful. It seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of a cross between Jules Feiffer and Gahan Wilson, if that can be imagined." [...] Beck also stated that the film was [...] "very similar to R. Crumb's Mr. Natural and Flakey Foont. There is no reason that the duck should be a duck. Every character in the film is human, and he just seems to be a duck just to give the film a catchy title. There are some highly imaginative animated ideas here, but the film's entertainment value is at a minimum." [...] Beck later called the film [...] "one of the most overlooked animated features of the 1970s, a glorious experimental mess of a film, which, from today’s vantage point, looks incredibly creative and daring, and something current Hollywood studios would never attempt." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Zap2it wrote, [...] "Sure, Blair's (Leighton Meester) {{been dreaming}} of her fairytale wedding {{since she was}} just a little girl. But it's also true that producers of Gossip Girl have been dreaming of this moment for a long time as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In what has come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references to Gossip Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl quote ("I love you, always have, always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured the confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|E

These proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of sheep-pens of unpolished wood, each with four hard chairs in it. The interior of the Highfield Athletic and Gymnastic Club was severely free from anything in the shape of luxury and ornament. Along the four walls were raised benches in tiers. On these were seated as tough-looking a collection of citizens as one might wish to see. On chairs at the ring-side were the reporters, with tickers at their sides, by means of which they tapped details of each round through to their down-town offices, where write-up reporters were waiting to read off and elaborate the messages. In the centre of the room, brilliantly lighted by half a dozen electric chandeliers, was the ring.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{an integer}} sorting {{algorithm}} using P systems with mobile catalysts. The paper considers {{the case when}} the number of components of the vector <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sorted</b> <b>is</b> a fixed number k. The components of the vector are represented as the multiplicities of certain objects present in one membrane. The result of the computation will be given in the outer region by eliminating objects according to their initial multiplicities order. Due to the massive parallel computational feature of P systems (and despite the “unorder ” of the multiset or the “weakness of the ingredients” used in computation) the time complexity of the algorithm depends linearly on the maximum of the values <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sorted</b> and not on the number of values <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sorted</b> as in classical sequential cases. ...|$|R
