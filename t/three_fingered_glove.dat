40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an idea of a glove {{wirelessly}} connected to a mobile-phone. The idea has been developed {{with the aid of}} interviews and experimental product design. Interviewees were persons in professions that are exposed to hard weather and whose tasks are physically demanding. The concept has been designed in a <b>three</b> <b>finger</b> <b>glove</b> where the interaction takes place mainly by voice and hand gestures. The product design integrates the function {{in the construction of the}} glove. Wanted investigates the use of technology in a special context where working conditions are exposed to hard weather and converts it to a useful concept and product. Keywords: smart clothing, wearable technology, smart textiles, product design, extreme condition...|$|R
5000|$|Glove Cycle is a sculptural {{installation}} of 54 separate bronze sculptures of gloves located throughout Porter station. Individual gloves {{are located on}} a turnstile and between {{the up and down}} escalators. Small piles of gloves are located {{at the bottom of the}} escalators and on the inbound platform, while other gloves are embedded in the floor of both platforms as well as the mezzanine. The gloves are arranged, some in small vignettes, to have different stories and emotions connected to them. Richard Wolkomir of Smithsonian Magazine explains that the first gloves one approaches in the station are [...] "a big glove giving birth to a little glove", and that [...] "Some gloves have two thumbs, or only <b>three</b> <b>fingers.</b> One large <b>glove</b> extends a <b>finger</b> toward a smaller glove, like a caricature of Michelangelo's Jehovah transmitting life to Adam on the Sistine ceiling." ...|$|R

5000|$|Jack caught only {{a couple}} of games until July 3. An injury to the regular catcher, Al [...] "Doc" [...] Bushong, gave him his opportunity. He caught 87 {{straight}} games for the Browns using the old <b>finger</b> <b>glove</b> which preceded the protective mitt of the modern era.|$|R
50|$|Alex awakens in <b>Three</b> <b>Finger's</b> {{house and}} sees Deputy Lane {{die in a}} razor wire net. Nate finds <b>Three</b> <b>Finger's</b> house and frees Alex, but <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> attacks him. Alex saves him by {{stabbing}} <b>Three</b> <b>Finger.</b> Nate and Alex drive away in his tow truck, but <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> follows them, leaps {{on top of the}} truck, and causes them to crash into a tree. As the truck catches fire, Brandon appears and pulls Alex out. While Brandon helps Nate, <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> attacks them, but Nate apparently kills him with a meathook. Afterwards, a U.S. Marshal team arrives and rescues Nate and Alex.|$|R
50|$|Dream allows fighters {{latitude}} in {{their choice of}} attire but open <b>finger</b> <b>gloves,</b> a mouthguard and a protective cup are mandatory. Fighters are allowed to use tape on parts of their body or to wear a gi top, gi pants, wrestling shoes, kneepads, elbow pads, or ankle supports at their own discretion, though each must be checked by the referee before the fight.|$|R
50|$|Gloves {{are worn}} by {{all members of}} the {{defensive}} team and are made in many styles and sizes. The gloves are made with leather or a sturdy fabric. The catcher and first baseman usually wear mitts which include additional padding and no <b>fingers.</b> <b>Gloves</b> are similar to baseball gloves, but softball allows larger sizes up to 14 inches from top to bottom.|$|R
50|$|These gloves {{are also}} {{referred}} as short <b>finger</b> <b>gloves,</b> {{are used for}} better grip by exposing fingers. It gives you the dexterity needed when grabbing hold of bars. Very useful in hot and humid conditions to avoid sweating in hands. They are the second most used gym gloves. They also make the bare metal of the weight bars easier on the skin.|$|R

5000|$|The salute {{is often}} used by sport fans and players when celebrating victories. After winning the 1995 European {{basketball}} championship, the entire then-Yugoslav team displayed the <b>three</b> <b>fingers.</b> Sasha Djordjevic says he flashed the <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> [...] "not to be provocative. Just: that's Serbia, that's us, that's me - nothing else. It's my pride." [...] Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic raises <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> after his victories.|$|R
50|$|As mentioned, Landmates {{have four}} arms. The two large ones {{are used for}} {{carrying}} items, frequently large weapons, and employ jointed, five-fingered mechanical hands. The two smaller arms, located below the first pair, are hollow and flexible sheaths, that contain the pilot's arms. Most military and police Landmates have a lightly armored, <b>fingered</b> <b>glove</b> {{at the end of}} the control arms, allowing the pilot to use their own hand for special purposes or weapons handling, whereas civilian models typically have a protective steel mitt.|$|R
5000|$|In Serbian and Orthodox tradition, {{the number}} three is {{exceptionally}} important. <b>Three</b> <b>fingers</b> are used when signing the cross in Orthodoxy, symbolizing the Trinity. The Serbs, when swearing Oath, historically used the <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> (collected, as when crossing) {{along with the}} greetings [...] "My Holy Trinity" [...] (Svetog mi Trojstva) or [...] "for the Honorable Cross and Golden Freedom" [...] (za krst časni i slobodu zlatnu) during formal and religious events. The salute was often made with both hands, raised above the head. Serbian peasants sealed a pledge by raising <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> to the face, the face being [...] "the focus of honour" [...] in Balkan culture. A Serbian proverb goes [...] "There is no cross without three fingers" [...] (Nema krsta bez tri prsta). Karađorđe was appointed leader of the Serbian rebels after they all raised their [...] "three fingers in the air" [...] and thereby swore Oath. [...] The <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> were viewed of {{as a symbol of}} [...] in the 19th century. Njegoš mentioned [...] "the crossing with <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> has not remained" [...] when speaking of the Islamization of Serbs, a central theme in The Mountain Wreath (1847). Paja Jovanović's painting, The Takovo Uprising (1888), depicts Miloš Obrenović holding a war flag and saluting with <b>three</b> <b>fingers.</b> [...] The Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik, which supported that Serbs had three faiths (Orthodoxy, Catholicism and Islam), criticized the Pan-Serbists who according to them only [...] "truly believed those Serbs, who cross with three fingers". A short story published in 1901 surrounds a Serbian despot meeting with a Szilágyi, who has the despot's <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> cut off by Franciscan friars after discussing the right way of crossing. Serbian Metropolitan Nikolaj Velimirović (1881-1956) called for a Serbian salute in which <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> were to be raised along the greeting: [...] "Thus Help Us God!". In 1937, Velimirović began a sermon protesting the Catholic support for separation of state and religion in Yugoslavia with [...] "Rise <b>three</b> <b>fingers</b> Orthodox Serbs!".|$|R

40|$|This thesis work {{focuses on}} the <b>three</b> <b>finger</b> gripper. The main aim {{is to develop a}} <b>three</b> <b>finger</b> gripper for picking up {{specific}} hazardous objects by the gripper and placing it in the desired position. The system is under actuated. Therefore, to develop these <b>three</b> <b>fingered,</b> a solid model is prepared in Solid works. Kinematic analysis is carried out to find position, orientation and joint values of the gripper by forward and inverse kinematic equation. Grasping mechanism is also discussed in the thesis for gripping an object precisely...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Sheriff Carver {{looks for}} Nate, and Deputy Lane sets out {{look for the}} missing group of rafters. Sheriff Carver finds the group but is killed by <b>Three</b> <b>Finger.</b> Chavez and Floyd get into a fist fight while Brandon watches, {{allowing}} Nate and Alex to escape. After the fight, Chavez and Brandon leave the knocked out Floyd behind. When they hear Alex and Nate talking, they lay the money down before taking them hostage again. They find the location where the watch tower once stood, only to discover it was burned down years ago. Floyd finds the money and attempts to run away with it, but he stumbles on some rocks and cries out. Chavez hears him and finds Floyd, only to see <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> lobbing a molotov cocktail at Floyd, killing him and burning all the money. Chavez gives Alex to <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> to improve his chances of survival. <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> drags Alex into his truck and drives off. He secures Alex at his house and goes back out to hunt {{the rest of the}} survivors. Nate wants to go after Alex, but Chavez threatens to kill him if he does. Fed up, Brandon knocks Chavez unconscious and lets Nate go. After waking up, Chavez finds <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> and fights him, but <b>Three</b> <b>Finger</b> overpowers and kills him.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Finger</b> <b>Gloves</b> is a {{performance}} piece {{and the main}} prop of that performance piece and was done in 1972. They are worn like <b>gloves,</b> but the <b>finger</b> form extends with balsa wood and cloth. By {{being able to see}} what she was touching {{and the way in which}} she was touching it, it felt as if her fingers were extended and in her mind the illusion was created that she was actually touching what the extensions were touching. There is another piece that she did that is very similar to this one. It is part of her Berlin Exercises series done in 1974 called [...] "touching the walls with both hands simultaneously". In this piece she made more <b>finger</b> extension <b>gloves,</b> but this time measured it so that they specifically fit the selected space. If the chosen participant stood in the middle of the room, they could exactly touch opposing walls simultaneously.|$|R

5000|$|Full <b>fingered</b> - <b>Gloves</b> should fit snugly but not be tight. Pay {{particular}} attention to the length of the fingers as the fingertips can become very cold if the <b>glove's</b> <b>fingers</b> are not long enough. Ideally the glove should be loose on the fingers and fit comfortably around the palm. A tight glove will tend to restrict blood flow and make the hand cold as it is at an extreme distance from the heart.|$|R
