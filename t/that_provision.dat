5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming <b>that</b> <b>provision.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the {{university}} opened, the State Legislature amended Cornell's charter on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees. However <b>that</b> <b>provision</b> {{did not become}} operative until {{there were at least}} 100 alumni in 1872. Cornell {{was one of the first}} Universities to elect trustees by direct election. (Harvard was probably the first to shift to direct election of its Board of Overseers by alumni in 1865.) Cornell's first female trustee was Martha Carey Thomas (class of 1877), who the alumni elected while she was serving as President of Bryn Mawr College.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1876, several {{bills were}} {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives {{in an effort to}} resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck <b>that</b> <b>provision.</b> This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates {{for the first time in}} United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.|$|E

5|$|The college {{had its own}} science {{laboratories}} from 1907 to 1947, {{which were}} overseen (for all but the last three years) by the physical chemist David Chapman, {{a fellow of the}} college from 1907 to 1944. At the time of their closure, they were the last college-based science laboratories at the university. They were named the Sir Leoline Jenkins laboratories, after a former principal of the college. The laboratories led to scientific research and tuition (particularly in chemistry) becoming {{an important part of the}} college's academic life. The brochure produced for the opening ceremony noted that the number of science students at the college had increased rapidly in recent years, and <b>that</b> <b>provision</b> of college laboratories would assist the tuition of undergraduates, as well as attracting to Jesus College graduates of the University of Wales who wished to continue their research at Oxford. A link between one of the college science lecturers and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) led to 17 students joining ICI between the two World Wars, some, such as John Rose, reaching senior levels in the company. The laboratories became unnecessary when the university began to provide centralised facilities for students; they were closed in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The laboratories, {{which were}} in use from 1907 to 1947, {{occupied}} three floors.

The total cost was £25,000.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether discretionary provisioning by Western European banks is driven by income smoothing or credit risk considerations. We find evidence <b>that</b> discretionary <b>provisioning</b> by Western European banks is driven by income smoothing incentives in the post-financial crisis period, particularly, among listed banks. Also, we observe <b>that</b> discretionary <b>provisioning</b> is significantly influenced by credit risk factors, mainly, non-performing loans and loan growth. Also, we find <b>that</b> discretionary <b>provisioning</b> by Western European banks is procyclical with fluctuations in the economic cycle. Overall, the implication of the findings is <b>that</b> discretionary <b>provisioning</b> among Western European banks is driven by both income smoothing and credit risk considerations...|$|R

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the decision, more {{automobile}} manufacturers began putting arbitration clauses in their contracts, and courts began enforcing them. Dealers opposed them, sometimes in court, since the ADDCA had been passed to give them a judicial forum for those disputes, as its popular name implied. Some took refuge in state laws regulating motor vehicle franchising that explicitly barred the enforcement of arbitration clauses. But in 1990 the Fourth Circuit struck <b>that</b> <b>provision</b> of Virginia's Motor Vehicle Dealer Licensing Act down as incompatible with the FAA under Southland Corp. v. Keating and the Supreme Court's other arbitration jurisprudence.|$|E

25|$|Justice Chan {{began by}} affirming that the High Court has {{jurisdiction}} {{to issue an}} order of prohibition against the Government. Although section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act states that courts cannot grant an injunction in civil proceedings against the Government, he rejected the State Counsel's argument that based on this provision the Court did not have power to do so. He held that the reference in section 27 to civil proceedings it did not relate to judicial review proceedings and, hence, <b>that</b> <b>provision</b> {{did not affect the}} court's ability to grant an order of prohibition during a judicial review of government proceedings.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 Axelrod sold TFH Publications to Central Garden & Pet Company of California for $70 million.

The following year, however, the purchaser filed a countersuit against him, claiming that he had grossly and illegally inflated {{the value of the}} company before the purchase. On September 1, 2005, Axelrod was ordered to pay Central Garden & Pet Company $16.4 million (net, after deducting $3.7 million the company was ordered to pay Axelrod due to earnings targets).|$|E
40|$|Following the {{financial}} and banking crisis of the late 2000 s, accounting regulators sought to replace the incurred-loss method of loan-loss provisioning by a more forward-looking expected-loss method. Difficulties arose, including {{with respect to the}} weight <b>that</b> expected-loss <b>provisioning</b> should place on objective evidence of loss relative to evidence of a less specific and more judgemental nature. This paper provides evidence relevant to this issue by examining whether loan-loss provisioning by UK banks was less timely under the stricter evidence requirements of the IAS 39 incurred-loss regime implemented in 2005 than under the less strict evidence requirements of the previous UK incurred-loss regime. It does so by reference to the relationship in time between loan write offs and loan-loss expense. The results do not suggest <b>that</b> <b>provisioning</b> became less timely under the stricter evidence requirements of IAS 39. There is no evidence <b>that</b> <b>provisioning</b> became less timely immediately prior to the crisis of the late 2000 s. Also, there is no evidence <b>that</b> general <b>provisioning,</b> permitted under the pre-IAS 39 regime, enhanced the timeliness of loan-loss provisioning The results do not suggest that stricter requirements regarding the evidence necessary to support recognition of loan losses have resulted in less timely loan-loss provisioning...|$|R
