5|$|Established during <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indies film industry, Oriental {{released}} its first film, Kris Mataram, in July 1940. It starred Njoo's wife Fifi Young, and relied on her fame {{as a stage}} actress to draw audiences. This {{was followed by a}} further three films, which were targeted at low-income audiences and extensively used kroncong music. Their final production was Panggilan Darah in 1941, which was completed after Njoo and Young had migrated to Majestic Film.

5|$|Established during <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indies film industry, Union {{released}} its first film, Kedok Ketawa, in July 1940.

This continued after Saeroen left for Star Film in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising realism.

McLachlan would later sell his stake in Omni, but remains proud of their documentary work. At the time, McLachlan was unsuccessful in joining an industry union, relegating his work to advertising and small-scale productions; his first union-backed project was on <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> television series Sea Hunt.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Britain intervened and {{returned}} {{control of the}} Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its incorporation into the global, and particularly European, economic pattern of growth. The beneficiaries of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a new layer within the Arab elite. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration and <b>the</b> <b>revival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew language and culture. The movement was publicly supported by Great Britain during World War I with the Balfour Declaration of 1917.|$|E
