5000|$|The PowerPC 7450 [...] "Voyager"/"V'ger" [...] was {{the only}} major {{redesign}} of the G4 processor. The 33-million <b>transistor</b> <b>chip</b> extended significantly the execution pipeline of 7400 (7 vs. 4 stages minimum) to reach higher clock speeds, improved instruction throughput (3 + branch vs. 2 + branch per cycle) to compensate for higher instruction latency, replaced an external L2 cache (up to 2 MB 2-way set associative, 64-bit data path) with an integrated one (256 KB 8-way set associative, 256-bit data path), supported an external L3 cache (up to 2 MB 8-way set associative, 64-bit data path), and featured many other architectural advancements. The AltiVec unit was improved with the 7450; instead of executing one vector permute instruction and one vector ALU (simple int, complex int, float) instruction per cycle like 7400/7410, the 7450 and its Motorola/Freescale-followers can execute two arbitrary vector instructions simultaneously (permute, simple int, complex int, float). It was introduced with the 733 MHz Power Mac G4 on 9 January 2001. Motorola followed with an interim release, the 7451, codenamed [...] "Apollo 6", just like the 7455.|$|E

50|$|Versions of {{the older}} NS32000 line for low cost {{products}} such as the NS32CG16, NS32CG160, NS32FV16, NS32FX161, NS32FX164 and the NS32AM160/1/3, all based on the NS302CG16 were introduced from 1987 and onwards.These processors had some success in the laser printer and fax market, despite intense competition from AMD and Intel RISC chips. Especially the NS32CG16 should be noted. The key difference between this and the NS32C016 was {{the integration of the}} expensive TCU (Timing Control Unit) which generated the needed two-phase clock from a crystal, and the removal of the floating point coprocessor support, which freed up microcode space for the useful BitBLT instruction set, which significantly improved the performance in laser printer operations, making this 60,000 <b>transistor</b> <b>chip</b> faster than the 200,000 transistor MC68020. The NS32CG160 was the CG16 with timers and DMA peripherals, while the NS32FV/FX16x chips had extra DSP functionality on top of the CG16 BitBLT core for the Fax/Answering Machine market. They were complemented by the NS32532 based NS32GX32 later. Unlike the previous chips, there was no extra hardware. The NS32GX32 was the NS32532 without the MMU sold at an attractive price for embedded system. In the beginning, this was just a remarked chip. It is unclear if the chip was redesigned for lower-cost production.|$|E
50|$|The MC6801 was a single-chip {{microcomputer}} with a 6802 CPU with 128 bytes of RAM, a 2 KB ROM, a 16-bit timer, 31 programmable parallel I/O lines, and a serial port. It could {{also use the}} I/O lines as data and address buses to connect to standard M6800 peripherals. The 6801 would execute 6800 code but it had ten additional instructions and the execution time of key instructions was reduced. The two 8-bit accumulators could act as a single 16-bit accumulator for double precision addition, subtraction and multiplication. It was initially designed for automotive use with General Motors as the lead customer. The first application was a trip computer for the 1978 Cadillac Seville. This 35,000 <b>transistor</b> <b>chip</b> was too expensive for wide-scale adoption in automobiles so a reduced function MC6805 {{single-chip microcomputer}} was designed. The MC6809 was the most advanced 8-bit microprocessor Motorola produced. It had a new instruction set that {{was similar to the}} 6800 but abandoned op-code compatibility for improved performance and high-level language support; the two were software compatible in that assemblers could (and generally did) generate code which was equivalent to 6800 opcodes the 6809 did not directly emulate. In that sense, the 6809 was upward compatible with the 6800. The 6809 had many 16-bit operations, including the first 8-bit multiply instruction (generating a 16 bit product) in a microprocessor, two 16-bit index registers and stack pointers, and full support for both position independent (object code could run wherever it was loaded in memory) and reentrant (object code could be written to be reused by other routines), these last features previously seen only in much larger machines such as IBM 360 mainframes.|$|E

40|$|Semiconductor {{transient}} faults (soft errors) {{are becoming}} an increasingly critical threat to reliable software execution. With {{the advent of}} the billion <b>transistor</b> <b>chip</b> era, it is impractical to protect the entire hardware. As a result, it is crucial that the tradeoffs between reliability and performance be made at the architecture design stage. To achieve this goal, researchers need a framework to evaluate software vulnerability to transient errors at a high level.

Compared with previous studies, Sim-SODA covers more hardware structures and provides fine-grained reliability analysis.

Ageing under increased drain voltage allowed studying both thermal and electrical aspects. Characterization performed before and after ageing tests proved that ageing process is mainly due to thermal stress for the irreversible part and to trapping effects for the reversible one, respectively. This was confirmed by additional physical analysis, the results revealing strong changes of the Schottky contact.

40|$|The goal of more {{powerful}} computers is to enable more demanding applications.

New applications will continue to demand more and more computing power. The problem of computing is then one of determining how to provide a desired level of computing power given the available technologies. There are three broad aspects of the computing function that I will comment on in this paper: (i) Algorithms for carrying out the desired computation, (ii) Hardware to perform the desired operations, and (iii) Software (compilers) that converts a computation expressed in a high-level language to a form that hardware can operate upon.

40|$|The pace of {{progress}} {{in the design of}} integrated circuits continues to amaze observers inside and outside of the industry. Three decades ago, a 50 <b>transistor</b> <b>chip</b> was a technological wonder. Fifteen year later, a 5000 transistor device would 'wow' the crowds. Today, 50, 000 transistor chips will earn a 'not too bad' assessment, but it takes 500, 000 to really leave an impression. In 1975 a typical ASIC device had 1000 transistors, took one year to first samples (and two years to production) and sold for about 5 cents per transistor. Today's 50, 000 transistor gate array takes about 4 months from spec to silicon, works the first time, and sells for about 0. 02 cents per transistor. Fifteen years ago, the single most laborious and error prone step in IC design was the physical layout. Today, most IC's never see the hand of a layout designer: and automatic place and route tool converts the engineer's computer captured schematic to a complete physical design using a gate array or a library of standard cells also created by software rather than by designers. CAD has also been a generous benefactor to the digital design process. The architect of today's digital systems creates the design using an RTL or other high level simulator. Then the designer pushes a button to invoke the logic synthesizer-optimizer tool. A fault analyzer checks the result for testability and suggests where scan based cells will improve test coverage.
