5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E
25|$|In 1517, {{father and}} son began a project in Lucerne (Luzern), {{painting}} internal and external murals for the merchant Jakob von Hertenstein. While in Lucerne Holbein also designed cartoons for stained glass. The city's records show that on 10 December 1517, he was fined five livres for fighting in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> goldsmith called Caspar, who was fined the same amount. That winter, Holbein probably visited northern Italy, though no record of the trip survives. Many scholars believe he studied the work of Italian masters of fresco, such as Andrea Mantegna, before returning to Lucerne. He filled two series of panels at Hertenstein's house with copies of works by Mantegna, including The Triumphs of Caesar.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the wall}} was opened in November 1989 and the {{checkpoint}} booth removed on June 22, 1990, the checkpoint remained an official crossing for foreigners and diplomats until German reunification during October 1990 when the guard house was removed; it is now {{on display in the}} open-air museum of the Allied Museum in Berlin-Zehlendorf. The course of the former wall and border is now marked in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> line of cobblestones. A copy of the guard house and sign that once marked the border crossing was later built where Checkpoint Charlie once was. It resembles the first guard house erected during 1961, behind a sandbag barrier towards the border. Over the years it was replaced several times by guard houses of different sizes and layouts (see photographs). The one removed during 1990 was considerably larger than the first one and did not have sandbags.|$|E

25|$|The Cork {{area has}} seen {{improvements}} in road infrastructure in recent years. For example, the Cork South Link dual carriageway {{was built in}} the early 1980s, to link the Kinsale Road roundabout with the city centre. Shortly afterwards, the first sections of the South Ring dual carriageway were opened. Work continued through the 1990s on extending the N25 South Ring Road, {{with the opening of the}} Jack Lynch Tunnel under the River Lee being a significant addition. The Kinsale Road flyover opened in August 2006 to remove a bottleneck for traffic heading to Cork Airport or Killarney. Other projects completed at this time include the N20 Blackpool bypass and the N20 Cork to Mallow road projects. The N22 Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass, which links to the Western end of the Cork Southern Ring road was opened in September 2004. City Centre road improvements include the Patrick Street project – which reconstructed <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pedestrian focus. The M8 motorway links Cork with Dublin.|$|E

[...] "Castleers" [...] is a short vocal track and tribute to Raphael and D'wayne's Castlemont High School chorus group, Castleers Choir, in which they sang as students. Raphael said of its inspiration, [...] "The high school choir was all about that classic R & B harmony, so I named the song after the choir. One {{of the great things}} about that experience at school was that it got us ready to go out in the professional world with our music." ...|$|E

2500|$|O'Connell {{is known}} in Ireland as [...] "The Liberator" [...] or [...] "The Great Emancipator" [...] for his success in {{achieving}} Catholic Emancipation. O'Connell admired Latin American liberator Simón Bolívar, {{and one of his}} sons, Morgan O'Connell, was a volunteer officer in Bolívar's army in 1820, aged 15. The principal street in the centre of Dublin, previously called Sackville Street, was renamed O'Connell Street in his honour in the early 20th century after the Irish Free State came into being.

2500|$|In 2005, under {{financial}} {{pressure from}} its charity involvements and rising costs, the SVCMC system filed for bankruptcy. [...] The system launched an aggressive reorganization effort, selling or transferring its money-losing facilities and focusing development on its main hospital, which {{allowed it to}} emerge from bankruptcy {{in the summer of}} 2007. [...] In the name of modernizing and restructuring, it also announced plans to build a new Manhattan hospital across <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> planned opening set for 2011. Part of this redevelopment was to include construction of a billion-dollar residential condominium by the Rudin real estate family. The plan was a source of contention with several neighborhood groups, such as the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation and the Municipal Art Society. The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the residential components of the plan in July 2009, but by then residential development financing was no longer available because of the global financial crisis.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{building}} was designed to echo the Washington Monument, the sides of {{the building}} slope slightly inward, and each floor of the Foshay Tower is slightly smaller than the one below it. It is also unusual in that the tower is set back from <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two-story structure surrounding it on the Marquette Avenue and 9th Street sides. The other two sides of the building, facing 8th Street and 2nd Avenue, are now surrounded by the TCF Tower, which rises to seventeen stories on the 2nd Avenue side and entirely obscures the views from the windows of the first seven stories of the Foshay Tower on the 2nd Avenue and 8th Street sides. Internally the building uses steel and reinforced concrete. The exterior is faced with Indiana limestone, while the interior features African Mahogany, Italian marble, terrazzo, gold-plated doorknobs, a silver and gold plated ceiling, ornamental bronze, hand wrought iron and three commissioned busts of George Washington. It cost US$3.75 million to build. From the Marquette Avenue side of the structure, the name, [...] "Foshay," [...] is visible in concrete four times on the exterior of the building (once on the top and three times on the street level).|$|E
2500|$|The {{prevalent}} {{practice is}} that one eats in the sukkah on the eighth day, but without reciting the blessing (berakhah) for sitting in a sukkah. However, one does not take the lulav and etrog (nor does one sleep in the sukkah according to most opinions) on the eighth day. If someone sees a neighbor on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lulav and etrog on the eighth day, the rabbis reason, s/he might mistakenly assume {{that it is still}} the seventh day (ḥol hamoed), when the lulav and etrog are still needed. S/he might then violate prohibitions of the yom tov of the eighth day. For that reason, the rabbis ruled that one should not take the lulav and etrog on the eighth day, even outside the Land of Israel. They are therefore muktzah; that is, one may not even move them on a holiday where they are not needed. [...] Sleeping in the sukkah brings a similar discussion. Additionally, most people would prefer to sleep indoors {{at this point in the}} year due to the weather, so sleeping in the sukkah may impinge on one's own joy during the festival. This is why the rabbis ruled that one does not sleep in the sukkah on Shemini Atzeret, even outside the Land of Israel. Other rabbis, such as the Vilna Gaon, ruled that one should sleep in the sukkah on Shemini Atzeret outside the Land of Israel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rare and}} wonderfully warm {{observations}} Berry made of working people {{are perhaps the}} most enduring: [...] "old women, who sat night after night, squat as frogs, drinking, watching, eating and taking all in", [...] "and the publican had got a clean collar and tie on, and all the world was ship-shape--this was happiness." [...] "I once saw a pot-woman dance an impromptu fertility dance...the woman sitting with him had knees the size of hams, and drank a case of bottled beer as she sat there." [...] And [...] "then there are the princes of drink, men high in the hierarchy of booze, popes of the tap-room...they manage to live and live with style; to smoke and drink and back horses without ever seeming to concern themselves about money...savour the full richness of the working class who can live without work...I have known such men rear big families on the dole, and strut up <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rose in their buttonhole." [...] Then there are the [...] "ordinary men who cannot make ends meet and are under the rule of women...lesser men, who are pestered by women and children, whooping cough and rashes of one sort or another...troubles that reduce an honest man to a worrying machine...all the bellyaching and mither and half-pint scrimping that bogs most men down...the poverty, and the poverty of just being able to make ends meet... bosses and women and children [...] pull men down from their dignity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chili Peppers {{were again}} without a drummer and {{were forced to}} hold open auditions. Denise Zoom, {{a friend of the}} band, {{suggested}} Chad Smith, claiming he was the best drummer she had ever seen. The band agreed to audition Smith, but he was late and the last drummer to audition. Kiedis recalled {{the first time he saw}} Smith by saying, [...] "I spied this big lummox walking down <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> really bad Guns N' Roses hairdo and clothes that were not screaming I've got style". Smith was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, according to Flea, [...] "lit a fire under our asses". From the moment they started jamming, Smith and Flea instantly found chemistry. Smith was a hard-hitting musician with whom the Chili Peppers believed they would create a strong relationship. Kiedis said the audition with Smith [...] "left the band in a state of frenzied laughter, that we couldn't shake out of for a half an hour". Smith was so much different from the other three. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were heavily influenced by punk rock, whereas Smith's taste in heavy metal music and his biker appearance contrasted with their punk rock views. Kiedis informed Smith he would be hired on one condition: as an initiation to the band, Smith had to cut his long hair. He refused, though Kiedis was not about to argue with the much larger Smith. Smith was hired as the band's fourth drummer on December 3, 1988.|$|E

[...] In no time it was lined with various mills and factories. [...] The buzzing Town of Sheridan incorporated in 1886. The subsequent discovery of natural gas on West 3rd Street in 1888 boosted the town’s growth even further as several additional industries chose to locate there. [...] Sheridan’s movers and shakers eagerly expanded their holdings {{to take advantage of this}} inexpensive fuel, which, unfortunately, as [...] in [...] the several [...] other [...] “gas [...] boom” counties of Indiana, soon ran out. [...] But for a time, Sheridan even boasted both glass factory and a cannery along with a large brickworks, the Thistlethwaite Tile and Brick plant. [...] Several smaller brick manufacturers, along with numerous other industries, including Indiana Condensed Milk—a company purchased by Wilson’s Milk, a leader in canned condensed milk. [...] Despite the waning gas supply, many industries remained. [...] Sheridan, around the turn of the twentieth century had become the second largest town in the county with a thriving commercial district along Main Street. [...] Included were a large variety of stores, several hotels, banks, and lodges still sharing <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few dwellings. [...] Many of these buildings survive, including the two large commercial buildings on Main—the Golden Rule general merchandise store and the dry goods store of Stanley Brothers. [...] Both were constructed in the 1890s. [...] The town applied to Andrew Carnegie for funds to build a library, a structure completed in 1912.|$|E
