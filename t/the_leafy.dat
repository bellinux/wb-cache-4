5|$|Camouflage is {{sometimes}} facilitated by motion, as in <b>the</b> <b>leafy</b> sea dragon and some stick insects. These animals complement their passive camouflage by swaying like plants, either preventing predators from detecting them, or appearing as {{something other than}} prey.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as <b>the</b> <b>leafy</b> sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E
5|$|The built {{environment}} around Coatbridge's town centre is characterised by its mixture of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century sandstone buildings and late twentieth-century precast concrete shops. <b>The</b> <b>leafy</b> Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas {{to the west}} and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various twentieth-century local authority housing buildings. Several high rise flats dominate the skyline. Due to the decline of industries, several private housing estates have been built on reclaimed land.|$|E

5|$|Mimesis is practised by {{animals such as}} <b>the</b> <b>leafy</b> sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and {{the leaf}} scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. In the fish species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving {{back and forth in the}} surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E
5|$|Swaying {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} <b>the</b> <b>leafy</b> sea dragon and {{the stick}} insect Extatosoma tiaratum. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, {{and the ability to}} sway effectively like the plants that they mimic. E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is a gust of wind, with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two, and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and <b>the</b> <b>leafy</b> stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E

5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, <b>the</b> <b>leafy</b> sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E

25|$|Male {{pregnancy}} is the incubation {{of one or}} more embryos or fetuses by male members of some species. In nearly all heterogamous animal species, offspring are ordinarily carried by the female until birth, but in fish of the Syngnathidae family (pipefish, seahorses and <b>the</b> <b>leafy</b> seadragon), males perform this function. There are different ideas concerning whether a human male could become pregnant, and, by some definitions of gender identity, humans that identify as men have become pregnant. Male humans incubating fetuses are also a recurring theme in speculative fiction.|$|E
25|$|Commercially grown {{orange trees}} are {{propagated}} asexually by grafting a mature cultivar onto a suitable seedling rootstock {{to ensure the}} same yield, identical fruit characteristics, and resistance to diseases throughout the years. Propagation involves two stages: first, a rootstock is grown from seed. Then, when it is approximately one year old, <b>the</b> <b>leafy</b> top is cut off and a bud taken from a specific scion variety, is grafted into its bark. The scion is what determines the variety of orange, while the rootstock makes the tree resistant to pests and diseases and adaptable to specific soil and climatic conditions. Thus, rootstocks influence {{the rate of growth}} and have an effect on fruit yield and quality.|$|E
