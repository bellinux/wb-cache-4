5|$|In November 1883, the Oregon and California Railroad {{was built}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the Rogue Valley, {{bypassing}} Jacksonville, the county seat. The railroad company also constructed a train depot halfway between Central Point and Phoenix, and platted 82 city blocks around it. The townsite was named Medford in December. In 1884, residents celebrated the town's first Independence Day by firing 38 cannon blasts—one for each U.S. state—from Roxy Ann Peak's summit. Medford grew quickly, and was incorporated on February 24, 1885.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Route 50 (US-50) in Utah {{crosses the}} center of the state. The highway serves no major {{population}} centers in Utah, with the largest city along its path being Delta. Most of the route passes through desolate, remote areas. Through the eastern half of the state the route is concurrent with Interstate 70 (I-70). US-50 both enters and exits Utah concurrent with US-6, however the two routes are separate <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the state.|$|E
5|$|A {{topographic}} map {{shows that the}} majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Canada–US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E
5|$|As the {{original}} expressway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along {{which it was}} to run. There was some initial support to name it after Roy Chapin, the late president of the Hudson Motor Car Company and a former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover. On April 23, 1946, the Detroit Common Council voted instead to name the highway after Edsel Ford, the son of Henry Ford {{and president of the}} Ford Motor Company from 1918 until his death in 1943.|$|E

5|$|East of the mall, {{the route}} passes through {{increasingly}} rural areas, {{with the exception}} of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY250 and the Wayne County line. NY31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural town of Macedon to the village of the same name. Prior to exiting the village, NY31 meets the southern terminus of NY350 and the eastern terminus of NY31F. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In Palmyra, NY31 joins NY21 <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the village.|$|E
5|$|In La Pintada, {{a remote}} fishing village of around 400residents {{situated}} {{to the west}} of Acapulco, a mudslide occurred on September14, which within a few minutes, swept <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> town. As such, many residents initially wandered throughout town in a state of panic and confusion; it took two days for word of the mudslide to spread to the public. Throughout the village, 71people were killed. Over half the town, including 20homes, were demolished due to the mudslide. A total of 334people were evacuated by police, though 30elected to stay in the area until all the victims had been identified. Many surviving citizens of La Pintada were also hurt, including one seriously.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of Mellenville, NY217 intersects with CR9 (Mellenville Road), with NY217 serving as CR9's {{southern}} terminus. NY217 then heads southeast, crossing Claverack Creek and passing Mellenville Union Cemetery to the north {{as well as the}} adjacent Claverack Town Park. The route turns eastward and meets the northern terminus of Roxbury Road as it enters the village of Philmont. Within Philmont, NY217 follows Main Street <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the densely populated village. At an intersection with Maple Street, the highway comes within view of Summit Lake, a small water body in {{the center of}} Philmont. Past the lake, NY217 turns northeast once more and intersects with CR11 (Martindale Road) as it leaves the village.|$|E

50|$|In 1963 J. O'M. Bockris, M. A. V. Devanthan and Klaus Müller {{proposed}} the BDM {{model of the}} double-layer that included {{the action of the}} solvent in the interface. They suggested that the attached molecules of the solvent, such as water, would have a fixed alignment to the electrode surface. This first layer of solvent molecules displays a strong orientation to the electric field depending on the charge. This orientation has great influence on the permittivity of the solvent that varies with field strength. <b>The</b> IHP passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> these molecules. Specifically adsorbed, partially solvated ions appear in this layer. The solvated ions of the electrolyte are outside <b>the</b> IHP. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> these ions pass the OHP. The diffuse layer is the region beyond the OHP. The BDM model now is most commonly used.|$|R
50|$|The Schönhardt {{polyhedron}} can {{be formed}} by two congruent equilateral triangles in two parallel planes, such that <b>the</b> line <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangles is {{perpendicular to the}} planes. The two triangles should be twisted with respect to each other, {{so that they are}} neither translates of each other nor 180-degree reflections of each other.|$|R
5|$|Interstate 805 (I-805) {{is a major}} north–south Interstate Highway in Southern California. It is a bypass of I-5, running roughly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the Greater San Diego region from San Ysidro (part of {{the city}} of San Diego) near the Mexico–U.S. border to near Del Mar. The {{southern}} terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses the cities of Chula Vista and National City before reentering San Diego. The freeway passes though the San Diego neighborhoods of North Park, Mission Valley, Clairemont, and University City before terminating at I-5 in the Sorrento Valley neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.|$|E
5|$|NY31F {{originally}} ran <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Fairport, turning north at NY250 {{and sharing}} Main Street with NY250 {{on a short}} concurrency between Church Street and High Street. NY31F turned east at High Street and followed it to Turk Hill Road, where NY31F continued east on its current alignment. The route was realigned onto its current alignment through Fairport on April1, 1984, {{as a result of}} a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and the village of Fairport. In the swap, ownership and maintenance of High Street was transferred from the state to Fairport in exchange for control over the portion of East Church Street between NY250 and Turk Hill Road.|$|E
5|$|NY410 {{begins at}} a rural {{intersection}} with NY26 {{in the town}} of Denmark. The two-lane route heads eastward from the junction, winding to the north and south across open, rolling terrain with several cultivated fields. After , the highway meets County Route19 (CR19, named East Road) and turns to the northeast toward the village of Castorland. The open fields gradually give way to homes as NY410 enters the village limits as Main Street. The route passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the village, serving four lightly developed residential blocks before crossing the Mohawk, Adirondack and Northern Railroad at the northeastern edge of the community. At the rail crossing, the highway passes south of what was once the New York Central Railroad's Castorland passenger station.|$|E
