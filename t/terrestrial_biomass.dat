40|$|Why is {{this issue}} important? Calculating Net Primary Production (NPP) {{is the first}} step in {{quantifying}} the amount of carbon plants fix from the atmosphere and accumulate as biomass. NPP is an important component of the global carbon cycle, but it is also useful in estimating environmental change, such as desertification, deforestation, and disturbances such as fire and insect outbreaks; assessing the impacts of pollution and climate change; and evaluating the status of ecosystems and their services, including habitat and wildlife condition and the size of ecological footprints. NPP is also a very useful measure to inform land management decisions and to estimate renewable natural resources. What are the findings and implications? In a paper published on 20 August 2010 in Science, researchers report that contrary to expectations, <b>terrestrial</b> <b>biomass</b> production has declined over the last decade (2000 - 2009) (Zhao and Running 2010).

40|$|Abstract. Lagoons are {{ecosystems}} where freshwater {{and marine}} organisms converge together with lagoonal specialists {{to form a}} mixed community that may vary spatially along a salinity gradient. Many organisms can only survive within relatively narrow bands of salinity. As a result of marine and freshwater inflows, together with exposure to variable salinity levels, dead marine and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>biomass</b> is accumulated in lagoons where it enters the detritic pathway. This study examined the in situ decomposition of marine (Fucus vesiculosus) and terrestrial (Alder glutinosa) biomass in Cuskinny Lagoon, South West Ireland. F. vesiculosus decayed rapidly and uniformly across the lagoon. A. glutinosa biomass loss varied throughout the lagoon, with the greatest loss occurring near the freshwater inflow. Thus, the spatial pattern of A. glutinosa decomposition {{differs from that of}} F. vesiculosus decomposition. Invertebrate abundances were not related to the amount of biomass loss of the marine and terrestrial material.

40|$|In {{the global}} carbon cycle, <b>terrestrial</b> <b>biomass</b> plays an {{important}} role in both as a sink and source. To evaluate biomass variation due to various natural hazards, it is necessary to detect the location, extent and duration of vegetation disturbance at a large spatial scale with an efficient method. This study contributes to develop such a method, and only the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD 13 Q 1 enhanced vegetation index (EVI) products are used to generate a continuous vegetation damage index (CVDI) for detecting severe vegetation disturbance in large areas. To verify the performance of this new index, this study takes the identification of the vegetation damage due to the Wenchuan earthquake in China occurred on 12 May 2008 as a case study. This study calculates the CVDI for the earthquake stricken areas, and delineates the regions with considerable EVI abnormal variation. The study result reveals that those delineated regions with severe vegetation damage are normally consistent with the areas with the landslides caused by the earthquake. Moreover, according to the changes of other vegetation-related MODIS datasets since 12 May 2008, this study discloses that the EVI value in most of the areas, where the vegetation was damaged due to the earthquake, has not reached to the normal value in 2012, which is 4 years after the earthquake. Finally, to validate the vegetation damage areas determined by CVDI method, the high resolution images and field survey information are used.

Here, we quantify species-specific spatiotemporal variability in <b>terrestrial</b> aboveground <b>biomass</b> stem growth across Canada’s boreal forests from 1950 to the present. We use 873 newly developed tree-ring chronologies from Canada’s National Forest Inventory, representing an unprecedented degree of sampling standardization for a large-scale dendrochronological study. We find significant regional- and species-related trends in growth, but the positive and negative trends compensate each other to yield no strong overall trend in forest growth when averaged across the Canadian boreal forest. The spatial patterns of growth trends identified in our analysis were to some extent coherent with trends estimated by remote sensing, but there are wide areas where remote-sensing information did not match the forest growth trends. Quantifications of tree growth variability as a function of climate factors and atmospheric CO 2 concentration reveal strong negative temperature and positive moisture controls on spatial patterns of tree growth rates, emphasizing the ecological sensitivity to regime shifts in the hydrological cycle. An enhanced dependence of forest growth on soil moisture during the late- 20 th century coincides with a rapid rise in summer temperatures and occurs despite potential compensating effects from increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration...|$|R
