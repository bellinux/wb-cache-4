He {{has a good}} many reminiscences and imitations of Tibullus, Propertius and Ovid (iii. 5, 15-20, and Ovid, Ars. am. ii. 669 seq.; Tr. iv. 10, 6: and Am. xi. 14, 23 seq.); {{and they are not}} always happy.

The writer takes a melancholy tone, telling the young man to remember the writer not because of the strength of the sonnets, but because <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> has been shown to the young man far surpasses any love shown by another poet.|$|E

25|$|Secular Franciscans should {{consider}} {{their own family}} {{to be the first}} place in which to live their Christian commitment and Franciscan vocation. They should make space within it for prayer, for the Word of God, and for Christian catechesis. They should concern themselves with respect for all life in every situation from conception until death. Married couples find in the Rule of the OFS an effective aid in their own journey of Christian life, aware that in the sacrament of matrimony their love shares in <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> Christ has for his Church. The beauty and the strength of the human love of the spouses is a profound witness for their own family, the Church, and the world.|$|E
25|$|Love, a theme {{throughout}} the Divine Comedy, {{is particularly important}} for the framing of sin on the Mountain of Purgatory. While <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> flows from God is pure, it can become sinful as it flows through humanity. Humans can sin by using love towards improper or malicious ends (Wrath, Envy, Pride), or using it to proper ends but with love that is either not strong enough (Sloth) or love that is too strong (Lust, Gluttony, Greed). Below the seven purges of the soul is the Ante-Purgatory, containing the Excommunicated from {{the church and the}} Late repentant who died, often violently, before receiving rites. Thus the total comes to nine, with the addition of the Garden of Eden at the summit, equaling ten.|$|E

Author Eunice Rojas cites this {{as an example of}} the group using [...] "the power of music to advance social causes." [...] The song [...] "Suelta Los Amarres" [...] from Ideas Nuevas discourages listeners from using violence to advance a political cause. However, the lyrics on La Dulzura place more emphasis on interpersonal relationships and love. Silva notes that the group refrains from writing [...] "romantic" [...] lyrics, noting that [...] "romanticism has a connotation of suffering for love.

500|$|... "Missing You" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by British-Irish girl group The Saturdays, taken from their first EP, Headlines!. Written by Alexander Kronlund and Lukas Hilbert with production from Hilbert and James Reynolds, the song was released as the collection's lead single on 8 August 2010 as a digital download and on 9 August as a CD single. The lyrics centre on being in a relationship where the passion has died, but still being addicted to <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> used to exist. It features an electropop production, incorporating elements of synthpop. The group described the song as [...] "an updated version of their sound" [...] and was fun to record and experiment with.

500|$|For Hazlitt, {{the essence}} of Romeo and Juliet is Shakespeare's {{portrayal}} of <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> comes with [...] "the ripening of the youthful blood"; and with that love {{the imagination of the}} youthful lovers is stirred to dwell not so much on present pleasure but [...] "on all the pleasures they had not experienced. All that was to come of life was theirs. [...] Their hopes were of air, their desires of fire." [...] In many beautiful poetic passages, [...] "the feelings of youth and of the spring are [...] blended together like the breath of opening flowers." [...] Assessing the character of the play as a whole, he states: [...] "This play presents a beautiful coup-d'oeil of the progress of human life.

Although it had support from old republicans, it was put aside due to a precondition from Princess Isabel that this could only be permitted if the banishment of her family was also rescinded. The dedication of a statue of the Emperor in Petrópolis on 5 February 1911 was attended by more than 1,500 people, including members of the federal government. Several statues of the monarch were erected throughout the country during the following years.

However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
500|$|According to Latin American {{literature}} scholar Richard Callan, {{the dichotomy}} between destruction and fertility is {{embodied in the}} opposition between the President and Miguel Angel Face. While the President represents sterility and destruction, his favorite, Miguel Angel Face, embodies fertility, a positive and generative force of nature. Callan notes that Miguel Angel Face's transformation from the President's favorite to a positive generative force is not deliberate. Instead, Callan argues that [...] "it results from the birth of true love in his formerly barren heart. However, he is too engrossed in his love to notice the shift in {{his relationship with the}} President." [...] The President, not surprisingly, identifies himself candidly with death. Examples from the novel include the death sentences he gives to Abel Carvajal (for a crime the President is fully aware the man did not commit) and to Lucio Vasquez, a man in his service that carried out his wish for the Zany to be killed and yet is still executed. In contrast to the President, Callan highlights Miguel Angel Face's association with love. <b>The</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> Miguel Angel Face develops for Camila identifies him with love and life, and leads to procreationthe birth of his son. Rosello argues that even before his transformation, Miguel Angel Face was aware of the President's destructive nature. As such, Rosello argues that Miguel Angel Face [...] "knew from the beginning that the only 'safety' in the President's world is a form of self destruction: only by losing his identity and letting the President's mind invade his own could he hope to remain alive". So, when he failed to comply, he did indeed lose his life.|$|E

500|$|The {{years from}} 1801 to 1804 are {{something}} of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located {{in the area where}} the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that [...] "having written so much {{on one side of the}} question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had [...] "had a very high ideal of <b>the</b> <b>love</b> <b>that</b> should unite a husband and wife... All of her heroines... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love". A possible autobiographical element in Sense and Sensibility occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that [...] "the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life" [...] with an unsuitable man.|$|E
