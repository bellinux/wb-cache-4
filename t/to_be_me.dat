The play was {{published}} by Larkin's usual publishers, Faber and Faber. Set in the three decades after Larkin's arrival in Hull, it explores his long relationships with Monica Jones, Maeve Brennan and Betty Mackereth. Another Larkin inspired entertainment, devised and starring Sir Tom Courtenay, was given a pre-production performance {{on the afternoon of}} Saturday 29 June 2002 at Hull University's Middleton Hall. Courtenay performed his one-man play Pretending <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Me</b> as part of the Second Hull International Conference on the Work of Philip Larkin. In November that year, Courtenay debuted the play at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, later transferring the production to the Comedy Theatre in London's West End.|$|E

This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.|$|E

25|$|Press reports at {{the time}} claimed that a ferocious fight erupted over Williams' successor. Williams' {{resignation}} came just 15 days before the Teamster convention, at which a successor {{would have to be}} elected. In addition to Presser, other candidates for the presidency were reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>M.E.</b> (Andy) Anderson, president of the statewide Teamsters organization in California; Joseph Morgan, president of the Teamsters in Florida; Don Peters, president of the large Teamsters local in Chicago; and Ray Schoessling, secretary-treasurer of the international Teamsters union and a Williams appointee. The press reported that Presser had formed an alliance with Anderson, which gave him enough votes to win the presidency.|$|E
500|$|An audio {{recording}} of the play, {{which is based on}} Larkin's letters, interviews, diaries and verse, was released in 2005. [...] In June 2010, Courtenay returned to the University of Hull to give a performance of a newly revised version of Pretending <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Me</b> called Larkin Revisited in aid of the Larkin statue appeal as part of the Larkin 25 festival.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1910, at a {{time when}} Romanian art came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>me</b> more {{familiar}} with new artistic trends (including Cubism and Fauvism, both advocated locally by art critic Theodor Cornel), Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești adapted his discourse to the new trends. The art patron, who probably exercised considerable influence over Cornel, publicly complained that, instead of keeping up with the times, his fellow Romanian intellectuals still regarded Impressionism as the ultimate novelty. On the occasion, he hailed the Post-Impressionist French artists Paul Gauguin and Paul Cézanne as the models to follow. He was actively seeking to mend his split with Luchian, and, although he called the painter [...] "inconsistent", again stated that he found him to be Romania's best young artist.|$|E

500|$|The song's lyrics {{allude to}} his {{supposed}} relationship with Mariah Carey, the music video for [...] "Obsessed", and pictures and proof {{he claims to}} have of the couple.

Now I'm pissed off," [...] before describing Carey's impersonation of him in her video, [...] "Oh gee, is that supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>me</b> in the video with the goatee?/ Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out." [...] Eminem continues describing a near-sexual encounter with the singer, threatening to release voice-mails and pictures he still has in his possession.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the same publication, Ne-Yo explained how he wrote the lyrics, [...] "I'm listening to the track, and all I can see is Rihanna and some random person sitting across from each other at the table with a gun sitting {{in the middle of the}} table and playing Russian roulette." [...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>me.</b> That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us."

[...] "In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something", she remarked, [...] "but a friend pointed {{out that it was}} a pun in English – 'a ruler' – which is funny because he is a politician. And my mum always used to say about my father, 'He was so useless, all he ever gave you was his name'. So I turned it around and turned that something into nothing. And at the same time I {{thought it would be a}} good way to find him. If he really was an egomaniac, he'd be looking himself up and he'd get this pop album stealing his name that would turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>me,</b> and he'd have to get in touch", a prediction which ultimately came true.) ...|$|E
500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] {{was written}} by Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with {{featured}} artist Wale. The song interpolates a song called [...] "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Me.</b> I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011.

500|$|In 1999, {{as part of}} a new storyline, Sable was {{attacked}} by a masked woman named Spider Lady, {{who turned out to be}} Luna. Sable defeated Luna in a Strap match at the Royal Rumble after an assist from a planted female Sable fan, WWF newcomer Tori. Tori's debut signified a change in Sable's persona. After the Rumble, Rena (under her Sable ring name) was featured as the cover girl for the April 1999 issue of Playboy. The issue was one of the highest selling issues of Playboy ever. Surrounding the release of the issue, the Sable character turned heel by [...] "going Hollywood" [...] and having an inflated ego. Rarely defending her title, Sable continually berated her fan Tori, and she feuded with both Tori and Luna Vachon (who had turned face). She debuted a new catchphrase: [...] "This is for all the women who want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>me</b> and all the men who come to see me" [...] and a dance move called [...] "the grind."

I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>me</b> not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started.

500|$|After Carey premiered [...] "Obsessed" [...] on June 16, 2009, {{the media}} frenzied and began speculating {{the song was}} {{targeting}} at Eminem, due to its lyrics and overall message. Following the song's accompanying music video, which featured Carey playing a role that resembled the rapper, critics considered it Carey's response to Eminem's [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". Soon after both the song and video's release, the rapper released another song, titled [...] "The Warning" [...] on July 30, 2009, which he {{claimed to be a}} retaliation.

According to Mathieson [...] "the band were {{starting}} to bristle at the extent of Kosky's involvement {{in every aspect of}} their stalled career." [...] Kosky felt he was a scapegoat for problems with the second album including its poorer commercial performance: [...] "Everyone was looking for a fall guy. It happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>me</b> and I left gracefully. I put my life into it for five years and I gambled a lot. Like any relationship, you find a time when you move on."

2500|$|The concept [...] "sanction of the victim" [...] {{is defined}} by Leonard Peikoff as [...] "the {{willingness}} of the good to suffer {{at the hands of}} the evil, to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the 'sin' of creating values". Accordingly, throughout Atlas Shrugged, numerous characters are frustrated by this sanction, as when Hank Rearden appears duty-bound to support his family, despite their hostility toward him; later, the principle is stated by Dan Conway: [...] "I suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed. If it turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>me,</b> I have no right to complain". John Galt further explains the principle: [...] "Evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us", and, [...] "I saw that evil was impotent... and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1980 {{fan club}} interview, Holder {{spoke of the}} album.

With Return to Base we were really pleased with the album, we thought that it turned out really well, but it didn't sell. Everyone around the band was saying to us that we weren't coming up with as good songs as we used to, but me and Jim knew that we were, we knew that we were coming up with strong songs. Some of the songs on Return to Base we thought were some of the best songs that we'd ever written. There only seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>me</b> and Jim that had confidence in the songs; people like Chas, Dave and Don said that they didn't think our songs were as strong, some of them they did but some of them they didn't. But we ourselves thought that they were. Thus it was a case of getting the album down; and in our minds it turned out to be a great album." ...|$|E
