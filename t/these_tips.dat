40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} can trigger irreversible regime {{shifts in the}} climate system, known as tipping points. Multiple tipping points affect each other's probability of occurrence, potentially causing a 'domino effect'. We analyse climate policy {{in the presence of}} a potential domino effect. We incorporate three different tipping points occurring at unknown thresholds into an integrated climate-economy model. The optimal emission policy considers all possible thresholds and the resulting interactions between tipping points, economic activity, and policy responses into the indefinite future. We quantify the cost of delaying optimal emission controls in the presence of uncertain tipping points and also the benefit of detecting when individual tipping points have been triggered. We show that the presence of <b>these</b> <b>tipping</b> points nearly doubles today's optimal carbon tax and reduces peak warming along the optimal path by approximately 1 degrees C. The presence of <b>these</b> <b>tipping</b> points increases the cost of delaying optimal policy until mid-century by nearly 150 %...|$|R

5|$|Davies's Merthyr {{constituency}} {{included the}} mining village of Aberfan, situated {{a few miles}} south of Merthyr Tydfil. On the mountainsides above the village, colliery waste had been dumped {{over the years to}} form large spoil tips. Shortly after 9:00 am on Friday 21 October 1966 one of <b>these</b> <b>tips</b> collapsed, sending thousands of tons of semi-liquid waste hurtling towards Aberfan. The point of impact was Pantglas Junior School, where morning lessons were beginning. The school was half buried; inside, 109 children and 5 teachers were killed. A further 7 children and 23 adults lost their lives outside the school, in the streets or adjoining houses. In the immediate aftermath, Davies visited and consoled the bereaved families in Aberfan, and the following day he led a party which included the Duke of Edinburgh {{on a tour of the}} disaster site.|$|E
40|$|Based on the broaden-and-build {{theory of}} {{positive}} emotions, researchers discovered tipping points predicting whether individuals were flourishing, languishing, or depressed in life. <b>These</b> <b>tipping</b> points {{were based on}} a positivity ratio, calculated as the proportion of one’s experienced positive and negative emotions. Individuals who were flourishing reported positivity ratios greater than 2. 9, while languishing individuals reported scores at or below 2. 9. Those who reported a ratio below 1. 0 had clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms, and thus were classified as depressed. Studies have examined the utility of the positivity ratio, and findings supported <b>these</b> <b>tipping</b> points as related to a number of health indicators such as job performance, marital satisfaction, coping, and depression. The present study surveyed a sample of postdoctoral research fellows (n = 200) to determine if the classifications of positivity (viz., flourishing, languishing, and depressed) distinguished differences in reported stress, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms. MANOVA results provided further support for the utility and generalizability of the positivity ratio, as the data revealed significant differences in stress, trait anxiety, and depressive symptoms among flourishing, languishing, and depressed postdocs. Flourishing postdocs demonstrated the lowest mean scores, while depressed postdocs recorded the highest...|$|R

5|$|The {{vegetative}} stage encompasses those {{phases of}} the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As <b>these</b> <b>tips</b> expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope {{can remove}} SAM molecules in many different ways. The first is to remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This {{is not the most}} desired technique as <b>these</b> <b>tips</b> are expensive and dragging them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second way is to degrade or desorb the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. The {{scanning tunneling microscope}} can also remove SAMs by field desorption and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Dip-pen {{nanolithography}} is {{a process}} that uses an atomic force microscope to transfer molecules on the tip to a substrate. Initially the tip is dipped into a reservoir with an ink. The ink on the tip evaporates and leaves the desired molecules attached to the tip. When the tip is brought into contact with the surface a water meniscus forms between the tip and the surface resulting in the diffusion of molecules from the tip to the surface. <b>These</b> <b>tips</b> can have radii in the tens of nanometers, and thus SAM molecules can be very precisely deposited onto a specific location of the surface. This process was discovered by Chad Mirkin and co-workers at Northwestern University.|$|E
40|$|Many {{different}} types of fiber tips have been developed {{over the last few}} years to be used in endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) procedures. All these new but different tips claim a certain superiority over the other tips. Evidence for a best tip is however lacking. Four of <b>these</b> fiber <b>tips</b> have been compared in this article: (1) the bare fiber, (2) the Tulip-Tip, (3) the NeverTouch™ tip, and (4) the radially emitting tip. The aim of this paper is to provide information on the technical differences between <b>these</b> fiber <b>tips</b> and differences in their underlying heat transfer mechanisms. Although all tips are effective in the primary goal of EVLA, namely to occlude the incompetent vein, they differ in side effects, they differ in side effects, practicality, and cost. Although <b>these</b> new <b>tips</b> have improved EVLA, the perfect tip is not on the market yet...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} toward a unique lift-generated noise reduction apparatus. This apparatus includes a plurality of tip fences that are secured to the trailing and leading assemblies of the high-lift system, {{as close as possible}} to the discontinuities where the vortices are most likely to form. In one embodiment, <b>these</b> <b>tip</b> fences are secured to some or all of the outboard and inboard tips of the wing slats and flaps. The tip fence includes a generally flat, or an aerodynamically shaped plate or device that could be formed of almost any rigid material, such as metal, wood, plastic, fiber glass, aluminum, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the tip fences extend below and perpendicularly to flaps and the slats to which they are attached, such that <b>these</b> <b>tip</b> fences are aligned with the nominal free stream velocity of the aircraft. In addition to reducing airframe noise, the tip fence tends to decrease drag and to increase lift, thus improving the overall aerodynamic performance of the aircraft. Another advantage presented by the tip fence lies in the simplicity of its design, its elegance, and its ready ability to fit on the wing components, such as the flaps and the slats. Furthermore, it does not require non-standard materials or fabrication techniques, and it can be readily, easily and inexpensively retrofited on most of the existing aircraft, with minimal design changes...|$|R
60|$|The hackles do {{not differ}} much in the various breeds, but are short and stiff in Malays, and absent in Hennies. As in some orders male birds display extraordinarily-shaped feathers, such as naked shafts with discs at the end, etc., the {{following}} case may be worth giving. In the wild Gallus bankiva and in our domestic fowls, the barbs which arise from {{each side of the}} extremities of the hackles are naked or not clothed with barbules, so that they resemble bristles; but Mr. Brent sent me some scapular hackles from a young Birchen Duckwing Game cock, in which the naked barbs became densely re-clothed with barbules towards their tips; so that <b>these</b> <b>tips,</b> which were dark coloured with a metallic lustre, were separated from the lower parts by a symmetrically-shaped transparent zone formed of the naked portions of the barbs. Hence the coloured tips appeared like little separate metallic discs.|$|E

50|$|At this point, one may ask {{how such}} a wiggle of a hair bundle {{triggers}} a difference in membrane potential. The current model is that cilia are attached to one another by “tip links”, structures which link the tips of one cilium to another. Stretching and compressing, the tip links may open an ion channel and produce the receptor potential in the hair cell. Recently {{it has been shown}} that Cadherin-23 CDH23 and Protocadherin-15 PCDH15 are the adhesion molecules associated with <b>these</b> <b>tip</b> links. It is thought that a calcium driven motor causes a shortening of these links to regenerate tensions. This regeneration of tension allows for apprehension of prolonged auditory stimulation.|$|R

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{images of}} graphene and graphite show contrast with atomic periodicity. However, the contrast patterns {{vary depending on}} the atomic termination of the AFM tip apex and the tip–sample distance, hampering the identification of the atomic positions. Here, we report quantitative AFM imaging of epitaxial graphene using inert (carbon-monoxide-terminated) and reactive (iridium-terminated) tips. The atomic image contrast is markedly different with <b>these</b> <b>tip</b> terminations. With a reactive tip, we observe an inversion from attractive to repulsive atomic contrast with decreasing tip–sample distance, while a nonreactive tip only yields repulsive atomic contrast. We are able to identify the atoms with both tips at any tip–sample distance. This is a prerequisite for future structural and chemical analysis of adatoms, defects, and the edges of graphene nanostructures, crucial for understanding nanoscale graphene devices...|$|R
