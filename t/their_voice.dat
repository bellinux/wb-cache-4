5|$|Chetham's educates choristers {{from the}} cathedral who follow a similar {{curriculum}} {{to other students}} and study an instrument. However, they do not apply in an audition. When a chorister reaches Year 8 (age 12 or 13), or <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> breaks, they can apply to join Chetham's via the usual audition process.|$|E
5|$|Bryars {{chose to}} {{distinguish}} the character types through the vocal ranges they were given. The adults of the town are largely given deep voices, bass and bass-baritone for the men, contralto and mezzo-soprano for the women. The lovers have high voices, soprano and counter-tenor. In {{order to make the}} scientists sound unlike the townspeople, Bryars made Ox a tenor and Ygène a baritone, both parts being agile, lyric and relatively high in <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> range.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 tour of She Has a Name was {{a fringe}} theatre tour across Canada. The {{performances}} were co-produced by Burnt Thicket Theatre and Raise <b>Their</b> <b>Voice</b> and were directed by Waldschmidt. Carl Kennedy portrayed Jason, Evelyn Chew portrayed Number 18, Alysa van Haastert portrayed Ali, and Warkentin and Howell-Holden returned as Marta and Mama. To avoid {{giving the impression}} that human trafficking is limited to Asia, the producers deliberately cast actors who were not of Asian descent.|$|E
5000|$|People {{understand}} why singers have to train {{to develop the}} breath and range of the voice. An actor has to develop <b>their</b> own <b>voice,</b> <b>their</b> personal <b>voice,</b> <b>their</b> individual <b>voice.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{second season}} of episodic video games {{developed}} by Telltale Games {{was announced in}} July 2007. Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space followed the same overall format as Save the World, with each episode having a contained storyline with an overarching storyline involving laundering of {{the souls of the}} dead. As with Save the World, episodes were originally published on GameTap before being made available for general release. The season consisted of five episodes and ran from November 2007 to April 2008. Nowlin and Kasten both returned to reprise <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> roles. In addition to the main games, a twenty-minute machinima video was produced, taking the form of a Sam & Max Christmas special.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{video games}} {{based on the}} film, one from 1985 for Commodore 64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC by CRL Group PLC based on the music by Vangelis (due to {{licensing}} issues), and another action adventure PC game from 1997 by Westwood Studios. The 1997 video game featured new characters and branching storylines based on the Blade Runner world. Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, and J.F. Sebastian appear, and <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> files are recorded by the original actors. The player assumes the role of McCoy, another replicant-hunter working {{at the same time}} as Deckard.|$|E
5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{factor that}} has to be {{controlled}} in order for the results to be reliable is the frequency of exposure. [...] If we take the example of celebrities, people are exposed to celebrities' faces more often than <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> because of the mass media. [...] Through magazines, newspapers and the Internet, individuals are exposed to celebrities' faces without <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> on an everyday basis rather than <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> without <b>their</b> faces. Thus, someone could argue that for all of the experiments that were done until now the findings were a result of the frequency of exposure to the faces of celebrities rather than <b>their</b> <b>voices.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Yelling: When people yell, raise <b>their</b> <b>voices,</b> or talk in a mean tone, they fuel {{their own}} anger. Many are unaware {{when they start}} to raise <b>their</b> <b>voices.</b> People should ask others to respond when the volume is rising and thank them.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{everyone}} who hears voices becomes a patient. Over {{a third of}} 400 voice hearers in the Netherlands they studied had not had any contact with psychiatric services. These people either described themselves as being {{able to cope with}} <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> and/or described <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> as life enhancing.|$|R
5|$|Japanese voice {{recording}} {{for the game}} began two years before its release in 2008. Several voice actors had worked on other tri-Ace titles in the past. Beyond merely being given directions for their performances, the actors were able {{to contribute to the}} characters' personalities. Many characters were revised based on suggestions given by <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> actors during recording. The cast enjoyed their experience, as the game gave them the opportunity for a large range of performances, from comedic to dramatic scenes. Overall, the production process for both actors and development staff was a positive one. The English {{voice recording}} began in August 2009 under the supervision of Sega. Recording took place at studios in Los Angeles, and was overseen by Shimano and Suguro. Speaking about his view of the three main actors, Shimano was impressed, praising DiCocco's range and expression for Leanne and noting Menville's performances as Zephyr required fewer retakes than other actors.|$|E
5|$|The males arrive {{first and}} remain in the {{location}} for several weeks while the females only stay long enough to mate and spawn. Rather than fighting {{for the right to}} mate with a female, male toads may settle disputes by means of the pitch of <b>their</b> <b>voice.</b> Croaking provides a reliable sign of body size and hence of prowess. Nevertheless, fights occur in some instances. In a study at one pond where males outnumbered females by four or five to one, it was found that 38% of the males won the right to mate by defeating rivals in combat or by displacing other males already mounted on females. Male toads generally outnumber female toads at breeding ponds. A Swedish study found that female mortality was higher than that of males and that 41% of females did not come to the breeding pond in the spring and missed a year before reproducing again.|$|E
5|$|The stage {{premiere of}} She Has a Name was {{directed}} by Waldschmidt, who was also the scenic designer. Aaron Krogman was selected to portray Jason and the unnamed pimp, Sienna Howell-Holden to portray Mama, Glenda Warkentin to portray Marta, Denise Wong to portray Number 18, and Cari Russell to portray Ali. Waldschmidt suggested that Warkentin audition for the play after seeing her perform at Rosebud Theatre in Rosebud, Alberta. Wong, Krogman, and Kooman spoke highly of Waldschmidt's directing, and Kooman praised Waldschmidt's work as scenic designer. Waldschmidt praised the cast's acting. He said he found the play's opening scene, in which a rape occurs, {{the most difficult to}} stage, despite having previously performed a similar rape scene as an actor. The premiere of She Has a Name was produced by Burnt Thicket Theatre in partnership with Raise <b>Their</b> <b>Voice.</b> The office of Joy Smith, MP for Kildonan—St. Paul, released a statement advertising the premiere of She Has a Name.|$|E
50|$|In {{some cases}} {{a few of}} Sierra's former {{employees}} such as Josh Mandel, Lori Ann Cole and Andy Hoyos became involved with the fan games, lending <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> to characters. In the case of King's Quest III Redux, several professional actors/actresses lent <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> {{to a couple of}} characters, including Robert Adamson.|$|R
50|$|The {{internet}} has expanded {{the power of}} the human rights movement by improving communication between activists in different physical locations. This is known as mediated mobilization. Individuals who are using <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> to communicate about the injustices are now able to communicate with like minded people who use <b>their</b> <b>voices</b> through participatory journalism.|$|R

5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E
5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (<b>their</b> <b>voice,</b> singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions, but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice very minor characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to be reflected in <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved along at a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E

25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend to sit back and let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for <b>their</b> <b>voice</b> to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
