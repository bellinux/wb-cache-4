5|$|The idea of {{creating}} a heritage streetcar system in Astoria, as part of efforts to redevelop and revitalize the riverfront area, had first been raised in 1980, long after {{the closure of the}} city's streetcar-transit system, which operated from 1892 to 1924. An attempt by city officials to acquire a <b>trolley</b> <b>car</b> in 1986 was dropped in the face of high insurance costs.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{building on}} the site was a <b>trolley</b> <b>car</b> barn for the Broadway Railroad's Broadway streetcar line, opened in 1859. The barn began serving buses in 1931, and was acquired by the city during unification in 1940. Construction on the current bus depot began in 1947. The depot was built {{on top of the}} subway tunnel roof of the IND Fulton Street Line, which had been built in the early 1940s. The depot opened on December 17, 1950. The trolley barn was replaced by the current depot on October 30, 1956, when Brooklyn streetcar service ended.|$|E
25|$|Trolley is an American word {{derived from}} the {{electric}} current pickup mechanism in early systems. The first successful electric streetcars in the United States used a system devised by Frank J. Sprague, in which a spring-loaded trolley pole pushed a small trolley wheel up against an overhead wire to collect electricity for the motors. Although not the first overhead collection system, it was far more reliable than its predecessors, and eventually became used by almost all streetcars. Some authorities believe that the vehicle became known as a <b>trolley</b> <b>car</b> because it reminded people (particularly on the West Coast) of a boat trolling for fish. Others believe it derived from a dialect word for a wheeled cart.|$|E
25|$|David J. Macpherson (b. 1854, Ontario, Canada), a civil {{engineer}} from Cornell University and a newcomer to Pasadena (1885), proposed a steam driven cog wheel train to reach the crest via Mount Wilson. It wasn't until he {{was introduced to the}} millionaire Thaddeus S. C. Lowe (arrived in Pasadena 1890) that a fully funded plan could be put into action. The two men visited Colorado to view the mountain railway to Pike's Peak. Lowe was impressed with the <b>trolley</b> <b>car</b> systems in the city and thought that should be the way to go. This would make the Mount Lowe Railway the only electric traction rail line ever to be put into scenic mountain railway service.|$|E

25|$|The tunnel {{was opened}} on September 24, 1907. While {{demonstration}} <b>trolley</b> <b>car</b> runs were conducted through the tunnels, Belmont {{did not have}} a franchise to operate a transit line. The concession to operate the tunnels had expired on January 1, 1907, and the city of New York was unwilling to renew the contract. The city did not tolerate privately operated subways and legally prevented the IRT from operating the tunnel with the trams. So for the next five years, the tunnels, with trolley loops on both the Manhattan and Queens sides, remained inoperative. Belmont sold the tunnels to the city in 1913 {{in the wake of the}} Dual Contracts, which included the Steinway Tunnel as part of the new Flushing subway line.|$|E
25|$|A {{trolley pole}} is a tapered {{cylindrical}} pole of wood or metal placed {{in contact with}} an overhead wire to provide electricity to the <b>trolley</b> <b>car.</b> The trolley pole sits atop a sprung base {{on the roof of}} the trolley vehicle, the springs maintaining the tension to keep the trolley wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. Occasionally, a Canadian named John Joseph Wright is credited with inventing the trolley pole when an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario, was built in 1883. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, there is no hard evidence to prove it. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent. Official credit for the invention of the electric trolley pole has gone to an American, Frank J. Sprague, who devised his working system in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888. Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this 12-mile system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888.|$|E

500|$|As older {{forms of}} {{transportation}} {{such as the}} canal boat disappeared, new forms arose. One of these, the electric trolley, began operation in Lock Haven in 1894. The Lock Haven Electric Railway, managed by the Lock Haven Traction Company and after 1900 by the Susquehanna Traction Company, ran passenger trolleys between Lock Haven and Mill Hall, about [...] to the west. The trolley line extended from the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad station in Lock Haven to a station of the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania, which served Mill Hall. The route went through Lock Haven's downtown, close to the Normal School, across town to the <b>trolley</b> <b>car</b> barn on the southwest edge of the city, through Flemington, over the Bald Eagle Canal and Bald Eagle Creek, and on to Mill Hall via what was then known as the Lock Haven, Bellefonte, and Nittany Valley Turnpike. Plans to extend the line from Mill Hall to Salona, [...] south of Mill Hall, and to Avis [...] northeast of Lock Haven, were never carried out, and the line remained unconnected to other trolley lines. The system, always financially marginal, declined after World War I. Losing business to automobiles and buses, it ceased operations around 1930.|$|E

2500|$|MTS {{began work}} in March 2011 {{on a study}} to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of reconnecting Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo and Downtown San Diego through a fixed-guideway, electrified streetcar line â€“ the final study on the subject was published in October 2012. The project study corridor runs between the City College Trolley Station area, and Balboa Park {{in the vicinity of}} the San Diego Zoo. An alignment similar to the proposed one was last served by a streetcar system in 1949 on lines 7 (Park Boulevard-University Avenue to East San Diego) & 11 (Park Boulevard-Adams Avenue to Kensington). The Committee evaluated what types of streetcars to use for this proposed line, the possible options including the recently ordered 57 Ultra Short 2011 S70s in the [...] "Modern Streetcar" [...] category, and the restored PCC Streetcars from the Downtown Silver Line in the [...] "Vintage Streetcar" [...] category. The major construction issue was how to cross I-5 without having to reconstruct the entire bridge.

No funding sources were identified. No further action on this proposal has taken place since the October 2012 release of the study.|$|E
