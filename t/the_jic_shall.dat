40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review and {{critique}} the current status of intellectual capital (IC) research as published in the Journal of Intellectual Capital (JIC) as it heads into its 15 th year with a view to understanding the past and possible direction of future IC research. Design/methodology/approach: Articles published in <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> are reviewed building on prior IC research and analysis by Guthrie et al. (2012) and Dumay and Garanina (2013). To help understand the impact of articles in <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> <b>the</b> analysis is supplemented by including citation data from google scholar, journal impact data from the SCImago Journal & Country Rank portal, and the 2013 Australian Business Dean's Council (ABDC) journal ranking list. Also included is commentary from <b>the</b> <b>JIC's</b> senior editors based on their responses to questions asked via e-mail relating to their involvement in, and the future of, <b>the</b> <b>JIC.</b> Findings: <b>The</b> <b>JIC</b> faces a challenge as it is most recognised as an accounting journal despite its focus on managing IC. The research published in <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> is multidisciplinary as it comes from a wide range of perspectives. However, there appears to be a paucity of research emanating from different perspectives, most notably from North American academics, and a lack of focus on the private and public sectors. However, new perspectives of IC, especially that associated with IC praxis and the third stage of IC research are emerging as transformational opportunities for future IC research, along with the opportunity to experiment with transdisciplinary research. Originality/value: The paper presents a comprehensive critical review of the articles published in <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> along with measuring the impact of the articles using citation data from google scholar. Using this approach, the type of research and its impacts can be simultaneously assessed to offer insights into future transformational IC research opportunities, and how IC researchers and <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> can also be transformational. 36 page(s...|$|R

40|$|PhDThis thesis {{analyses}} {{the contribution}} that the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIQ made to British policy concerning Germany (both West and East) {{during the early}} Cold War. The question of control over war-ravaged, but strategically significant Germany was critical {{to the security of}} Europe. As such, Germany and Berlin in particular, became the most important Cold War battleground in Europe. By combining recently released JIC archives with both existing research on intelligence, foreign and defence policy and records from the other government departments, this research adds to the understanding of one of the central themes of the Cold War. It reveals how ministers, senior officials and military officers made use of the assessmentps roduced by <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> in formulating their policies towards Germany and the developing threat from the Soviet Union and its allies. This research takes a chronological approach, in order to trace both the development of policy and of the role of <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> within central government. It explores the major crises of the period: the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948, the riots in East Berlin of June 1953 and the 1958 - 61 Berlin Crisis. Away from these crises, the thesis examines the picture that <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> painted of Soviet intentions and capabilities in Eastern Germany and of the development of the two German nations. It also looks at <b>the</b> <b>JIC's</b> contribution to British attitudes towards German rearmament. The developing role of the intelligence apparatus, both within central government and in Germany is a major theme running through the thesis. By improving its sources, its product and its administration,, <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> ensured that it became an essential tool for successive governments, and within Whitehall, became the interface between intelligence and policy...|$|R

40|$|Extruded Mg-Al-Zn alloy is a {{lightweight}} and high strength magnesium alloy that {{is becoming a}} preferred material {{to be used as}} a structural component in automobiles. During a crash event, an automobile structure is subjected to dynamic loading. The magnesium alloy structures must be able to maintain its integrity and provide adequate protection in survivable crashes. Besides static tensile properties, tensile properties at high strain rates of extruded magnesium alloys and their fracture behaviour are some of the important parameters to be considered in design in ensuring the durability and reliability of automobile structures. In this study, the effect of strain rates on tensile properties and work hardening behaviour were evaluated for extruded Mg-Al-Zn alloys. Further, the fracture behaviour at different loading rates and the effect of temperature on fracture toughness of Mg-Al-Zn alloys were investigated. The extruded Mg-Al-Zn alloys used in this study were AZ 61 and AZ 31 magnesium alloys. Tensile tests under low and high strain rates were carried out using a universal testing machine and high strain rate tensile tester, respectively. The high strain rate tensile tester was designed and fabricated in-house to fulfil the requirement of tensile test under high strain rate ranging from 100 to 600 s- 1. Work hardening behaviour for low strain rate tensile specimen was determined by referring to the ASTM E 646. To obtain the fracture behaviour of both alloys at different loading rates, three-point bending fracture test was conducted on pre-cracked specimens. Standard test methods i. e. ASTM E 1820 and JSME S 001 were referred to determine the elastic-plastic fracture toughness JIC value of AZ 31 and AZ 61 alloys. <b>The</b> <b>JIC</b> value obtained were then used as a standard reference value to identify a proper groove depth of a single side-grooved specimen. The side-groove depths evaluated were 25 %, 35 % and 50 %. The proper depth of the side-grooves is confirmed after the J value obtained from the side-grooved specimen test method is identical to <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> value that of the standard test method. The side-grooved specimen with proper groove depth was then used to determine <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> value of AZ 61 alloy at high temperature. From the results, the tensile strengths were gradually increased with increasing strain rates. However, at above 200 s- 1, the tensile strength increased significantly to more than 600 to 800 MPa. In addition, the work hardening rate for AZ 61 was found higher compared to that of AZ 31. Both alloys exhibited significant elastic-plastic fracture behaviour at different loading rates. It was found that 50 % side-grooves depth is appropriate enough to produce valid JIC value using a single specimen. This finding is very useful especially in determining JIC value in a condition where standard multiple specimen test method is difficult to be conducted such as in high temperature environment. <b>The</b> <b>JIC</b> values of AZ 31 and AZ 61 at room temperature were 19 and 25 kJ/m 2, respectively. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> value of AZ 61 at 150 °C was found twice higher than <b>the</b> <b>JIC</b> value at room temperature...|$|R
