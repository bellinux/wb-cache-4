5|$|In February 2000, the Turnpike Authority {{gave in to}} {{the orders}} from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to have Route 92 undergo an {{environmental}} impact study, which could go up to two years, to help see if they should award the contract for construction. Opponents of the Route 92 project hailed this decision for {{the thought that the}} environmental impact statement (EIS) would back up their beliefs. Four months later, the Army Corps of Engineers held a meeting to decide what to take into account for the impact statement and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing <b>that</b> <b>Route</b> 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 <b>that</b> <b>Route</b> 92 was to handle. In December 2003, the Army Corps of Engineers approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E
5|$|NY30 was {{assigned}} in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York {{to most of}} its modern routing south of Wells, replacing a series of designations that {{had been assigned to}} the highway in the 1920s.

5|$|NY36 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s to an alignment extending from Hornell {{in the south}} to Avon in the north. The route utilized the routing of legislative Route15 from Hornell to Dansville and from Mount Morris to Shakers Crossing, the modern junction of NY63 and NY408 northeast of Mount Morris. Between Dansville and Mount Morris, NY36 followed its current alignment. Past Shakers Crossing, NY36 continued northward through Geneseo to Avon on modern NY63 and NY39. The Geneseo–Avon segment of NY36 became part of US20 when <b>that</b> <b>route</b> {{was assigned}} in 1927. South of Hornell, what is now NY36 from Hornell to Jasper became part of NY17 when <b>that</b> <b>route</b> was assigned to most of legislative Route4 in 1924. The remaining sections of contemporary NY36—from Jasper to the Pennsylvania state line and north of Mount Morris—were state-maintained but unnumbered.|$|E
5|$|State Route 247 (SR 247) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California in San Bernardino County.

5|$|The freeway turns east {{again and}} enters Union Township, {{coming to an}} {{interchange}} with CR 614 and Route 173. From here, I-78/US 22 continue east directly {{to the south of}} Route 173, coming to another interchange with <b>that</b> <b>route</b> as well as CR 625. Entering more commercial areas, Route 173 merges onto I-78/US 22 at exit 13. At exit 15, the highway meets an interchange with CR 513, and Route 173 splits from I-78/US 22 by heading north on CR 513. At this point, the freeway runs along the border of Franklin Township to the south and Clinton to the north before entirely entering Clinton and crossing the South Branch Raritan River. I-78/US 22 turns northeast and leaves Clinton for Clinton Township, where it has an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for Route 173 that also provides access to Route 31. Immediately after is the interchange with Route 31. At the next interchange near the community of Annandale, US 22 splits from I-78, heading closely to the south of <b>that</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

5|$|When Iowan began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Eastbound {{shipments}} were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. With {{the opening of}} the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking <b>that</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known to use <b>that</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{occupation}} of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access {{coupled with the}} fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking <b>that</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

5|$|After this intersection, Old Baltimore Pike {{continues}} past suburban neighborhoods, {{gaining a}} center left-turn lane and intersecting Salem Church Road. Farther east, the highway reaches a junction with DE 273 in a wooded area. At this point, the road narrows to two lanes again and {{heads into the}} community of Christiana. Here, the highway intersects DE 7, where it turns north and follows <b>that</b> <b>route</b> through residential areas. The road comes to an interchange with DE 1 {{to the west of}} the Christiana Mall, where DE 7 continues north along with DE 1 and Old Baltimore Pike reaches a dead end.|$|E
5|$|Following the interchange, US30 enters Waterford Township, as {{it passes}} near the {{community}} of Atco. The road turns south {{as it passes}} Atco Lake and continues into more wooded areas with some development, eventually heading south-southeast again. New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line runs a short distance to the northeast of the route at this point. US30 continues through Chesilhurst before it enters Winslow Township. Here, the route intersects CR536 and forms a short concurrency with <b>that</b> <b>route</b> before it heads to the east. From this point, the road continues into a mix of woodland, farmland, and development. US30 intersects Route143 and passes over the Atlantic City Line as it turns southeast. The road makes another turn to the south as it crosses CR723.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, White Star {{refitted}} Suevic, {{adding the}} capacity for 266 second-class passengers, after which {{she returned to her}} Australian route. In March 1924, she completed her 50th voyage on <b>that</b> <b>route.</b> In 1928, though, Suevic was showing her age, and White Star sold her to Yngvar Hvistendahl's Finnhval A/S for £35,000, who renamed her Skytteren and sent her to Germaniawerft at Kiel to be converted into a whaling factory ship. She served with the Norwegian whaling fleets in Antarctic waters. 1936 AS Finnhval came under control of the Norwegian shipping agent Jørgen Krag who handled on behalf of the German Margarine Union. So until the war her hunting results were delivered to Germany.|$|E
5|$|From here, {{the route}} becomes a two-lane {{undivided}} road that continues northeast through {{a mix of}} woods and farms with some development, passing under the abandoned Lackawanna Cut-Off. After passing through the community of Hainesburg, the road turns more {{to the east and}} enters Blairstown Township. Route 94 turns northeast before reaching the community of Blairstown, where the road continues east past some development before intersecting CR 521. It forms a short wrong-way concurrency with <b>that</b> <b>route,</b> along which it crosses the Paulins Kill. A short distance later, Route 94 enters Frelinghuysen Township, passing through more rural surroundings. The road turns northeast through the community of Marksboro before heading east again. After the intersection with CR 661, Route 94 makes a sharp turn to the north-northeast.|$|E
5|$|From this point, {{the route}} {{continues}} east through dense woods prior to turning northeast into Liberty Township. The road {{passes through the}} community of Townsbury before crossing into Independence Township. Here, US 46 enters more agricultural areas and turns east again, with development increasing along the road as it passes through Great Meadows-Vienna. It continues southeast before entering Hackettstown, where the road becomes Main Street. In Hackettstown, the route crosses New Jersey Transit’s Morristown Line and Montclair-Boonton Line before coming to an intersection with CR 517. Here, CR 517 forms a concurrency with US 46, and the two routes continue southeast through the downtown area. At the intersection with the northern terminus of Route 182, CR 517 splits from US 46 by heading south on <b>that</b> <b>route</b> while US 46 continues to the east.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, {{this version}} of M-64 was renumbered M-9. In 1934, M-9 {{traveled}} on Pioneer Road in Hillsdale County, from the Ohio border before turning west on Burt Road, north on Clark Road, west on Montgomery Road then north onto Hillsdale Road. During this time a loop was planned to continue north {{from the corner of}} Pioneer and Burt Roads to Montgomery Road where it turned west and met back up with M-9 at Clark Road. This short loop was designated M-158, however later in the year the routing of M-9 was shifted onto the M-158 alignment, eliminating <b>that</b> <b>route.</b> By the middle of 1936, the highway was extended northward to end in Lansing. The M-9 designation was replaced with M-99 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In Elizabeth, Route 27 narrows to two {{lanes and}} becomes Rahway Avenue, {{crossing}} Route 439 {{and continuing to}} the northeast through residential and commercial areas.

The southbound direction of Route 27 intersects the eastern terminus of Route 28, where <b>that</b> <b>route</b> continues west on Westfield Avenue. Past the one-way pair, Route 27 resumes east on four-lane Westfield Avenue, turning north onto Broad Street. The route heads into a more urbanized setting and continues northeast onto Newark Avenue, intersecting the northern terminus of Route 439. Through Elizabeth, about 10,000 to 20,000 vehicles travel on Route 27 every day.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Congressman William J.

The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify the construction of a freeway along the corridor. The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002.|$|E
