6000|$|In {{the midst}} of our evil season sprang up a {{hurricane}} of wind; so that all supposed she must go down. I was shut in the cabin from noon of one day till sundown of the next; the Master was somewhere lashed on deck. Secundra had eaten of some drug and lay insensible; so you may say I passed these hours in an unbroken solitude. At first I was terrified beyond motion, and almost beyond thought, my mind appearing to be frozen. Presently there stole in on me a ray of comfort. If the NONESUCH foundered, she would carry down with her into the deeps of that unsounded sea the creature whom we all so feared and hated; {{there would be no}} more Master of Ballantrae, the fish would sport among his ribs; his schemes all brought to nothing, his harmless enemies at peace. At first, I have said, it was but a ray of comfort; but it had soon grown to be broad sunshine. The thought of the man's death, of his deletion from this world, which he embittered for so many, took possession of my mind. I hugged it, I found it sweet in my belly. I conceived the ship's last plunge, the sea bursting upon all sides into the cabin, the brief mortal conflict there, all by myself, in that closed place; I numbered the horrors, I had almost said with satisfaction; I felt I could bear all and more, if the NONESUCH carried down with her, overtook by the same ruin, the enemy of my poor master's house. Towards noon of the second day the screaming of the wind abated; the ship lay not so perilously over, and it began to be clear to me that we were past the height of the tempest. As I hope for mercy, I was singly disappointed. In the selfishness of that vile, absorbing passion of hatred, I forgot the case of our innocent shipmates, and thought but of myself and my enemy. For myself, I was already old; I had never been young, I was not formed for the world's pleasures, I had few affections; it mattered not the toss of a silver tester whether I was drowned there and then in the Atlantic, or dribbled out a few more years, to die, perhaps no less terribly, in a deserted sick-bed. Down I went upon my knees - holding on by the locker, or else I had been instantly dashed across the tossing cabin - and, lifting up my voice in {{the midst of}} that clamour of the abating hurricane, impiously prayed for my own death. [...] "O God!" [...] I cried, [...] "I would be liker a man if I rose and struck this creature down; but Thou madest me a coward from my mother's womb. O Lord, Thou madest me so, Thou knowest my weakness, Thou knowest that any face of death will set me shaking in my shoes. But, lo! here is Thy servant ready, his mortal weakness laid aside. Let me give my life for this creature's; take the two of them, Lord! take the two, and have mercy on the innocent!" [...] In some such words as these, only yet more irreverent and with more sacred adjurations, I continued to pour forth my spirit. God heard me not, I must suppose in mercy; and I was still absorbed in my agony of supplication when some one, removing the <b>tarpaulin</b> <b>cover,</b> let the light of the sunset pour into the cabin. I stumbled to my feet ashamed, and was seized with surprise to find myself totter and ache like one that had been stretched upon the rack. Secundra Dass, who had slept off the effects of his drug, stood in a corner not far off, gazing at me with wild eyes; and from the open skylight the captain thanked me for my supplications.|$|E

50|$|During {{its service}} the tank {{proved to be}} not entirely adapted to winter conditions, due to an {{incomplete}} draining of the cooling system, caused by a water pump system that had been modified to reduce engine height. A small shaft would break after the impeller pump froze. The repair of the shaft, considering the field conditions, proved very impractical and required three people. Two people had to hold a third person by the legs and lower him into the engine bay, where he had to loosen the fastening and remove the broken shaft. Then, he was pulled out and lowered back down to install the new shaft. He was repeatedly lowered until the new part was secured. Another serious problem discovered during the winter conditions was that the crews of the T-44A suffered from frostbite because of the complete lack of a heating system.

(The reprinted 1897 Sears Roebuck Catalog lists [...] "stockmen’s bed sheets" [...] of [...] "heavy white duck," [...] with snap rings or eyelets, as 13-18 oz. for either size, but Fay Ward states that of the various weights of tarp (16-, 18-, 20-, and 22-ounce), the preferable one was [...] "the 18-ounce type… a good water excluder, is not too heavy to manage and will stand a lot of rough handling.") The <b>tarpaulin</b> <b>cover</b> was made {{with a series of}} snaps and rings down either side so it could be folded over and snapped shut. Inside were two to four almost-square heavy quilts called [...] "sougans," [...] folded double, made of heavy wool or cotton batting quilted between patches of pants, coats, and overcoats, or sometimes of patches alone, weighing about 4 lb. each, and generally used as a pad. The sougans in turn enwrapped a blanket or two (woolen ones weighed 4-6 lb. per; Navajo and Mexican Chimayo ones, which were both warm and waterproof, were highly desirable), a lightweight double blanket sheet 35" [...] wide (about 1 lb. for 3.75 yd.), and sometimes, sandwiched between them as a mattress, a thin, feather-filled comfort (probable weight about 5 lb.) known in cowboy vernacular as a [...] "henskin." [...] (The modern cowboy uses a 4"-thick twin-size foam mattress, but this is the only significant change that has taken place in over a century.) The tarpaulin cost roughly $7.70-$11.60, depending on its weight; the sougans, about 28-30c. for two 3x7' rolls of cotton batting (the patches being more or less free); the blankets $1.10-$9.96 each; the sheeting 34-53c., and the henskin, if applicable, 96c.-$2.25, so the entire roll could be assembled for anywhere between $9.42 and $34.60. At the very core was the [...] "war bag," [...] generally an old gunny sack that had at one time held grain, feed, or even sugar, though some were of canvas, cotton, or oilskin. Earlier rolls (and those of riders traveling light, such as outlaws on the run) were wrapped in a canvas groundcloth, an oilskin cover, cowhide blanket, rubber blanket, or India-rubber [...] "sleeping spread," [...] and consisted of a blanket or two and perhaps a quilt, or even a couple of buffalo robes.|$|E

40|$|Artists {{were invited}} {{to respond to a}} series of five minute talks about {{research}} delivered by scientists from the University of Bath recorded as part of Ignite UBath. These artistic interpretations were presented as a series of short videos accompanied by an exhibition, talks and science/art workshops. ([URL] The five minute scientist talk that my proposal for a collaboration responded to was 'Sounding the Future: Acoustic Imaging and our Environment' by Dr Philippe Blondel, from the Centre for Space, Atmosphere and Oceanic Science at the University of Bath. My initial proposal was to visualize radio frequencies of the livestreaming of magnetospheric data from our Ionosphere. However our meeting led to a collaboration with his team's research recordings of the sound of melting glaciers being visualised as a night projection over flood tides. Exhibition Statement: Nicola: "Our meeting led to an increased awareness of the similarities and differences between our interests in sound and its visualization. My art practice involves experimentation with sonic frequency visualisations, often in response to electro-acoustic phenomena or viewer interactivity. We both use sound emission analysers designed for scientific purposes, but my work is self-directed. When Philippe was asked what sounds that he currently found most interesting, he replied the sound of ice cracking in Svalbard as a result of global warming. So we decided to focus on a hydrophone recording of melting glaciers in the Hornsund Fjord on Svalbard, recorded by Philippe’s research team. My suggestion was to visualise these sonic frequencies of melting glaciers projected onto water at night in the Somerset Levels, with its history of flooding due to climate change. The process of projecting sonic frequencies onto high tides in the dark during January made it necessary to create a robust projection trolley with <b>tarpaulin</b> <b>cover</b> to protect the digital equipment. The possibility of filming projections in the Somerset Levels receded as the necessity for a constant source of electricity became more apparent. So my late Grandmother’s house with its fragile sea walls, located beside the low lying estuary at Birdham on the Sussex coast, with its own history of flooding, became our location. Other arctic glacier calving recordings can be heard at intervals, alongside the more subtle underwater recordings of Philippe’s research team. " Philippe: "Hornsund.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} use of irresolvable and {{permanent}} garbage in environment to build an energy saving wall in cold and hot climatic conditions. The wall is mainly constructed from plastic bottles which provide lightness. The bottles, filled with water to store solar energy, are confined between two walls and able to provide wall stability. Transparent twin wall polycarbonate sheets have been selected as the external surface in order to let the bottles receive solar energy. The inner layer is opaque and fire resistant. A tarpaulin with a reflective inner face is used to prevent heat loss during cold and heat conditions. As the empirical results of the built sample (45 * 65 cm) indicate, in cold season, the wall stores the solar energy {{during the day and}} transfers the heat indoors (by conduction) at nights, when the <b>tarpaulin</b> <b>covers</b> the exterior.

40|$|This {{exhibition}} of handmade ceramic work was created {{over three years}} in the ceramics studios at UCA, Farnham. The work is an exploration of the artist's own African and South African identities. The exhibition forms part of a practice-led PhD thesis entitled: Africa and the West: a contested dialogue in modern and contemporary ceramics. The exhibition comprises three themes in which an animal or animal-related symbol {{has been used as a}} metaphor and a starting point for examining questions of identity and representation. In the first phase this is relatively simple. Nguni cattle are synonymous with KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the artist comes from. In 'Object/ify', cattle forms are arranged to create a large herd-like grouping. The second theme is centred on notions of official forms of identification and identity documents. The plastic ear tag commonly used to 'mark' cattle in commercial farming practices all over the world have been remade in clay in their hundreds, and suspended using silk thread. The third animal symbol is more abstract. The group of insects known collectively as 'wood-borer' pose a significant threat to suburban houses in the port city of Durban, South Africa. To get rid of these insects, pest control companies use extermination tents. These large <b>tarpaulins</b> <b>cover</b> entire houses during fumigation. The striking forms of these giant 'skins' over houses have been translated into an installation of ceramic 'Extermination Tents' made from thin porcelain and terracotta paper clay. Inner structures of grey stoneware clay that echo scaffolding hold up some of these fragile tents. Through this careful grouping of objects, the project moves away from rural symbols.
