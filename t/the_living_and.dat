5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> the dead. Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E

5|$|Teilhard de Chardin's {{ideas have}} been seen by advocates of the Gaia {{hypothesis}} proposed by James Lovelock, which holds that <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> nonliving parts of Earth {{can be viewed as}} a complex interacting system with similarities to a single organism, as being connected to Lovelock's ideas. The Gaia hypothesis has also been viewed by Lynn Margulis and others as an extension of endosymbiosis and exosymbiosis. This modified hypothesis postulates that all living things have a regulatory effect on the Earth's environment that promotes life overall.|$|E
5|$|As Dan travels across Gallowmere, {{fighting}} his {{way through}} Zarok's hordes and confronting all manners of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok's lair, fighting off Zarok's skeletal warriors using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices. After also managing to defeat Zarok's champion, Lord Kardok, Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but Dan manages to defeat him. As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse, Dan escapes and Zarok's magical influence over the land is thwarted, restoring the souls back to <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> putting the dead back to rest. With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber. If the player has managed to collect all the Chalices, Dan will ascend to the Hall of Heroes, where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E

This led Al-Nafis to seek his own {{understanding of the nature}} of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> body <b>and</b> its soul through theoretical study of medicine, physics, and theology.|$|R

5|$|The game's story follows Neku {{over the}} course of the three weeks that he plays the Game, paired with {{partners}} Shiki, Joshua, and Beat for each week, respectively. Neku is confused at first, lacking knowledge of how he died or how he arrived at the UG. As he develops friendships with his partners, he starts to understand the rules of the Game. After the first week, only Shiki is allowed to return to <b>the</b> <b>living,</b> <b>and</b> she promises to meet Neku at the statue of Hachiko. He also recovers his entry fee, which was his memories, except for the events leading up to his death. However, Shiki has become what Neku values most, and she is used as his new entry fee for the second week. During the second week he recalls small details of his death; eventually, he recognizes that he was shot at by Sho Minamimoto, one of the Reapers he faced during the Game. At the end of the second week, Joshua seemingly sacrifices himself to save Neku from an explosion created by Minamimoto.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> {{economic}} activity structures were either distributed randomly or arranged in rows or around a central empty lot. The larger settlements {{could have had}} over a dozen homesteads and be occupied by 50 to 80 residents, but more typically there were just several homes {{with no more than}} 30 inhabitants. From the 7th century on, the previously common semi-subterranean dwellings were being replaced by buildings wholly above the surface, but still consisted of just one room. Pits were dug for storage and other uses. As the Germanic people before them, the Slavs left vacant regions between developed areas for separation from strangers and to avoid conflicts, especially along the limits of their tribal territories.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Shaman King {{revolves}} around Yoh Asakura, a shaman, a medium between {{the worlds of}} <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> the dead. Yoh seeks to become the Shaman King, {{the one who is}} able to contact the Great Spirit, and will gain the ability to reshape the world in any way they wish, and for this purpose he must to win the Shaman Fight, a battle held once every 500 years between competing shamans. Anna Kyoyama, Yoh's fiancée, soon enters the scene and prescribes a brutal training regimen to prepare him for the tournament. Thus begins the plot that will lead Yoh on a journey that will lead him to befriend Ryu, Tao Ren, Horohoro, Faust VIII, Lyserg Diethel, and Joco McDonnell (known as Chocolove McDonnell).|$|E

5|$|The {{second book}} {{includes}} several essays on original sin {{and the fall}} of man, which directly refer to Augustine, who developed these doctrines. He often cited the Church Fathers in order to defend the reformed cause against the charge that the reformers were creating new theology. In Calvin's view, sin began {{with the fall of}} Adam and propagated to all of humanity. The domination of sin is complete to the point that people are driven to evil. Thus fallen humanity is in need of the redemption that can be found in Christ. But before Calvin expounded on this doctrine, he described the special situation of the Jews who lived {{during the time of the}} Old Testament. God made a covenant with Abraham, promising the coming of Christ. Hence, the Old Covenant was not in opposition to Christ, but was rather a continuation of God's promise. Calvin then describes the New Covenant using the passage from the Apostles' Creed that describes Christ's suffering under Pontius Pilate and his return to judge <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> the dead. For Calvin, the whole course of Christ's obedience to the Father removed the discord between humanity and God.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named Strigoï has no direct relation to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>and</b> cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there could drink its blood and communicate.|$|E
