40|$|Abstract. We study {{fundamental}} spectral {{properties of}} random block operators {{that are common}} in the physical modelling of meso-scopic disordered systems such as dirty superconductors. Our re-sults include ergodic properties, {{the location of the}} spectrum, ex-istence and regularity of the integrated density of states, as well as Lifshits <b>tails.</b> <b>Special</b> attention is paid to the peculiarities arising from the block structure such as the occurrence of a robust gap {{in the middle of the}} spectrum. Without randomness in the off-diagonal blocks the density of states typically exhibits an inverse square-root singularity at the edges of the gap. In the presence of randomness we establish a Wegner estimate that is valid at all energies. It implies that the singularities are smeared out by ran-domness, and the density of states is bounded. We also show Lif-shits tails at these band edges. Technically, one has to cope with a non-monotone dependence on the random couplings. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{examine the}} tail {{behaviour}} and extremal cluster characteristics of two-state Markov-switching autoregressive models {{where the first}} regime behaves like a random walk, the second regime is a stationary autoregression, and the generating noise is light-tailed. Under additional technical conditions we prove that the stationary solution has asymptotically exponential tail and the extremal index is smaller than one. The extremal index and the limiting cluster size distribution of the process are calculated explicitly for some noise distributions, and simulated for others. The practical relevance of the results is illustrated by examining extremal properties of a regime-switching autoregressive process with Gamma-distributed noise, already applied successfully in river flow modeling. The limiting aggregate excess distribution is shown to possess Weibull-like <b>tail</b> in this <b>special</b> case...|$|R

The airplanes were caused to oscillate by means of the elevator, then the longitudinal control was either locked or kept free while the oscillation died out. The magnitude of the oscillation was recorded either by a kymograph or an airspeed meter. The results show that the engine speed has as much effect on the period and damping as the airspeed, and that, contrary to theory as developed for small oscillations, the damping decreased at the higher airspeeds with closed throttle...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we argue for a special case of the {{generalized}} hyperbolic (GH) family that we denote as the GH skew Student's t-distribution. This distribution has the important property that one tail has polynomial and the other exponential behavior. Further, {{it is the only}} subclass of the GH family of distributions having this property. Although the GH skew Student's t-distribution has been previously proposed in the literature, it is not well known, and specifically, its <b>special</b> <b>tail</b> behavior has not been addressed. This article presents empirical evidence of exponential/polynomial tail behavior in skew financial data, and demonstrates the superiority of the GH skew Student's t-distribution with respect to data fit compared with some of its competitors. Through VaR and expected shortfall calculations we show why the exponential/polynomial tail behavior is important in practice. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
