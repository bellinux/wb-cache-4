5|$|The {{walls of}} the kitchen garden {{were built in the}} 1920s and include two {{gateways}} with neoclassical architraves. <b>The</b> <b>gravel</b> paths are laid out in a square with a cross at the centre enhanced by a fountain surrounded by fruit trees, vegetable plots and soft fruits. There are carriage openings with wrought-iron gates.|$|E
5|$|After the closure, the {{non-profit}} organization Friends of the Numedal Line was established and offered occasional heritage rides along the line. It maintains the tracks between Rollag and Rødberg and offers draisine rental between Veggli and Rødberg. Irregular transport from <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> pit at Svene and the sawmill Numedal Bruk at Flesberg. The latter is operated by Tågåkeriet i Bergslagen and hauls lumber from Uddevalla, Sweden. The stretch from Flesberg to Rødberg is suggested preserved by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage.|$|E

50|$|This is a disused {{gravel pit}} which exposes <b>the</b> Westland Green <b>Gravels,</b> which were {{laid down by}} the ancestral River Thames 1.6 to 1.8 million years ago. At this time the Thames flowed from Oxford through the Goring Gap to Norwich, and <b>the</b> <b>Gravels</b> show <b>the</b> ancient course of the river. As the {{original}} site where <b>the</b> <b>Gravels</b> were identified is now completely degraded, Hillcollins Pit is now considered the type site for <b>the</b> Westland Green <b>Gravels,</b> and is of considerable importance in reconstructing {{the evolution of the}} geography of southern Britain.|$|R

5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have cut through <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> and flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 European Grand Prix on 24 August, mid-season testing {{took place}} at Italy's Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari {{concentrated}} on their aerodynamic set-up during tests on Monza's long straights. Massa set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen. BMW Sauber's Nick Heidfeld was quickest on the second day. Massa spun off into <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> at the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief halt to testing. Hamilton was fastest on the third day.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Lillestrøm SK took {{initiative}} to convert one of <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> pitches to artificial turf. The proposal {{also saw the}} installation of floodlights and under-soil heating. The new field cost NOK9 million, which was covered by LSK, betting grants and the municipality. Construction started in August 2004 and was completed in November. The pitch located behind Skedsmohallen was converted to a throwing venue in 2005.|$|E

50|$|This site {{consists}} of a river terrace approximately 10m above the present River Avon. <b>The</b> Pleistocene fluvial <b>gravels</b> temporarily exposed at Newton St Loe exhibit scour-and-fill structures. The trough cross bedding is consistent with <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> having been laid down by a braided river, a fluvial style usually associated with cold stage sedimentation. The provenance of there gravels is complex and they contain material from South Wales and Midland sources. <b>The</b> <b>gravels</b> were subsequently weathered and decalcified during interstadial episodes and cryoturbated under stadial conditions.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the parody of King Leopold II, Méliès's scenario for the film features another topical element: the scene with the tar wagon {{is based on the}} experiments of Ernest Guglielminetti, who spread tar over a small part of <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> road to Monaco. This experiment, widely reported by the press, successfully eliminated the dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{the line}} lay unused and in disrepair, but the riveted-steel {{elevated}} structure was structurally sound. Around this time, the structure became known {{to a few}} urban explorers and local residents for the tough, drought-tolerant wild grasses, shrubs, and rugged trees such as sumac that had sprung up in <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> along the abandoned railway. It was slated for demolition under the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.|$|E

5|$|The Forest Highway System {{was created}} by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921. An earthen road was present along the route of H-13 by the middle of 1936. Later that year, the segment along the Alger–Schoolcraft county line was built as a gravel road, and Miners Castle Road was {{upgraded}} to gravel as well. Additional segments were under construction in 1940 in Delta County and south of Wetmore. During World War II, <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> surface was downgraded to earth along Miners Castle Road. The rest of the modern H-13 was paved in 1948 or 1949.|$|E
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up in cool and dry weather. Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his good performance, setting a time of 1:22.855 despite going into <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> after braking too deep and also drove the spare Ferrari. Häkkinen was the second-fastest driver; Barrichello was third and Coulthard rounded out the top four. After the session ended, Arrows withdrew their appeal after they accepted the FIA's findings and de la Rosa was required {{to start at the}} back of the field.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> Tertiary <b>gravels</b> {{deposited}} along <b>the</b> western {{flank of}} the Sierra Nevada mountains elucidate {{the nature of the}} paleochannels and paleotopography of the range in the Eocene-Oligocene epochs. Numerous geologic maps and studies were compiled to place existing Tertiary gravels onto topographic maps and cross-sections extracted from ArcGIS. Based on the remnant deposits, the extent of deposition of <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> during <b>the</b> Eocene-Oligocene epoch was inferred, and average end-area values were measured from the cross-sections to calculate the volume of <b>the</b> Tertiary <b>gravels</b> that was originally deposited. The map of the inferred deposits was also used to measure surface gradients of <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> and compare them to deposits of active fluvial systems. This study calculated that 197 - 290 km 3 of gravels were originally deposited and that surface gradients ranged from 0. 004 to 0. 034 (0. 229 ° to 1. 95 °). The map shows that <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> were widely distributed across the west sloping ramp of the north and central Sierras, and the cross-sections suggest that the river valleys were deeply incised and filled with Tertiary <b>gravels.</b> <b>The</b> early Cenozoic Sierran landscape consisted of a tall, rugged mountain range carved by paleochannels that were subsequently buried by gold-bearing <b>gravels</b> during <b>the</b> Eocene and Oligocene epochs...|$|R
50|$|His {{leisure time}} was chiefly {{devoted to the}} study of what was {{afterwards}} called the Stone Age and antediluvian man, as he expressed it. About the year 1830 he had found, in <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> of <b>the</b> Somme valley, flints which in his opinion bore evidence of human handiwork; but not until many years afterwards did he make public the important discovery of a worked flint implement with remains of elephant and rhinoceros in <b>the</b> <b>gravels</b> of Menchecourt.

5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 09;30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in dry weather conditions. Both Williams drivers {{maintained}} their good place from qualifying; Ralf Schumacher had the fastest time, 1:42.621. Montoya finished with the second fastest time. Coulthard was third quickest, and Michael Schumacher completed the top four, one-tenth of a second behind Ralf Schumacher. Alonso spun at the Sudkurve corner and skated across <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> trap towards the tyre barriers.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry {{and warm}} for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Michael Schumacher again set the fastest {{time for the}} third session, a 1:37.176, quicker than his best on Friday. The Williams drivers were running quicker; Ralf Schumacher in second and Button in fourth. They were separated by Coulthard. Fisichella set the fifth quickest time, ahead of Villeneuve, who spun into <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> late in the session. Barrichello, Irvine, Johnny Herbert and de la Rosa completed the top ten. In the final practice session, Häkkinen set the quickest time, a 1:37.037, one-tenth of a second faster than Michael Schumacher. Button was happy {{with the performance of}} his car and was third fastest. Barrichello maintained his consistent performance and set the fourth fastest time despite again spinning into <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> traps. He was ahead of Ralf Schumacher who had his fastest time revoked after exceeding track limits. Coulthard was sixth, two-tenths of a second faster than Fisichella. Irvine, Alexander Wurz and Villeneuve completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. All three sessions were held on a dry track. Hamilton was fastest in the first session {{with a time of}} 1:35.630, 0.39 of a second ahead of Massa, who was next quickest. Räikkönen, Heikki Kovalainen of McLaren, Kubica, Alonso and Heidfeld rounded out the top seven. Sébastien Bourdais of Toro Rosso was eighth, having been quickest early in the session. Renault driver Nelson Piquet drove into <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> beside the pit-lane entry, though managed to rejoin. Hamilton was again quickest in the second session; his early time of 1:35.750 was the fastest of the afternoon. The Renaults were next quickest, ahead of Jarno Trulli of Toyota, Red Bull driver Mark Webber, Massa, Bourdais and Räikkönen. Bourdais spun off at turn two late in the session and beached his car in <b>the</b> <b>gravel.</b> Heidfeld was fastest in the final session with a time of 1:36.061, ahead of Hamilton, Kubica and Kovalainen. Massa, Räikkönen and Alonso lacked pace, and failed to make the top ten. Webber stopped late in the session when his engine failed on the back straight, requiring an engine change before qualifying. This would give him a ten-place penalty on the grid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gravels</b> {{ascribed}} to <b>the</b> Biber glacial period (also called <b>the</b> Highland <b>Gravel</b> or Oldest Gravel (Ältester Deckenschotter) occur northwest of Augsburg as <b>the</b> Stauffenberg <b>Gravel</b> (Stauffenberg-Schotter), {{as well as}} northeast as <b>the</b> Hohenried <b>Gravel</b> (Hohenrieder Schotter) and southwest of Augsburg as <b>the</b> Stauden Plateau <b>Gravel</b> (Schotter der Stauden-Platte).

60|$|But remember, {{that when}} you ran through the chalk hills to Reading, you passed {{from the bottom of}} the chalk to the top of it, on to <b>the</b> Thames <b>gravels,</b> which lie there on the chalk, and on to the London clay, which lies on the chalk also, with <b>the</b> Thames <b>gravels</b> always over it. So that, you see, the newest layers, the London clay and <b>the</b> <b>gravels,</b> are lower in height than the {{limestone}} cliffs at Bristol, and much lower than the old mountain ranges of Devonshire and Wales, though in geological order they are far higher; and there are whole worlds of strata, rocks and clays, one on the other, between <b>the</b> Thames <b>gravels</b> and <b>the</b> Devonshire hills.|$|R
5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 23 April, all teams {{conducted}} in-season {{testing at}} the Circuit de Catalunya on 25–28 April {{to prepare for}} the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix. Jos Verstappen was fastest {{on the first day of}} testing despite spinning into <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> early in the session, ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier Panis. Michael Schumacher was quickest on the second day. Michael Schumacher remained the fastest driver on the third day of testing. The session was disrupted because several drivers stopped on the circuit with problems with their cars. On the final day, (which was held in wet weather conditions in the morning and during the end of the session) Michael Schumacher stayed the quickest driver on the final day.|$|E
5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Much of {{the recent}} {{literature}} on salmonid spawning gravels {{has been devoted to}} the search for a single statistic drawn or computed from the streambed particle size distribution to serve as an index of gravel quality. However, a natural gravel mixture cannot be fully described by any single statistic, because gravel requirements of salmonids differ with life stage, and thus the appropriate descriptor will vary with <b>the</b> functions of <b>gravel</b> at each life stage. To assess whether gravels are small enough to be moved by a given salmonid to construct a redd, the size of <b>the</b> framework <b>gravels</b> (<b>the</b> larger <b>gravels</b> that make up the structure of the deposit) is of interest, and the d 50 or d 84 of <b>the</b> study <b>gravel</b> (<b>the</b> sizes at which 50 % or 84 % of the sediments are finer) should be compared with <b>the</b> spawning <b>gravel</b> sizes observed for the species elsewhere. To assess whether the interstitial fine sediment content is so high as to interfere with incubation or emergence, the percentage of fine sediment of <b>the</b> potential spawning <b>gravel</b> should be adjusted for probable cleansing effects during redd construction, and then compared with rough standards drawn from laboratory and field studies of incubation and emergence success.
