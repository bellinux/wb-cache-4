40|$|Quarter-wave OLEDS are {{microcavity}} {{devices that}} can {{operate in the}} low finesse limit and achieve high efficiency (> 300 lm/W) by using interference to reduce the onset current for the transition <b>to</b> <b>stimulated</b> emission. In this work we study the transition <b>to</b> <b>stimulated</b> emission and compare the kinetics and electrical properties of conventional and quarter-wave devices. We show that suppression of spontaneous emission into the vertical mode {{can result in a}} sharp transition <b>to</b> <b>stimulated</b> emission at (γ /eV) I N_se/τ_sp where N_se/τ_sp is determined by optical parameters, and we find a previously observed electrical signature for the transition where the excited state population becomes fixed at low current density. We then study the role of loss mechanisms in the quarter-wave configuration and conclude with some requirements for practical device. Comment: 42 pages, 24 figure...|$|R

50|$|Study {{shows the}} {{adherence}} of porphyromonas gingivalis to human umbilical vein endothelial cells increases with the induction of E-selectin expression by TNF-α. An antibody to E-selectin and sialyl LewisX suppressed P. gingivalis adherence <b>to</b> <b>stimulated</b> HUVECs. P. gingivalis mutants lacking OmpA-like proteins Pgm6/7 had reduced adherence <b>to</b> <b>stimulated</b> HUVECs, but fimbriae-deficient mutants were not affected.

40|$|The binding of von Willebrand factor (vWf) <b>to</b> <b>stimulated</b> {{platelets}} in {{the plasma}} milieu was performed using a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody to vWf. Plasma proteins specifically inhibited the thrombin- and ADP/epinephrine-induced vWf binding to activated platelets {{but did not}} inhibit the ristocetin-induced vWf binding. When normal plasma was heat defibrinated, monoclonal-labeled vWf was bound to platelets following thrombin or ADP/epinephrine stimulation. Furthermore, monoclonal-labeled vWf from afibrinogenemic plasma bound normally to platelets. The binding of vWf <b>to</b> <b>stimulated</b> platelets in either heat-defibrinated normal plasma or afibrinogenemic plasma was specifically inhibited {{by the addition of}} normal plasma fibrinogen in a concentration-dependent manner. At levels of fibrinogen less than 1 mg/ml, however, vWf binding could be demonstrated. The inhibition by fibrinogen of vWf binding to platelets was competitive and overcome by increased concentrations of vWf. These studies show that thrombin-induced and ADP/epinephrine-induced vWf binding to platelets does not occur in the plasma milieu, although at reduced levels of fibrinogen, vWf binding <b>to</b> <b>stimulated</b> platelets can be demonstrated...|$|R

5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and prairies. Pasture, grain, forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|E
