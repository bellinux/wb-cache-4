2500|$|I think [...] {{has stated}} <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> {{weapons of mass}} destruction, and that's as simple as {{they want to keep}} it. They don't {{want to get into the}} nitty-gritty things such as if you bury a Scud missile to hide it from detection, there is a little thing called corrosion. Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{has also}} noted that, while President Bush [...] "never {{directly}} accused the former Iraqi leader {{of having a}} hand in the attacks on New York and Washington", he [...] "repeatedly associated the two in keynote addresses delivered since 11 September", adding that [...] "Senior members of his administration have similarly conflated the two." [...] For instance, the BBC report quotes Colin Powell in February 2003, stating that [...] "We've learned <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> trained al-Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September 11, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America." [...] The same BBC report also noted the results of a recent opinion poll, which suggested that [...] "70% of Americans believe the Iraqi leader was personally involved in the attacks." ...|$|E

50|$|In April 1991 Iraq {{provided}} {{its first}} {{of what would be}} several declarations of its chemical weapons programs. Subsequent declarations submitted by Iraq in June 1992, March 1995, June 1996 came only after pressure from UNSCOM. In February 1998, UNSCOM unanimously determined that after seven years of attempts to establish the extent of Iraq's chemical weapons programs, <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> still not given the Commission sufficient information for them to conclude <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>had</b> undertaken all the disarmament steps required by the UNSC resolutions concerning chemical weapons.|$|R
50|$|For example, two tested {{hypotheses}} {{could be}} <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> WMD or Iraq {{does not have}} WMD. If the evidence showed {{that it is more}} likely there are WMDs in Iraq then two new hypotheses could be formulated: WMD are in Baghdad or WMD are in Mosul. Or perhaps, the analyst may need to know what type of WMD Iraq has; the new hypotheses could be <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> biological WMD, Iraq has chemical WMD and Iraq has nuclear WMD.

5000|$|Bush {{continues}} {{to talk and}} moves to discussing post-invasion Iraq. He says that he expects Hussein's generals to put up resistances by blowing up infrastructure, especially oil wells.

Bush thinks they can [...] "win without destruction," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>has</b> good foundations including a strong bureaucracy and civil society.
