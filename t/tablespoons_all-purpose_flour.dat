50|$|Special cake flour {{with a high}} starch-to-gluten {{ratio is}} made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat. It is {{strongly}} bleached, and compared to <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour,</b> cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter, less dense texture. Therefore, it is frequently specified or preferred in cakes meant to be soft, light, and/or bright white, such as angel food cake. However, if cake flour is called for, a substitute {{can be made by}} replacing a small percentage of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> with cornstarch or removing two tablespoons from each cup of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour.</b> Some recipes explicitly specify or permit <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour,</b> notably where a firmer or denser cake texture is desired.|$|R
5000|$|<b>All-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> is {{the most}} common flour used in baking. Its protein content lies between bread and cake flours and pastry <b>flours.</b> <b>All-purpose</b> is used in many recipes for the reason that people find it’s {{acceptable}} for most household baking needs. It can generally be substituted for recipes that call for either bread or cake flour, however, the final texture of the product may vary slightly. High-protein bread flour absorbs more liquid, so substituting <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> may result in a slightly stickier dough; while low-protein flour absorbs less liquid, so substituting with <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> may result in a slightly dry batter.2 ...|$|R
50|$|Many dry ingredients, such as {{granulated}} sugar, are {{not very}} compressible, so volume measures are consistent. Others, notably flour, are more variable. For example, 1 cup of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> sifted into a cup and leveled weighs about 100 grams, whereas 1 cup of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> scooped from its container and leveled weighs about 140 grams.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem was}} to {{determine}} the effects of using <b>all-purpose</b> and instantized <b>flour</b> in a plain cake, rising the two-stage quick method of preparation. Less than two years ago the first instantized flour was introduced to the consumer market by General Mills, Inc. Their Gold Medal Wondra Instantized Flour is granular in texture, but still retains the basic structure of regular flour. Since the summer of 1963, instantized flour has also been introduced by Pillsbury and Robin Hood. The present research was undertaken to determine if the new flour can be used in place of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> in plain cake recipes. The results should be beneficial to homemakers rising the new type of flour. If there is a significant difference between the quality of the cakes made with instantized and <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour,</b> the consumer should be made aware that recipes need changing. The manufacturers should also be made aware of any significant differences, since they indicate that instantized flour can be substituted for <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> in any recipe calling for <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour.</b> If there is no significant difference between the cakes, the consumer can feel confident in substituting instantized <b>flour</b> for <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour.</b> The hypothesis of this study was that there would be no significant differences between cakes made with the two types of flours,There is a great need for research on the instantized flours, using cakes, pies, and all other products often prepared with <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour.</b> Only two significant research articles have been published, The review of literature that follows indicates the limitations in knowledge about the instantized flour. The present problem was delimited by using only one brand of instantized flour, General Mills', Inc. Gold Medal Wondra Instantized Flour. Only plain cakes were made and only one method of preparation was used. Therefore, the results should be applied with care. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

50|$|Southern chefs {{may have}} had an {{advantage}} in creating biscuits. Northern American <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flours,</b> mainly grown in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, are made from the hard spring wheats that grow in the North's cold-winter climate. Southern American bleached <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flours,</b> originally grown in the Carolinas, Georgia and Tennessee before national food distribution networks, are made from the soft winter wheat that grows in the warm southern summer. This summer growth results in wheat that has less protein, which is more suited {{to the creation of}} quick breads, as well as cookies, cakes and muffins.|$|R

50|$|Bread flour {{is high in}} gluten protein, with 12.5-14% protein {{compared}} to 10-12% protein in <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour.</b> The increased protein binds to the flour to entrap carbon dioxide released by the yeast fermentation process, resulting in a stronger rise. Bread flour may be made with a hard spring wheat.|$|R

40|$|Many health {{benefits}} {{have been linked}} to consuming adequate amounts of fiber, but most commercial baked products contain little fiber. This 2013 study determined the overall acceptability, sensory characteristics, and functional properties of cookies made with the addition of Fibersol®- 2. Enough Fibersol®- 2 was added to make a two cookie serving a good source of fiber. Fibersol®- 2 was added to the cookie dough to yield 2. 5 grams of soluble fiber per two cookies. Sensory evaluation compared two test variations to a control cookie that contained <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> and no Fibersol®- 2. One cookie variation contained the Fibersol®- 2 addition and 50 percent of the <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> (50 / 50 +F) substituted with whole white wheat flour. The other cookie variation contained the Fibersol®- 2 addition and 100 percent of the <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> (WWW+F) substituted with whole white wheat flour. Fifty-two untrained judges participated in evaluating cookies based on moistness, tenderness, flavor intensity, difference, and preference. Analysis of variance conducted on sensory characteristics indicated a significant difference in tenderness, discrimination, and overall preference. Post hoc analysis (using Fisher’s least signiﬁcant difference method) indicated that the 100 percent whole white wheat variation was not signiﬁcantly different from the control for moistness or flavor intensity. The 50 percent whole white wheat variation was significantly different than the control for moistness and flavor intensity. Cookie volume was not affected by the Fibersol®- 2, although cookie height and diameter were different for all variations. This study demonstrates that Fibersol®- 2 cannot be added to cookies at a good source of fiber without significantly decreasing the eating quality of the cookies...|$|R
