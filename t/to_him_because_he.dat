25|$|In 1945, Davis married artist William Grant Sherry, {{who also}} {{worked as a}} masseur. She had been drawn <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> claimed {{he had never heard}} of her and was, therefore, not intimidated by her. The same year, Davis refused the title role in Mildred Pierce (1945), a role for which Joan Crawford won an Academy Award, and instead made The Corn Is Green (1945) based on a play by Emlyn Williams.|$|E

25|$|In 1965 {{he married}} schoolteacher Linda Moore in Bakersfield, but they {{divorced}} two years later. Unable {{to find any}} gainful employment, he became a migrant worker. Dalkowski experienced problems with alcohol abuse. He drank heavily {{as a player and}} his drinking escalated after the end of his career. He received help from the Association of Professional Ball Players of America (APBPA) periodically from 1974 to 1992 and went through rehabilitation. He was able to find a job and stay sober for several months but soon went back to drinking. The APBPA stopped providing financial assistance <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was using the funds to purchase alcohol.|$|E
25|$|In December 1902, Bertholf {{reported}} for duty {{as an assistant}} inspector for the U.S. Life-Saving Service in Atlantic City. It was common practice for Revenue Cutter Service officers to perform this duty. This was helpful <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> could manage {{to stay close to}} home, now that he was married. He was responsible as an assistant inspector to examine and drill the surfmen at the 42 life saving stations along the New Jersey shore each month. He also had to investigate any shipwrecks along the coast to see if the rescues had been conducted properly by the life saving stations. This tour of duty with the Life Saving Service would be of valuable experience later in his career when the USLSS merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E

Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by [...] "brute force and immorality", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by [...] "soul force and morality". Gandhi {{captured the imagination of}} the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning [...] "hate with love". These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too he was popular among the Indian indentured workers. After he returned to India, people flocked <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> reflected their values.|$|E

2500|$|Thirty-six-year-old actor Will Mellor {{was cast}} as {{telephone}} installer and alleged psychic Steve Connolly. Chibnall {{had written the}} Connolly character {{to be in his}} 50s. Mellor, however, auditioned for the role even though he was not the right age. He was cast, says Chibnall, because [...] "Will came in and read and just blew it out the water. And it was just, well, you have to give the part <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> redefined it!'." ...|$|R

500|$|McCartney {{attended}} Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when {{he transferred}} to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton. In 1953, with only three others out of ninety examinees, he passed the 11-Plus exam, meaning he could attend the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school. In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his suburban home in Speke. The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: [...] "I tended to talk down <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a year younger." ...|$|E
500|$|Wheatley was {{involved}} in competitive athletics from an early age: In his youth, he ran competitively with the Penn Park track team, where, as an eight-year-old, he stood out for his discipline and promptness. [...] Because of his family trouble, he assumed a family leadership role at a relatively young age. [...] Wheatley {{made it clear to}} his brothers and sisters that when chaos came to their lives, they should to turn <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> would be there and he would never fall. When he was in high school, he would take his younger siblings to basketball games, mapping out emergency plans for shooting outbreaks or brawls. Wheatley's guardianship continued throughout his career at the University of Michigan and while he was a professional athlete. While playing in the NFL, he realized that leaving Mongo—the youngest of his siblings—in Inkster and merely providing financial support was not a solution because Mongo was still exposed to gang shootings. As Mongo's guardian, Wheatley moved Mongo to New Jersey for school. Mongo later earned outstanding freshman athlete honors during the Bergen County, New Jersey outdoor track championships while living with Wheatley, who was playing for the Giants at the time. In 2004, with his graduation from high school imminent, Mongo signed a letter of intent with [...] Utah State as a defensive back.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the joke}} becomes a {{national}} sensation. Comedian Carlos Mencia goes on Conan O'Brien's show claiming {{credit for the}} joke. The joke is played on rapper Kanye West, who does not understand it. West grows angry when others say he does not get it, and will not allow anyone to explain it <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{claims to be a}} genius and [...] "the voice of a generation". Kanye abducts Carlos Mencia, who admits he stole the joke to compensate for not being funny and claiming that his [...] "dick don't work" [...] in a parody of Viggo Mortensen's character Lalin in Carlito's Way, but Kanye doesn't believe him and beats him to death {{with the help of his}} hired thugs. Cartman and Jimmy go on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and claim they invented the joke, prompting Kanye to go after them. Jimmy confronts Cartman, asking how he can live with himself for taking credit for a joke he did not write. They are interrupted by Kanye, who threatens to kill them. By now, Cartman has not only convinced himself he wrote the whole joke without Jimmy's help, but believes he also saved his life from a black widow, slew a dragon, defeated an army of Jew robots, and has powers similar to the Human Torch. Cartman thinks he realizes what Kyle was trying to tell him, but he gets it completely backwards: Cartman believes that Jimmy's ego is the one that is twisted and Jimmy's ego trying to convince itself that he wrote the joke, while not accepting that Cartman wrote the whole thing, and Jimmy believes him. Kanye has an epiphany about his own massive ego and believes he finally understands the joke. However, he incorrectly thinks it means he is, in fact, a gay fish. The episode ends with Kanye donning a wetsuit and diving off the Santa Monica Pier into the ocean to embrace his new identity as a gay fish in the form of a music video, in which he happily swims around the sea, kissing and humping random fish.|$|E

The name Kamuzu was given <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was conceived after {{his mother had been}} given root herbs by a medicine man to cure infertility. His surname, Banda, means [...] "a small hut". He took the Christian name of Hastings after being baptised into the Church of Scotland by Dr. George Prentice, a Scot, in 1910, naming himself after John Hastings, a Scottish missionary working near his village whom he admired.

[...] At first he was unwilling to perform these duties, according <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> lacked knowledge and interest on politics; however, Ferreira da Veiga made him change his mind after praising his first article written for the journal Aurora Fluminense.

2500|$|Actor Joe Sims {{was cast}} as Nigel [...] "Nige" [...] Carter, Mark Latimer's {{best friend and}} co-worker who has several secrets to hide. Sims says he was hired {{relatively}} early in the casting process. Broadchurch appealed <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had seen the television film United, which had been written by Chris Chibnall and directed by James Strong. He loved their work, and very much {{wanted to be part}} of their next project. He got the chance to audition because he had met Sam Hoyle socially some years before, and this connection—along with heavy lobbying by his agents—won him a meeting with director Strong and casting directors Hendry and Jenkins. Sims admits that he was very nervous in his first audition, and auditioned several more times before getting the part. He believes his auditions improved each time, as he learned more about the plot at each audition (which involved reading new scenes).|$|E
2500|$|Abe's appearance, {{resembling}} {{that of a}} grey alien, includes large bulbous eyes, large forehead, {{a skinny}} frame, and a bald head with a tuft of hair. His depiction is humorous. Despite his unusual appearance, which is unlike the [...] "typically cute" [...] platform characters, Abe appeals {{to a wide range}} of video game players. His design was meant to look downtrodden, but optimistic. Unlike other Mudokons, Abe has blue or purplish-green skin, bloodshot eyes, and a high ponytail. The stitches on his lips were given <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> cried excessively after birth and they were a measure to keep him quiet, though he keeps them now because they were given to him at such a young age before he was [...] "awake enough, conscious enough as a person to really understand why he had these, but it's something that he feels is a part of him, so he doesn't want to snip loose". His skin has three mystical tattoos that grow over his body gradually: one on the back of each hand and one on his chest. Mudokon spirits have given him invisibility for short periods; he is sometimes able to incarnate the Mudokon god Shrykull; and background Mudokons assist him with other powers.|$|E

2500|$|Wu's first {{experience}} in film production came with his {{starring role in}} Julian Lee's 2003 film, Night Corridor.

Though Night Corridor dealt with [...] "risky" [...] themes, Wu felt he had less reliance on image than many of his pop-star actor peers, and he was nominated for best actor at Taiwan's 40th Golden Horse Film Awards for his effort. During 2003, Wu also took part as producer and creative director on [...] "MTV's Whatever Things!", a [...] "Jackass"-styled program aired in Asia, also featuring Sam Lee, Josie Ho, Terence Yin, and other celebrities.

2500|$|Soap Opera Digest {{revealed}} that Yancey's Cameron {{would play a}} key role in the upcoming storyline featuring Celeste Perrault (Beverly Todd) and Lexie Carver (Renée Jones). According to Owens, with the recast, the character of Cameron would develop an edge and bring more excitement; not unstable, just edgier. In an interview with Soapdom.com, Owens {{revealed that}} Cameron has issues that need to be explored. The actor explained that the character has [...] "skeletons" [...] in his closet and those secrets will eventually bring him to a breaking point. Owens drew on personal experience to help him prepare for the role as he also faced issues with his family — Cameron has to develop a sense of family and what it means <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> does not grow up in the [...] "ideal" [...] family. Owens also avoided seeing clips of Yancey's portrayal to make sure he could put his own spin on the character. However, he did take the opportunity to learn more about the cast members and Days as a whole. Cameron wants a relationship with the his late sister, Lexie's family, the DiMeras because he longs for familial acceptance, something he did not grow up with. According to Owens, Cameron has strong feelings for Abigail and does not see her ex, Chad DiMera (Casey Jon Deidrick) as an obstacle.
