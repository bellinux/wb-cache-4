5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it was endemic, the emu was an {{important}} source of meat to Aboriginal Australians. They used the fat as bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin. It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon, and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.|$|E

In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it is common, and the increased mobility of people has {{increased the number of}} epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, and might pose a threat to Europe.|$|E

5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from several of <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it {{was recorded in}} the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has {{been lost in the}} past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
5|$|The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism was Weber's {{second major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion. Hans H. Gerth edited and translated this text into English, with an introduction by C. K. Wang. Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were {{different from those of}} Western Europe, especially those aspects that contrasted with Puritanism. His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China. He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom and Chinese religion and philosophy (primarily, Confucianism and Taoism), as <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.|$|E

5|$|The {{curriculum}} {{is designed to}} prepare students for professional careers in the arts. Each student concentrates in at least one major area: creative writing, dance, drama, music, stagecraft, and visual art. Younger students often concentrate in two or more. High school students are required to specialize and major only in <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they have potential to do professional work. Advanced students study up to two hours each day in their major. Forty percent of the students stay at least two hours after school for rehearsals, private lessons, and productions.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-hour}} delay, {{the race was}} restarted. Rahal {{suffered}} clutch problems on the restart, which placed him two laps down, while the other drivers ran behind the safety car, during which the marshalls showed <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> repair work had been conducted. Just prior to the restart, {{there was a short}} rain shower which made the track slightly slippy. Power lost one position on the restart, dropping to third. Franchitti, who was the closest driver to the front to have the softer compound red tires fitted gained two positions on the restart, moving up to fourth. The restart only lasted for six corners, before Castroneves spun in the wet conditions, and was then struck by Ed Carpenter. On the next corner, Josef Newgarden had slid into the wall and stalled, and a full-track caution was again called. The race was restarted with nine laps remaining, and Franchitti once more gained a position, passing Pagenaud to gain second. However, the race was almost immediately under a yellow flag again as E.J. Viso was spun by Marco Andretti, and stalled in the middle of turn four. From the ensuing restart, Dixon managed to maintain the lead from Franchitti, and the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers completed a second successive one-two finish.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some have even been found to roost in caves and {{possibly}} housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, {{it was found that the}} species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.|$|E

25|$|Arcuatula senhousia shares its habitat with {{eelgrass}} (Zostera marina) {{in many of}} <b>the</b> <b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it has invaded.

The Asian date mussel had the most detrimental effect on rhizome growth in areas where the eelgrass was sparse and patchy. This is a cause of concern for conservationists because beds of eelgrass are already degraded and sparse as a result of anthropogenic forces. The presence of Arcuatula senhousia can only worsen the situation.|$|E
