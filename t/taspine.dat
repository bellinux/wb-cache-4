50|$|The latex of C. lechleri is {{traditionally}} used in South American medicine {{for the treatment}} of diarrhoea, wounds, inflammations, tumours, insect bites, and other conditions. A number of chemicals were isolated in the late 1980s and 1990s and tested in cellular and animal models, for example identifying <b>taspine</b> as a cicatrizant (wound healing promoter). Immunomodulatory, antioxidative, antiproliferative and mutagenic effects of dragon's blood and its components also received some attention from the scientific community. The purified proanthocyanidin fraction was first described in 1994 under the name SP-303 as an antiviral substance, but a study testing it {{for the treatment of}} herpes simplex was not successful. In 1999 the drug was reported to improve the symptoms of cholera toxin induced diarrhoea in mice.|$|E
40|$|<b>Taspine</b> is an {{alkaloid}} {{found in}} the latex of certain trees belonging {{to the family of}} Euphorbiaceae, commonly called "Sangre de Drago" (Dragon's blood). Its structure and antineoplastic properties are well known. Here we report the total synthesis of <b>taspine,</b> starting from ferulic acid and isovanillin. The successful synthetic strategy was then applied to the synthesis of a symmetrical analogue TAS 2 C. Both the synthesised compounds were tested by ESI-MS (electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry) for their ability to bind different quadruplex and duplex DNA structures.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Taspine</b> is an {{attractive}} target of research due to the anticancer and anti-angiogenic effects shown by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The present study inves-tigated the role of tas 1611, which is a derivative of <b>taspine</b> that has increased activity and solubility, in the regulation of the invasive properties of the SMMC- 7721 liver cell line in vitro and in tumor inhibition in vivo. The proliferation of the SMMC- 7721 cells was examined using the tetrazole blue colorimetric method. Matrigel ® invasion chamber assays and zymogram analyses were performed to assess the inhibi-tory effect of tas 1611 on cell invasion. Finally, a solid tumor athymic mouse model was employed to further investigate the anti-tumor effect of this compound. The results revealed that tas 1611 had a marked inhibitory effect on {{the invasion of the}} SMMC- 7721 cells and that this effect was associated with the activity and expression levels of matrix metal-loproteinase (MMP) - 2 and MMP- 9. Furthermore, tas 1611 was able to inhibit tumor growth effectively in a solid tumor SMMC- 7721 athymic mouse model. In conclusion, tas 1611 may serve as a promising novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of metastatic liver cancer...|$|E

40|$|Croton is a genus of Euphorbiaceae {{comprising}} around 1, 300 species, {{widespread in}} tropical {{regions of the}} Old and New Worlds. Several species have a long role in the traditional use of medicinal plants in Africa, Asia and South America. Popular uses include treatment of cancer, constipation, diabetes, digestive problems, dysentery, external wounds, fever, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, inflammation, intestinal worms, malaria, pain, ulcers and weight-loss. Several species of Croton have a red sap, in some species containing proanthocyanidins and/or alkaloids. The latter may be <b>taspine</b> or some of several benzylisoquinoline-like compounds. Diterpenes are very common in Croton, corresponding to clerodanes, cembranoid, halimanes, kauranes, labdanes, phorbol esters, trachylobanes and sarcopetalanes. Some species are aromatic due to the possession of volatile oils. Representatives of new classes of compounds (phenylbutanoids, glutarimide alkaloids, sarcopetalane diterpenes) have been isolated from Croton species. While laticifers have been described in Croton species, so far there are no anatomical studies about secretory structures of volatile oil. Few studies about flavonoids {{have been carried out}} with Croton species. Chemical affinities are apparent in the genus, grouping species with (i) kauranes and/or labdanes, (ii) trachylobanes and (iii) alkaloids. Pharmacological assays have frequently corroborated the traditional uses of Croton species. A great part of pharmacological assays with Croton substances dealt with the clerodane trans-dehydrocrotonin, a wide diversity of effects having been noticed, including hypolipidemic, hypoglycaemic, anti-oestrogen and anti-cancer. Cytotoxic effects also have been observed in assays with alkaloids (<b>taspine)</b> and with secokaurene, labdane and cembranoid diterpenes. Several other effects of Croton substances have been registered, including anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antimicrobial, antispasmodic, antiulcer, antiviral and myorelaxant...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe blood-red sap of Dragon's blood {{has been}} used in folk {{medicine}} for fractures, wounds, inflammation, gastrointestinal disorders, rheumatism, blood circulation dysfunctions, and cancer. Existing in vitro and in vivo bioactivity of this herb on different mechanisms of healing shows strong potential of this sap in wound healing. This clinical trial study was designated to evaluate the wound healing effect of Dragon's blood on human wounds. Sixty patients, between the ages of 14 – 65 years, who were referred to remove their skin tag, were assigned to this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial and received either Dragon's blood or a placebo cream. They were visited on the 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, 10 th, 14 th, and 20 th day of the trial to check the process of healing and to measure the wound's surface. At the end of trial, {{there was a significant difference}} in the mean duration of wound healing between the two groups (p =  0. 0001). The phenolic compounds and the alkaloid <b>taspine,</b> which exist in Dragon's-blood resin, are probably the main reasons for the wound healing property of this plant. Being natural accessible, safe, and affordable makes Dragon's blood cream, a good choice for addition to the wound healing armamentarium. Further studies on wounds with different causes and among larger populations are suggested to ensure the effectiveness and safety of Dragon's blood...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Natural product {{structures}} {{have high}} chemical diversity and are attractive as lead structures for discovery of new drugs. One {{of the disease}} areas where natural products are most frequently used as therapeutics is oncology. METHOD AND FINDINGS: A library of natural products (NCI Natural Product set) was screened for compounds that induce apoptosis of HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells using an assay that measures an endogenous caspase-cleavage product. One of the apoptosis-inducing compounds identified in the screen was thaspine (<b>taspine),</b> an alkaloid from the South American tree Croton lechleri. The cortex of this tree is used for medicinal purposes by tribes in the Amazonas basin. Thaspine was found to induce conformational activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in HCT 116 cells. Analysis of the gene expression signature of thaspine-treated cells suggested that thaspine is a topoisomerase inhibitor. Inhibition of both topoisomerase I and II was observed using in vitro assays, and thaspine {{was found to have}} a reduced cytotoxic effect on a cell line with a mutated topoisomerase II enzyme. Interestingly, in contrast to the topoisomerase II inhibitors doxorubicin, etoposide and mitoxantrone, thaspine was cytotoxic to cell lines overexpressing the PgP or MRP drug efflux transporters. We finally show that thaspine induces wide-spread apoptosis in colon carcinoma multicellular spheroids and that apoptosis is induced in two xenograft mouse models in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The alkaloid thaspine from the cortex of Croton lechleri is a dual topoisomerase inhibitor effective in cells overexpressing drug efflux transporters and induces wide-spread apoptosis in multicellular spheroids...|$|E
40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: Dragon's {{blood is}} a dark-red sap {{produced}} by species from the genus Croton (Euphorbiaceae), {{which has been}} used as a famous traditional medicine since ancient times in many countries, with scarce data about its safe use in humans. in this research, we studied genotoxicity and clastogenicity of Croton palanostigma sap using the comet assay and micronucleus test in cells of mice submitted to acute treatment. Material and methods: HPLC analysis was performed to identify the main components of the sap. the sap was administered by oral gavage at doses of 300 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg. for the analysis, the comet assay was performed on the leukocytes and liver cells collected 24 h after treatment, and the micronucleus test (MN) on bone marrow cells. Cytotoxicity was assessed by scoring 200 consecutive polychromatic (PCE) and normochromatic (NCE) erythrocytes (PCE/NCE ratio). Results and conclusion: the alkaloid <b>taspine</b> was the main compound indentified in the crude sap of Croton palanostigma. the results of the genotoxicity assessment show that all sap doses tested produced genotoxic effects in leukocytes and liver cells and also produced clastogenic/aneugenic effects in bone marrow cells of mice at the two higher doses tested. the PCE/NCE ratio indicated no cytotoxicity. the data obtained suggest caution in the use of Croton palanostigma sap by humans considering its risk of carcinogenesis.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of <b>taspine</b> {{hydrochloride}} (TA/HCl) on skin wound healing in rats and its mechanism. Methods: Bilateral round wounds were made {{on the backs of}} SD rats. The effect of TA/HCl on the skin wound was evaluated through determining closure time and contracting ability of the skin wound, observing histopathological characteristics and measuring contents of hydroxyproline (Hyp) and protein in the wound tissue. Results: The closure time of the skin wounds was significantly shorter in the TA/HCl-treated groups than that in the model group. The percentages of wound contraction were higher in the TA/HCl-treated groups than that in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group of the same group (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01) on the 3 rd to 14 th days after wounding. The content of the protein in the wound tissue in the TA/HCl-treated group (2 mg/ml) was higher than that in the model group (P< 0. 05) on the 3 rd to 7 th days after wounding, and it arrived at the peak on the 7 th day and gradually decreased to the normal level in skin tissue on the 14 th to 21 st days after wounding. The contents of Hyp in the wound tissues in the TA/HCl-treated groups were higher than that in the model group (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 015) on the 3 rd to 21 st days after wounding, and they arrived at the peak on the 14 th day and at the normal level in skin tissue on the 21 st day. Histopathological test results showed that TA/HCl could promote the formation of newly born capillaries in the early period of the wound healing. Conclusion: TA/HCl has the ability of promoting skin wound healing in rats, and it can also accelerate the growth of newly born capillaries and raise the production of protein and collagen in wound tissue...|$|E
