40|$|This {{study is}} purposed {{to show how}} the Christian and Islamic {{concepts}} <b>of</b> monotheism are <b>paradigms</b> and thus, argues that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>paradigm,</b> as a method of inquiry, can be a basis for analysing and exposing the conflictive differences and seeming similarities between <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> <b>of</b> Trinitarianism and Tawhidism.   Taking its ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> <b>of</b> Trinitarianism and Tawhidism from the Christian Trinity and Islamic Tawhid respectively, this study argues that the Christians and Muslims construct their identities from these paradigms as Trinitarian faith and Tawhidic faith respectively.   It investigates the fundamental principles of Islam and Christianity as constituting the belief formulae wrapped in <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> <b>of</b> Trinitarianism and Tawhidism. Therefore, analysing the issues of identity and alterity, the ideological oppositions, and orthodoxy claims intertwined in <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> <b>of</b> Trinitarianism and Tawhidism, this study examines the conflict of interpretations with reference to the nature of God, Christology/ ’Isalogy, Maryology and the lines of defining Christians and Muslims as ‘binary opposites’.   It further argues for a transformational intersubjectivity as a necessary condition to authentic communication between Christians and Muslims by analysing <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> <b>of</b> Trinitarianism and Tawhidism from the philosophies of dialogue. Using in places the framework of critical discourse analysis (CDA), this study analyses the empirical data of   A Common Word and reavels the underlying problems of ideologies, dichotomies, identity constructions and orthodoxy claims that are associated with <b>the</b> <b>paradigms</b> <b>of</b> Trinitarianism and Tawhidism.   This study observes that groups of Christians and Muslims, through various conferences and workshops were able to reach some compromise on interfaith matters.

25|$|Negative priming is {{identified}} {{as one of the}} cognitive process necessary for goal directed behaviors. It is associated with many cognitive processes such as inhibition, selective attention, encoding, memory retrieval, and short-term memory.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> {{toxicological}} assessment of benzene is shifting towards {{the domain of}} molecular toxicology as it allows understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in a better way. Glutathione seems {{to play an important}} role by protecting against benzene-induced DNA breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect. Benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure. These aberrations can be monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes to assess the effects of benzene along with the hematological tests as markers of hematotoxicity. Benzene metabolism involves enzymes coded for by polymorphic genes. Studies have shown that genotype at these loci may influence susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene exposure. Individuals carrying variant of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX) and deletion of the glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) showed a greater frequency of DNA single-stranded breaks.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{interest}} in Paul {{is a recent}} phenomenon. Before the so-called Jewish reclamation of Jesus (as a Jew) in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, he had hardly featured in the popular Jewish imagination and little had been written about him by the religious leaders and scholars. Arguably, he is absent from the Talmud and rabbinical literature, although he makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval polemic Toledot Yeshu (as a spy for the rabbis). But with Jesus no longer regarded as <b>the</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> gentile Christianity, Paul's position became more important in Jewish historical reconstructions of their religion's relationship with Christianity. He has featured as the key to building barriers (e.g. Heinrich Graetz and Martin Buber) or bridges (e.g. Isaac Mayer Wise and Claude G. Montefiore) in interfaith relations, as part of an intra-Jewish debate about what constitutes Jewish authenticity (e.g. Joseph Klausner and Hans Joachim Schoeps), and, on occasion, as a dialogical partner (e.g. Richard L. Rubenstein and Daniel Boyarin). He features in an oratorio (by Felix Mendelssohn), a painting (by Ludwig Meidner) and a play (by Franz Werfel), and there have been several novels about Paul (by Shalom Asch and Samuel Sandmel). Jewish philosophers (including Baruch Spinoza, Leo Shestov, and Jacob Taubes) and Jewish psychoanalysts (including Sigmund Freud and Hanns Sachs) have engaged with the apostle {{as one of the most}} influential figures in Western thought.

25|$|The {{functional}} view on {{the evolution}} of feathers has traditionally focused on insulation, flight and display. Discoveries of non-flying Late Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs in China, however, suggest that flight could not have been the original primary function as the feathers simply would not have been capable of providing any form of lift. There have been suggestions that feathers may have had their original function in thermoregulation, waterproofing, or even as sinks for metabolic wastes such as sulphur. Recent discoveries are claimed to support a thermoregulatory function, at least in smaller dinosaurs. While feathers have been suggested as having evolved from reptilian scales, there are numerous objections to that idea, and more recent explanations have arisen from <b>the</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary developmental biology. Theories of the scale-based origins of feathers suggest that the planar scale structure was modified for development into feathers by splitting to form the webbing; however, that developmental process involves a tubular structure arising from a follicle and the tube splitting longitudinally to form the webbing. The number of feathers per unit area of skin is higher in smaller birds than in larger birds, and this trend points to their important role in thermal insulation, since smaller birds lose more heat due to the relatively larger surface area in proportion to their body weight. The miniaturization of birds also {{played a role in the}} evolution of powered flight. The coloration of feathers is believed to have evolved primarily in response to sexual selection. In one fossil specimen of the Parave Anchiornis huxleyi, the features are so well preserved that the melanosome (pigment cells) structure can be observed. By comparing the shape of the fossil melanosomes to melanosomes from extant birds, the color and pattern of the feathers on Anchiornis could be determined. Anchiornis was found to have black-and-white-patterned feathers on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with a reddish-brown crest. This pattern is similar to the coloration of many extant bird species, which use plumage coloration for display and communication, including sexual selection and camouflage. It is likely that non-avian dinosaur species utilized plumage patterns for similar functions as modern birds before the origin of flight. In many cases, the physiological condition of the birds (especially males) is indicated by the quality of their feathers, and this is used (by the females) in mate choice.|$|E
