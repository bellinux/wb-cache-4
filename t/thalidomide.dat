5|$|To more {{effectively}} minimize recurrence {{and severity of}} epistaxis, other options {{may be used in}} conjunction with therapies listed above. Intravenously administered anti-VEGF substances such as bevacizumab (brand name Avastin), pazopinab and <b>thalidomide</b> or its derivatives interfere with the production of new blood vessels that are weak and therefore prone to bleeding. Due to the past experiences with prescribing <b>thalidomide</b> to pregnant women to alleviate symptoms of nausea and the terrible birth defects that followed, <b>thalidomide</b> is a last resort therapy. Additionally, <b>thalidomide</b> can cause neuropathy. Though this can be mitigated by tinkering with dosages and prescribing its derivatives such as lenolidomide and pomalidomide, many doctors prefer alternative VEGF inhibitors. Bevacizumab has been shown to significantly reduce the severity of epistaxis without side effects.|$|E
5|$|Kelsey died in London, Ontario, on August 7, 2015 {{at the age}} of 101, {{less than}} 24 hours after Ontario’s Lieutenant-Governor, Elizabeth Dowdeswell, visited her home to present her with the {{insignia}} of Member of the Order of Canada for her role against <b>thalidomide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several anti-angiogenesis drugs {{approved}} for other conditions, such as cancer, {{have been investigated}} in small clinical trials. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, for instance, has been used off-label in several studies. In the largest study conducted so far, bevacizumab infusion {{was associated with a}} decrease in cardiac output and reduced duration and number of episodes of epistaxis in treated HHT patients. <b>Thalidomide,</b> another anti-angiogenesis drug, was also reported to have beneficial effects in HHT patients. <b>Thalidomide</b> treatment was found to induce vessel maturation in an experimental mouse model of HHT and to reduce the severity and frequency of nosebleeds in the majority {{of a small group of}} HHT patients. The blood hemoglobin levels of these treated patients rose as a result of reduced hemorrhage and enhanced blood vessel stabilization.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of her {{blocking}} American approval of <b>thalidomide,</b> Kelsey was nominated for the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service by John F. Kennedy, becoming the second woman so honoured. After receiving the award, Kelsey continued her work at the FDA. There she {{played a key role in}} shaping and enforcing the 1962 amendments. She also became responsible for directing the surveillance of drug testing at the FDA.|$|E
5|$|Despite a life {{filled with}} bad luck—having Tourette syndrome, {{being struck by}} lightning, and losing one of his {{testicles}} to cancer—Harvie remains optimistic, living out his own eccentric way of life. In one of the pivotal episodes of his life, Harvie sits in the park next to a statue of Horace while he hears the instructional Carpe diem, which inspires him to make many changes in his life, such as embracing nudism and embarking on daring rescue missions for animal rights. He marries Val, a nurse he meets in hospital, and they adopt a daughter, Ruby, who has deformed limbs due {{to the effects of}} <b>thalidomide.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of <b>thalidomide,</b> a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E
5|$|Toxicology testing became {{important}} in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, {{in response to the}} Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the <b>Thalidomide</b> tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold.|$|E
5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving his head around at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to <b>thalidomide</b> deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from <b>thalidomide</b> and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include <b>thalidomide,</b> the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thalidomide,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Immunoprin, among others, is an {{immunomodulatory}} drug and the prototype of the <b>thalidomide</b> class of drugs. Today, <b>thalidomide</b> is used mainly as a treatment of certain cancers (multiple myeloma) and of a complication of leprosy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thalidomide</b> was {{prescribed}} {{for treatment of}} HG in Europe until it was recognized that <b>thalidomide</b> is teratogenic and is a cause of phocomelia in neonates.|$|E
25|$|In Spain, <b>thalidomide</b> {{was widely}} {{available}} throughout the 1970s, perhaps {{even into the}} 1980s. There were two reasons for this. First, state controls and safeguarding were poor; indeed, {{it was not until}} 2008 that the government even admitted the country had ever imported <b>thalidomide.</b> Second, Grünenthal failed to insist that its sister company in Madrid warn Spanish doctors, and permitted it to not warn them. The Spanish advocacy group for victims of <b>thalidomide</b> estimates that in 2015, there were 250–300 living victims of <b>thalidomide</b> in Spain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thalidomide</b> {{has been}} used by Brazilian {{physicians}} as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, and by 1996, at least 33 cases of <b>thalidomide</b> embryopathy were recorded in people born in Brazil after 1965. Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of <b>thalidomide</b> have been strictly controlled, requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests. Despite this, cases of <b>thalidomide</b> embryopathy continue, with at least 100 cases identified in Brazil between 2005 and 2010. 5.8 million <b>thalidomide</b> pills were distributed throughout Brazil in this time period, largely to poor Brazilians in areas with poor access to healthcare, and these cases have occurred despite the controls.|$|E
25|$|Research {{efforts have}} been focused on {{determination}} how <b>thalidomide</b> causes birth defects and its other activities in the human body, efforts to develop safer analogs, and efforts to find further uses for <b>thalidomide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Four {{years after}} <b>thalidomide</b> was {{withdrawn}} from the market {{for its ability to}} induce severe birth defects, its anti-inflammatory properties were discovered when patients suffering from erythema nodosum leprosum(ENL) used <b>thalidomide</b> as a sedative and it reduced both the clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. <b>Thalidomide</b> was discovered to inhibit tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in 1991. TNF-α is a cytokine produced by macrophages of the immune system, and also a mediator of inflammatory response. Thus the drug is effective against some inflammatory diseases such as ENL. In 1994 <b>Thalidomide</b> was found to have anti-angiogenic activity and anti-tumor activity which propelled the initiation of clinical trials for cancer including multiple myeloma. The discovery of the anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activities of <b>thalidomide</b> increased the interest of further research and synthesis of safer analogs.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{physical}} malformations associated with Roberts syndrome {{are very similar to}} the malformations that occur in children whose mothers took <b>thalidomide</b> during pregnancy. The physical similarities suggest that there is a similar underlying biology between ESCO2 and <b>thalidomide.</b> As a result, it is speculated that <b>thalidomide</b> affects chromosomes and cell division in a similar manner to ESCO2. For this reason, Roberts syndrome is sometimes called Pseudothalidomide Syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The common {{structure}} for analogs that inhibit TNF-α via inhibition of PDE4 is prepared {{on the basis}} of hydrolysing the glutarimide ring of <b>thalidomide.</b> These analogs do not have an acidic chiral hydrogen, unlike <b>thalidomide,</b> and would therefore be expected to be chirally stable.|$|E
25|$|The {{exploration}} of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities of <b>thalidomide</b> {{has led to the}} study and creation of <b>thalidomide</b> analogs. Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to <b>thalidomide,</b> such as lenalidomide, that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects— except for greater myelosuppression. In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for lenalidomide (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, pomalidomide, is now FDA approved. Additionally, apremilast was approved by the FDA in March 2014. These <b>thalidomide</b> analogs can be used to treat different diseases, or used in a regimen to fight two conditions.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, <b>thalidomide</b> {{has always}} {{been used as a}} racemate. Generally the S-isomer is {{associated}} with the infamous teratogenic effects of <b>thalidomide</b> and the R-isomer is devoid of the teratogenic properties but conveys the sedative effects, however this view is highly debated and {{it has been argued that}} the animal model that these different R- and S-effects were seen in was not sensitive to the <b>thalidomide</b> teratogenic effects. Later reports in rabbits, which is a sensitive species, unveiled teratogenic effects from both isomers. Moreover, <b>thalidomide</b> enantiomers have been shown to be interconversed in vivo due to the acidic chiral hydrogen in the asymmetric center (shown, for the EM-12 analog, in Figure 3), so the plan to administer a purified single enantiomer to avoid the teratogenic effects will most likely be in vain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thalidomide</b> is used off-label {{in several}} ways.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{mechanism}} of action of <b>thalidomide</b> and its analogs is not fully clear and the bioreceptor for these substances has not been identified, the insight into {{the relationship between the}} structure and activity of <b>thalidomide</b> and its analogs are mostly derived from molecular modelling and continued research investigation.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicated}} that a substitution at the phthaloyl ring would increase TNF-α inhibition activity (Figure 5). An amino group substitution was tested at various locations on the phthaloyl ring (C4, C5, C6, C7) of <b>thalidomide</b> and EM-12 (previously described). Amino addition at the C4 location on both <b>thalidomide</b> and EM-12 resulted in much more potent inhibition of TNF-α. This also revealed that the amino group needed to be directly opposite the carbonyl group on the isoindolinone ring system for the most potent activity. These analogs do not inhibit PDE4 and therefore do not act by PDE4 inhibition. Other additions of longer and bigger groups at the C4 and C5 position of the phthaloyl ring system of <b>thalidomide,</b> some with an olefin functionality, have been tested with various results. Increased inhibitory effect, compared to <b>thalidomide,</b> was noticed with the groups that had an oxygen atom attached directly to the C5 or C4 olefin. Iodine and bromine addition at C4 or C5 resulted in equal or decreased activity compared to <b>thalidomide.</b> These groups were not compared with lenalidomide or pomalidomide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thalidomide</b> {{has shown}} {{efficacy}} in reversing endoscopic evidence of disease.|$|E
25|$|One of the analogs of {{interest}} {{was made by}} isoindolinone replacement of the phthaloyl ring. It was given the name EM-12 (Figure 3). This replacement was thought to increase the bioavailability of the substance because of increased stability. The molecule had {{been reported to be}} an even more potent teratogenic agent than <b>thalidomide</b> in rats, rabbits and monkeys. Additionally, these analogs are more potent inhibitors of angiogenesis than <b>thalidomide.</b> As well, the amino-thalidomide and amino-EM-12 were potent inhibitors of TNF-α. These two analogs later got the name lenalidomide, which is the EM-12 amino analog, and pomalidomide, the <b>thalidomide</b> amino analog.|$|E
25|$|Several {{countries}} either {{restricted the}} drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, {{a member of}} the Austrian pharmaceutical admission conference, enforced <b>thalidomide</b> (tradename Softenon) being sold under the rules of prescription medication and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland. In the United States, pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey M.D. withstood pressure from the Richardson-Merrell company and refused Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market <b>thalidomide,</b> saying further studies were needed. This reduced the impact of <b>thalidomide</b> in United States patients. Although <b>thalidomide</b> was never approved for sale in the United States at the time, millions of tablets had been distributed to physicians during a clinical testing program. It was impossible to know how many pregnant women had been given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative.|$|E
25|$|Little further {{work was}} done with <b>thalidomide</b> in cancer until the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>thalidomide</b> {{increased}} fears regarding {{the safety of}} pharmaceutical drugs. The Society of Toxicology of Canada was formed after the effects of <b>thalidomide</b> were made public, focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology. The need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster. The Society of Toxicology of Canada {{is responsible for the}} Conservation Environment Protection Act, focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances. <b>Thalidomide</b> brought on changes in the way drugs are tested, what type of drugs are used during pregnancy, and increased the awareness of potential side effects of drugs.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 the FDA {{approved}} the drug's {{use in the}} treatment of ENL. Because of thalidomide's potential for causing birth defects, the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions. The FDA required that Celgene Corporation, which planned to market <b>thalidomide</b> under the brand name Thalomid, establish a system for <b>thalidomide</b> education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program. The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed <b>thalidomide,</b> providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of analogs of <b>thalidomide</b> was precipitated {{by the discovery}} of the anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drug yielding a new way of fighting cancer as well as some inflammatory diseases after it had been banned in 1961. The problems with <b>thalidomide</b> included; teratogenic side effects, high incidence of other adverse reactions, poor solubility in water and poor absorption from the intestines.|$|E
25|$|The drug thalidomide's {{birth defects}} in {{children}} affected many people's lives, and from these events came {{the formation of}} the group called The <b>Thalidomide</b> Victims Association of Canada, a group of 120 Canadian survivors. Their goal was to prevent future usage of drugs that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies. The members from the <b>thalidomide</b> victims association were involved in the STEPS program, which aimed to prevent teratogenicity.|$|E
25|$|Celgene Corporation {{originally}} synthesized <b>thalidomide</b> using a three-step sequence {{starting with}} L-glutamic acid treatment, {{but this has}} since been reformed {{by the use of}} L-glutamine. As shown in the image below, N-carbethoxyphtalimide (1) can react with L-glutamine to yield N-Phthaloyl-L-glutamine (2). Cyclization of N-Phthaloyl-L-glutamine occurs using carbonyldiimidazole, which then yields <b>thalidomide</b> (3). Celegne Corporation's original method resulted in a 31% yield of S-thalidomide, whereas the two-step synthesis yields 85-93% product that is 99% pure.|$|E
25|$|In vivo anti-tumor {{activity}} of <b>thalidomide</b> {{is believed to}} be due to the potent anti-angiogenic effect and also through changes in cytokine expression. In vitro assays on apoptosis in MM cells have been shown, when treated with <b>thalidomide</b> and its analogs, to upregulate the {{activity of}} caspase-8. This causes cross talking of apoptotic signaling between caspase-8 and caspase-9 leading to indirect upregulation of caspase-9 activity. Further anti-tumor activity is mediated through the inhibition of apoptosis protein-2 and pro-survival effects of IGF-1, increasing sensitivity to FAS mediated cell death and enhancement of TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand. They have also been shown to cause dose dependent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in leukemia cell lines where the analogs showed 100 times more potency than <b>thalidomide.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is no {{conclusive}} evidence that <b>thalidomide</b> or lenalidomide {{is useful to}} bring about or maintain remission in Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Israeli {{physician}} Jacob Sheskin administered <b>thalidomide</b> to {{a patient}} critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum(ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of leprosy. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours {{and was able to}} get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of <b>thalidomide</b> in leprosy soon followed.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{after a long}} {{campaign}} by The Sunday Times, a compensation settlement for the UK victims was reached with Distillers Company (now part of Diageo), which had distributed the drug in the UK. This compensation, which is distributed by the <b>Thalidomide</b> Trust in the UK, was substantially increased by Diageo in 2005. The UK Government gave survivors a grant of £20 million, to be distributed through the <b>Thalidomide</b> Trust, in December 2009.|$|E
