5|$|At {{an archaeological}} dig in the Ecuadorian highlands, two archaeologists, Dr. Bilac and Dr. Roosevelt, {{get into an}} {{argument}} over the removal of a burial urn that contains an Amaru, or a female shaman. Roosevelt argues that the urn must be taken from the site and preserved in a museum, much to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> Bilac and the tribespeople present. Later, a native shaman distributes Yaje to the local villagers and Bilac. During this ritual, a jaguar spirit kills Roosevelt in his tent.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry {{set aside}} $850 {{million for the}} Fifth {{generation}} computer project.

Much to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> scruffies, they chose Prolog as the primary computer language for the project.|$|E
5|$|A New Generation {{was made}} over a seven-month period at Nelvana's Toronto facilities, with {{additional}} work handled by Taiwan's Wang Film Productions, and involved several crew {{members who had}} worked on the original Care Bears Movie. Patricia Cullen served as composer, and Los Angeles musicians Dean and Carol Parks worked on the film's six songs. The Samuel Goldwyn Company, the US distributor for the first film, was originally set to release the sequel, but demands from the film's producers caused the company to give up. To <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> Goldwyn's founder, the worldwide distribution rights were then acquired by Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far more {{difficult}} than first imagined. Workers followed an old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a corduroy road, much to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E

50|$|However, the {{leadership}} style of Lim and other newer top NTUC leaders had increasingly alienated {{elements of the}} union grassroots.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1861, when Rainilaiarivony was 33 years old, Queen Ranavalona's {{advanced}} age and acute illness produced speculation about who would succeed her. Ranavalona had repeatedly stated her intention that her progressive and pro-European son, RadamaII, would be her successor, much to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> the conservative faction at court. The conservatives privately rallied behind the queen's nephew and adoptive son Ramboasalama, whom the queen had initially declared heir apparent some years prior, and who had never abandoned hope to one day reclaim the right that had briefly been accorded to him.|$|E

To <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, leafy spurge, St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues facing the newly elected government was {{the decision of the}} province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed Edmonton as the provisional capital, much to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> Calgary. Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign, but selecting a permanent capital was {{high on the list of}} the new legislature's orders of business. Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross. Banff and Red Deer were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders. In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members—including Rutherford—to eight.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Posey was {{appointed}} territorial Governor on March 3, 1813, and served until the state's first Governor was sworn into office on November 7, 1816. Posey, who was age sixty-two and in poor health, {{had created a}} rift {{in the politics of}} the territory by refusing to reside in the capital of Corydon, instead living in Jeffersonville to be closer to his doctor. He further complicated matters by being a supporter of slavery, much to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> opponents like Jennings, Dennis Pennington, and others who dominated the Territorial Legislature, and who sought to use the bid for statehood to permanently end the possibility of slavery in the state.|$|E
5|$|When the entourage reached Rome in {{the autumn}} of 219, Comazon and other allies of Julia Maesa and Elagabalus were given {{powerful}} and lucrative positions, to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> many senators who did not consider them worthy of such privileges. After his tenure as Praetorian prefect, Comazon would serve as the city prefect of Rome three times, and as consul twice. Elagabalus soon devalued the Roman currency. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 58% to 46.5%— the actual silver weight dropping from 1.82grams to 1.41grams. He also demonetized the antoninianus during this period in Rome.|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting in September 1936, Göring and Hitler {{announced}} that the German rearmament programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan to undertake this task. Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy-making decisions, to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> Hjalmar Schacht, the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on rearmament, in spite of growing deficits. Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937, and Walther Funk took over the position, as well as control of the Reichsbank. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under Göring's control {{under the auspices of}} the Four Year Plan. In July 1937, the Reichswerke Hermann Göring was established under state ownership – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{became the}} leading cabinet {{member in the}} new {{government}} under President Washington. He was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the national debt, assume states' debts, and create the government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports, and later also by a highly controversial tax on whiskey. To overcome localism, Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government, especially bankers and businessmen, which became the Federalist Party. A major issue {{in the emergence of}} the American two-party system was the Jay Treaty, largely designed by Hamilton in 1794. It established friendly trade relations with Britain, to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> France and the supporters of the French Revolution. Hamilton {{played a central role in}} the Federalist party, which dominated national and state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Later, on 19 June, Chief of Staff al-Hariri led a {{high-ranking}} delegation that included Prime Minister al-Bitar, Aflaq and Education Minister Sami Droubi to Algeria {{for a state}} visit. While al-Hariri was away, the Committee used the opportunity to undertake a purge of about 30 elite officers—mostly political independents—under al-Hariri's command. Al-Hariri was ordered to take a direct flight to the Syrian embassy in the United States, where he was reassigned as the embassy's military attache. Instead, he returned to Syria via a flight to Beirut on 23 June to protest the Committee's move against him. Unsuccessful, he left the country for France in a self-imposed exile on 8 July. The Committee's virtual ousting of al-Hariri was to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> al-Bitar, who viewed al-Hariri as the last military counterweight able to check the Committee's domination over his government.|$|E

Shruti files a missing person report for Jhilmil. The Darjeeling police learn about the report, resume their pursuit of Barfi and arrest him. As he is being interrogated, another ransom demand for Jhilmil is made and she is apparently killed {{in the process of}} the exchange, though her body is never found. In order to conclude the case, the police try to frame Barfi for Jhilmil's murder. Policeman Sudhanshu Dutta, who grew fond of Barfi after investigating him for his nuisances, asks Shruti to take him away, offering him a second chance at life. She agrees and hopes that now Jhilmil is gone, she can finally be with Barfi.|$|E

5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match.

However, his reputation for controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had to be separated by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E
5|$|In Cairo, an-Nasir Ahmad did not {{partake in}} the usual royal feast and the public prayer during the Eid al-Fitr holiday. He {{surrounded}} himself with his coterie of supporters from al-Karak, refused to meet directly with the Mamluk emirs of Egypt, avoided the public view, and was generally seclusive. He ordered Qawsun and Altunbugha {{as well as the}} governor of Qus who oversaw the execution of Abu Bakr to be executed. He assigned many of his unqualified supporters from al-Karak to senior administrative offices, to <b>the</b> <b>chagrin</b> <b>of</b> the Mamluk emirs in Egypt. Tashtamur played an integral role in an-Nasir Ahmad's administration. However, Tashtamur's arbitrary conduct in office and his selective approach to an-Nasir Ahmad's orders turned the latter against him, and with support from the leading Mamluk emirs who were also frustrated with Tashtamur, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur imprisoned in May 1342. In addition, an-Nasir Ahmad ordered Qutlubugha to be confined to Damascus, while Mamluk emirs in Egypt sought to eliminate Qutlubugha. The latter was able to leave Egypt unharmed, but before reaching Beisan from Jenin, he was arrested by the governor of Safad, Baybars al-Ahmadi, who extradited him to Egypt.|$|E

On June 26, 2008, he used his player option to opt out of his contract with the Trail Blazers, making him a free agent for the off-season.|$|E
