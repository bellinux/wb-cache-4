50|$|Tents for {{recreational}} camping {{fall into two}} categories. Tents intended to be carried by backpackers are the smallest and lightest type. Small tents may be sufficiently light {{that they can be}} carried for long distances on a <b>touring</b> <b>bicycle,</b> a boat, or when backpacking.|$|E
5000|$|Dawes {{presented}} the [...] "Courier" [...] for the 1951 Festival of Britain, which incorporated {{a number of}} hints of the future direction for the company's bikes. Hand-built around a lightweight frame with a long wheelbase (comfortable for long-distance touring), it was equipped with a state-of-the-art ten-gear derailleur system, and was fitted with toecaps and saddlebag. This was followed into production with the more specialist [...] "Windrush", a specific-designed <b>touring</b> <b>bicycle</b> and a direct fore-runner of the later [...] "Galaxy". The company's response to the 1960s passion for small bikes was the step-framed [...] "Kingpin", with a three-speed Sturmey-Archer enclosed hub gearing system. In 1971, Dawes first [...] "Galaxy" [...] model appeared, fitted with wide-ratio gears and Reynolds 531 tubing. The Galaxy became the benchmark in the English <b>touring</b> <b>bicycle</b> market.|$|E
5000|$|To be field-repairable and for reliability, <b>touring</b> <b>bicycles</b> {{typically}} have a steel (CroMo) frame and fork, however aluminum and titanium are also sometimes used.|$|R
50|$|A luggage carrier, also {{commonly}} called a rack, is a device {{attached to a}} bicycle to which cargo or panniers can be attached. This is popular with utility <b>bicycles</b> and <b>touring</b> <b>bicycles.</b>|$|R
25|$|Disc brakes {{are most}} common for {{mountain}} bikes (including nearly all downhill bikes), {{and are also}} seen on some hybrid <b>bicycles</b> and <b>touring</b> <b>bicycles.</b> A disc brake is sometimes employed as a drag brake.|$|R
5000|$|The Galaxy {{series is}} popular amongst touring cyclists because of {{features}} such as a long wheelbase and a slightly heavier but stiffer frame which allows luggage to be loaded on the bike. When introduced in 1971, the Galaxy was an off-the-peg <b>touring</b> <b>bicycle</b> {{at a time when}} tourers were usually expensive custom-built machines.|$|E
5000|$|... “29-inch wheels”, {{which also}} {{conform to the}} popular 700C (622 mm {{diameter}} clincher) wheel standard are becoming more popular for not only cyclocross bikes but also cross-country mountain bikes. Their rim diameter of 622 mm (~24.5 inch) is identical to most road, hybrid, and <b>touring</b> <b>bicycle</b> wheels, but they are typically reinforced for greater durability in off-road riding. The average 29-inch mountain bike tire is ISO 59-622 - corresponding to an outside diameter of about 29.15 in.|$|E
50|$|A <b>touring</b> <b>bicycle</b> is {{a bicycle}} {{designed}} or modified to handle bicycle touring. To make the bikes sufficiently robust, comfortable and capable of carrying heavy loads, special features may include a long wheelbase (for ride comfort and to avoid pedal-to-luggage conflicts), frame materials that favor flexibility over rigidity (for ride comfort -- though frame flexing can eventually lead to metal fatigue and frame failure, so newer frames are rigid), heavy duty wheels (for load capacity), and multiple mounting points (for luggage racks, fenders, and bottle cages).|$|E
50|$|A utility bicycle is {{a bicycle}} {{designed}} for practical transportation, {{as opposed to}} bicycles which are primarily designed for recreation and competition, such as <b>touring</b> <b>bicycles,</b> racing bicycles, and mountain bicycles. The vast majority of bicycles {{that can be found}} in the developing world are utility bicycles. As such, utility bicycles are the most common form of bicycle globally.|$|R
50|$|Road <b>touring</b> <b>bicycles</b> have a frame {{geometry}} {{designed to}} provide a comfortable ride and stable, predictable handling when laden with baggage, provisions for the attachment of fenders and mounting points for carrier racks and panniers.|$|R
50|$|Current {{production}} is around 300 to 400 frames per year, with 20% being exported outside the United Kingdom. As of 2010, <b>touring</b> <b>bicycles</b> account for around 67% of Mercian's production, with track bicycles making up another 25%.|$|R
5000|$|For {{recreational}} road cycling, the road-style bicycles with drop handlebars {{used to be}} {{the norm}} in the 1980s, along with the <b>touring</b> <b>bicycle,</b> (a drop-handlebar bike with a slightly longer wheelbase to provide a smoother ride and less sensitivity to steer and balance disturbances). These designs, called [...] "road bikes" [...] or colloquially, [...] "roadies" [...] or [...] "racing bikes", have become less popular in recent years. The Mountain bike geometry, with its straight handlebars and upright sitting position (resembling the city bike), have moved into the high-performance spaces, and high production volumes have brought down costs significantly.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, 90 and 100 series were sports/entry level bicycles. 200 and 600 {{series and}} the 1000 model were touring bicycles, {{with the level}} of bicycle {{increasing}} with first digit in the series. In general, a 200 series <b>touring</b> <b>bicycle</b> would be roughly equivalent to a 300 series competition/fitness bicycle in terms of component levels, frame materials and value. 300, 400, 500, 700, 900 series were mid-range competition/fitness bicycles [...] - [...] {{with the level of}} quality increasing with first digit in the series. The top line, pro series bicycles were named non-numerically (e.g., Team Miyata and Pro Miyata). 1000 series and X000 series bicycles, with the notable exception of the 1000 touring model, were competition/fitness models with non-ferrous frames.|$|E
50|$|The {{victory by}} Belgian Ernest Mottard in 1930 {{featured}} {{one of the}} great escapes {{in the history of the}} race, Mottard broke away from the peloton with 130 miles (209 km) remaining and stayed away until the finish. Ireland’s Shay Elliott was particularly unfortunate in 1958, he had a lead of over a minute with only three miles remaining when he smashed the frame of this bike with no team car near at hand, he was offered a <b>touring</b> <b>bicycle</b> by a spectator but was quickly caught by the chasing bunch and finished well down the field with Belgium‘s Rik Van Looy taking final victory. The 1963 edition of the race was made memorable by a small breakaway forming well before the border into Belgium, which was a rare event in itself. The break established a 13-minute lead and included Britain’s Tom Simpson who was expected to win, being the best sprinter in the break, however his gears slipped in the final sprint and he lost out to France’s Jean Stablinski.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles can be {{categorized}} in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include utility bicycles, mountain <b>bicycles,</b> racing <b>bicycles,</b> <b>touring</b> <b>bicycles,</b> hybrid bicycles, cruiser bicycles, and BMX bikes. Less common are tandems, low riders, tall bikes, fixed gear, folding models, amphibious bicycles, cargo bikes, recumbents and electric bicycles.|$|R
25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on mountain, hybrid, and <b>touring</b> <b>bicycles</b> with three chainrings. The relative {{step on the}} chainrings (say 25% to 35%) is typically around twice the relative step on the cogset (say 15%), e.g. chainrings 28-38-48 and cogset 12-14-16-18-21-24-28.|$|R
5000|$|At first Koga Miyata only {{produced}} racing bicycles. In 1976 {{they added}} {{a range of}} high quality randonneurs or <b>touring</b> <b>bicycles,</b> and in 1986 mountain bikes. In 1993, after it was acquired by the Atag Cycle Group, Koga Miyata also produced hybrid bicycles.|$|R
