5|$|Brown thus gained {{selection}} for the First Test, batting {{out of position}} in the middle order while Sid Barnes and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first-choice team; Harvey did not play and Brown batted out of position in the middle order. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of Harvey receiving a last-minute call-up when Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week {{leading up to the}} Test, but the opener recovered.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost.

Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Brown {{had scored}} 800 runs on tour {{at an average}} of 72.72, while Loxton had made 310 runs at 51.66. Harvey had scored only 296 runs at 42.29. The other five places in the top six were firmly entrenched in the hands of Barnes, Morris, Bradman, Hassett and Miller, who had all played in those {{positions}} regularly since the end of World War II. Brown gained selection out of position in the middle order in the First Test at Trent Bridge, while Loxton and Harvey watched from the sidelines. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> one of them would receive a last-minute call-up as Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week leading up to the Test, but the opener recovered. Brown made only 17 as Australia won by eight wickets.|$|E

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{examination}} of the fossil on March 6, 1999 it had already become clear to Currie that {{the left and right}} feet mirrored each other perfectly and that the fossil had been completed by using both slab and counterslab. He also noticed no connection could be seen between the tail and the body. In July 1999, Currie and the Czerkases brought the fossil to the High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility of the University of Texas (Austin) founded and operated by Dr. Timothy Rowe to make CT scans. Rowe, having made the scans on July 29, determined that they indicated that the bottom fragments, showing the tail and the lower legs, were not part of the larger fossil. He informed the Czerkases on August 2 that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of the whole being a fraud. During a subsequent discussion Rowe and Currie were pressured by the Czerkases to keep their reservations private.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{was also}} expected to re-strengthen prior to its second landfall in Mexico, though the Weather Bureau also noted that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for the storm to affect Texas. Although the possibility never materialized, the agency expected rain bands and rough seas to affect southern Texas, and small watercraft were urged to remain in ports until the hurricane moved inland. On August 21, the cyclone was expected to move ashore between Nautla and Tuxpan, though it eventually made landfall further north near Tampico. Local officials expressed concerns about residents in huts and other vulnerable structures. In the Harlingen Valley region of southern Texas, precautionary measures were taken and Red Cross divisions organized {{a meeting at the}} local city hall. City departments and facilities were ready for disposal if the cyclone moved closer to the area. The cyclone's rains were {{also expected to}} impact unpicked cotton plants in the region. In advance of the storm, a Coast Guard plane dropped messages from the air to several vessels, advising them to seek shelter. In Tampico, oil industries erected barriers to protect fields, and authorities planned to evacuate residents from the surrounding low-lying areas. Thousands of residents stayed in refugee centers on elevated ground.|$|E

5|$|Edward 'Ned' Trickett {{sought to}} win the Australian Championship from Rush. Trickett was outclassed by Rush at the 1874 and 1875 events, but {{afterwards}} competed at numerous regattas and in private matches, and his form was consistently improving. Trickett and his backers demanded that Rush contest the title on the Parramatta River where he won it from Hickey. Rush declined to row anywhere but on the Clarence River, and demanded that the stakes be not less than £500. By 1875, Rush had a wife and five children to support, {{as well as many}} business commitments, and could not afford to undertake a sporting endeavour involving a major investment in time and money, unless <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of an adequate financial return. Dozens of letters and articles in the Australian press debated the issue for nearly two years, as Trickett and his supporters became increasingly incensed at Rush's stalling. Finally, former champion sculler and now a prosperous publican and backer of sculling events, offered to finance an attempt by an Australian sculler to topple the current holder of the World Sculling Championship, Englishman Joseph Sadler. Rush declined to travel to London. Trickett agreed to the journey, went to the Thames, beat Sadler, and brought home the World Championship to Australia. Rush challenged Trickett for the World title. Trickett demanded that the race be rowed on the Parramatta River, and the match came off on the afternoon of 30 June 1877.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to adopt the}} Pentropic organisation was driven {{by a desire to}} modernise the Army and ensure that Australian units were able to integrate with those of the United States Army. While the US Pentomic organisation had been implemented in 1957 to improve the Army's ability to operate during a nuclear war, the Australian organisation was optimised for limited wars in South East Asia in which <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that nuclear weapons might be used. Both structures were designed to facilitate independent operations by the sub-units of divisions. The Australian Pentropic division was intended to be air portable, capable of fighting in a limited war and capable of conducting anti-guerrilla operations.|$|E
25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay.

And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E
25|$|Claudia Millian, who {{was also}} {{spending}} time in Paris, described Fondane's new focus on studying Christian theology and Catholic thought, from Hildebert to Gourmont's own Latin mystique (it was also at this stage that the Romanian writer acquired and sent home part of Gourmont's bibliophile collection). He coupled these activities {{with an interest in}} grouping together the cultural segments of the Romanian diaspora: around 1924, he and Millian were founding members of the Society of Romanian Writers in Paris, presided upon by the aristocrat Elena Văcărescu. Meanwhile, Fondane acquired a profile on the local literary scene, and, in his personal notes, claimed to have had his works praised by novelist André Gide and philosopher Jules de Gaultier. They both were his idols: Gide's work had shaped his own contribution in the prose poem genre, while Gaultier did the same for his philosophical outlook. The self-exiled debutant was nevertheless still viewing his career with despair, describing it as languishing, and noting that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of him failing to earn a solid literary reputation.|$|E
