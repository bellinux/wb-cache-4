5|$|As {{detected}} by the British, repairs to Tirpitz following Operation Tungsten progressed quickly. Work on repairing <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> began in late April, and 157 shipyard workers and special equipment were transported from Kiel in Germany to Kaafjord {{to accelerate the}} project. Assisted by the long hours of daylight at Kaafjord's latitude during summer, three shifts of personnel worked on Tirpitz each day. <b>The</b> <b>battleship</b> was capable of moving under her own power by 2 June, and ready to begin gunnery exercises {{at the end of}} that month. The repair works concluded in mid-July, though the battleship's starboard propeller shaft could only be used to drive her forwards. Captain Wolf Junge assumed command of <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> in May 1944, replacing Captain Hans Meyer who had been wounded during Operation Tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1950 the US {{fleet of}} battleships had been entirely decommissioned; however, Missouri was spared this fate {{due to the}} {{influence}} of President Harry S. Truman, a native Missourian, who refused to allow <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> to be decommissioned, and against the advice of Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan, and Chief of Naval Operations Louis E. Denfeld, Truman ordered Missouri to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> and partly because <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> had been christened by his daughter. As a result, Missouri was involved in various training and flag waving exercises at home and abroad between World War II and the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> was unable to put to sea for crew {{training}} due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E

50|$|In late 1944, <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> was reorganized {{into two}} type commands, each {{led by a}} vice admiral. Battleships Squadron One {{consisted}} of <b>the</b> Old <b>Battleships,</b> while Battleship Squadron Two consisted of <b>the</b> Fast <b>Battleships.</b>|$|R
5|$|Two of <b>the</b> Tegetthoff-class <b>battleships</b> were {{commissioned}} {{less than two}} years prior the beginning of World War I, while Prinz Eugen was commissioned the same month as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. <b>The</b> last <b>battleship</b> of <b>the</b> class, Szent István, was commissioned during the war in November1915. Prior to <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> in commission were assigned to <b>the</b> 1st <b>Battleship</b> Division of <b>the</b> 1st Battle Squadron of Austro-Hungarian Navy. During the war, the ships had limited service due to the Otranto Barrage, which prevented <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> from leaving <b>the</b> Adriatic Sea. As a result, they rarely left Pola. However, three of <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> participated in <b>the</b> flight of <b>the</b> German <b>battleships</b> SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau in 1914, and in the bombardment of the Italian city of Ancona in May 1915. (Szent István was still under construction). Following these operations and the completion of the Szent István, <b>the</b> Tegetthoff-class <b>battleships</b> remained in port {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|R

5|$|In {{an effort}} to spare <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> from scrapping, {{citizens}} of Massachusetts pooled resources {{to raise money for}} her transfer to the Massachusetts Memorial Committee, and in 1965 the Navy formally donated <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> to the committee. Massachusetts was towed to what would later be renamed Battleship Cove, Fall River, Massachusetts, and formally opened as a museum ship on 14 August 1965.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May, Rear Admiral L.S. Parks {{relieved}} Rear Admiral Crommelin as Commander, BatDiv 2. Departing Norfolk on 19 June, <b>the</b> <b>battleship,</b> {{over the}} ensuing weeks, conducted a midshipman training cruise through the Panama Canal to South American waters, and reached Valparaiso on 3 July. Eight days later, <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> {{headed back to}} the Panama Canal and the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|With {{the added}} missile {{capacity}} of <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> in <b>the</b> 1980s came additional fire-support systems to launch and guide the ordnance. To fire the Harpoon anti-ship missiles, <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> were {{equipped with the}} SWG-1 fire-control system, and to fire the Tomahawk missiles <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> used either <b>the</b> SWG-2 or SWG-3 fire-control system. In addition to these offensive-weapon systems, <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> were outfitted with the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie {{to be used as}} a lure against enemy torpedoes, an SLQ-32 electronic warfare system that can detect, jam, and deceive an opponent's radar and a Mark 36 SRBOC system to fire chaff rockets intended to confuse enemy missiles.|$|R
25|$|At 16:01 the Italian destroyers {{generated}} {{smoke and}} <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> got under cover. There is some debate about this point today, the Allied position being that <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> were leaving battle, the Italian {{that they were}} attempting to make a torpedo attack with their destroyers from within the smoke.|$|R

5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase had {{included}} removing the anchors from <b>the</b> <b>battleship,</b> but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} anchors to be reattached. His reason for doing so was that the anchor would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity forward to a narrower part of <b>the</b> <b>battleship,</b> thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.|$|E

5|$|Starting 10 December 2011, the USS Iowa {{was open}} for weekend tours. <b>The</b> <b>Battleship</b> Expo at the Port of Richmond {{included}} shipboard access and other exhibits such as 16-inch shells, a short film about <b>the</b> <b>battleship,</b> and other exhibits.

5|$|Owing to the {{original}} 1938 design of <b>the</b> <b>battleships,</b> <b>the</b> Tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to the Iowa-class unless <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> were physically rebuilt {{in such a way}} as to accommodate the missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch the Tomahawks. This realization prompted the removal of the anti-aircraft guns previously installed on the Iowas and the removal of four of each of the battleships' ten 5"/38DP mounts. The mid and aft end of <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> were then rebuilt to accommodate the missile magazines. This resulted in the construction of two separate platforms, one located between the first and second funnel and one located behind the second funnel, to which MK-143 Armored Box Launcher (ABL) canisters could be attached. Each Armored Box Launcher carried four missiles, and each of <b>the</b> <b>battleships</b> was outfitted with eight canisters, enabling the Iowa-class to carry and fire a total of 32 Tomahawk missiles.|$|R

5|$|The British Government and Royal Navy were {{concerned}} about the threat Tirpitz posed once she re-entered service. Allied intelligence tracked the progress of work on <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> using decrypted German radio signals, photo reconnaissance flights and eyewitness reports from agents in Norway. It was feared <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> could sortie and attack convoys in the Norwegian Sea or Atlantic Ocean after the repairs were completed. The need to guard against this possibility would also occupy warships needed to support the planned invasion of France. As a result, it was decided in late 1943 to make further attempts to sink <b>the</b> <b>battleship.</b>|$|E
5|$|The British {{attacked}} Tirpitz {{several times}} during 1942 and 1943. When <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> sortied to intercept Convoy PQ 12 on 6 March 1942 , which formed part of the convoy's escort, attempted to attack her using torpedo bombers. These aircraft launched twenty torpedoes at <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> but all missed. On several occasions during 1942 and 1943 bombers from the Royal Air Force and Soviet Air Forces attempted to strike Tirpitz in her anchorages without success. On 23 September 1943 two British X-class midget submarines succeeded in penetrating the defences around <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> at her main anchorage at Kaafjord in northern Norway during Operation Source, and placed explosive charges in the water beneath her. This attack caused extensive damage to Tirpitz, putting her out of service for six months.|$|E

5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a major threat}} to Allied shipping, the British military sought to damage or destroy <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> before she could re-enter service. Another midget submarine attack was considered impractical due to improvements to Kaafjord's defences, and the commander of the RAF's Bomber Command refused to attempt heavy bomber raids against <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> as he believed that such operations were unlikely to be successful and would result in heavy casualties. As a result, the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers were considered the best means of attacking Kaafjord, and the Admiralty directed the fleet to begin planning such a raid in late 1943. Following several months of preparations the Home Fleet's first attack on Kaafjord, which was designated Operation Tungsten, was conducted on 3 April 1944 and involved five aircraft carriers. The two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters were not detected during their flights to Kaafjord, and <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> was hit by 15 bombs. Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties, but the ship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, the damage inflicted on Tirpitzs superstructure, armament and engines was sufficient to put her out of service for several months while repairs were completed. The commander of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, placed a priority on returning <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> to service so that she could continue to tie down Allied naval resources. He and other senior German officers recognised at this time that the threat of further air attacks meant that Tirpitz could no longer operate against Allied convoys.|$|E
5|$|As the {{intelligence}} {{available to them}} was not conclusive, the Allies believed that Tirpitz still posed a potential threat. Accordingly, Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons made two further attacks on <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> after she moved to Tromsø on 15 October; these operations were more straightforward to conduct than Operation Paravane as the port was {{within the range of}} Lancasters flying from airfields in northern Scotland. The first raid, Operation Obviate, took place on 29 October but caused only minor damage to <b>the</b> <b>battleship.</b> During the subsequent attack conducted on 12 November, Operation Catechism, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E
5|$|Between being {{commissioned}} in 1896 and {{the outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War in 1898, Massachusetts conducted training exercises off the eastern coast of the United States. During the war, she was placed in the Flying Squadron under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley. Schley went searching for Cervera's Spanish squadron and found it in the port of Santiago. <b>The</b> <b>battleship</b> was part of the blockade fleet until 3 July, but missed the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, because she had steamed to Guantánamo Bay the night before to resupply coal. The next day, <b>the</b> <b>battleship</b> came back to Santiago, where she and Texas fired at the Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedes, which was being scuttled by the Spanish in a failed attempt to block the harbor entrance channel.|$|E
