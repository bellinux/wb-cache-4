5|$|Determining {{the nature}} of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter-mass planet on an {{eccentric}} orbit. Dust would collect in orbits that have mean-motion resonances with this planet—where their orbital periods form integer fractions with <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet—producing the resulting clumpiness.|$|E

5|$|In the Central Asian-Turkic myths, Jupiter {{is called}} Erendiz or Erentüz, from eren (of {{uncertain}} meaning) and yultuz ("star"). There are many {{theories about the}} meaning of eren.

5|$|More recent investigations, mainly {{based on}} {{original}} medical reports from <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pandemic, {{found that the}} viral infection itself was not more aggressive than any previous influenza, but that the special circumstances (malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, poor hygiene) promoted bacterial superinfection that killed most of the victims typically after a somewhat prolonged death bed.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{writers of}} Latin from Africa during the Imperial period include the novelist Apuleius, and the Church Fathers Tertullian and Augustine.

2500|$|Aryabhata (476–550), in his magnum opus Aryabhatiya (499), propounded a {{computational}} {{system based}} on a planetary model in which the Earth was taken to be spinning on its axis and <b>the</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planets were given {{with respect to the}} Sun.

30|$|The {{periodic}} environment {{means that}} <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> nutrient and inhibitors is periodic with <b>the</b> same <b>period.</b> As being {{pointed out by}} a referee, and I agree, the model used here can be extended to a more general one that <b>the</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> nutrient and inhibitors {{are assumed to be}} different. If <b>the</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> nutrient and inhibitors are assumed to be different, do these results remain true or not?

5|$|Although a few hagiographies, or saints' biographies, {{about native}} British saints survive from <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mission, none {{describes}} native Christians as active missionaries amongst the Anglo-Saxons.

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} at Dwarka, both {{on shore}} and offshore in the Arabian Sea, {{have been performed}} by the Archaeological Survey of India. The first investigations carried out on land in 1963 revealed many artifacts. Excavations done at two sites on the seaward side of Dwarka brought to light submerged settlements, a large stone-built jetty, and triangular stone anchors with three holes. The settlements are {{in the form of}} exterior and interior walls, and fort bastions. From the typological classification of the anchors it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle kingdoms of India. Coastal erosion was probably the cause of the destruction of what was an ancient port.|$|E
5|$|As {{the state}} religion, Saivism enjoyed all the prerogatives of the {{establishment}} during <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jaffna kingdom. The Aryacakravarti dynasty was very conscious of its duties as a patron towards Saivism because of the patronage given by its ancestors to the Rameswaram temple, a well-known pilgrimage center of Indian Hinduism. As noted, one of the titles assumed by the kings was Setukavalan or protector of Setu another name for Rameswaram. Setu was used in their coins {{as well as in}} inscriptions as marker of the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the period}} Scotland had adopted many of the major tenets of the European Renaissance in art, {{architecture}} and literature and produced a developed educational system.

5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers {{were making}} {{systematic}} {{observations of the}} positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, {{rather than from the}} less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E
