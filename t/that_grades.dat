25|$|In August 2014, {{a faculty}} {{committee}} tasked by Dean of the College Valerie Smith {{to review the}} effectiveness of grade deflation found {{not only that the}} 35% target was both often misinterpreted as a hard quota and applied inconsistently across departments, but also <b>that</b> <b>grades</b> had begun to decline in 2003, the year before the policy was implemented. The committee concluded that the observed lower grades since 2003 were the result of discussions and increased awareness during and since the implementation of the deflation policy, and not the deflation targets themselves, so recommended removing the numerical targets while charging individual departments with developing consistent standards for grading. In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed as recommended by the committee.|$|E
50|$|After {{joining the}} Cork under-21 hurling team, Barry-Murphy enjoyed further success.

500|$|The {{academic}} program grants {{a bachelor of}} science degree with a curriculum <b>that</b> <b>grades</b> cadets' performance upon a broad {{academic program}}, military leadership performance, and mandatory participation in competitive athletics. Cadets are required {{to adhere to the}} Cadet Honor Code, which states that [...] "a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do." [...] The academy bases a cadet's leadership experience as a development of all three pillars of performance: academics, physical, and military.|$|E
500|$|New {{features}} include a grading system <b>that</b> <b>grades</b> the player {{based on the}} time it takes for them to complete the level; they can return to levels later to try for a higher grade. There is a point system based on the one in Sonic Advance 2 but displaying points in multiple categories. There is also a [...] "Tension Gauge" [...] {{on the left side of}} the screen which is filled by doing tricks and defeating enemies. The energy it generates allows the player to use boosts of speed while moving; defeating enemies, moving through the level more quickly which results in more points and a higher grade, and when playing as Sonic, accessing the special stage. Although the game is primarily two-dimensional, there are three-dimensional elements which create a 2.5D effect. For the first time in the series, Sonic and Blaze's sprites are rendered in 3D. The game's boss battles are 3D.|$|E
2500|$|Students are officers-in-training and are {{referred}} to as cadets. Tuition for cadets is fully funded by the Coast Guard in exchange for an obligation of five years active duty service upon graduation. This obligation increases if the cadet chooses to go to flight school or graduate school. Approximately 250 cadets enter the academy each summer, with about 200 graduating. Graduates are commissioned as ensigns. The academic program grants a Bachelor of Science degree in one of eight majors, with a curriculum <b>that</b> <b>grades</b> cadets' performance upon a holistic education of academics, physical fitness, character, and leadership.|$|E

2500|$|The upper {{member of}} the Dox Formation is the Ochoa Point Member. Within the central Grand Canyon, it also has been removed by pre-Tapeats Sandstone erosion. It {{consists}} of micaceous mudstone <b>that</b> <b>grades</b> upward into a predominantly red quartzose, silty sandstone. Sedimentary structures found in this member include, salt crystal casts in the mudstone, and asymmetrical ripple marks and small-scale cross beds, in the sandstones. The Ochoa Point Member is [...] thick and forms steep slopes and cliffs below the Cardenas Basalt. The Dox Formation that directly underlies the Cardenas Basalt consists of brick-red to vermilion well-bedded sandstone, with parallel bedding and shaly partings, forming smooth slopes. It also contains a thin, discontinuous basaltic lava flow.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} liberal-arts {{colleges in the}} U.S. either do not issue grades at all (such as Alverno College, Antioch College, Bennington College, The Evergreen State College, [...] New College of Florida, and Hampshire College), {{de-emphasize}} them (St. John's College, Reed College, Sarah Lawrence College, Prescott College, College of the Atlantic), or do not calculate grade point averages (Brown University). In all cases, the rationale is <b>that</b> <b>grades</b> alone do not provide {{a clear picture of}} academic aptitude or of potential for success, and that learning, not achieving the highest score, should be the goal of a liberal education {{as is the case in}} graduate programs. In many cases, narrative evaluations are used as an alternative measurement system. Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn is one of several secondary schools to eschew grades in favor of narrative reports, while still managing to be the number one high school in the country for having the highest percentage of graduating seniors enroll in Ivy League and several other highly selective colleges.|$|E
2500|$|In her view, {{two-thirds of}} this {{evaluation}} {{is based on}} tests, while only one third is based on grades, leading her to conclude at one point <b>that</b> <b>grades</b> were less important overall as a factor than test scores, while in a different chapter she also suggested that the high school transcript information described roughly 60% of the college's perception of a student's academic performance. Next, the composite academic index score was combined with an analysis of personal factors such as extracurricular activity or the essay, such that the academic factor was weighted 70% to 85% while the personal evaluation was weighted only 30% to 15%. Generally the particulars of the mathematical formulas are not revealed to the public, and different colleges have different formulas. Part {{of the purpose of}} algorithms is to expedite the handling of thousands of applications in a short amount of time. For example, at Dartmouth College, data goes into a master card for each application, which leads to a ready sheet, where readers summarize applications; then, an initial screening is done: top applications go directly to the director of admissions for approval while lackluster ones go to another director. Dartmouth uses [...] "A" [...] for accept, [...] "R" [...] for reject, [...] "P" [...] for possible, with [...] "P+" [...] and [...] "P-" [...] being variants. A committee might spend a week with the [...] "P" [...] ones, of which they only accept about a sixth, according to Hernandez.|$|E

6000|$|This point {{seems to}} need some illustration. Suppose that all the [...] lands in a {{community}} are of five different grades of [...] productiveness.

When a man rents a [...] farm, he always gets land of varying degrees of fertility within [...] its limits.

Moreover, [...] suppose that lands down to grade three paid rent when A took the [...] farm; now, if the price of produce rises slightly, grade four may [...] pay something, but possibly not enough to warrant any rent going [...] to a landlord.
