40|$|This {{project is}} {{oriented}} {{to the development}} of a Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software to control and supervise electrical variables from a scaled platform that represents a meshed HVDC grid employing National Instruments hardware and LabVIEW logic environment. The objective is to obtain real time visualization of DC and AC electrical variables and a lossless data stream acquisition. The acquisition system hardware elements have been configured, tested and installed on the grid platform. The system is composed of three chassis, each inside of a VSC <b>terminal</b> <b>cabinet,</b> with integrated Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), one of them connected via PCI bus to a local processor and the rest too via Ethernet through a switch. Analogical acquisition modules were A/D conversion takes place are inserted into the chassis. A personal computer is used as host, screen terminal and storing space. There are two main access modes to the FPGAs through the real time system. It has been implemented a Scan mode VI to monitor all the grid DC signals and a faster FPGA access mode VI to monitor one converter AC and DC values. The FPGA application consists of two tasks running at different rates and a FIFO has been implemented to communicate between them without data loss. Multiple structures have been tested on the grid platform and evaluated, ensuring the compliance of previously established specifications, such as sampling and scanning rate, screen refreshment or possible data loss. Additionally a turbine emulator was implemented and tested in Labview for further testing...|$|E
40|$|The work is {{focusing}} on dynamic effects of short-circuit currents, more precisely dynamic effects of short-circuit currents on switchgear <b>cabinet</b> (<b>terminal</b> box). The work was designated to a concrete construction type of two switchgear cabinets located on rotating machines via company Siemens Electric Machines Dr√°sov s. r. o [...] The switchgear cabinets are designed for non-explosive environment where the air is used as an insulating medium. The task was {{to determine how the}} device will behave during the three-phase short-circuit and three-phase short-circuit with earth/ground connection. The following programs were used for the calculations and simulations: Ansoft Maxwell 16. 0, Ansoft Maxwell 2015 and ANSYS Workbench 16. 0. By using these programs the effects of forces which acts on current paths in cabinet caused by the passage of short-circuit current were simulated, statically and also dynamically. Further the effects of pressure acting on cabinet frame during the arc short-circuit have been statically and dynamically simulated. All the results are summarized in the conclusion. Conclusion also contains the final evaluation of the functionality of both switchgear cabinets...|$|R
5000|$|The Great Depression plunged the {{government}} into a <b>terminal</b> crisis. The <b>Cabinet</b> {{agreed that it}} was essential to maintain the Gold Standard and that the Budget needed to be balanced, but were divided over reducing unemployment benefits by 10%. At first, Henderson gave strong support to Prime Minister MacDonald throughout the financial and political crisis of August. The financial crisis across Europe was worsening and Britain's gold reserves were at high risk. New York banks provided an emergency loan; but additional money was needed and to get it, the budget had to be balanced. MacDonald and Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden proposed cuts in unemployment benefits. Henderson rejected that solution and became the leader of nearly half the Cabinet. The Labour Cabinet decided to resign. The king implored MacDonald to remain and form an all-party National government that would make the budget cuts. MacDonald agreed on 24 August 1931 and formed an emergency National Government, with members from all parties. The new cabinet had four Labourites (now called [...] "National Labour Party") who stood with Macdonald, plus four Conservatives and two Liberals. Labour unions were strongly opposed and the Labour Party officially repudiated the new National government. It expelled MacDonald and his supporters from the party. Henderson cast the only vote against the expulsions. Against his own inclinations, Henderson accepted the leadership of the main Labour Party and led it into the general election on 27 October against the cross-party National coalition. It was a disastrous result for Labour, which was reduced to a small minority of 52. MacDonald won the largest landslide in British electoral history, Yet again Henderson lost his seat, at Burnley. The following year, he relinquished the party leadership.|$|R
