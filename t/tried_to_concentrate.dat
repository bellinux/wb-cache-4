25|$|Part of Lee's {{difficulty}} at Test {{level is}} {{that the benefits of}} his high speed, which give the batsmen less reaction time, also results in more erratic bowling. In recent times he has <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> solely on accuracy by reducing speed. During the first Test against the West Indies in late 2005 at the Gabba, after declaring that he would sacrifice pace and focus on 'line and length', Lee reverted to his initial style of bowling, based on the advice of his captain Ricky Ponting after his new method of bowling failed in the first innings. This saw him take 5/30 his fifth five-wicket haul in Tests, his first in four years.|$|E
25|$|Nothing was fixed: A deity {{could be}} {{identified}} both as a honji and a suijaku {{in different parts of}} the same shrine, and different identifications could be believed to be true at the same time and place. The religious situation during the Middle Ages was, therefore, confused and confusing. Historians have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> on the reformers of that age with a clear way philosophy and little interest in kami questions because they are easier to understand. The theory was ultimately beneficial to the kami, which went from being considered unilluminated outsiders to actual forms assumed by important deities. The ultimate expression of this shift is Ryōbu Shintō, in which Buddhist deities and kami are indivisible and equivalent like the two sides of a coin.|$|E
25|$|Joffe {{was one of}} the Soviet delegates at the Genoa Conference in February 1922, an {{experience}} he described in a short book published later that same year. After the Soviet walkout, he was made ambassador to China, as the Soviet troubleshooter (or Kuznetsov) of those days. In 1923, Joffe signed an agreement with Sun Yat-Sen in Shanghai on aid to Kuomintang {{on the assumption that the}} latter would cooperate with Chinese Communists, presumably with Lenin's approval. While in China, Joffe traveled to Japan in June 1923 to settle Soviet-Japanese relations. The negotiations proved long and difficult and were aborted when Joffe became gravely ill and had to be sent back to Moscow. After a partial recovery, he served as a member of the Soviet delegation to Great Britain in 1924 and as Soviet representative in Austria in 1924–1926. In 1926 his declining health and disagreements with the ruling Bolshevik faction forced his semi-retirement. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> on teaching, but it also proved difficult due to his illness.|$|E

500|$|Rozhestvensky {{decided to}} take the most direct route to Vladivostok using the Tsushima Strait and was intercepted by the Japanese battlefleet under the command of Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō on 27 May 1905. At the {{beginning}} of the battle, Imperator Alexandr III was second in line behind Rozhestvensky's flagship, [...] Very little is known of the ship's actions during the battle as there were no survivors from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle, but Captain W. C. Pakenham, the Royal Navy's official military observer under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, noted that she was set on fire early in the engagement. She did initially follow Knyaz Suvorov when that ship's steering was damaged about a half-hour after the Japanese opened fire at 14:10, but turned north when her captain, Nikolai Bukhvostov, realized that Knyaz Suvorov was out of control. Tōgō <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> his fire on the crippled Knyaz Suvorov around 16:00, but Bukhvostov turned Imperator Alexandr III straight for the Japanese battleline in a successful attempt to focus their attention on his ship. He was successful, but she was badly damaged in the process. Observers noted that her bow was badly damaged and that there was a large hole in the forward hull on the port side. When the shooting resumed around 18:00, the Japanese concentrated their fire upon the ship and her sister, [...] Imperator Alexandr III sheered out of line to port around 18:30 and capsized, but did not sink until 19:07; there were no survivors.|$|E
2500|$|She {{helped the}} girls change into long white nightgowns. She then softly combed their hair. Misch <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> {{on his work}} but {{he knew what was}} going to happen. Magda then went back up to the Vorbunker with the children. Shortly thereafter, Werner Naumann came down to the Führerbunker and told Misch that he had seen Hitler's {{personal}} physician, Dr Stumpfegger give the children something [...] "sweetened" [...] to drink. About two hours later, Magda came back down to the Führerbunker, alone. She looked very pale, her eyes very red and her face was [...] "frozen". She sat down at a table and began playing patience. Goebbels then came over to her, but did not say a word at that time.|$|E
60|$|All the same, Lister was proud. The girl {{belonged to}} a circle he could not enter, and if he got promotion, it must be by his merits. He was not the man to get forward by intrigue and the clever use of a woman's influence; he had no talent {{for that kind of}} thing. He let it go, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> on his calculations.|$|E

60|$|She {{stepped forward}} compelling, commanding, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> in her glance all her will power, {{the sense of}} her own right to dispose of herself and her claim to be served to the last moment of her life.

60|$|She {{threw herself}} into an easy chair, and John <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> his {{attention}} upon the balls. More than once, however, he glanced across at his hostess. She was looking older this morning, paler, {{her face a}} little drawn, her eyes large and soft. She sat looking into the fire; on her knee were some letters, at which she scarcely glanced. Presently she threw them aside and rang the bell.|$|E
60|$|Time stood still. Baxter's {{thoughts}} {{began to}} wander. He {{knew that this}} was fatal and exerted himself to drag them back. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> his mind on some one definite thing. He selected the scarab as a suitable object, but it played him false. He had hardly concentrated on the scarab before his mind was straying off to ancient Egypt, to Mr. Peters' dyspepsia, and on a dozen other branch lines of thought.|$|E
60|$|Yet, when Una {{returned}} to the flat, something was gone. She <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> on thought about immortality. She found that she had absolutely no facts upon which to base her thought. The hundreds of good, sound, orthodox sermons she had heard gave her nothing but vague pictures of an eternal church supper somewhere in the clouds--nothing, blankly and terribly nothing, that answered her bewildered wonder as to {{what had become of}} the spirit which had been there and now was gone.|$|E

60|$|She {{stood up}} in front of a mirror, over which she lighted a shaded candle, and for a moment or two her white hands flashed deftly in and out amongst the dark, silky coils of disordered hair. Paul sat down, and taking up a {{magazine}} which he found lying on the divan, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> his thoughts upon its contents. But he could not. Every moment he found his eyes and his thoughts straying to that slim, lithe figure, watching the play of her arms and the grace of her backward pose. When she looked suddenly round, on the completion of her task, their eyes met.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he began}} to puzzle about a {{likeness}} to somebody he knew. He had remarked this before, but the likeness was faint and eluded him. Lighting his pipe, he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> his thoughts, and by and by made an abrupt movement. He had it! When he was in British Columbia, engaged {{on the construction of}} a section of the railroad that was being built among the mountains, he met a young Englishman at a mining settlement. The lad had been ill and was not strong enough to undertake manual labor, which was the only occupation {{to be found in the}} neighborhood. Moreover, he had lost his money, in consequence, Festing gathered, of his trusting dangerous companions.|$|E
60|$|For {{ten minutes}} or more I sat idle, with the pen in my hand, {{thinking}} over {{the events of the}} last twelve hours. When I at last addressed myself to my task, I found a difficulty in proceeding with it which I had never experienced before. In spite of my efforts to fix my thoughts on the matter in hand, they wandered away with the strangest persistency in the one direction of Sir Percival and the Count, and all the interest which I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> on my journal centred instead in that private interview between them which had been put off all through the day, and which was now to take place in the silence and solitude of the night.|$|E
50|$|It {{shows the}} artworks that pleased {{them and they}} did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> in one {{direction}} or the other. Typical for the collection is the personal liking of an object or an interest in its material, a certain coloring or in its provenance. For instance they often collected ethnological art. But it could very well be that their eye fell on an abstract canvas of Kees van Bohemen or a woodcut of Hokusai.|$|R

60|$|He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> {{his senses}} on the sword-play; but {{one half of}} his brain was wrestling with the puzzle; the apocalyptic and almost seraphic {{apparition}} of a stout constable out of Clapham {{on top of a}} dreary and deserted hill in France. He did not, however, have to puzzle long. Before the duellists had exchanged half a dozen passes, the big, blue policeman appeared once more {{on the top of the}} hill, a palpable monstrosity in the eye of heaven. He was waving only one arm now and seemed to be shouting directions. At the same moment a mass of blue blocked the corner of the road behind the small, smart figure of Turnbull, and a small company of policemen in the English uniform came up at a kind of half-military double.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pett was by {{this time}} heartily regretting the impulse which had caused her to {{telephone}} to Mr. Sturgis. In a career which had had {{more than its share}} of detectives, both real and fictitious, she had never been confronted with a detective like this. The galling thing was that she was helpless. After all, one engaged a detective for his or her shrewdness and efficiency, not for suavity and polish. A detective who hurls speech at you through clenched teeth and yet detects is better value for the money than one who, though an ideal companion for the drawing-room, is incompetent: and Mrs. Pett, like most other people, subconsciously held the view that the ruder a person is the more efficient he must be. It is but rarely that any one is found who is not dazzled by the glamour of incivility. She crushed down her resentment at her visitor's tone, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> her mind on the fact that this was a business matter and that what she wanted was results rather than fair words. She found it easier to do this when looking at the other's face. It was a capable face. Not beautiful, perhaps, but full of promise of action. Miss Trimble having ceased temporarily to speak, her mouth was in repose, and when her mouth was in repose it looked more efficient than anything else of its size in existence.|$|E
60|$|He spoke quietly, leaning {{with one}} elbow {{against the side}} of his reading stand. The {{occasional}} pulsations of applause were almost immediately hushed, as though the people feared to lose even a word that should fall from his dry lips. What was it he was talking about? I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> my attention, with only partial success. He was explaining the new theory of city government that did not attempt to evade, but dealt frankly with the human needs of to-day, and sought to meet those needs in a positive way... What had happened to me, though I did not realize it, was that I had gradually come under the influence of a tragic spell not attributable to the words I heard, existing independently of them, pervading the spacious hall, weaving into unity dissentient minds. And then, with what seemed a retarded rather than sudden awareness, I knew that he had stopped speaking. Once more he ran his hand through his hair, he was seemingly groping for words that would not come. I was pierced by a strange agony--the amazing source of which, seemed to be a smile on the face of Hermann Krebs, an ineffable smile illuminating the place like a flash of light, in which suffering and tragedy, comradeship and loving kindness--all were mingled. He stood for a moment with that smile on his face--swayed, and would have fallen {{had it not been for}} the quickness of a man on the platform behind him, and into whose arms he sank.|$|E

60|$|But Baldassarre's mind {{rejected}} {{the thought of}} that brief punishment. His whole soul had been thrilled into immediate unreasoning belief in that eternity of vengeance where he, an undying hate, might clutch for ever an undying traitor, and hear that fair smiling hardness cry and moan with anguish. But the primary need and hope was to see a slow revenge under the same sky and on the same earth where he himself had been forsaken and had fainted with despair. And {{as soon as he}} <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>concentrate</b> his mind on the means of attaining his end, the sense of his weakness pressed upon him like a frosty ache. This despised body, which was to be the instrument of a sublime vengeance, must be nourished and decently clad. If he had to wait he must labour, and his labour must be of a humble sort, for he had no skill. He wondered whether the sight of written characters would so stimulate his faculties that he might venture to try and find work as a copyist: that might win him some credence for his past scholarship. But no! he dared trust neither hand nor brain. He must be content to do the work that was most like that of a beast of burden: in this mercantile city many porters must be wanted, and he could at least carry weights. Thanks to the justice that struggled in this confused world in behalf of vengeance, his limbs had got back some of their old sturdiness. He was stripped of all else that men would give coin for.|$|E
