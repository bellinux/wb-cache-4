5|$|According to Eusebius of Caesarea, Pamphilus of Caesarea {{was born}} into a rich family in Beirut {{in the latter half of}} the 3rd century and {{attended}} its law school. Pamphilus later became the presbyter of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers Aphian and Aedesius, born to a noble Lycian family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for <b>their</b> <b>beliefs.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} propositions about causes differ in meaning from those about {{enabling}} conditions: with a cause {{the effect is}} necessary, whereas with an enabler it is possible. But, the salient mental model {{is the same for}} both. We report an experiment that tested this difference in a study of belief revision. The results showed that causes and enabling conditions are revised differently. On trials in which participants encountered information consistent with an earlier interpretation, most of them maintained <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> in a particular enabling condition whereas only half of the participants maintained <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> in a particular cause. On trials in which they encountered information inconsistent with an earlier interpretation, just over half of them switched <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> in a particular enabling condition whereas the majority of participants maintained <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> in a particular cause. We discuss the results with reference to theories of causality...|$|R

5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. Some of those {{who claimed to have}} witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches {{is a book}} {{composed}} by the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland that was published in 1899. It contains what he believed was the religious text {{of a group of}} pagan witches in Tuscany, Italy that documented <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> and rituals, although various historians and folklorists have disputed the existence of such a group. In the 20th century, the book was very influential {{in the development of the}} contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca. Aradia is also the name of a character in the webcomic Homestuck, created by Andrew Hussie.|$|E

With a two-thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have to vote for the same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E

5|$|Harry Toulmin (sometimes called Henry Toulmin) (April 7, 1766 – November 11, 1823) was a Unitarian {{minister}} and politician. The son of noted Dissenting minister Joshua Toulmin, Toulmin fled his native England for the United States {{after he and}} his followers were persecuted for <b>their</b> <b>beliefs.</b> He arrived in Virginia in 1793, and aided by recommendations from Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe, he was chosen president of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in Lexington, Kentucky. His Unitarian views, however, offended many of the orthodox Presbyterian members of Transylvania's board of regents, and Toulmin resigned after two years.|$|E
5|$|In 1852 {{the family}} settled at Greencastle, Indiana, where Lilly's parents {{enrolled}} him at Indiana Asbury University (later known as DePauw University). Eli attended classes from 1852 to 1854. He also assisted {{at a local}} printing press as a printer's devil. Lilly {{grew up in a}} Methodist household, and his family was prohibitionist and anti-slavery; <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> served as part of their motivation for moving to Indiana. Lilly and his family were members of the Democratic Party during his early life, but they became Republicans during the years leading up to the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Since then, most criticisms and denials of {{evolution}} {{have come from}} religious groups, {{rather than from the}} scientific community. Although many religious groups have found reconciliation of <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> with evolution, such as through theistic evolution, other religious groups continue to reject evolutionary explanations in favor of creationism, the belief that the universe and life were created by supernatural forces. The U.S.-centered creation–evolution controversy has become a focal point of perceived conflict between religion and science.|$|E
40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that people tend to conceal some aspects of their status (e. g., HIV positive diagnosis, homosexual orientation) because they fear that they will be stigmatized (Chaudoir, 2009), however little to no research exists regarding the divulgence of beliefs that may be stigmatized (e. g., belief in Bigfoot, ghosts, unconventional religious beliefs). My thesis extends research on concealable stigmatized status to research on stigmatized beliefs, by examining the degree to which people’s feelings about disclosure of stigmatized beliefs are impacted by anticipated responses from other people. I investigated this issue by asking participants to write about either a conventional or an unconventional belief that they held, and then imagining a response by a confidant that was either supportive or unsupportive. The dependent variables measured the participant’s perceptions of <b>their</b> <b>belief,</b> how they relate to others socially with <b>their</b> <b>belief,</b> and <b>their</b> anticipated affective state after their confidant reacted to <b>their</b> <b>belief.</b> It was found that participants’ perceptions of the acceptability and the commonality of the belief were greater for conventional beliefs. In addition, participants expected their willingness to share <b>their</b> <b>belief,</b> as well as their experience of positive emotions to increase when the confidant reacted supportively to <b>their</b> <b>belief...</b>|$|R

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and neurological studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and neurological studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond never {{returned}} to Antioch (he went to Sicily where he died in 1111), and the carefully constructed clauses of the Treaty were never implemented. Bohemond's nephew, Tancred, refused to honor the Treaty. In his mind, Antioch was his by right of conquest. He {{saw no reason to}} hand it over to someone who had not been involved in the Crusade, and had indeed actively worked against it (as the Crusaders believed). The Crusaders seem to have felt Alexios had tricked Bohemond into giving him Antioch; they already believed Alexios was devious and untrustworthy and this may have confirmed <b>their</b> <b>beliefs.</b> The treaty referred to Tancred as the illegal holder of Antioch, and Alexios had expected Bohemond to expel him or somehow control him. Tancred also did not allow a Greek Patriarch to enter the city; instead, Greek Patriarchs were appointed in Constantinople and nominally held power there.|$|E
5|$|Converts were {{provided}} with elaborate details of Ernest and Ruth Norman's purported spiritual visits to other planets. The couple believed that humans could learn from great teachers on these journeys; Ernest said that this contact held the potential to educate and heal humanity. Ernest also spoke of the scientific advancements of other worlds. The couple also discussed revelations about their past lives, including Jesus and Mary of Bethany among their past identities. Ruth stated that she had lived about 50lives over several million years; she recalled being several well-known and a few obscure people on Earth, as well as beings from other planets and an archangel. Their group developed a mythology from the accounts that Ernest and Ruth gave of these lives, including tales from their past incarnations in Atlantis and Lemuria. Some of their stories were similar to the plots of contemporary books and films, prompting Tumminia to cast <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> as a pastiche or bricolage of the surrounding culture.|$|E

5|$|Given {{its subject}} matter, the episode {{features}} many references to witchcraft and occultism. The nurse from the episode, Rebecca Waite, was originally {{named after a}} friend of the writers called Rebecca White. However, this was changed because there was a real nurse from Chicago whose last name was White. Some viewers ended up believing that Waite's name as a reference to either Rebecca Nurse, an innocent woman prosecuted during the Salem witch trials, or the Rider-Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck utilized in the world. The episode itself directly references Gerald Gardner, a wiccan known for publishing several books on witchcraft and founder of the Gardnerian Tradition. While the Mayhew sisters tried to depict occultism without offending anybody by not connecting Franklin or Waite to any known cult, many Wiccans sent angry letters and e-mails to Fox regarding the portrayal of <b>their</b> <b>beliefs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon reopening his business, Johnson started {{publishing}} theological and political works by Priestley and other Dissenters. Starting in the 1770s, Johnson published more specifically Unitarian works, {{as well as}} texts advocating religious toleration; he also became personally involved in the Unitarian cause. He served as a conduit for information between Dissenters {{across the country and}} supplied provincial publishers with religious publications, thereby enabling Dissenters to spread <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> easily. Johnson participated in efforts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the civil rights of Dissenters. In one six-year period of the 1770s, Johnson was responsible for publishing nearly one-third of the Unitarian works on the issue. He continued his support in 1787, 1789, and 1790, when Dissenters introduced repeal bills in Parliament, and he published much of the pro-repeal literature written by Priestley and others.|$|E
5|$|Le souper de Beaucaire was a {{political}} pamphlet written by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1793. With the French Revolution into its fourth year, civil war had spread across France between various rival political factions. Napoleon was involved in military action, on the government's side, against some rebellious cities of southern France. It was during these events, in 1793, that he spoke with four merchants from the Midi and heard their views. As a loyal soldier of the Republic he responded in turn, set on dispelling the fears of the merchants and discouraging <b>their</b> <b>beliefs.</b> He later wrote about his conversation {{in the form of}} a pamphlet, calling for an end to the civil war.|$|E
