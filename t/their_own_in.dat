Ukraine was the first ex-USSR country to win twice.|$|E
5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, Wallis's aunt Bessie Merryman was widowed, and the {{following}} year Alice and Wallis moved into her four-bedroom house on West Chase Street, Baltimore, where they lived {{for at least a}} year until they settled in an apartment, and then a house, of <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> 1908, Wallis's mother married her second husband, John Freeman Rasin, son of a prominent Democratic party boss.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the giant}} planets {{probably}} had accretion disks of <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>in</b> the first {{meaning of the}} word.

The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants {{have been known to}} lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> the 2009 Yukon Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon Quest International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.|$|E
5|$|Dreyer {{shot and}} edited {{the film in}} France and then brought it to Berlin where it was post-synchronized in both German and French. Dreyer did the audio work at Universum Film AG, as they had the best sound {{equipment}} available {{to him at the}} time. Most of the actors did not dub their own voices. The only voices of the actors that are <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> the film are of Schmitz and Gunzburg. The sounds of dogs, parrots, and other animals in the film were fake and were done by professional imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film's score and worked with Dreyer to develop the music.|$|E
5|$|During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain pioneered European {{exploration}} of the globe, {{and in the process}} established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> the Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then, following union between England and Scotland in 1707, Great Britain, the dominant colonial power in North America. It then became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757.|$|E

In October 2013, Kele assembled a DJ Mix for !K7's Tapes mix series, released under the Bloc Party name. In September 2014, Okereke stated that Bloc Party were working on a fifth album. In March 2015, bassist Gordon Moakes tweeted he had parted ways with Bloc Party. Following the departure of their former members Okereke and Lissack started to work on new songs on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> late 2014.|$|E
5|$|Funding on the paving project between Buck Hill and the {{boundary}} of the national lakeshore was held up, pending passage of a technical corrections bill by the US Senate. The original funding authorization specified that sections were being repaved; instead they were being paved {{for the first time}} or realigned. A technical corrections bill solved the legal hurdles involved. The road commission used state matching grants from the Michigan Department of Transportation to complete the financing needed to pave the roadway. Local officials received the checks to pay for the projects at a ceremony in August 2008. While the county completed a segment on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> 2006, the 2008 projects paved segments of the roadway outside of the national lakeshore boundaries from Buck Hill northwards. Construction in 2009 and 2010 completed the roadway inside the park boundaries, including a new bridge over the Hurricane River.|$|E
5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to declare war on each other, starting World War I.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to intervene personally in Ireland. He took a large army into south Wales, forcing the rebels who had held the area since 1165 into submission prior to sailing from Pembroke and landing in Ireland in October 1171. Some of the Irish lords appealed to Henry {{to protect them from}} the Anglo-Norman invaders, while de Clare offered to submit to Henry if he was allowed to retain his new possessions. Henry's timing was influenced by several factors, including encouragement from Pope Alexander, who saw the opportunity to establish papal authority over the Irish church. The critical factor though appears to have been Henry's concern that his nobles in the Welsh Marches would acquire independent territories of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> Ireland, beyond the reach of his authority. Henry's intervention was successful, and both the Irish and Anglo-Normans in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule.|$|E
5|$|In August 1942, the Allies {{succeeded in}} {{repelling}} a second attack against El Alamein and, {{at a high}} cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta. A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya. This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, {{which resulted in the}} region joining the Allies. Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France; although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces. The now pincered Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942 the Royal Marines were tasked to organise Commando {{units of}} <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> total nine Commando units were {{formed by the}} Royal Marines: No. 40, No. 41, No. 42, No. 43, No. 44, No. 45, No. 46, No. 47 and the last, No. 48, which was only formed in 1944. In 1943 two other Commando units were formed. The first was the Royal Naval Commandos, who were {{established}} to carry out tasks associated with establishing, maintaining, and controlling beachheads during amphibious operations. The other was the Royal Air Force Commandos, who would accompany an invasion force either to make enemy airfields serviceable, or to make new airstrips operational and contribute to their defence.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} quarter against Navy, Scarbath scored on a quarterback keeper. Before the half, he {{completed}} passes to ends Stan Karnash and Pete Augsburger for 44- and 59-yard touchdowns. In the third quarter, the Midshipmen responded with a score of <b>their</b> <b>own.</b> <b>In</b> the final period, Maryland end Elmer Wingate returned an interception 34 yards for another touchdown. Then, 54 seconds later, end Lew Weidensaul recovered a Midshipmen fumble, which allowed Ed Modzelewski to rush five yards for the final score by the Terrapins. Navy scored twice more, but Maryland held on to win, 35–21.|$|E
5|$|Substantial combat {{had ended}} {{but the war}} had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, and had a {{powerful}} fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> 1782–83. Money matters fed the anxiety; the treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive {{almost to the point}} of mutiny. At one point, they forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton. Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783, and Congress came up with the promise of a five-year bonus.|$|E
5|$|Tradition and old records {{assert that}} {{southern}} Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was inhabited very early by hunter-gatherers of Khoisan descent. Although {{most of these}} early inhabitants {{are believed to have}} been either overwhelmed, driven away or, in some cases, assimilated by later migrants to the area, physical traces of their occupation survive in certain ethnic minority groups inhabiting modern-day Jubaland {{and other parts of the}} south. The latter descendants include relict populations such as the Eile, Aweer, the Wa-Ribi, and especially the Wa-Boni. By the time of the arrival of peoples from the Cushitic Rahanweyn (Digil and Mirifle) clan confederacy, who would go on to establish a local aristocracy, other Cushitic groups affiliated with the Oromo (Wardai) and Ajuuraan (Ma'adanle) had already formed settlements of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>in</b> the sub-region.|$|E
