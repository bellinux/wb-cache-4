40|$|Evaluation of an acidic deproteinization for the {{measurement}} of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate in plasma samples Ichiro Koshiishi, Yoshie Mamura, Ji Liu, and Toshio Imanari* The most popular pretreatment method of plasma samples for {{the measurement}} of ascorbate (AsA) and dehydroascorbate (DHA) has been an acidic deproteinization via metaphosphoric <b>acid</b> or <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> In general, DHA is absent in plasma samples prepared from human blood in a conventional manner. However, when these plasma samples were subjected to acidic deproteinization, DHA was detected in the acidified sample solutions. In the present study, we demonstrate that the oxidation of AsA to DHA in the solutions was promoted by at least two mechanisms, one involving catalysis by ferric ion released from transferrin, and the other involving catalysis by plasma hemoglobin. In the acidified transferrin <b>solution</b> by <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> an oxidation of AsA to DHA proceeded with standing time, whereas the oxidation was not observed in that by metaphosphoric acid. This oxidation appeared to be catalyzed by ferric ion released from transferrin. In contrast, plasma hemoglobin functioned {{as a catalyst for}} AsA oxidation in both metaphosphoric <b>acid</b> and <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>solutions.</b> Therefore, DHA content in the trichloroacetic acid-treated plasma sample was markedly higher than that in the metaphosphoric acid-treated one. These results suggest that DHA detected in acidified plasma samples is an artifact resulting from AsA oxidation...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} activity of Odontomyces viscosus, {{which has been}} reported to cause periodontal disease in hamsters, was examined. The microorganism was cultured anaerobically in Brain Heart Infusion broth, and the cells were harvested. The washed cells were injected intradermally into the abdomen of rabbits. After 72 hr, a well-defined, firm, raised nodule (about 1. 0 by 1. 5 cm) with an erythematous border was seen at the injection site. Suspensions of cell wall and cytoplasmic material were injected intradermally, and the lesions appeared only at the site of cell wall injection. The cell walls, which were then treated with trypsin, pepsin, and ribonuclease, again produced the characteristic lesion. These nodular dermal lesions persisted for a minimal time of 10 days. The enzymatically treated cell walls were then hydrolyzed with 1 n HCl, and such hydrolysis up to 1 hr failed to alter the toxic activity of the cell walls. Similar dermal nodular lesions were obtained by injection of enzymatically treated cell walls of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus groups B, C, E, F, K, Lactobacillus casei, and Actinomyces israelii. Treatment with hot and cold <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>solutions</b> and proteolytic enzymes, or with formamide, yielded insoluble fractions which produced the characteristic nodular lesions. The size of the lesion resulting from injection of these fractions was proportional to the amount of the injected material. The active fraction, which does not appear susceptible to hydrolysis by lysozyme, is thought to be cell wall mucopeptide.

Treatment of these model compounds with <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> in <b>solution</b> gives the corresponding protonated salts.

N-Benzalideneaniline and trans-N-cinnamalideneaniline, with shorter polyenic moieties, tend to show a greater bathochromic shift in cellulose. all-trans-N-Retinylidene-n-butylamine, all-trans-N-retinylidenetryptamine and all-trans-N-retinylidene-beta-naphthylamine show a reduced bathochromic shift when intercalated in cellulose pretreated with a base such as n-butylamine. The chromophore of all-trans-N-retinylidenetryptamine is stabilized by the presence of the indole moiety.

Materials and Methods: This was a randomized clinical trial performed in 92 patients. Patients were randomized into two groups: the first group was treated with 50 % TCA solution, once monthly and for a maximum of 5 months, and the second group was treated with CO 2 laser which was performed for only one time. Patients were followed-up at 3 and 6 months after starting the treatment. The improvement of scar was graded by a 6 -point scale using digital camera and the collected data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results: In this study, 74 females and 18 males were enrolled. The improvement of scar was 48. 13 % in the TCA group and 44. 87 % in the CO 2 laser group. This difference was not statically significant (P = 0. 55). There was also no significant difference regarding side effects between these two groups. Conclusion: The results of our study showed that efficacy of focal with 50 % TCA solution is compared with CO 2 laser in treatment of leishmaniasis scar.

In randomly taken milk samples (n = 776) and in kidneys derived from healthy pigs (n = 124), the aminoglycoside residues found were far below their established MRL. In eight out of the 94 kidney samples obtained from diseased animals after emergency slaughter, aminoglycoside residues were above the MRL...|$|E
30|$|Acid {{phosphatase}} (E.C. 3.1. 3.2.) {{was determined}} by monitoring the rate of hydrolysis of ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP), and phytase activity {{was determined by}} measuring the amount of liberated inorganic phosphate from sodium phytate (Haros et al. 2008). For acid phosphatase, 250  μL of 0.1  M sodium acetate buffer (pH  5.5) containing 5  mM PNPP was mixed with 250  μL of enzyme sample. Samples were then incubated at 50 °C for 30  min in a water bath, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5  mL of 1.0  M NaOH and the released ρ-nitrophenol was measured at 420  nm. For phytase, 400  μL of 0.1  M sodium acetate (pH  5.5) containing 1.2  mM sodium phytate was mixed with 250  μL of enzyme sample. Samples were then incubated for 30  min at 50 °C in a water bath, the reaction was stopped by adding 100  μL of 20 % <b>trichloroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>solution.</b> An aliquot was analyzed to determine the liberated inorganic phosphate (Pi) by the ammonium molybdate method, OD at 420  nm (Tanner and Barnett 1986). One unit of acid phosphatase or phytase (Ph U/mL) was defined as 1.0  μM of ρ-nitrophenol or 1.0  μM of Pi liberated per minute under assay conditions.|$|E
