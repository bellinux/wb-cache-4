5|$|Several {{historians have}} {{attempted}} to establish <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> Kanhopatra's life and death. One estimate places her life circa 1428 CE by relating her to a Bahamani king of Bidar who {{is often associated with}} the Kanhopatra story—although in most accounts, that king is never explicitly named. Pawar estimates that she died in 1480. Others suggest dates of 1448, 1468 or 1470, or simply say that she lived in the 15th century—or in rare instances, the 13th or 16th century. According to Zelliot, she was a contemporary of saint-poets Chokhamela (14th century) and Namadeva (c.1270-c.1350).|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd custom was {{performed}} during wither festivities, specifically around <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> Christmas and New Year.

There is a unique example provided by an account from Gower in which the head was kept buried throughout the year, only being dug up for use during the Christmas season.|$|E
5|$|The {{antiquarian}} William Lambarde, for example, published what {{he believed}} were the Anglo-Saxon and Norman law codes, tracing {{the origins of the}} 16th-century English Parliament back to this period, albeit misinterpreting <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> many documents concerned. Francis Bacon argued that clause 39 of Magna Carta was the basis of the 16th-century jury system and judicial processes. Antiquarians Robert Beale, James Morice, and Richard Cosin argued that Magna Carta was a statement of liberty and a fundamental, supreme law empowering English government. Those who questioned these conclusions, including the Member of Parliament Arthur Hall, faced sanctions.|$|E

5|$|The {{extensive}} {{findings of}} glass and stone beads at the site provided Begley the link to Arikamedu's history. She identified the beads as Indo-Pacific beads crafted at Arikamedu. Based on the antiquities and structural features from the excavations, Begley and Raman established a revised sequence of six major periods of occupation of the site. Finds of new variety of Roman Amphorae ware also facilitated revision of <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> occupancy. They have also inferred that the site has been in continuous occupation since at least 2nd or 3rd century BCE to much more recent times.|$|E

5|$|Æthelbert was {{instrumental}} in forming a library at York, which was probably the largest contemporary collection of books {{to be found in}} Europe outside of Rome.

Æthelbert, in his search for books, travelled far, and we know that he visited Rome among other places. Alcuin's poem Versus lists 41 different authors, including some who wrote in Hebrew. He taught both the trivium as well as the quadrivium, plus how to figure <b>the</b> <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> church festivals and natural science.|$|E
