5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

500|$|By {{the first}} week of July, Harrison was in a Los Angeles studio {{recording}} his purpose-written song, [...] "Bangla Desh", with co-producer Phil Spector. The song's opening verse documents Shankar's plea to Harrison for assistance, and the lyrics [...] "My friend came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> sadness in his eyes / Told me that he wanted help before his country dies" [...] provided an enduring image for what United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan later recognised as the basic human aspect behind the cause.|$|E

Ellis-Bextor stated that she released the song because [...] "it was important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> this single to push boundaries {{a little bit and}} part of that is explore a few musical directions that are a bit more unexpected, so it's been nice to release a ballad".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film was due to air on British {{television}} in December 2012, Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock: [...] "He {{made it very clear}} what was expected of me, but I was equally clear that I wasn't interested...Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant moviemaker and I enjoyed working with him before I realised he was starting to take an almost obsessive interest in me." [...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore.

In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for Billboard, Jason Lipshutz {{described}} [...] "Artpop" [...] as Gaga's manifesto about her creativity, {{calling it a}} [...] "lurching electro-jazz beast" [...] who's beats became louder and complex as it reached climax. Consisting of strings, the techno song has a beat similar to Selena Gomez's 2011 single [...] "Love You like a Love Song" [...] with its electronic composition, and a groove comparable to singer Kylie Minogue's 2001 hit single [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head". Interspersed between are computerized musical sounds and the chorus, which has a coo-ing accompanied with the main vocals, like Michael Jackson, and was described by Kevin Harley from The Independent as [...] "sleek Eurodisco". [...] "Artpop"s lyrics have been deduced to be a statement about [...] "the subjectivity of art". It begins with the singer uttering the lines [...] "Come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> all your subtext of fantasy", the line being an indicative of enigma around her, according to The Huffington Post. Gaga explained the lyrics were a metaphor about love with the chorus line [...] "We could belong together, Artpop". She believed that if her fans and herself could be together, that would probably mean a bonding for art and pop too. On the contrary, Jim Farber from New York Daily News believed that the love relationship was sidelined for that between art and pop with the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} on Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later, but after Drake forwent the song, he insisted that Songz include it on Ready. Songz stated in an interview what fan reception to the track mostly had been that he should put a verse in on [...] "Successful", but Songz told BallerStatus, [...] "I was like, 'That's my homie's song.' Then initially, Drake came up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's {{going to be a}} waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' So we put the verse on there just to give me a little more presence on the record for it to be on my album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place. I had this beat sitting here that I love so much, and I didn't know what to do with it..." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>with</b> my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
