30|$|Besides that, {{when the}} UCT is {{comparable}} to the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius, the effect of <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> on machined surface quality could no longer be neglected. For instance, the increased <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius would increase the surface roughness [17], and the spring back of the machined material affected by the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> is thought to be responsible of the machined surface roughness [18]. At the <b>tool</b> <b>edge,</b> there is a region or point where the material tends to separate [19, 20]. The point is thought to be the stagnation point [14, 15, 21], and the region is the stagnation region where the material flow velocity is almost zero [22]. The material above the stagnation point or region is removed to form the chip. The material below them is pressed down to the flank face of cutting tool to form the machined surface. The amount of pressed material which is determined by the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius, is responsible of the side flow and further affects the generated surface quality. However, the influence of cutting tool geometry on side flow still lacks deep investigations in nano-cutting.|$|R
30|$|Besides that, {{when the}} UCT is {{comparable}} to the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius, the <b>tool</b> could no longer be simplified as a sharp edge. The interactions between the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and the materials make the material deform in different ways. For instance, the shearing plane which used to be a plane [11 – 13] extends to a shearing zone [14, 15]. Woon et al. [15] systematically investigate the effect of <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius on the material deformation behavior {{in a wide range of}} UCT. In nano-cutting process, Fang et al. [16, 17] propose that the materials are extruded in front of the cutting tool when the UCT is much less than <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> radius. Woon et al. [18] also found an extrusion-like material deformation behavior at a critical combination of UCT and <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> [18]. Simoneau et al. [19] found the chip formation changes from the shearing to a quasi-shear-extrusion mechanism with a decrease of UCT. When UCT decrease to a critical value, the material cannot remove stably or just no formation of chip. The threshold value is defined as the minimum UCT. It is a key parameter which strongly relates to the material separation mechanisms in front of the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and determines the machined surface quality. Two major mechanisms have been proposed in describing the material separation at the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> [20, 21]. One is based on the existence of stagnation point at the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> [22], another one is based on the formation of stagnation region in which the material flow velocity is almost zero [23]. The stagnation point or the tip of stagnation region is where the workpiece material starts to split into two parts to form the chip or the machined surface. The material deformation mechanism influenced by <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> would further affect the generated surface quality. The cutting edge with large edge radius results in higher average surface roughness values than that with small edge radius [24], and the effect of the cutting edge radius on the surface roughness decreased with an increase in workpiece hardness. The spring back of the machined material which influences the surface roughness is also affected by the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> [25].|$|R

The {{side flow}} is formed because the {{material}} at {{or under the}} stagnation region is extruded by the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> to flow {{to the side of}} the <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> The side flow is influenced by the position of stagnation region. Higher stagnation height would increase the size of the side flow and further deteriorate the machined surface quality.|$|R
30|$|When {{the cutting}} {{direction}} is { 100 }< 001 >, no shearing plane is formed {{in front of}} the <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> For the UCT of 0.45 and 0.7  nm which is {{less than or equal to}} separation height, workpiece surface is firstly pressed down by the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> in elastic deformation. Then, the upper layer, usually the first layer, of the workpiece material is removed by the cutting tool in an extrusion way. The rest part of the materials flow to the flank face of the cutting tool experience the elastic-plastic deformation and form the machined surface. For the UCT of 0.95  nm which is larger than separation height, more materials are removed to form the chip. However, no shearing plane forms {{in front of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and the materials are still removed by extruding. Similar results obtain at cutting direction of { 100 }< 011 >{ 110 }< 1 - 10 > and { 111 } < 11 - 2 >. Minor difference in the cutting processes is that the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> rubs on the workpiece material surface and almost no materials are removed, when the UCT is less than the separation height at these three cutting directions. In rubbing mechanism, the workpiece material experiences elastic-plastic deformation due to the interaction with the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and flank face, which, to some extent, affects the generated surface. For the cutting direction of { 110 }< 001 > whose separation height is negative, the upper layer materials could be removed even the UCT is 0.1  nm. This is because the materials in front of the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> firstly pile up by shearing mechanism and then are extruded or secondly sheared by the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> The material could also be removed when the UCT is 0.25  nm for the cutting direction of { 111 }< 1 - 10 >, as shown in Fig.  13. Materials are extruded up at a distance of several nanometers away from the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> The distance of the materials starting to be extruded increases with the cutting distance.|$|R

40|$|AbstractMachining process {{models can}} be used to predict cutting force/power and further {{optimize}} the process parameters. In this work, a mechanistic cutting force model for turning processes is developed. In order to accurately predict cutting forces, the cutting <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> is discretized and an approach for calculating the chip load corresponding to each discretized edge segment is developed. Approach for calculating effective tool angles is also developed considering effects of the tool corner radius and the change of feed direction. By using the yield shear stress of the work material, the friction angle between work and tool material, the chip load and the effective tool angles for each <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> segment, the distributions of the turning forces and force intensity along the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> can be predicted. Turning cases of straight turning, contour turning, taper turning and facing are tested and the model outputs include the distributions of the instantaneous effective tool angles, chip load, cutting force coefficients and force intensity.

30|$|The thrust forces {{predicted}} by the two criteria are also different. Both thrust forces remain negative at the early stage but increase gradually and turn into positive, reaching nearly 0.5  N and 3.5  N, respectively, at a later stage. In the beginning, the thrust force is negative because at the initial stage of penetration of the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> into workpiece, the workpiece contacts the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and the rake area. Besides the reaction forces ahead in the horizontal direction, the tool also encounters a reaction force from upper left perpendicular to the tool rake. The resultant force has a negative (downwards) thrust force component. However, with additional advances of the tool, when the contacts between the workpiece and the bottom of <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> and the <b>tool</b> flank are established, the reaction force from the tool bottom becomes dominant, which results in a positive thrust force.|$|R

The {{side flow}} is formed because the {{material}} at {{or under the}} stagnation region is extruded by the <b>tool</b> <b>edge</b> to flow {{to the side of}} the <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> Higher stagnation height would increase the size of the side flow. The anisotropic nature of the material which partly determines the stagnation region also influences the side flow due to the different deformation mechanism under the action of the <b>tool</b> <b>edge.</b> At different cutting directions, the size of the side flow has a great difference which would finally affect the machined surface quality.
