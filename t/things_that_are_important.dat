2500|$|Donald Tsang {{delivered}} {{an unprecedented}} 20-minute speech {{prior to the}} start of the debate on a motion tabled by Lee Wing Tat in an attempt to quell the criticism. Tsang lectured the chamber about there having been [...] "excessive" [...] argument about the subject. [...] "It is about time we put an end to it... We should dedicate all our energies to the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> to the people of Hong Kong, especially the livelihood issues," [...] Tsang said. Tsang denied Norman Chan had shown favouritism during the selection process, saying [...] "It was unfair to those appointees who were identified as Chan's people. Chan knows people from various sectors." [...] After his speech, Tsang refused to take questions; his speech was followed by those by the Chief Secretary and the Secretary for Justice.|$|E
60|$|But neither tariffs nor financiers {{would be}} able to cause serious trouble, {{if it were not for}} the {{sentiment}} of national pride. National pride might be on the whole beneficent, if it took the direction of emulation in the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>important</b> to civilization. If we prided ourselves upon our poets, our men of science, or the justice and humanity of our social system, we might find in national pride a stimulus to useful endeavors. But such matters play a very small part. National pride, as it exists now, is almost exclusively concerned with power and dominion, with the extent of territory that a nation owns, and with its capacity for enforcing its will against the opposition of other nations. In this it is reinforced by group morality. To nine citizens out of ten it seems self-evident, whenever the will of their own nation clashes with that of another, that their own nation must be in the right. Even if it were not in the right on the particular issue, yet it stands in general for so much nobler ideals than those represented by the other nation to the dispute, that any increase in its power is bound to be for the good of mankind. Since all nations equally believe this of themselves, all are equally ready to insist upon the victory of their own side in any dispute in which they believe that they have a good hope of victory. While this temper persists, the hope of international coöperation must remain dim.|$|E

50|$|It is also of {{note that}} the actual value which an {{individual}} brings to a group is not of consequence in determining his or her popularity; the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> his or her value as perceived by {{the other members of}} the group. While perceived value and actual value may often overlap, this is not a requisite and it has <b>been</b> shown <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> instances in which an individual's actual value is relatively low, but they are perceived as highly valuable nevertheless.|$|R

50|$|To {{his family}} and closest friends, {{as well as anyone}} willing to indulge him in {{recollections}} of his war stories, Albert showed a softer side. Although a pessimist, he was also nostalgic, and easily grew attached to <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>important</b> to him. Unfortunately, this occasionally manifested itself through stubbornness, especially in family matters, as he tended to think he knew what was best for people and would not hesitate to tell them, even if he knew they disagreed with him. Likewise, when let down by his family, he was prone to feeling sorry for himself until his indignation was validated.|$|R

50|$|As fat {{cannot be}} stored {{under the skin}} it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to have a healthy diet without excess fat.

In people with moderate / severe lipodystrophy a low fat diet would be recommended but in those where the lipodystrophy has not progressed (for example in younger children) a healthy relatively low fat diet may be sufficient. The fat and muscle reduction is not the result of dietary insufficiency and cannot be treated with dietary measures. Apart from diet the other <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>is</b> exercise which should be encouraged and will make insulin work more effectively.|$|R
