40|$|Structural {{performance}} evaluation of composite concrete slabs that were constructed using partially precast concreting system which utilized Hybrid Fiber-Reinforced Lightweight Aggregate Concrete (HyFRLWAC) as stay in-place formwork and self-compacting concrete (SCC) as <b>topping</b> <b>layer</b> {{was conducted in}} this research. This paper focused on determining the appropriate strength limit criteria of interface between two different concrete layers. The tensile strength was tested using pull-off test, while concrete cohesion was investigated based on modified bisurface shear test, and dual L-shaped shear {{test was used to}} determine the effect of normal force on the shear strength of concrete interface. Sample variants were designed based on the substrate surface conditions, compressive strength of the <b>topping</b> <b>layer,</b> and magnitude of perpendicular normal force acting on interface area. The substrate surfaces were prepared in as-placed and grooved conditions for tensile test, cohesion, and shear strength test. Test results indicate that tensile strength, cohesion, and shear strength of the concrete interface are affected by surface condition of the substrate, compressive strength of the <b>topping</b> <b>layer,</b> and the normal force acting perpendicularly on the concrete interface area. Proposed formulation for bond strength prediction between HyFRLWAC as substrate and SCC as <b>topping</b> <b>layer</b> is also presented in this paper...|$|E

This project aims at improving the design rules for orthotropic decks and developing a UHPFRC-based innovative solution to improve the durability. Bendings tests were carried out on four specimens, consisting in a realistic steel orthotropic deck model, 2. 4 x 4 m, with different types and thicknesses of topping layers: traditional bituminous concrete, thin layer of UHPFRC or no <b>topping</b> <b>layer.</b> The load application has been chosen as representative of real situations and of idealised cases considered in design codes. The loads were first applied through static tests with different configurations in accordance with Eurocode 1 and then through a fatigue test representative of traffic loads during bridge lifespan...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{presenting}} {{the results of}} experimental and numerical investigation programs assessing the stress reduction in orthotropic steel bridge decks associated with ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) <b>topping</b> <b>layer.</b> This RandD project was aimed at evaluating {{the effectiveness of the}} UHPFRC overlay, as an alternative to conventional bituminous concrete, to reduce the stress distribution and thereby improve the fatigue resistance of the complex deck plate. Loading tests were carried out on realistic samples of orthotropic deck equipped or not with a reference bituminous concrete or a new UHPFRC topping. The deflection, and strain and stress values on the top and the bottom of the orthotropic deck plate and more particularly at the weld joint between longitudinal stiffeners (troughs) and the deck plate were measured. A 3 -D shell element model has been developed using a finite element code in order to obtain the stresses in details for the most representation and critical locations. The global and local behaviors have been analyzed in order to understand and to evaluate the beneficial effects of UHPFRC <b>topping</b> <b>layer</b> under static condition. The results obtained in terms of stress reduction factor demonstrate the beneficial effects for fatigue verification. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Stable and {{reliable}} operation of an optical sensor for pH monitoring {{is important for}} many industrial applications {{of these types of}} devices. The layer-by-layer deposition technique is a simple and versatile method used to deposit a sensitive thin film on such an optical fibre-based device but creating a coating which can often be destroyed in use in highly acid or alkali solutions i. e. with very low or very high pH. It is thus important to create stable and durable sensors {{to meet the needs of}} users for operation under these extreme environments. The main aim of this study has been to prepare a number of such sensors and compare the performance of three different stabilization approaches used for the development of an effective wavelength-dependent pH-sensitive optical sensor. Techniques such as employing heat treatment, the deposition of two layers of a PAH/SiO 2 thin film and the deposition of two layers of APTMS/SiO 2 as <b>topping</b> <b>layers</b> have been studied to determine the optimum approach to creating a stable {{and reliable}} sensor – one yielding the same value of peak wavelength for a measurement of a known value of pH and to do so repeatibly. An improvement in performance and in shelf-life, stability and re-usability of the sensor has been achieved by the addition of two bilayers of APTMS/SiO 2 (3 -Aminopropyl-trimethoxy silane/Silica nanoparticle) in the work carried out and the results of the investigation undertaken are reported...|$|R

Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) is a material which under its own self-weight flows to form and fill any shape, attains full compaction, without external energy input, to create a dense homogenous mass (based on Holton, 2003; The Concrete Society and BRE, 2005; Damtoft et al, 2008). It is, in respect {{to the history of}} concrete, a relatively new development, with its first UK application occurring in the late 1990 s. Since then a significant amount of research has sought to understand its physical and structural properties, but {{there is a lack of}} a knowledge base on its practical application and performance in construction projects. Where it does exist, such research lacks robust and transparent data, particularly relating to the claimed attributes of the material (such as better surface finish, faster construction and lower overall costs). Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, this research investigates the construction practices employed when pouring SCC and presents new data on its practical applications. Interviews with a range of building contractors, ranging from multinationals to small UK businesses (SMEs), show that current perceptions of SCC limit its use to specific applications because practitioners see SCC as just another type of concrete. A critical examination of these attitudes led to the identification of three distinct scenarios for the use of SCC: 1. Reactive selection: in which a particular attribute of SCC provokes its use to solve a particular problem, often as a last minute substitution for conventional concrete the most common scenario. 2. Strategic change: in which the material is chosen on the basis of a balanced assessment of all its benefits and on the understanding that such benefits can only be attained if the contractor appreciates that there may be implications for the construction process a rarely experienced scenario. 3. Specification: in which there is complete acceptance of SCC as a method, not just as a material; a significant amount of early project involvement with knowledge holders, such as contractors and material suppliers, optimises the construction process. A rigorous work measurement study of live construction projects has made it possible to quantify the as-built costs of SCC for selected UK residential slab and multi-storey flat slab applications and compare this with the equivalent conventional concrete slab construction. On-site use of self-compacting concrete vi The results indicate that SCC can reduce construction times of structural <b>topping</b> <b>layers</b> of residential slabs by up to 73...|$|R
50|$|The {{architecture}} of the Ten Great Buildings is a composite of factors based in modernism, communism, and historicism. Chinese architecture {{at the time was}} shaped by review of its own historical models mixed with external influences. Debate was vigorous in publications such as the Architectural Journal prior to the constructions, and history, modernity and influence were being conceptualized and reconsidered. A criticism of this initiative is that while creating facilities for political, and cultural institutions, these public projects failed to provide for a needed increase in housing, however, a housing surge would occur in the country later in the century. Modern architecture brought to China, as it had to the west, a new economic and rational manner of building, and the modernist buildings of the group were the least decorated by the public art campaign. Examples of this are the Workers' Stadium, the Minzu Hotel, and the Overseas Chinese Hotel. The modernist tenets of function and structure were realized in these buildings, yet these were attributed both to western capitalist influences and the Soviet notion of the proletariat. The Soviet architecture inspired examples from the Ten Buildings are the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, and the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum. The Great Hall of the People and the National Museum of China across from it on the square continue the numerology of tens—each having ten freestanding columns in their facades. The architectural aspects of the traditionally inspired buildings included large and heavy roofs laden with ceramic tiles. These were often stacked in multiple layers recalling the towering form of the pagoda. Another feature is upturned corners and curved ridges on hipped edges. Beneath these thick composite <b>toppings</b> are <b>layers</b> of beams, and brackets known as dougong. Examples of this type of architecture among the Ten Great Constructions are the Beijing railway station, the Nationalities Cultural Palace, and the National Agriculture Exhibition Hall.|$|R

These tests have been carried out within the frame of a joint R& D project called Orthoplus, in partnership with Eiffage Company, Arcadis engineering office and the Sétra (French Highways technical authority). This project aims at improving the design rules for orthotropic deck and developing a UHPFRC-based innovative solution to improve the durability of orthotropic deck. Loads have been applied to four specimens, 4 m-long and 2. 40 m-wide, consisting in a realistic steel orthotropic deck with different types of topping layers: traditional bituminous concrete, thin layer of UHPFRC, or no <b>topping</b> <b>layer.</b> The dimensions of the specimens have been chosen to limit the effect of boundary conditions on the effect of a local loading. The load application has been chosen as representative of real situations and of idealised cases considered in design codes: real truck wheels have been used as well as rectangular steel plates with dimensions complying with Eurocode 1 part 2. The investigation has been focused on the stress obtained at the weld between stiffener and deck plate, at mid-span between transverse crossbeams, which is critical to estimate the fatigue lifespan of real orthotropic deck structures under the effect of repeated local loads induced by traffic. The stress repartition in the different configurations has been assessed through static tests, then 2 million cycles have been applied to verify the fatigue resistance the specimen. The paper details the test protocol and the main results of the experimental program. Namely, the benefits of an increased rigidity provided by the UHPFRC top layer is quantified, due to the reduction in stress concentration at the critical fatigue detail...|$|E
40|$|The {{passivation}} {{of silicon}} surfaces {{play an important}} role for achieving high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells. In this work, a stack system comprising of 20 nm Al 2 O 3 with a 22 nm TiO 2 <b>topping</b> <b>layer</b> was deposited on p-type Si using thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) and was investigated regarding its passivation quality. Quasi-steady-state photo conductance (QSSPC) measurements reveal that the minority carrier lifetime at an injection density of 1015 cm− 3 increased from 1. 10 ms to 1. 96 ms after the deposition of TiO 2, which shows that the deposition of TiO 2 onto Al 2 O 3 is capable of enhancing its passivation quality. Capacity voltage (CV) measurements show that the amount of negative charges in the dielectric layer has increased from - 2. 4 · 1012 cm− 2 to - 6. 3 · 1012 cm− 2 due to the deposition of TiO 2. The location of the additional charges was analyzed in this work by etching the dielectric layer stack in several steps. After each step CV measurements were performed. It is found that the additional negative charges are created within the Al 2 O 3 layer. Additionally, ToF-SIMS measurements were performed to check for diffusion processes within the Al 2 O 3 layer...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Urban {{stormwater}} runoff {{contains a}} broad range of pollutants that are transported to natural water systems. A practice known as biological retention (bioretention) has been suggested to manage stormwater runoff from small, developed areas. Bioretention facilities consist of porous soil, a <b>topping</b> <b>layer</b> of hardwood mulch, and a variety of different plant species. A detailed study of the characteristics and performance of bioretention systems for the removal of several heavy metals (copper, lead, and zinc) and nutrients (phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen [TKN], ammonium, and nitrate) from a synthetic urban stormwater runoff was completed using batch and column adsorption studies along with pilot-scale laboratory systems. The roles of the soil, mulch, and plants in the removal of heavy metals and nutrients were evaluated to estimate the treatment capacity of laboratory bioretention systems. Reductions in concentrations of all metals were excellent (� 90 %) with specific metal removals of 15 to 145 mg/m 2 per event. Moderate reductions of TKN, ammonium, and phosphorus levels were found (60 to 80 %). Little nitrate was removed, and nitrate production was noted in several cases. The importance of the mulch layer in metal removal was identified. Overall results support the use of bioretention as a stormwater best management practice and indicate the need for further research and development. Water Environ. Res., 73, 5 (2001) ...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on facts}} that the {{composite}} action in semi-precast and strengthened structural system {{depends on the}} bond strength of the interface between concrete faces of different ages, this preliminary research is aimed to investigate effects of mixed polypropylene (PPF) and steel fiber (SF) addition on the hardened properties of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) and its bond strength when used as <b>topping</b> <b>layer</b> on normal concrete substrate. Effects of hybrid fiber addition on the hardened properties of SCC were investigated based on the compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strength of concrete specimens which is tested in 28 days of age. In the next step, the tensile and shear strength of the interface were evaluated using indirect splitting tensile and bi-surface shear test method. In this research, fiber addition were prepared using 1 kg/m PPF and various SF addition ranging from 15 kg/m 3, 20 kg/m 3, 25 kg/m 3 and 30 kg/m 3. Test results indicate that hybrid fiber addition {{does not affect the}} compressive strength significantly but it leads ositive improvement to the splitting tensile and flexural strength of hardened SCC and also improve the bond strength between SCC and normal concrete. Hybrid fiber addition of 1 kg/m 3 PPF which is combined with 20 kg/m 3 SF can be suggested as optimum composition for Hybrid Fiber Reinforced Self-Compacting Concrete (HyFRSCC) that will be used as topping or overlay material based on its hardened properties and interface strength...|$|E
