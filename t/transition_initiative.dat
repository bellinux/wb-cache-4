Through an investigation of the Transition Towns approach and its relationship to local government it identifies opportunities to effectively build resilience through collaboration.

Survey research, qualitative document analysis and semi-structured interviews explore the effectiveness of the Transition Towns model, local government planning, and regional policy, for addressing resilience issues such as climate change and peak oil. The analysis of results highlights the importance of, and opportunities for, collaboration between <b>Transition</b> <b>initiatives</b> and local governments within local communities.

40|$|This paper {{engages with}} the {{progressive}} politics {{of climate change}} and resource constraint developed by the Transition 'movement' which looks to develop a positive local politics of {{the transition to a}} low carbon economy and society. At the heart of this politics is a vision of economic localisation rooted in a geographical imaginary of market towns with agricultural hinterlands. Consequently, the question of how the Transition model can be applied in urban settings has not been clear, leading to the implicit assumption that urban <b>Transition</b> <b>initiatives</b> are more complex and difficult. In contrast, this paper argues that the plasticity of Transition politics means that, in some cases, an urban context might be more productive for the development of <b>Transition</b> <b>initiatives</b> because it allows for a greater diversity of political action as well as providing a density of networks and resources that can be critical for the survival of grassroots interventions. © 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited...|$|R
