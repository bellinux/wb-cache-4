60|$|The Wizard rode on {{the back}} of the Hungry Tiger and carried the cage of monkeys very carefully, so as not <b>to</b> <b>joggle</b> them. Dorothy rode {{on the back}} of the Cowardly Lion, and the Glass Cat trotted, as before, to show them the way.|$|E
5000|$|In a bid {{to raise}} $5000 for the special needs {{non-profit}} organization Special Kids, he participated on January 11, 2009, in the Walt Disney World Marathon for Team A.S.K. (Athletes for Special Kids). He simultaneously jogged 26.2 mi and juggled three balls, in a sport commonly known as joggling. In the marathon's 16-year history, he {{was considered to be}} the first participant <b>to</b> <b>joggle</b> the full distance. In 2013, Civillico raised $10,000 from his friends to participate in the Special Olympics Nevada charity event Over the Edge, which required a minimum donation of $1,000 for participants to rappel down the 350-foot tall Planet Hollywood building. In October 2013, he was the host of Caesars Got Talent, a fundraising event held to benefit Opportunity Village, a Las Vegas non-profit organization that serves the intellectually disabled. Stephen Ruiz of the Orlando Sentinel noted that if Civillico had applied his theology degree, he would not likely have done the marathon. Civillico said: [...] A lot of parents say theoretically, 'You have to do what you love.' But they want their sons and daughters to go into professions that are well-defined and you have to jump through certain hoops -- doctors, lawyers. And {{there is nothing wrong with}} that. My parents said, 'You have to do what you love', and meant it.|$|E

[...] "He's all the {{boy that}} I have known or recollect; {{but that would}} be a good way of ending the book"; then, turning round, [...] "because, when you come to think of it, neither religion, training, nor {{education}} avails anything against the force of circumstances that drive a man. Suppose we took the next four and twenty years of Tom Sawyer's life, and gave a little <b>joggle</b> <b>to</b> the circumstances that controlled him. He would, logically and according <b>to</b> the <b>joggle,</b> turn out a rip or an angel." ...|$|R
50|$|Dow speaks admiringly {{of another}} {{technical}} {{development on the}} railway: the stock rails at turnouts were <b>joggled</b> <b>to</b> protect the switch tips from being struck by wheel flanges.|$|R
50|$|On many clinker built craft, e.g. in Scandinavia, in Thames skiffs, {{and larger}} working craft like the coble, sawn frames are used, {{assembled}} from floors and top timbers, <b>joggled</b> <b>to</b> fit the lands. Sometimes the timbers in larger craft were also joggled before being steamed in.|$|R
60|$|Usually at {{the weekly}} hops Maggie kept {{a spot on}} the wall warm with her back. She felt and showed so much {{gratitude}} whenever a self-sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished. She had even grown used <b>to</b> noticing Anna <b>joggle</b> the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two-step.|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} completion of the doctoral program and in particular this research has been greatly influenced by the unceasing support and guidance of my doctoral committee chairperson and mentor, Dr. Bill Ryan. I am enormous grateful for his support, guidance and patience throughout this entire process. He has {{taught me how to}} keep focus and not let distractions slow me down too much. I also would like to express my earnest appreciation to my other committee members Dr. Jerrold K. Leong, Dr. Bo Hu and Dr. Robert Nolan, whose guidance, assistance, inspiration and encouragement are invaluable. I wish to thank my family who have encouraged and supported me throughout this entire process. Particularly, special thanks to my parents for supporting my academic ambitions and teaching me courage. Finally, thanks to the support of my friends and colleagues who in different ways supported me during this period and made it possible for me <b>to</b> successfully <b>joggle</b> my professional life with other equally important competing priorities...|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the Stirling shares considerable similarity to the earlier Short Empire flying boats. The structure of the cantilever mid-mounted wing, which employed a two-spar covered by aluminium alloy sheeting that was flush-rivetted to the internal spars and ribs, was one instance of the two design's convergence. The wing housed three large self-sealing fuel tanks within the spar truss, along with a fourth non-self-sealing fuel tank within {{the leading edge of}} the wing root, which provided for a combined tankage of 2,254 gallons. Up to six ferry tanks could also be installed within the wing bomb cells in order to increase fuel capacity by a further 220 gallons. Significant attention was paid to reducing drag - all rivets were flush headed and panels <b>joggled</b> <b>to</b> avoid edges - but camouflage paint probably negated the benefit. The wing was fitted with Gouge flaps similar to those of the flying boats.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was initiated {{to determine the}} cause of coating spallation occurring on the Shuttle Orbiter's wing leading edge panels in the slip-side joggle region. The coating spallation events were observed, post flight, on differing panels on different missions. As part of the investigation, the high re-entry heating occurring on the joggles was considered here as a possible cause. Thus, a thermostructural evaluation was conducted to determine the detailed state-of-stress in the joggle region during re-entry and the feasibility of a laboratory test on a local <b>joggle</b> specimen <b>to</b> replicate this state-of-stress. A detailed three-dimensional finite element model of a panel slip-side joggle region was developed. Parametric and sensitivity studies revealed significant stresses occur in the joggle during peak heating. A critical interlaminar normal stress concentration was predicted in the substrate at the coating interface and was confined <b>to</b> the curved <b>joggle</b> region. Specifically, the high interlaminar normal stress is identified to be the cause for the occurrence of failure in the form of local subsurface material separation occurring in the slip-side joggle. The predicted critical stresses are coincident with material separations that had been observed with microscopy in joggle specimens obtained from flight panels...|$|R
5000|$|For an old Man that Travelled up {{and down}} the Country, and had some {{acquaintance}} at that house, calling in and asking the Man of the house how he did and his Wife; He told him that himself was well, but his Wife {{had been a long time}} in a languishing condition, and that she was haunted with a thing in the shape of a Bird that would flurr sic near to her face, and that she could not enjoy her natural rest well. The Old Man bid him and his Wife be of good courage. It was but a dead Spright, he said, and he would put him in a course to rid his Wife of this languishment and trouble, He therefore advised him to take a Bottle, and put his Wives Urine into it, together with Pins and Needles and Nails, and Cork them up and set the Bottle to the Fire well corkt, which when it had felt a while the heat of the Fire began <b>to</b> move and <b>joggle</b> a little, but he for sureness took the Fire shovel, and held it hard upon the Cork, And as he thought, he felt something one while on this side, another while on that, shove the Fire shovel off, which he still quickly put on Again, but at last at one shoving the Cork bounced out, and the Urine, Pins, Nails and Needles all flew up, and gave a report like a Pistol, and his Wife continued in the same trouble and languishment still.Not long after, the Old Man came to the house again, and inquired of the Man of the house how his Wife did. Who answered, as ill as ever, if not worse. He askt him if he had followed his direction. Yes, says he, and told him the event as is above said. Ha, quoth he, it seems it was too nimble for you. But now I will put you in a way that will make the business sure. Take your Wiveâ€™s Urine as before, and Cork, it in a Bottle with Nails, Pins and Needles, and bury it in the Earth; and that will do the feat. The Man did accordingly. And his Wife began to mend sensibly and in a competent time was finely well recovered; But there came a Woman from a Town some miles off to their house, with a lamentable Out-cry, that they had killed her Husband. They askt her what she meant and thought her distracted, telling her they knew neither her nor her Husband. Yes, saith she, you have killed my Husband, he told me so on his Death-bed. But at last they understood by her, that her Husband was a Wizard, and had bewitched this Mans Wife and that this Counter-practice prescribed by the Old Man, which saved the Mans Wife from languishment, was the death of that Wizard that had bewitched her.|$|R
