50|$|Initially {{serving in}} World War I, Hollard {{subsequently}} became an engineer. Working for an armament firm, he fled Paris after the French capitulation in 1940 to rally his firm's HQ in the Free Zone {{in the south}} of France and was nearly mobbed twice on his way by frantic French crowds, who thought he was a German paratrooper. He later resigned from his post when his company began working for the occupant and gained employment with a manufacturer of wood gas generators, which enabled him to travel around France using his job as a cover. In 1941 Hollard crossed the defenses barring access to the French Free Zone and the Swiss border {{for the first time to}} offer his services as a spy to the British embassy in Bern. He was greeted icily despite recommendations and intelligence about France's wartime automotive manufacturing capabilities that he had brought with him to show his goodwill. When he came back, the second meeting was much warmer since the British had made <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>checks</b> about him. He founded the Réseau AGIR resistance network in 1941, working directly for the Secret Intelligence Service. Hollard and his agents began to supply regular information of the highest quality, leading Hollard to be considered one of the most reliable sources working for the British.|$|E

5000|$|To be sure, {{there were}} still {{occasional}} made-for-TV premieres, such as the sports biography Babe (1975), starring Susan Clark as the multi-talented athlete Babe Didrikson. In fact, this production was nearly doomed before it began. Earlier, when Babe's co-producer Stanley Rubin tried repeatedly to convince Didrikson's widower/husband George Zaharias to sell him the exclusive rights to her story, he flatly refused. As Rubin later recalled, [...] "He said he had several opportunities to sell Babe's story. Once, he had gotten badly burned in some deal. So he was understandably leery of the whole thing." [...] One Saturday, however, Zaharias relented and phoned Rubin, granting him permission for the story, but only if he hand-delivered a cashier's check by that very afternoon. Since few banks were open for business on a weekend, Rubin was just barely {{able to make it}} to Zaharias's residence in time with <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>check</b> to close <b>the</b> deal. As it turned out, Babe's reviews were quite good. Syndicated columnist Joan Hanauer, for example, praised writer Joanna Lee's scenario. She stated that even if Babe's story [...] "loses in suspense because the end is preordained, it gains in poignancy because Babe was a real woman...whose beautifully functioning body was no more able to conquer cancer than those of her weaker sisters." [...] It was positive critical reaction such as this that made Rubin's persistence pay off.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} static analysis of 55 m long railway bridge deck in Luka Koper. Analyzed construction is designed as four span integral concrete bridge with foundation consisting of 50 m long piles. Bridge deck is analyzed as composite cross section of four prefabricated post tensioned beams with in-situ concrete slab on them. For the analysis is made an idealized 3 D mathematical model with Sofistik computer program based on finite element method.

40|$|Board {{independence}} is {{considered as a}} key corporate governance mechanism to help preserve <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>checks</b> and balances between the board and executive management. Request for external audit services falls {{into the realm of}} board strategic decisions. To test the monitoring function of the board, the objective {{of this paper is to}} revisit the board independence-audit fees relationship while taking into account the ownership structure of the firm. Two effects are unfolding along the ownership concentration spectrum: separation of ownership and control (Principal-Agent problems) and separation of voting and cash flow rights (Principal-Principal problems). The study is conducted over a seven-year period (2002 - 2008) using panel regressions on a sample of Canadian publicly traded companies. The results show a positive and significant relationship between board independence (BI) and audit fees (AF) when ownership is concentrated in the hands of a dominant/controlling shareholder. The highest level of separation between voting and cash flow rights is also found in controlled entities. The higher the gap between voting and cash flow rights of the ultimate owner, the stronger the relationship between BI and AF. Overall, evidence supports both the Demand Based Perspective on audit fees and the Expropriation Effect argument...|$|E

40|$|Most {{software}} applications use a relational database for data man-agement and storage. Interaction {{with such a}} database is often done by letting the program construct strings with valid SQL statements, which are then sent for execution to the database engine. The fact that these statements are only checked for correctness at runtime is a source for many potential problems such as type and syntax errors and vulnerability to injection attacks. The ARARAT system presented here offers a method for dealing with these predicaments, by coercing the host C++ compiler to do <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>checks</b> of the generated strings. A library of templates (and preprocessor directives) effectively extends C++ with a little language representing an augmented relational algebra formalism. Type checking of this language extension, as done by the template library, assures, at compile-time, the correctness of the generated SQL strings. All SQL statements constructed by the system are immune to injection attacks. Standard techniques (e. g., “expression templates”) for compile time representation of symbolic structures, are enhanced by our system to support a type system and a symbol table lookup of the symbolic structure. Our work may also open the way for embed-ding other domain specific languages in C++. 1...|$|E
40|$|Building on the {{pioneering}} work of Barro (1991) and Mauro (1995) {{to include the}} most recent years for which data are available (for Bangladesh in the 1990 s), the authors investigate the relationships between corruption, and growth, and, between corruption and investment, both domestic and foreign, {{to see whether they}} have changed from earlier decades. Then they move away from Mauro's implicit assumption that the corruption index value for {{a relatively short period of}} time, can be used as a proxy for the long run, and further augment Mauro's model by including significant regional dummy variables, in an attempt to take account of various region-specific effects. The authors also analyze the sensitivity of corruption in the presence, and absence of various policy, geographic, and demographic variables that are widely used in empirical growth, and investment literature. The findings suggest that countries serious about improving governance, and reducing corruption, should redefine the role of government, overhaul the system of incentives, and strengthen domestic institutions, to make sure <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>checks,</b> and balances are in place.

40|$|The {{issue of}} model {{reduction}} {{is one that}} must often be overcome in order to perform <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>checks</b> {{as part of the}} spacecraft Finite Element Model (FEM) validation process. This work compares different reduction methods; specifically the popular and long-standing Guyan method, and the potentially more accurate System Equivalent Reduction Expansion Process (SEREP). The influence of sensor set location {{on the quality of the}} reduced model has also been considered, and the commonly applied methods to maximize kinetic energy and effective independence have been applied. These investigations have taken the form of studies involving two large, unique, scientific spacecraft. The computational results are compared with experimental results that are also detailed in the paper. The findings highlight the potential issues with the accuracy of a Guyan reduced model in replicating the full system dynamics, even with a reasonably large sensor set. It is shown that this can be improved slightly in some circumstances through implementation of sensor set placement optimization techniques. The SEREP method is shown to have the benefit of being more accurate at replicating the full system behavior than the more traditional Guyan method, while also producing higher diagonal values in cross-orthogonality comparisons between FEM and test...|$|E

However, {{they are usually}} enforced dynamically- even the static parts. We propose a new hybrid approach to policy enforcement in the Category-Based Access Control (CBAC) meta-model. We build on previous work, which estab-lished a static system for the enforcement of (static) hierarchical Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. We modify the previous policy language, JPol, to specify static and dynamic categories. We establish an equivalence between static categories and static roles (in RBAC), there-fore {{we are able to}} use the previous design patterns and static verification algorithm, with some changes, to enforce static categories. For dynamic categories, we propose a new design methodology and generate code in the target program to do <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> run-time <b>checks.</b> ...|$|R
