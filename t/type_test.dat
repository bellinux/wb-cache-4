Idflieg authorized low level production pending availability of the more powerful Goebel Goe.III. Deliveries commenced in April and ceased in August, after only 59 aircraft had been completed. Seven aircraft were delivered to the Austro-Hungarian Air Service (Luftfahrtruppen).|$|E

Only Ernst Udet and Hans Weiss favored the D.XII over the Fokker D.VII, but Udet's opinion carried such weight that Pfalz received substantial production orders for the D.XII.

25|$|Instead of {{submitting}} the V.4 for a <b>type</b> <b>test,</b> Fokker {{produced a}} revised prototype designated V.5.

The V.5 also featured interplane struts, which were not necessary from a structural standpoint, but which minimized wing flexing. On 14 July 1917, Idflieg issued an order for 20 pre-production aircraft. The V.5 prototype, serial 101/17, was tested to destruction at Adlershof on 11 August 1917.|$|E

25|$|In {{statistic}}s, the Durbin–Watson statistic is a {{test statistic}} used to detect the presence of autocorrelation (a relationship between values separated from each other by a given time lag) in the residuals (prediction errors) from a regression analysis. It is named after James Durbin and Geoffrey Watson. The small sample distribution of this ratio was derived by John von Neumann (von Neumann, 1941). Durbin and Watson (1950, 1951) applied this statistic to the residuals from least squares regressions, and developed bounds tests for the null hypothesis that the errors are serially uncorrelated against the alternative that they follow a first order autoregressive process. Later, John Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava developed several von Neumann–Durbin–Watson <b>type</b> <b>test</b> statistics for the null hypothesis that the errors on a regression model follow a process with a unit root against the alternative hypothesis that the errors follow a stationary first order autoregression (Sargan and Bhargava, 1983).

On 5 July 1949, the Ministry of Supply ordered five prototypes to this specification {{with the understanding that}} BOAC would contract for an additional 25 production examples. [...] BOAC purchased options for 25 aircraft on 28 July, to be powered initially with the Bristol Centaurus engine but to be re-fitted with the Bristol Proteus when available. In November 1948, the Type 175 design was revised again to accommodate 74 passengers and a longer span wing in a contemplated long-range version aimed at long-haul Empire and transatlantic routes rather than the medium-haul Empire routes originally planned. On reflection, BOAC decided that only a Proteus-engined aircraft was worth working on, necessitating a further redesign with Bristol eliminating the Centaurus option. Senior figures within BOAC such as the Deputy Chairman Whitney Straight, however, considered the Proteus engine to be [...] "an obsolete contraption". Despite BOAC's desire to have a turboprop engine, the Type 175 project was contingent on the Proteus passing a 150-hour <b>Type</b> <b>Test.</b>|$|E

40|$|The rotary <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> machine {{undergoes}} {{mechanical stress}} as an external force is applied. In {{case of the}} rotary <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> machine, even a tiny flaw results in a fatal demage because {{the size of the}} machine is huge. Therefore, when designing the rotary <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> machine, it is necessary to secure a safety factor with the mechanical stress analysis in order to prevent the machine from being destroyed due to scattering or transformation of rotating field. This thesis proposes a LSM rotary type tesitng machine which rotates at the speed of up to 600 km/h. And the mechanical stress is considered in order that the safety factor remains above 1. 5 at the maximum speed. In addition, because normal force as well as thrust occurs in the machine, the normal force exerted was considered through the strength analysis. Finally, a design plan which enables to weaken the normal force affecting the rotary <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> machine is introduced and its validity is proved by the results of FEM analysis. ? ??? ??????????? ???? ?? ??(???? e???? ?????? ??, ?? ??PK 1501 A) ? ???? ???????...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Compilers for Object-Oriented Languages {{optimize}} dynamic message sends through run-time <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> {{when they}} cannot precisely infer the message receiver type. While run-time <b>type</b> <b>testing</b> optimizes dynamic messages, it still results in redundant <b>type</b> <b>testing.</b> We propose a ow-sensitive analysis which calculates regions {{in a program}} where an object's type is statically unknown but invariant. The type check is hoisted at the entry point of a region and its results are shared over all dynamic call-sites in the region. We implemented this optimization in the Vortex compiler and demonstrate its eectiveness on ve large Cecil benchmarks.

40|$|Dynamic typing is an {{important}} feature of dynamic programming languages. Primitive operators such as those for performing arithmetic and comparisons typically operate {{on a wide variety}} of in put value types, and as such, must internally implement some form of dynamic type dispatch and type checking. Removing such <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> is important for an efficient implementation. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of a novel approach to reducing the number of dynamically executed <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> called context-driven basic block versioning. This simple technique clones and specializes basic blocks in such a way as to allow the compiler to accumulate type information while machine code is generated, without a separate type analysis pass. The accumulated information allows the removal of some redundant <b>type</b> <b>tests,</b> particularly in performance-critical paths. We have implemented intraprocedural context-driven basic block versioning in a JavaScript JIT compiler. For comparison, we have also implemented a classical flow-based type analysis operating on the same concrete types. Our results show that basic block versioning performs better on most benchmarks and removes a large fraction of <b>type</b> <b>tests</b> at the expense of a moderate code size increase. We believe that this technique offers a good tradeoff between implementation complexity and performance, and is suitable for integration in production JIT compilers.

5000|$|Whiley {{takes an}} unusual {{approach}} to type checking {{referred to as}} [...] "Flow Typing". In this scheme, variables can have different static types {{at different points in}} a function or method. Furthermore, on the true branch of a runtime <b>type</b> <b>test,</b> the variable being tested is retyped automatically (rather than requiring an explicit cast). Flow typing is similar to occurrence typing as found in Racket. [...] To aid flow typing, Whiley supports union, intersection and negation types. [...] Union types are comparable to sum types found in functional languages like Haskell but, in Whiley, they are not disjoint. Intersection and negation types are used in the context of flow typing to determine the type of a variable on the true and false branches of a runtime <b>type</b> <b>test.</b> For example, suppose a variable [...] of type [...] and a runtime <b>type</b> <b>test</b> [...] On the true branch, the type of [...] becomes [...] whilst, on the false branch, it becomes [...] Whiley is also unusual in employing a structural rather than nominal type system. Modula-3, Go and Ceylon are examples of other languages which support structural typing in some form.|$|E
