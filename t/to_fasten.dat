5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|The motto in fact {{refers to}} Edward's {{claim to the}} French throne, and the Order of the Garter was created to help pursue this claim. The use of the garter as an emblem may have derived from straps used <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> armour.|$|E
5|$|The diver ascends {{along the}} shotline, and may use it purely {{as a visual}} reference, or can {{hold on to it}} to {{positively}} control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> a diver to an anchor line or shot line during a decompression stop.|$|E
40|$|A {{prosthetic}} valve apparatus (10), {{in particular}} for cardiac applications. The apparatus (10) comprises a valve prosthesis (20) <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> a suture ring (30). The apparatus (10) further {{provides for the}} valve prosthesis (20) <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> the suture ring (30) {{by means of a}} plurality of magnets (21 d, 30 b) which provide a magnetic attraction between the two components...|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} of the M1C was the chinstraps (this was {{seen on the}} M2). The chinstraps found on the M2 and M1C both had a button snap on the end so as <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> the liner.|$|R
60|$|One {{thing was}} clear--the wheel {{must be removed}} from the block. A second thing was equally clear--while the wheel was being removed the car would have <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> the cable by the rope he had brought.|$|R
5|$|The house stood empty {{until the}} Manhattan Project support {{personnel}} arrived in early 1945. The northeast room (the master bedroom) was designated the assembly room. Workbenches and tables were installed. To keep dust and sand out of instruments and tools, {{the windows were}} covered with plastic. Tape was used <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> {{the edges of the}} plastic and to seal doors and cracks in the walls.|$|E
5|$|The camera tracks {{down to a}} lower {{floor on}} the building, where small kittens are thrown into a woodchipper-type machine to provide the filling for Bart Simpson plush dolls. The toys are then placed into a cart pulled by a sad panda which is driven by {{a man with a}} whip. A man {{shipping}} boxes with The Simpsons logo on the side uses the tongue from a severed dolphin head <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> shut the packages. Another employee uses the horn of a sickly unicorn to smash the holes in the center of The Simpsons DVDs. The shot zooms out to reveal that sweatshop is contained within a grim version of the 20th Century Fox logo, surrounded by barbed wire, searchlights, and a watchtower.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivor}} was Edgar Forwood, 67-year-old Managing-Director of Forwood Down and Company Ltd., a South Australian engineering company. He was {{the oldest}} person on board the flight, and probably the most experienced air traveller. He was interviewed by police in hospital in Perth, but {{was not aware of}} much detail about the final minutes of the flight. He said {{there was no sign of}} fire prior to the crash and no announcement to passengers <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> their seat belts. He died six days after the crash and was buried at the North Road cemetery in Adelaide, his home town.|$|E
60|$|When {{the poles}} were all ready {{on each side}} of the creek, the insulators, or glass knobs, to which the wires were to be attached, were <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> them, a foot or two from the top.|$|R
5000|$|The bone {{is still}} more {{malleable}} and can be remodelled relatively 'simply' by greenstick fractures of the bone. At approximately one year of age the bone has become more mineralized and brittle and needs <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> the surrounding bone with sutures or an absorbable plate.|$|R
50|$|Her arms {{appeared}} <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> her sides. Her {{legs were}} intertwined with each other, and her feet had disappeared. The long green train {{of her skirt}} thickened and grew solid, {{and seemed to be}} all one piece with the writhing green pillar of her interlocked legs.|$|R
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy at their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack. The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a visual reference, or can hold on to it to positively control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the issue}} was brought up again, this time as a pontoon bridge. The depth and {{steepness}} of the fjord would make it impossible <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> the bridge to the sea bottom. However, a method without lateral anchorage had been developed for the Hobart Bridge in Australia. Another alternative was launched in 1963, involving a submerged floating tunnel through the fjord. It was estimated to cost between NOK 19.5 and 26 million. Norwegian expatriate Leif J. Sverdrup, co-founder of Sverdrup & Parcel of the United States, inspected the fjord in 1965 and was later hired to plan the bridge in cooperation with Oslo-based civil engineering consultants Prosjektering. Municipal engineers started measuring currents in 1966. Prosjektering and Sverdrup & Parcel recommended a pontoon bridge with a movable section to allow passage of ship traffic. In 1967, a new proposal was launched, in which a seaway tunnel would be blasted out in the rock on the Bergen side.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the pontoon bridge was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the high-strength low-alloy steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> the pontoon bridge to the cable-stayed bridge, came adrift during transport in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E

50|$|As brass {{became more}} readily available, the steel rail was phased out, {{along with its}} {{corrosion}} problems. Brass flex-track continued to be available long after sectional track was introduced, as the three-foot lengths of rail {{reduced the number of}} joints. The biggest disadvantage of flex-track was that it had <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> a roadbed.|$|R

25|$|Double-breasted suit coats {{are almost}} always kept buttoned. When {{there is more than}} one button <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> (as in a {{traditional}} six-on-two arrangement), only the top one need be fastened; in some configurations, the wearer may elect <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> only the bottom button, in order to present a longer line (a style popularised by Prince George, Duke of Kent).|$|E
25|$|Many {{railways}} use large wood screws, {{also called}} lag screws, <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> the tie plates (or baseplates) to the railroad ties.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most modern}} brooches, fibulae {{were not only}} decorative; they {{originally}} served a practical function: <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> clothing, such as cloaks. Fibulae replaced straight pins that were used <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> clothing in the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age. In turn, fibulae were replaced as clothing fasteners by buttons in the Middle Ages. Their descendant, the modern safety pin, remains in use today. In ancient Rome and other places where Latin was used, the same word denoted both a brooch and the fibula bone because a popular form for brooches and {{the shape of the}} bone were thought to resemble one another.|$|E
50|$|A {{floating}} or trapeze tailpiece (similar <b>to</b> a violin's) <b>fastens</b> <b>to</b> {{the body}} {{at the base of}} the guitar. These appear on Rickenbackers, Gretsches, Epiphones, a wide variety of archtop guitars, particularly Jazz guitars, and the 1952 Gibson Les Paul.|$|R
60|$|It was now {{full time}} for the men to arise when {{they found that the}} rope was <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> across their arms; which meant that a rope was <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> on the right arm of one, passed behind his back, <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> the arm of the second, and so behind his back to the third. Smith and Byrne, the former of whom in spite of his protestations to the {{contrary}} was the inhabitant of the cabin, had given the matter up as lost; but as the other, Tim Reynolds, did in fact reside at Drumleesh, he thought he might still show some cause why he should not be arrested for visiting his friend Joe Smith.|$|R
50|$|A Newcomen {{engine was}} {{to be set up}} on a tow-boat in front of another vessel, {{connected}} by a tow-rope. Six paddles in the stern of the tow-boat were <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> a cross axis connected by ropes to another axis which was turned by the engine. Hulls showed how to convert the rectilineal motion of a piston-rod into a rotatory motion.|$|R
25|$|The pin {{that is used}} <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> the {{clothing}} is either {{a continuation of the}} fibula's body or a separate piece attached to the body. The fibula is closed by connecting the end of the pin to a catch plate, or pin rest.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} types of heavy-duty clips are used <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> the rails to the underlying baseplate, one common one being the Pandrol fastener (Pandrol clip), named after its maker, which is shaped like a stubby paperclip. Another one is the Vossloh Tension Clamp.|$|E
25|$|According to a hadith from Bukhari, an Ifrit {{tried to}} {{interrupt}} the prayers of Muhammed. Muhammed overpowered the Ifrit and wanted <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> him to a pillar so that everyone can {{see him in the}} morning. Then, he remembered the statement of Solomon and he dismissed the Ifrit.|$|E
5000|$|A 19-inch rack is a {{standardized}} frame or enclosure for mounting multiple electronic equipment modules. Each module has a front panel that is 19 in wide. The 19-inch dimension includes the edges, or [...] "ears", that protrude {{on each side}} which allow the module <b>to</b> be <b>fastened</b> <b>to</b> the rack frame with screws. Common uses include server, audio, and scientific lab equipment.|$|R

25|$|Early 1975 models {{featured}} {{the seat belt}} interlock system introduced on all 1974 models that required both the driver and front passenger <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. However, Congressional action to rescind that regulation, which led automakers to discontinue the device and permitted dealers and garages to disconnect the device on cars so-equipped.|$|E
25|$|A {{thumbtack}} {{is a short}} nail or pin with a large, slightly {{rounded head}} made of metal which is used <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> documents to a background for public display and which can easily be inserted or removed by hand. The thumbtack was invented by Edwin Moore around 1900, {{the year in which}} he founded the Moore Push-Pin Company.|$|E
25|$|Also new for 1974 was {{a federally}} {{mandated}} interlock system {{that required the}} driver and front-seat passenger <b>to</b> <b>fasten</b> their seat belts in order to start the car. This regulation, which was very unpopular with the buying public, was offered only this one year and on some early 1975 models. It was rescinded by Congressional action.|$|E
