40|$|The guided {{waves are}} used for {{inspection}} of large industrial constructions. The Lamb waves are a sort of the guided waves propagating in planar structures.

The regularities of the excitation of Lamb waves by single longitudinal and shear type transducers has bean determined using numerical modelling. The directivity patterns of the <b>transducers</b> <b>arrays</b> having different configurations have been investigated using the results of the numerical modelling. It was found out that the main problem is not the generation of guided waves, but generation of the desired mode of a guided wave. In the case of generation of various modes under the different angles to the main wavefront direction, it is complicate to interpret the results because the waveforms of the received signal become very complicated. The obtained results revealed several configurations of the <b>transducer</b> <b>arrays</b> which enable generation only the desired mode of the Lamb wave with a relatively low level of the parasitic, e. g., undesired waves.

50|$|Long-{{baseline}} (LBL) systems, as {{in figure}} 1 above, use a sea-floor baseline transponder network. The transponders are typically {{mounted in the}} corners of the operations site. LBL systems yield very high accuracy of generally better than 1 m and sometimes as good as 0.01m along with very robust positions This {{is due to the fact}} that the transponders are installed in the reference frame of the work site itself (i.e. on the sea floor), the wide transponder spacing results in an ideal geometry for position computations, and the LBL system operates without an acoustic path to the (potentially distant) sea surface. Ultra-short-baseline (USBL) systems and the related super-short-baseline (SSBL) systems rely on a small (ex. 230 mm across), tightly integrated <b>transducer</b> <b>array</b> that is typically mounted on the bottom end of a strong, rigid transducer pole which is installed either on the side or in some cases on the bottom of a surface vessel. Unlike LBL and SBL systems, which determine position by measuring multiple distances, the USBL <b>transducer</b> <b>array</b> is used to measure the target distance from the transducer pole by using signal run time, and the target direction by measuring the phase shift of the reply signal as seen by the individual elements of the <b>transducer</b> <b>array.</b> The combination of distance and direction fixes the position of the tracked target relative to the surface vessel. Additional sensors including GPS, a gyro or electronic compass and a vertical reference unit are then used to compensate for the changing position and orientation (pitch, roll, bearing) of the surface vessel and its transducer pole. USBL systems offer the advantage of not requiring a sea floor transponder array. The disadvantage is that positioning accuracy and robustness is not as good as for LBL systems. The reason is that the fixed angle resolved by a USBL system translates to a larger position error at greater distance. Also, the multiple sensors needed for the USBL transducer pole position and orientation compensation each introduce additional errors. Finally, the non-uniformity of the underwater acoustic environment cause signal refractions and reflections that have a greater impact on USBL positioning than is the case for the LBL geometry.|$|E
50|$|At a {{location}} {{where there is}} a change of cross-section or a change inlocal stiffness of the pipe, an echo is generated. Based on thearrival time of the echoes, and the predicted speed of the wave mode at aparticular frequency, the distance of a feature in relation to theposition of the <b>transducer</b> <b>array</b> can be accurately calculated. GWTuses a system of distance amplitude curves (DAC) to correct forattenuation and amplitude drops when estimating the cross-sectionchange (CSC) from a reflection at a certain distance. The DACs areusually calibrated against a series of echoes with known signalamplitude such as weld echoes.|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} ten years, time-reversal of {{acoustic}} fields {{have been shown to}} be a very useful technique in ultrasonic imaging and testing. With the use of <b>transducer</b> <b>arrays,</b> it is possible to steer the sound beam to an arbitrary position within the medium, even if the medium is inhomogeneous or contains scatterers. The major drawback with traditional beamforming and time-reversal techniques is that they require the use of <b>transducer</b> <b>arrays.</b> Recently a new technique was presented that, with the use of a waveguide, makes it possible to focus sound arbitrarily, with only one transducer elements. A problem with the setup is that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is degraded because of interfering echoes from the waveguide. In this paper, we present an echo-cancellation scheme that results in an SNR gain of approximately 33 dB. This enables the new technique to be used in pulse-echo mode, where this was not previously possible. Godkänd; 2002; 20061024 (ysko...|$|R
