40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{coherent}} set of electron impact inelastic cross sections for argon, based on recent experimental measurements. The updated set is validated by comparing calculated swarm parameters and rate coefficients (obtained by solving the two-term approximation electron Boltzmann equation) with available experimental data. This validation procedure is usually adopted when the cross section set {{is to be}} later used in plasma discharge modelling. Simulation results for the electron drift velocity and characteristic energy are in very good agreement with experimental values of these quantities. Calculations, using cross section sets proposed by different authors, of the total (direct + cascade) excitation coefficients to the 4 s and 4 p states, and of the <b>Townsend</b> <b>ionization</b> coefficient, show that the present set ensures the best overall agreement with measured values. The agreement is particularly good for the excitation coefficient to metastable 4 s′[1 / 2] 0 and the <b>Townsend</b> <b>ionization</b> coefficient, which {{are probably the most}} relevant electron macroscopic coefficients in the modelling of discharge plasmas.

It is shown that such a mixture has the same behavior and gas amplification gain slightly modified {{with the increase of}} the (pd) parameter as compared to pure Helium. The use of the mixture gives rise to higher gain with respect to water vapor and more efficiency in the electrical neutralization of the specimen surface compared to He.

In {{the solution of the}} equation no expansion of the distribution function is made. The concentration of methane in the mixture is varied systematically. The distribution function is used to calculate several time-dependent electron swarm parameters in these gas mixtures. For each gas mixture a wide range of E/N values, from 0. 1 to 1000 Td, is investigated.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} electron multiplication in Townsend dis charge {{in the case of}} large values of E/p. An equation for the electron cur-rent density at different discharge points is found. An analytical expression for the first <b>Townsend's</b> <b>ionization</b> coefficient u/p has been obtained from the solution of this equation for a uniform electric field. The slopes a and k of the curves of ionization and total inelastic collision cross sections as functions of energy for some gases are obtained from the analysis of experimental data for a/p. Using the values of a and k one can solve the equation for the electron current density also for the case of non-uniform electric field. As an example, electron current densities in the discharge in nitrogen between two concentric cylinders as functions of voltages are calculated. 1...|$|R

The electron number density and electric field are determined from solution of the one-dimensional coupled continuity equations of charge carriers and Maxwell’s equation. The electron kinetic energy distribution is determined from the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation. A parametric study is conducted {{to examine the effects}} of linear current density (0. 1 - 100 µA per cm of wire length), wire radius (10 - 1000 µm), and air temperature (293 - 800 K) on the distribution of electrons and the <b>Townsend</b> second <b>ionization</b> coefficient. The results are compared to those previously determined for the positive corona discharge. In the negative corona, energetic electrons are present beyond the ionization boundary and the number of electrons is an order of magnitude greater than in the positive corona. The number of electrons increases with increasing gas temperature. The electron energy distribution does not depend on discharge polarity.

These values are often obtained by extrapolating the data of dc Townsend discharges. To check whether this is justified we computed the coefficients for electrons in an rf discharge by using a kinetic model based on a two-term approximation of the electron energy distribution function. The calculated electron mobility and electron diffusion coefficients agree reasonably well with the extrapolated Townsend values.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{electron}} energy distribution functions and the anisotropic drift {{term of the}} velocity distribution functions in non-selfsustaining (Townsend) discharges in argon were determined by direct measurement {{for a range of}} E/N (electric field strength by gas atom concentration) from 70 to 407 Townsends (Td). (One Td equals 1017 volts-cm 2). Motivation is supplied by the theoretical prediction by Heylen and Lewis (9) of unusual electron energy distri-butions in Townsend discharges in the noble gases, and by the subse-quent work by Roberts and Burch (20) supporting this prediction in helium. Some structure {{in the form of the}} distribution functions is observed, but the prediction of Heylen and Lewis (9) for argon is not fully supported. The experimental method employed is to energy-analyse elec-trons effusing from apertures in the anode of a discharge cell with a spherical retarding electric field. The discharge cell has plane parallel electrodes, a guard ring for field uniformity, and a specially built perforated anode. To determine the effect on the measurement of collecting the effusing electrons with a non-ideal collector, the col-lection efficiency of a platinum blacked stainless steel collector was investigated. Also, an attempt was made to insure the sphericity of the retarding field; however, the perturbations due to the non-spherical part of the field were also analyzed. The experimental energy distributions were used along with cross section data from the literature to compute the electron mobil-ities, diffusion constants, mean energies, and <b>Townsends</b> first <b>ionization</b> coefficients.

40|$|The energy {{resolution}} of a proportional counter depends fundamentally on (i) {{fluctuations in the}} number of electron-ion pairs produced in the primary ionization and (ii) fluctuations {{in the size of the}} subsequent electron avalanche. The avalanche fluctuation is typically 3 - 4 times larger than the ionization fluctuation. Previous theoretical and experimental work has indicated that fluctuations in both processes can be reduced by improving the efficiency of the ionization mechanisms involved. The ionization efficiency can be increased by means of the Penning effect. Energy spent exciting metastable states is used to increase the ionization yield. This is achieved by introducing a second gas whose first ionization potential is slightly lower than the first metastable level of the main gas. Cross ionization of the admixture gas by metastable states in the main gas can thus occur. With appropriate conditions, the Penning effect becomes the dominant ionization process. The operation of a proportional counter filled with a range of Penning mixtures is investigated experimentally. Penning mixtures are shown to give improved resolution over the more conventional filling of argon-methane. The Penning mixture, argon-xenon, seems to be a practical alternative filling. In order to make rather more fundamental studies of avalanche fluctuations in Penning mixtures, a uniform field chamber is constructed. With this chamber it is possible to directly compare experimental measurements of f (the relative variance of the avalanche size) with values predicted by various avalanche models. (With a cylindrical counter the ionization efficiency varies from cathode to anode and such a comparison is less clear.) The models assume different variations of the local value of <b>Townsend's</b> first <b>ionization</b> coefficient ai with the distance travelled by an electron from the previous ionization. The results obtained are in reasonable agreement with two of the models but these are unsatisfactory from a theoretical point of view.

Investigated are ac plasma displays of three different sizes: PAF 58, 90 and PAF 128. The development of an individual discharge in a stationary pulse sequence is described by analyzing the light emitted by the discharge and by comparing the data obtained with theore-tical calculations. Essential characteristics of the pulsed light emission of a n ac plasma display discharge are the build-up time t,, i. e. the period from cell voltage switch-on t o the discharge maximum, and the characteristic time z, which is the time constant describing the exponential growth of the discharge in its amplification range.

Plane-parallel aluminum electrodes (5 cm diameter) separated by a variable distance d (4. 0 cm < d < 11. 0 cm) were sustained with a dc voltage (0 < V < 1 kV). A Helmholtz coil was used to produce an uniform magnetic field(B) parallel to the discharge axis. Paschen curves were ob-tained and the secondary electron emission coefficient (γ), the first <b>Townsend</b> <b>ionization</b> coefficient (α) and the ionization efficiency(η), were plotted {{with respect to the}} variation of the reduced field (E/P). To observe the ef-fect of the magnetic field these curves were plotted for fixed values of B= 0 and B= 350 Gauss. As consequence of the longitudinal magnetic field, the free paths of the electrons in the Townsend discharge are lengthened and their lateral diffusion is reduced, thus reducing electron losses to the walls. The data presented in this paper give a quantitative description of the B-field effect on the Townsend’s coefficients and overall it is concluded that the DC {{electrical breakdown}} of the gases is facilitated if a longitudinal magnetic field is applied along the discharge axis. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} a state of the art of the {{understanding}} on the physics of homogeneous dielectric barrier discharges at atmospheric pressure. It is based on the analysis of present and previous work about the behavior of these discharges and the conditions to get them. Mechanisms controlling the homogeneity during gas breakdown and discharge development are successively discussed. The breakdown has to be a <b>Townsend</b> one, the <b>ionization</b> has to be slow enough to avoid a large avalanche development. During the breakdown, the discharge homogeneity is related to the ratio of the secondary emission at the cathode ( coefficient) on the ionization in the gas bulk (coefficient). Higher is this ratio, higher is the pressure  gas gap product () value for which a Townsend breakdown is obtained. Among the phenomena enhancing the secondary emission there is the negative charge of the dielectric on the cathode surface, the trapping of ions in the gas and the existence of excited state having a long lifetime compared to the time between two consecutive discharges. The first phenomenon is always present when the electrodes are covered by a solid dielectric, the second one is related to the formation of a positive column and the third one is specific of the gas. During the discharge development, the homogeneity is mainly controlled by the voltage or the current imposed by the electrical circuit/electrode configuration and by the gas ability to be slowly ionized. Larger is the contribution of a multiple step ionization process like Penning ionization, higher will be the working domain of the discharge. A decrease of the gas voltage during the discharge development is a solution to enhance the contribution of this process. After 20  years of research a lot of mechanisms have been understood however there is still open questions like the nature of the Inhibited homogeneous DBD, surface energy transfers, role of attachment and detachment [...] ...|$|R
