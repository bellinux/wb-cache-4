The aim of {{this work}} is to study the influence of component selection and sizing on the thermodynamic performance of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) designed for ultra-low grade <b>thermal</b> energy <b>recovery.</b> The selected working fluid of the ORC is a refrigerant whose properties are adapted for energy recovery in a low temperature regime, below 100 C. Following a mathematical model, validation of the results was conducted using experimental test using commercial water heater as a heat source, with temperature of the hot water ranging from 75 to 90 ??C. The system was modeled, designed, assembled, and tested. The limits of the ORC system are evaluated {{and the results were}} tabulated. It was found that component efficiencies and sizing have significant impact on system efficiency of ORCs. Expanders are typically expensive, whereas the scroll expander, used in this study, has limited efficiency.

40|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} {{technology is}} an attractive option for capturing carbon dioxide (CO 2) in power generation systems utilizing hydrocarbon fuels. However, conventional atmospheric oxy-fuel combustion systems require substantial parasitic energy in the compression step within the air separation unit (ASU), the flue gas recirculation system and the carbon dioxide purification and compression unit (CPU). Moreover, {{a large amount of}} flue gas latent enthalpy, which has high water concentration, is wasted. Both lower the overall cycle efficiency. Pressurized oxy-fuel combustion power cycles have been investigated as alternatives. Our previous study showed the importance of operating pressure for these cycles. In this paper, as the extended work of our previous study, we perform a pressure sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal combustor operating pressure for the pressurized oxy-fuel combustion power cycle. We calculate the energy requirements of the ASU and the CPU, which vary in opposite directions as the combustor operating pressure is increased.

50|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} (abbreviated EOR) is {{the implementation of}} various techniques for {{increasing the amount of}} crude oil that can be extracted from an oil field.

Work continued to delineate how the wettability of reservoir rock shifts from mixed and intermediate wet conditions to more water-wet conditions as temperature increases.

30|$|In the literature, it {{has been}} found that the usage of the {{aforementioned}} conventional techniques for long term production of heavy oil, usually damages the formation (Baptist 1960; Zhou et al. 1996). This is mainly due to the deposition of paraffin near the well bore and incursion of outside liquids and solids for various types of production operations. Paraffin deposition may also reduce the formation permeability. In addition, these <b>thermal</b> oil <b>recovery</b> techniques may also force the deposited paraffin into the formation resulting in pore throat plugging which may lead to production loss (Bailey et al. 2001).|$|R
30|$|The p {{value for}} all the factors except the {{permeability}} is less than 0.001 (Table 3) which means that all the factors have {{significant effect on the}} heat production except permeability. For the range of permeability considered for modeling, knowledge of the permeability map is less important for predicting the <b>thermal</b> energy <b>recovery</b> presumably due to the constant well rates assumption. This makes sense because the pressure of a geopressured geothermal reservoir is very high and this pressure constraint can provide the flow rate constraint imposed on the production well for the modeled range of permeability (Table 2).|$|R

50|$|Solar thermal {{enhanced}} oil recovery (abbreviated solar EOR) {{is a form}} of thermal {{enhanced oil}} recovery (EOR), a technique applied by oil producers to extract more oil from maturing oil fields.

50|$|As in all <b>thermal</b> <b>recovery</b> processes, cost {{of steam}} {{generation}} {{is a major}} part of the cost of oil production. Historically, natural gas has been used as a fuel for Canadian oil sands projects, due to the presence of large stranded gas reserves in the oil sands area.

The fact that natural gas production in Canada has peaked and is now declining is also a problem. Other sources of generating heat are under consideration, notably gasification of the heavy fractions of the produced bitumen to produce syngas, using the nearby (and massive) deposits of coal, or even building nuclear reactors to produce the heat.|$|E
