5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>irradiation,</b> which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{drugs are}} also used in {{conditioning}} regimens prior to bone marow transplant (hematopoietic stem cell transplant). Conditioning regimens are used to suppress the recipient's immune system {{in order to allow}} a transplant to engraft. Cyclophosphamide is a common cytotoxic drug used in this manner, and is often used in conjunction with <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>irradiation.</b> Chemotherapeutic drugs may be used at high doses to permanently remove the recipient's bone marrow cells (myeloablative conditioning) or at lower doses that will prevent permanent bone marrow loss (non-myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning). When used in non-cancer setting, the treatment is still called Chemotherapy, and is often done in the same treatment center as cancer patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemotherapy}} or irradiation given immediately {{prior to}} a transplant is called the conditioning regimen, the purpose {{of which is to}} help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ablated (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In allogeneic transplants a combination of cyclophosphamide with <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>irradiation</b> is conventionally employed. This treatment also has an immunosuppressive effect that prevents rejection of the HSC by the recipient's immune system. The post-transplant prognosis often includes acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease that may be life-threatening. However, in certain leukemias this can coincide with protection against cancer relapse owing to the graft-versus-tumor effect. Autologous transplants may also use similar conditioning regimens, but many other chemotherapy combinations can be used {{depending on the type of}} disease.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that low-dose ultraviolet-A (UVA- 1) <b>total</b> <b>body</b> <b>irradiations</b> were capable of {{improving}} disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We hypothesized that UVA- 1 -induced suppression of immunoglobulin production by activated B cells in the dermal capillaries could be (partly) responsible for this effect. Our experiments with donor skin demonstrated that approximately 40 % of UVA- 1 could penetrate through the epidermis. Irradiation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with 2 J/cm 2 of UVA- 1 resulted in 20 % cell death. This toxic effect could be prevented totally by preincubation of the cell cultures with catalase. This indicates that the generation of hydrogen peroxide plays a role in UVA- 1 cytotoxicity. T cells and B cells appeared to be less susceptible to UVA- 1 cytotoxicity than monocytes. With the use of a CD 40 –CD 40 L B cell activation method we measured immunoglobulin production after various doses of UVA- 1 irradiation (0 – 2 J/cm 2). The doses of 2 J/cm 2 caused a significant decrease of IgM, IgG, IgA and IgE production under the conditions of interleukin (IL) - 10 or IL- 4 (IgE) stimulation. Although UVA- 1 can cause apoptosis of B lymphocytes, we show that relatively low doses of UVA- 1 radiation also affect the function of these cells. Both effects may be responsible for the observed improvement of disease activity in SLE patients...|$|R

25|$|The precise {{treatment}} intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) {{will depend}} on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. <b>Total</b> <b>body</b> <b>irradiation</b> (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.|$|E

Balb/c female mice received <b>total</b> <b>body</b> single dose gamma radiation (7. 2 Gy) at the diestrous to proestrous transition period. In the first experiment, spontaneously ovulated oocytes were collected from irradiated animals. In the second experiment, irradiated animals were allowed to superovulate to assess the ovarian function. The spontaneous ovulation rate of the follicles exposed at antral stage was {{significantly lower than the}} sham-irradiated mice (p < 0. 01), and most of the oocytes were found at the metaphase I stage. Oocyte morphology and the ovulation rate of the follicles exposed at preantral stage were similar to the sham-irradiated group. Minimal morphological abnormalities were observed in the oocytes and the polar body as well. The superovulation response of all the irradiated animals was lower than the respective control animals. The superovulation rate was significantly lower in the first ovulation after irradiation (p < 0. 01). In conclusion, our findings indicate that <b>total</b> <b>body</b> gamma <b>irradiation,</b> on a basis of estrous cycle stages, leads to ovulation failure in the antral stage while causes abnormal oocyte morphology in the preantral stage follicles in mice...|$|R
40|$|Background: The radiation-induced energy {{metabolism}} dysfunction related to injury and radiation doses is largely elusive. The {{purpose of this}} study is to investigate the early response of {{energy metabolism}} in small intestinal tissue and its correlation with pathologic lesion after <b>total</b> <b>body</b> X-ray <b>irradiation</b> (TBI) in Tibet minipigs. Methods and Results: 30 Tibet minipigs were assigned into 6 groups including 5 experimental groups and one control group with 6 animals each group. The minipigs in these experimental groups were subjected to a TBI of 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 Gy, respectively. Small intestine tissues were collected at 24 h following X-ray exposure and analyzed by histology and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). DNA contents in this tissue were also examined. Irradiation causes pathologic lesions and mitochondrial abnormalities. The Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content-corrected and uncorrected adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) and total adenine nucleotides (TAN) were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner by 2 – 8 Gy exposure, and no further reduction was observed over 8 Gy.

Furthermore, the functional maturity of T and B cells involved in adaptive immunity following allogeneic UCBC- and BMC-transplantation was assessed in T- and B-deficient RAG 2 -/- BALB/c mice. Both sets of recipients showed complete rejection of third-party C 3 H (H- 2 k) skin grafts and antibody responses to the T cell-dependent antigen, 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet hemocyanin, with immunoglobulin class switching.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{evaluated}} the endocrine, biochemical, and haematological derangements as well as pancreatic and histological changes of the bone-marrow in the primate following external fractionated subtotal marrow irradiation without bonemarrow reconstitution. The irradiation was administered in preparation for pancreatic transplantation. Two groups of animals (ten in each group) received 800 rad (8 Gy) and 1, 000 rad (10 Gy) respectively over 4 to 5 weeks. A maximum of 200 rads (2 Gy) were administered weekly as photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. During irradiation the animals remained normoglycaemic {{in the presence of}} transiently elevated liver enzymes and serum amylase values, which returned to normal on completion of the irradiation. Insulin release was significantly reduced in both groups during irradiation and was associated with minimally decreased K-values in the presence of mild glucose intolerance. Pancreatic light morphologic changes included structural changes of both exocrine and endocrine elements and included necrosis of the islet cells and acinar tissue. Islet histology demonstrated striking cytocavitary network changes of alpha and beta cells, including degranulation, vacuolization, mitochondrial destruction, and an increase in lysosomes.

Whereas MyD 88 has an essential function in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, a role for Mal in this context is less well described. Colitis was induced in wild-type (WT) and Mal-deficient (Mal(-/-)) mice by administration of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS).

Here, we provide evidence that {{a part of this}} immune suppression may be attributable to dysfunction of immune regulation. We investigated the effects of sublethal TBI on T cell memory responses to gain insight into the potential for loss of vaccine immunity following such exposure. We show that in mice primed to an MHC class I alloantigen, the accelerated graft rejection T memory response is specifically lost several weeks following TBI, whereas identically treated naı̈ve mice at the same time point had completely recovered normal rejection kinetics. Depletion in vivo with anti-CD 4 or anti-CD 25 showed that the mechanism involved cells consistent with a regulatory T cell (T reg) phenotype. The loss of the T memory response following TBI was associated with a relative increase of CD 4 +CD 25 + Foxp 3 + expressing T regs, as compared to the CD 8 + T effector cells requisite for skin graft rejection. The radiation-induced T memory suppression was shown to be antigen-specific in that a third party ipsilateral graft rejected with normal kinetics. Remarkably, following the eventual rejection of the first MHC class I disparate skin graft, the suppressive environment was maintained, with markedly prolonged survival of a second identical allograft.

Musculoskeletal disuse by hindlimb unloading (1 or 2 wk) or <b>total</b> <b>body</b> gamma <b>irradiation</b> (1 or 2 Gy of 137 Cs) of 4 -mo-old, male C 57 BL/ 6 mice each decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in the proximal tibiae and lumbar vertebrae.

Similarly, osteoclast surface in the tibiae increased 46 % {{as a result of}} irradiation, 47 % as a result of hindlimb unloading, and 64 % as a result of irradiation + hindlimb unloading compared with normally loaded mice. Irradiation, but not hindlimb unloading, reduced viability and increased apoptosis of marrow cells and caused oxidative damage to lipids within mineralized tissue. Irradiation also stimulated generation of reactive oxygen species in marrow cells. Furthermore, injection of α-lipoic acid, an antioxidant, mitigated the acute bone loss caused by irradiation. Together, these results showed that disuse and gamma irradiation, alone or in combination, caused a similar degree of acute cancellous bone loss and shared a common cellular mechanism of increased bone resorption. Furthermore, irradiation, but not disuse, may increase the number of osteoclasts and the extent of acute bone loss via increased reactive oxygen species production and ensuing oxidative damage, implying different molecular mechanisms. The finding that α-lipoic acid protected cancellous tissue from the detrimental effects of irradiation has potential relevance to astronauts and radiotherapy patients...|$|R
