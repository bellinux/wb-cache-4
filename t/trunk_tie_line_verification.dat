This study demonstrates that: (1) an alcohol and a surfactant combination is more efficient than an alcohol used alone in water; (2) the prediction of the dominant recovery mechanism from the <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> slopes in phase diagram is accurate and can be reproduced in sand column experiments; and (3) TCE recovery efficiency in sand column experiments is generally well represented by {{the position of the}} miscibility curve in phase diagrams in the low concentration range. However, the miscibility curve alone is not sufficient to exactly predict the TCE recovery mechanisms involved. <b>Tie</b> <b>line</b> slopes and the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> have to be taken into consideration to select the active matter as well as its concentration and to predict the dominant recovery mechanism in sand column experiments. The sand column experiments quantified the recovery efficiency of each solution and identified the proportion of the recovery mechanisms (mobilisation vs. solubilisation). Washing solutions with an active matter concentration above the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> caused dominating mobilisation. Mobilisation was also dominant when the active matter of the washing solution partitioned into the organic phase and the active matter concentration was below the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> Solubilisation and emulsification were dominant for washing solutions containing active matter, which principally partitioned into the aqueous phase and an active matter concentration below the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> Copyright 2003 Elsevier B.

This paper presents the first partially miscible aqueousorganic mixtures flash point measurements and modeling for the ternary type-I mixtures, water + ethanol + 1 -butanol, water + ethanol + 2 -butanol, and the type-II mixture, water + 1 -butanol + 2 -butanol. Results reveal that the flash points are constant in each <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> Handling the non-ideality of the liquid phase through the use of activity coefficient models, the general flash-point model of Liaw et al. extended to partially miscible mixtures predicts the experimental data well when using literature LLE and the VLE activity coefficient model binary parameters to estimate sequentially the span and flash point in each <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> and the flash point in the mutual solubility region, respectively. The constant flash-point behavior in a <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> is also observed and predicted, in agreement with the VLLE <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> property that a single vapor is in equilibrium with all liquid composition on a <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> For the aqueousorganic mixtures here studied, a deviation between prediction and measurements is observed, arising from the failure of the constant lower flammable limit assumption in the mutual solubility inert-rich region.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} determine the optimal or near optimal commitment schedule for generating units located in multiple areas that are interconnected via <b>tie</b> <b>lines.</b> The evolutionary programming based particle swarm optimization method is used to solve multi area unit commitment problem, allocated generation for each area and find the operating cost of generation for each hour. Joint operation of generation resources can result in significant operational cost savings. Power transfer between the areas through the <b>tie</b> <b>lines</b> depends upon the operating cost of generation at each hour and <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> transfer limits.
