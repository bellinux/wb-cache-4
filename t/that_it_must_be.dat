5|$|After {{making the}} {{decision}} to use a new character rather than Dizzy, Codemasters allowed Big Red Software free rein to develop the new game, only stipulating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> ready for release within 12weeks. By this point Big Red Software was already familiar with platform adventure games. The game retained the Dizzy graphic adventure title engine. Pete Ranson had previously designed graphics for every Dizzy game bar the first, graphics were shared between Dizzy games and some were also recycled for Seymour Goes to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|After {{saving the}} Mushroom Kingdom in Super Mario Bros. 3, {{brothers}} Mario and Luigi {{decide to go}} on holiday to a place called Dinosaur Land, where there are many types of dinosaurs. However, while resting on the beach, Princess Toadstool disappears. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who then tells them that his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopas. Mario and Luigi soon realise <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> the evil King Bowser and his Koopalings.|$|E

5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} wastes to ammonia {{and dump}} it via their gills, and excrete other wastes as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other wastes for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> diluted rapidly with {{large quantities of}} water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous wastes to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter wastes out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, {{a system that has}} evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E
5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this. They concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E
5|$|The usual {{transportation}} of plutonium {{is through the}} more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package. A typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container, holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200kg of plutonium oxide. A sea shipment may consist of several containers, each of them holding a sealed package. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission dictates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74TBq (20Curie) of radioactive activity. In a recent example, the ships Pacific Egret and Pacific Heron of Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. are taking 331kg (730lbs) of plutonium to a United States government facility in Savannah River, South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the tale}} of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original, the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself. In the battle between Rama and Ravana, Indrajit – the son of Ravana – creates an {{illusion}}ary Sita (Maya Sita) and kills {{her in front of}} Rama's monkey general Hanuman, as a war tactic to dampen the spirits of Rama's army. The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama, who is also dejected by the news. However, they soon realise <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> an illusion of Indrajit. Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic. At the end of the Ramayana, a golden image of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices, after Sita's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects.|$|E
5|$|After fleeing Aboukir Bay, Admiral Villeneuve {{had been}} delayed in the Eastern Mediterranean by northeasterly winds, and on 17 August {{he decided to}} split his forces, sailing for Malta with his {{flagship}} Guillaume Tell and the two frigates while Captain Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille on Généreux was ordered to Corfu. Before they departed, a number of men were transferred to Généreux, which was already carrying survivors from Timoléon, one of the ships destroyed in Aboukir Bay, giving Généreux a crew of 936 men. As Généreux rounded the island of Goza off the western tip of Crete (then known as Candia) on the following morning, his lookouts reported a sail to the northwest. This vessel was Leander. Learning of the strange ship to the southeast, Captain Thompson deduced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> one of Villeneuve's ships and immediately ordered all sails set {{in an effort to}} avoid an unequal combat: Généreux carried 30 more guns than Leander and was more strongly built, carrying a broadside of over 1,000lbs to Leanders 432lbs.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Torch {{is brought}} into the stadium, passed from athlete to athlete during the torch relay, until it reaches the last carrier; often a {{well-known}} athlete from the host nation, who lights {{the fire in the}} stadium's cauldron. Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the opening ceremony for the 2010 Games in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was BC Place, which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first torch lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist Catriona Le May Doan, Canadian Senator Nancy Greene, who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, NBA star Steve Nash, a native of nearby Victoria, and hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, to each light one of four arms of the torch. Notably, Le May Doan's arm refused to light; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the torch and succeeded.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, President Shinra becomes {{suspicious}} of the Turks activities, believing that someone within the organization is leaking sensitive information. He concludes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> Veld, and removes him from command, instead placing the company's security leader Heidegger in charge. In his first operation however, Heidegger nearly destroys Junon, and the President reinstates Veld. In his first mission back in command, Veld plans to defeat AVALANCHE. An assault is launched at a Mako Reactor, during which Rufus Shinra is revealed to be the traitor supporting AVALANCHE. He is captured by the Turks and placed under house arrest. At the same time, Shears defects to the Turks {{in an effort to}} save the gravely ill Elfé. Veld discovers that Elfé is his daughter Felicia, whom he thought dead in a botched Shinra operation, and resigns from the Turks. With Elfé continuing to weaken, Fuhito takes over the command of AVALANCHE. It is revealed that a Materia owned by Elfé is Zirconiade, an ancient and powerful summoned monster that Fuhito intends to use to destroy humanity and stop them harming the planet. However, the Materia is broken, and is slowly draining Elfé's life energy. To save her, the four Support Materia must be found. Fuhito holds one, and the Turks and Shears hold another.|$|E

25|$|As {{the above}} {{summation}} argument shows, the Cantor set is uncountable but has Lebesgue measure 0.
