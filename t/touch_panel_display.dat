40|$|Abstract — This paper {{discusses}} {{a method}} to create pictograms based on multiplex local sign languages with applying the concept of “Context of Use ” on dialogue with applying Multivariate Analysis (MVA). Since pictograms are universal communication tools, human centred design (HCD) and context analysis by Persona model are applied. The experiments consist of three steps. The {{first step is to}} find out the similarity of a selected word among seven different local sign languages, which are American, British, French Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Chinese by means of MVA. The second step is to create a new common pictogram referring to the first step result by a pictogram designer. The final step is to validate the newly created pictogram by MVA. Under the cycle of HCD, the pictogram designer will perform to summarize the expression of several local sign languages by this method. The acquisition of this experience is to include it as a pictogram design guideline for context of universal communications such as emergency and traveling situations. Through the proposed method, the relationship between selected words and local sign languages are initially explained by sensory evaluation of the subjects. Currently the outcome of pictograms or icons of this experiment are implemented on the modern tablet computers with a <b>touch</b> <b>panel</b> <b>display</b> considering computer-human interactions...|$|E

A robotic synthetic platform is used to explore the wide parameter space of a chemical bath system that uses only cheap and earth abundant chemicals for thin film deposition. As-deposited films {{are found to be}} highly resistive, however, through exposure to several millisecond pulses of high-intensity, broadband light, intrinsically doped ZnO films with sheet resistances as low as 40 Ω □- 1 can be readily prepared. Such values are comparable with state-of-the-art-doped transparent conducting oxides. The mild processing conditions (&lt; 150 °C) of the ZnO electrodes also enable their deposition on temperature sensitive substrates such as PET, paving the way for their use in various flexible optoelectronic devices. Proof-of-concept light emitting devices employing ZnO as a transparent electrode are presented. Highly conductive, intrinsically doped ZnO electrodes are prepared using a low-temperature aqueous deposition and a flash light postprocessing. The aqueous bath chemistry favors the formation of oxygen deficient ZnO films, which are then flashed with millisecond light pulses to achieve record conductivity and high transparency.

40|$|Functional {{coatings}} {{on position}} 1 produce a huge interest in many fields of applications. Since these coatings {{are exposed to}} atmospheric conditions and natural environment such as dust, dirt or salt, their resistance to mechanical abrasion and their chemical stability is crucial for their function over lifetime. The use of float glass and a heat treatable and bendable coating is necessary for cost-effective production of curved and toughened glass. At Fraunhofer IST a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coating has been developed for position 1 based on a high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) generator. For depositing ITO films at varying deposition parameter a prototype power supply from Advanced Energy was used. This technique offers the interesting possibility to achieve films with low surface roughness and excellent conductivity by using an inline sputter coater. The ionization of the sputtered material helps structuring the formation in the initial steps of film growth. The deposition at low substrate temperatures shows superior electrical properties compared to DC sputtering [1]. Fields of application for this coating are photovoltaics, low emissivity coatings, heat mirrors or panel heaters as well as <b>touch</b> <b>panels</b> and <b>displays.</b> ITO film properties have been studied by optical spectroscopy (UV/VIS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements.
