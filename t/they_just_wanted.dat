25|$|In 1983 The Faith {{released}} an eight-song twelve inch EP called Subject to Change. It {{was produced by}} Ian MacKaye and showed the band progressing into more melodic territory {{with the addition of}} a second guitarist. Eddie Janney, formerly of the Untouchables and Ian MacKaye's short-lived Skewbald/Grand Union, joined The Faith at the end of 1982 to play second guitar and made his recorded debut. The addition was made because they wanted to get some more complex guitar ideas into the songs and soften the impact of guitar malfunctions, which were a constant threat during good shows. Not to mention, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> a fuller sound and liked the way Eddie played.|$|E

500|$|When Roger Corman's House of Usher was {{released}} in June 1960, its [...] box office success took AIP's James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff by surprise. Corman admitted, [...] "We anticipated that the movie would do well... but not half {{as well as it}} did." [...] According to Richard Matheson, [...] "When the first film was a hit, they still didn't consider doing a Poe series. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> another movie with a Poe title fixed to it." ...|$|E

500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I think <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> a northwest guy to do it, {{because they were}} shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E
500|$|Contrary to the accusations, {{the band}} have always denied {{the notion that}} they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video. Steve Harris has since commented that, [...] "It was mad. They {{completely}} got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists." [...] Harris has also stated that [...] "The Number of the Beast" [...] song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching , and also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter. Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born again Christian since 1999.|$|E

I heard later on that Steven had watched a few girls on tape that day, and I {{was the only}} one who ended up waking his {{sleeping}} wife off the couch, and she came running through the hallway to see if the kids were all right." [...] Joseph Mazzello had initially screen-tested for a role in Hook, but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised Mazzello that they would work together on a future film. Robin Wright turned down a role in the film. Christina Ricci auditioned for a role, but did not receive it.|$|E

500|$|While {{the event}} is {{considered}} a memorable one by several critics, they also agree {{that it was not}} one of the Stones' best performances, and the guitars played during the concert were out of tune. In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Keith Richards evaluated their performance, [...] "We played pretty bad until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to hear us play again." [...] The Stones' portion of concert was filmed by Granada Television and broadcast that September. It has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray. In April 2013, the band announced their intention to play two return concerts on 6 and 13 July, although the performances were not free.|$|E
500|$|During production, the film's English {{title was}} changed from The Snow Queen to Frozen, a {{decision}} that drew comparisons to another Disney film, Tangled. Peter Del Vecho explained that [...] "the title Frozen came up independently of the title Tangled. It's because, to us, it represents the movie. Frozen plays {{on the level of}} ice and snow but also the frozen relationship, the frozen heart that has to be thawed. We don't think of comparisons between Tangled and Frozen, though." [...] He also mentioned that the film will still retain its original title, The Snow Queen, in some countries: [...] "because that just resonated stronger in some countries than Frozen. Maybe there's a richness to The Snow Queen in the country's heritage and <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to emphasize that." ...|$|E

Cuoco viewed Billie as a [...] "little sister" [...] to the Halliwell sisters, and attributed her as [...] "very naive and always getting in trouble". She described the character's wardrobe as [...] "cute and fun", and felt that it matched her own personal style. When discussing the casting process, Cuoco stated that Billie's initial characterization was based solely on her physical appearance, explained, [...] "I think <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> a blonde on the show". Co-executive producer James L. Conway believed Billie's identity as a novice witch added a new dynamic to the show, while Pam Shae called the character [...] "demanding", [...] "spunky", and [...] "very, very confident" [...] despite her inexperience with magic. Keri Blakinger of New York Daily News felt that Billie developed into a [...] "powerful witch in her own right" [...] {{over the course of}} the season.|$|E

500|$|The Neptunes told MTV News {{that the}} duo and Timberlake drove {{in a car}} {{listening}} to Earth, Wind & Fire albums for inspiration, with {{the background of the}} band's music what the production duo wanted to implement into Justified musical content. The production duo commented that despite not being content with sampling music, for inspiration, they also listened to both Off the Wall (1979) and Thriller (1982), albums by Michael Jackson. Their intentions were to create music that was similar to Jackson's work without [...] "recycling them". One of the two members of The Neptunes, Chad Hugo, commented that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to re-create [...] "that sense of those timeless, classic songs, without any of the 'bling, bling, hit me on my two-way' style of the new R It has elements of the old and the new." [...] The producer further {{went on to say that}} people wanted Timberlake to be conformed to being part of boy band NSYNC, with the former insisting that the singer is an immaculate vocalist. Hugo acknowledged Timberlake's break-up with singer Britney Spears, saying that some of the album's music could be directed towards it.|$|E
500|$|Cacophonous being {{a secular}} label {{releasing}} material by {{a band that}} held Christian beliefs generated some interest in the metal scene. In an interview with Art for the Ears Webzine, published on December 12, 1998, Armoth said: [...] "We sent the CD and a short biography. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to sign us because of the music. And that's exactly {{what we wanted to}} do." [...] 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I can not say they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. They just said that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because {{we did not want to}} provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to try to come up with a way to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E

500|$|Australian activist Julian Assange—the {{founder of}} WikiLeaks—appeared as himself. Many of his lines {{were written by}} Australian author Kathy Lette, {{who is one of}} Assange's friends. According to Lette, [...] "Julian and The Simpsons {{producers}} asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. I guess <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> me to add a little Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from an irony deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers knew I could fire off a quip or two." [...] In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there. Assange was arrested in England, before being freed on conditional bail until a decision would be made {{as to whether or not}} he should be extradited to Sweden. Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assange's performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number to call and received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assange's legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is [...] "a controversial figure, and there's a good reason he's controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to have him on the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it." [...] Groening has said in an interview that [...] "We [...] dare ourselves to do things and Julian Assange was a dare." ...|$|E
500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them to ask me to come on and act—then <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> me to come on and sing ... Just to come on and be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do until I saw [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] I would have done it in a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of her tracks on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E
