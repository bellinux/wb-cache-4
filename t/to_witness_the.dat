5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> <b>the</b> devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E

He also frequented La Bibliothèque roumaine ("The Romanian Library"), while affiliating to the Freemasonry and joining the Lodge known as L'Athénée des étrangers ("Foreigners' Atheneum"), as did most other reform-minded Romanians in Paris. In 1846, he visited Spain, wishing <b>to</b> <b>witness</b> <b>the</b> wedding of Isabella II and the Duke of Cádiz, {{but he was also}} curious to assess developments in Spanish culture.

The progenitor of the Royal Geographic Society, James Rennell, was a midshipman aboard Brilliant {{during this period}} and produced his first coastal map while the frigate was stationed off Saint Cast.
