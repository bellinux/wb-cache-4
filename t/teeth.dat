5|$|Both {{species of}} Knoetschkesuchus {{have only two}} {{distinct}} types of <b>teeth,</b> uniquely among atoposaurids. Other atoposaurids have a third type of leaf-shaped <b>teeth.</b> The first type of <b>teeth,</b> found {{near the front of}} the jaw, are conical, slightly constricted at the base, and curved slightly inwards. A subtype is represented by the canine-like or pseudocaniniform <b>teeth.</b> They are the fourth and fifth maxillary <b>teeth,</b> and are enlarged (about twice the size of the other maxillary <b>teeth),</b> more pointed, and more constricted at the base. The second type of <b>teeth,</b> which constitutes the rest of the <b>teeth,</b> are shaped like thin lanceheads, with a wide base and a narrower tip; in K. guimarotae all of the tips are sharp, but in K. langenbergensis they gradually become blunter.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian <b>teeth</b> {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have <b>teeth</b> that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The <b>teeth</b> of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The <b>teeth</b> on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper <b>teeth</b> are visible when the mouth is closed. The <b>teeth</b> on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower <b>teeth</b> visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|Gorgosaurus <b>teeth</b> were {{typical of}} all known tyrannosaurids. The eight premaxillary <b>teeth</b> {{at the front}} of the snout were smaller than the rest, closely packed and D-shaped in cross section. In Gorgosaurus, the first tooth in the maxilla was also shaped like the premaxillary <b>teeth.</b> The rest of the <b>teeth</b> were oval in cross section, rather than blade-like as in most other theropods. Along with the eight premaxillary <b>teeth,</b> Gorgosaurus had 26 to 30maxillary <b>teeth</b> and 30 to 34teeth in the dentary bones of the lower jaw. This number of <b>teeth</b> is similar to Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus but is fewer than those of Tarbosaurus or Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

50|$|This {{particular}} formula, {{which is}} common to the scaphopods, means one marginal <b>tooth,</b> one lateral <b>tooth,</b> one rachidian <b>tooth,</b> one lateral <b>tooth,</b> and one marginal <b>tooth</b> across the ribbon.|$|R
5|$|Like other thyreophorans, Scelidosaurus was herbivorous. However, {{while some}} later ornithischian groups possessed <b>teeth</b> capable of {{grinding}} plant material, Scelidosaurus had smaller, less complex leaf-shaped <b>teeth</b> suitable for cropping vegetation and jaws capable of only vertical movement, {{due to a}} short jaw joint. Paul Barrett concluded that Scelidosaurus fed with a puncture-crush system of tooth-on-tooth action, with a precise but simple up-and-down jaw movement, in which the food was mashed between the inner side of the upper <b>teeth</b> and the outer side of the lower <b>teeth,</b> without the <b>teeth</b> actually touching each other as shown by very long vertical wear facets on the lower <b>teeth</b> alone.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is the complex process by which <b>teeth</b> form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have <b>teeth,</b> their {{development is}} largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human <b>teeth</b> to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary <b>teeth</b> start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent <b>teeth</b> begin to form in the twentieth week. If <b>teeth</b> do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened <b>teeth</b> used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like <b>teeth</b> for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower <b>teeth</b> for gripping and triangular upper <b>teeth</b> with serrated edges for cutting. The <b>teeth</b> of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
50|$|Gears {{have been}} {{included}} within Lego Technic sets since 1977 {{as a way of}} transferring rotary power, and of gearing-up or down the speed. Gears come in several sizes: 8 <b>tooth,</b> 16 <b>tooth,</b> 24 <b>tooth</b> and 40 <b>tooth</b> spur gears; 12 <b>tooth,</b> 20 <b>tooth</b> and 36 <b>tooth</b> double bevel gears; and 12 <b>tooth</b> and 20 <b>tooth</b> single bevel gears. The double bevel gears are cut so they can also be meshed as spur gears. There is also a 16 <b>tooth</b> clutch gear, and a 24 <b>tooth</b> friction gear that slips when a certain amount of torque is put on it to prevent motors from damaging any parts or burning themselves out.|$|R
5000|$|Crocodilia are {{the only}} non-mammalian {{vertebrates}} with <b>tooth</b> sockets. [...] Alligators grow a successional <b>tooth</b> (a small replacement <b>tooth)</b> under each mature functional <b>tooth</b> for replacement once a year, each <b>tooth</b> being replaced up to 50 times in the alligator's life. Crocodilia are researched for <b>tooth</b> regeneration in humans.|$|R
40|$|In general, a {{hypoid gear}} and a {{spiral bevel gear}} for cars {{are made up of}} a formate gear and a {{generated}} pinion. The <b>tooth</b> shape is tapered <b>tooth.</b> Much practice is required to obtain excellent <b>tooth</b> bearing of the tapered <b>tooth.</b> If we convert a tapered <b>tooth</b> to an equi-depth <b>tooth,</b> it is thought that we could easily obtain practical <b>tooth</b> bearing. To date, however, there is no paper that theoretically analyzes <b>tooth</b> bearing of the equi-depth <b>tooth</b> and actually demonstrates it. Therefore the tapered <b>tooth</b> is still used in cars. Thus, we have studied the gear cutting method of the equi-depth <b>tooth</b> hypoid gear. The <b>tooth</b> surface of the hypoid pinion is generated by the 3 rd gear member. In such a case, it is useful to apply the cutting pitch cone instead of the pitch cone and to change the generating shaft angle to the <b>tooth</b> bearing development of a hypoid gear. In this report, we present the relationships between the cutting pitch angle or the generating shaft angle and the <b>tooth</b> bearing pattern compared with a tapered <b>tooth...</b>|$|R
5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil <b>teeth</b> {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark <b>teeth,</b> and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such <b>teeth.</b> He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also contained an illustration of a megalodon tooth.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two <b>teeth)</b> shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent <b>teeth.</b> Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the <b>teeth</b> touch and bone is any greater.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate <b>teeth,</b> a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of <b>teeth</b> in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack <b>teeth</b> in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no <b>teeth.</b> In many amphibians there are also vomerine <b>teeth</b> attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E

5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} <b>teeth</b> secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to <b>teeth</b> as anchor points. Typically the number of <b>teeth</b> will outnumber the anchor points with the <b>teeth</b> that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two <b>teeth</b> (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of <b>teeth</b> (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature of Aravan's iconography {{is the presence}} of demonic canine <b>teeth.</b> Although the central Koovagam icon does not feature such demonic <b>teeth,</b> they are a regular feature of most Draupadi cult images, where Aravan's demonic features are emphasized.|$|E
5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual <b>teeth.</b> In the tooth sockets, new <b>teeth</b> grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of <b>teeth</b> posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tooth</b> {{whitening}} (termed <b>tooth</b> bleaching when utilizing bleach), {{is either}} restoration of natural <b>tooth</b> shade or whitening beyond natural <b>tooth</b> shade, {{depending on the}} definition used.|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} focused on the mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> width since it is {{believed}} that proper mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> width ratio of the maxillary and mandibular arches is necessary to have proper interdigitation, overbite, and overjet [35]. It is therefore important to know the characteristics of mesiodistal <b>tooth</b> width in <b>tooth</b> agenesis patients for making a treatment plan. However, because buccolingual dimensions and <b>tooth</b> shape were also affected in <b>tooth</b> agenesis patients [20, 22, 29], further analysis including three-dimensional analysis is essential to clarify the relation of <b>tooth</b> size/shape and <b>tooth</b> agenesis in Japanese patients.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tooth</b> {{discoloration}} (also termed <b>tooth</b> staining) is abnormal <b>tooth</b> color, hue or translucency. External discoloration is {{accumulation of}} {{stains on the}} <b>tooth</b> surface. Internal discoloration is due to absorption of pigment particles into <b>tooth</b> structure. Sometimes there are several different co-existent factors responsible for discoloration.|$|R
5|$|As {{noted by}} Arthur M. Greenhall:If there is fur {{on the skin}} of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek <b>teeth</b> like a barber's blades to shave away the hairs. The bat's razor-sharp upper incisor <b>teeth</b> then make a 7mm wide and 8mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them {{permanently}} razor sharp. Their <b>teeth</b> are so sharp, even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsid <b>teeth,</b> {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older <b>teeth</b> on top were continually replaced by the <b>teeth</b> underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid <b>teeth</b> sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure.

5|$|Diastema is a {{condition}} {{in which there is a}} gap between two <b>teeth</b> caused by the imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Discoloration of <b>teeth</b> {{may result}} from {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of <b>teeth</b> black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on <b>teeth.</b> This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in <b>teeth,</b> causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause <b>teeth</b> to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the <b>teeth.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Tooth</b> wear is the non-carious loss of <b>tooth</b> tissue, {{which results}} from three {{processes}} namely attrition, erosion and abrasion.

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of <b>tooth</b> wear among 16 -year old Malay school children and determine a feasible sample size for further study. Fifty-five subjects were examined clinically, followed by the completion of self-administered questionnaires. Questionnaires consisted of socio-demographic and associated variables for <b>tooth</b> wear obtained from the literature. The Smith and Knight <b>tooth</b> wear index was used to chart <b>tooth</b> wear. Other oral findings were recorded using the WHO criteria.

40|$|AbstractA {{fabrication}} {{method is}} adopted for which an imaginary gear simultaneously realizes conjugated meshing with an arc <b>tooth</b> cylindrical gear and an arc <b>tooth</b> face-gear. The cutter fillet and <b>tooth</b> crest edge form the <b>tooth</b> root fillet of the gear, and the linear <b>tooth</b> surface equation of the imaginary gear and the position vector of the curvature center of the cutter fillet are constructed with certain cutter inclination to deduce a working arc <b>tooth</b> surface equation. The <b>tooth</b> root fillet equation of the arc <b>tooth</b> face-gear {{is derived from the}} meshing geometry and kinematics. A numerically controlled machining model of the arc <b>tooth</b> face-gear is established through the transformation of adjustment parameters from the cutter-tilt milling machine to a common multi-axis NC machine. Motion parameters of each movement axis of the NC machine are acquired. A processing example is presented to verify the precision of the fabrication method in processing the arc <b>tooth</b> face-gear. The method provides a theoretical and tentative basis for the analysis of <b>tooth</b> surface contact stress, <b>tooth</b> root bending stress and dynamics. A hobbing test is conducted to demonstrate the good meshing condition of the arc <b>tooth</b> face-gear pair...|$|R
