5|$|Numerous archaeological discoveries {{show that}} silk {{had become a}} luxury {{material}} appreciated in foreign countries well before {{the opening of the}} Silk Road by the Chinese. For example, silk has been found in the Valley of the Kings in a tomb of a mummy dating from 1070 BCE. First the Greeks, then the Romans began to speak about the Seres (people of silk), a term to designate the inhabitants of the far-off kingdom, China. According to certain historians, the first Roman contact with silk was that of the legions of the governor of Syria, Crassus. At the Battle of Carrhae, near to the Euphrates, the legions were said to be so surprised by <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banners of Parthia that they fled.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E

25|$|During {{his tenure}} at the RFC, Reed {{influenced}} two major national policies. First, Reed was instrumental in setting up the Commodity Credit Corporation. In early October 1933, President Roosevelt ordered RFC president Jesse Jones to establish a program to strengthen cotton prices. On October 16, 1933, Jones met with Reed and together they created the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6340 the next day, which legally established the CCC. <b>The</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CCC was {{that the government would}} hold surplus cotton as security for the loan. If cotton prices rose above the value of the loan, farmers could redeem their cotton, pay off the loan and make a profit. If prices stayed low, the farmer still had enough money to live as well as plant next year. The plan worked so well that it became the basis for the New Deal's entire agricultural program.|$|E

Worshipped The Lord's feet at Chidambaram and being blessed with a vision of His was further helped by saint Vyaghrapada to consecrate a place of worship therewith. The temple murals and some cholan and pandyan literature refer to this sthala puranam. The chidambaram mahatyam as well as koyil puranam by the same author discuss as to how this prince who was presented with dhataki or atti garland and tiger flag in which Lord Indra would take abode to make him ever victorious was blessed with vision of lord and further attained mukti at this spot. This is very credible because all ancient {{literature and}} documents report that tiger flag and atti or dhataki (grislea tomentosa) garland as being emblematic with cholas. Some sangam period works also passingly refer to the krita age king's war with demons and his victory against them. The king also went by name Vyaghraketu after being gifted with the tiger flag.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reach <b>the</b> high <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light, ELETTRA has been {{designed}} for small emittances and is operating at high beam currents normally in the multi-bunch mode, being exposed there to coupled bunch instabilities.

500|$|Light {{became a}} popular means for 15th-century Northern {{painters}} {{to represent the}} mystery of the Incarnation, utilising the idea of light passing through glass without shattering it to convey the paradox of conception and [...] "virgo intacta". This is reflected in a passage attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux from his [...] "Sermones de Diversis"; [...] "Just as <b>the</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun fills and penetrates a glass window without damaging it, and pierces its solid form with imperceptible subtlety, neither hurting it when entering nor destroying it when emerging: thus the word of God, the splendor of the Father, entered the virgin chamber and then came forth from the closed womb." ...|$|E
500|$|Light was {{associated}} with Mary and the Incarnation from the 9th century.

From that point onwards the music of Delius became increasingly familiar to both British and European audiences, as performances of his works proliferated.

2500|$|In October 1852 editor Charles Frederick Briggs sent a {{circular}} out to writers, including Melville, announcing the plan [...] "to publish an Original periodical {{of a character}} different from any now in existence", inviting him, being among [...] "the best talent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country", to submit contributions to the new monthly that would only print American contributions.

2500|$|Today, unfortunately, most connoisseurs {{making the}} {{pilgrimage to the}} Cerasi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo would ignore Carracci’s Assumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin altarpiece (1600–1601) {{and focus on the}} {{stunning}} flanking Caravaggio works. It is instructive to compare Carracci's Assumption with Caravaggio's Death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin. Among early contemporaries, Carracci would have been an innovator. He re-enlivened Michelangelo's visual fresco vocabulary, and posited a muscular and vivaciously brilliant pictorial landscape, which had been becoming progressively crippled into a Mannerist tangle. While Michelangelo could bend and contort the body into all the possible perspectives, Carracci in the Farnese frescoes had shown how it could dance. The [...] "ceiling"-frontiers, <b>the</b> wide expanses <b>of</b> walls to be frescoed would, for the next decades, be thronged by <b>the</b> monumental <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carracci followers, and not Caravaggio's followers.|$|R
500|$|Closely {{detailed}} {{beams of}} light spill {{through the high}} windows and illuminate the interior, filling the portal and flowing across the tiled floors before it hits the clerestory windows. <b>The</b> <b>brilliance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daylight is juxtaposed with the gentle glow of the candles in the choir screen altar, while the lower portion of the pictorial space is relatively poorly lit. Shadows cast by the cathedral can be seen across the choir steps and near aisle. Their angle is rendered in an unusually realistic manner for early 15th century, and the detail is such that their description is likely based on observation of the actual behaviour of light, a further innovation in 15th-century art. Yet while the light is portrayed as it might appear in nature, its source is not. Panofsky notes that the sunlight enters from the north windows, but contemporary churches normally had east-facing choirs, so the light should enter from the south. He suggests the light {{is not intended to}} be natural, but rather to represent the divine, and hence subject to [...] "the laws of symbolism and not those of nature." ...|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary.

40|$|For a {{fundamental}} understanding of ultra fast dynamics in chemistry, biology and materials science {{it has been}} a longstanding dream to record a molecular movie, where both the atomic trajectories and <b>the</b> chemical state <b>of</b> every atom in matter is followed in real time.
