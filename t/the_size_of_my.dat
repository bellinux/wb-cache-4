The implicit social nature <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tea sets stands in juxtaposition to the process of handcrafting these teapots and cups; an activity that is an intensely solitary and introspective endeavor. Though functional in every way, <b>the</b> very small <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pieces denies practical usage and so reflects their truer ideal. Yet, the basic functionality of the teapots and cups allows for the imagined potential of a shared social interaction. However, the focus is instead an investigation <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own personal thoughts, ideas and half-formed imaginings (that often pertain to relationships and social involvement) at the time of creation. The gestation of a piece from pure plastic possibility to concrete and finished object is satisfying both as a tactile experience and as a focus for meditative thought. I start with a basic shape or two in mind, but as the piece comes together I make changes and take steps that feel intuitive and as my mental state urges—anything from joy to frustration or sadness. The construction of a piece takes fastidious care to preserve form and structural integrity, but I keep my joins loose and the end result of a shape is highly negotiable and dependent on an ongoing conversation not only between myself, my thoughts and the material, but between the components of the piece itself as they take shape. This clumsy meticulousness and the actual experience of play and discovery alters my initial form into a final object—intriguing, whimsical and possessive of a sense of personality obliquely suggestive <b>of</b> <b>my</b> internal thoughts.

Various ammonia- oxidizing archaea (AOA) are considered to be members of the pool of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in soil. This study reports the discovery of a chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizer that belongs to a distinct clade of nonmarine thaumarchaeal group I. 1 a, which is widespread in terrestrial environments. The archaeal strain MY 2 was cultivated from a deep oligotrophic soil horizon. The similarity of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence <b>of</b> strain <b>MY</b> 2 to those of other cultivated group I. 1 a thaumarchaeota members, i. e., Nitrosopumilus maritimus and "Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum koreensis," is 92. 9 % for both species. Extensive growth assays showed that strain MY 2 is chemolithoautotrophic, mesophilic (optimum temperature, 30 degrees C), and neutrophilic (optimum pH, 7 to 7. 5). The accumulation of nitrite above 1 mM inhibited ammonia oxidation, while ammonia oxidation itself was not inhibited in the presence of up to 5 mM ammonia. <b>The</b> genome <b>size</b> <b>of</b> strain <b>MY</b> 2 was 1. 76 Mb, similar to those of N. maritimus and "Ca.

A high level of representation of conserved orthologous genes for signal transduction and motility in the noncore genome might be implicated in niche adaptation by strain MY 2. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic, and genomic characteristics, we propose the name "Candidatus Nitrosotenuis chungbukensis" for the ammonia-oxidizing archaeal strain MY 2...|$|R

Larvae of this species live in riffle areas of open-country streams. Before this aim could be achieved, {{it was necessary to}} define the identity of the study animal and its relationships with other New Zealand Simuliidae, and gain an understanding of its life history. Wainui Valley Stream (43 º 49 'S, 172 º 54 ’E), Banks Peninsula was chosen as the study area to undertake these investigations on population changes (p. 165). A. tillyardianum was the only simuliid present in the stream, larvae were readily available throughout the year, and also there were few other species present thus reducing the amount of possible interspecific interactions. The stream was sufficiently small in size to simplify sampling procedures. Counteracting these favourable aspects were the unfavourable factors of the Wainui Valley being a popular holiday area, and the presence of a Y. M. C. A. camp site by the stream. Because of these two factors, it was considered inadvisable to leave equipment at the stream to monitor continuously stream temperature and water level which were thought to influence population <b>size.</b> <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>my</b> investigations are contained in the series of papers which follow.

40|$|P 2 X 4 receptors (P 2 X 4 R) are ligand-gated ion {{channels}} {{activated by}} ATP {{and with a}} high permeability to Ca 2 +. They are predominantly localised to lysosomes and from there can traffic to the cell surface. ATP levels within the lysosome are high but P 2 X 4 Rs are inhibited by the acidic pH. Previously, it was shown that the alkalinisation of lysosomes using pharmacological reagents was sufficient to activate P 2 X 4 Rs, which promoted homotypic lysosome fusion. The main {{aim of this study}} was to identify physiological regulators of lysosomal P 2 X 4 Rs and to examine their role in lysosome Ca 2 + signalling and fusion. The first candidate I investigated was P 2 X 7 R, which is typically co-expressed with P 2 X 4 R in immune and epithelial cells, and which has already been shown to induce changes in lysosome properties upon activation. I co-expressed these two receptors in normal rat kidney (NRK) cells and in HeLa cells and looked for a synergistic interaction between them in promoting lysosome fusion, as assessed by measuring <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> lysosomes. <b>My</b> results showed a significant increase in lysosome <b>size</b> following activation <b>of</b> P 2 X 7 R but only in the presence of P 2 X 4 R. Neither receptor alone was sufficient to promote lysosome fusion in response to the agonist BzATP. LAMP-GECO was used to measure changes in cytosolic [Ca 2 +] within the vicinity of the lysosome. Fusion of the Ca 2 + reporter (GECO) to the C-terminus of LAMP- 1 targets GECO to the cytosolic surface of the lysosome. Co-expression of P 2 X 4 R with P 2 X 7 R augmented the P 2 X 7 R-induced Ca 2 + signal suggesting that P 2 X 4 Rs mediate lysosomal Ca 2 + efflux downstream of P 2 X 7 R stimulation. Next, I showed that the expression of P 2 X 4 R was sufficient to enhance the cytosolic Ca 2 + response to the activation of endogenous histamine H 1 receptors and to promote lysosome fusion. Similar results were obtained with P 2 Y 2 R stimulation, which also couples to the phospholipase C pathway. Further experiments were conducted to look at differences in the trafficking behaviour of human and rat P 2 X 4 Rs and to examine a role for P 2 X 4 Rs in autophagic flux. My results suggest a synergistic interaction between P 2 X 4 R and P 2 X 7 R which inhibits autophagic flux, similar to the effect of bafilomycin treatment. Therefore, the effect of P 2 X 4 / 7 R in autophagy may be mediated by the alkalinisation of lysosomes. Altogether the results <b>of</b> <b>my</b> project improve our understanding of how the P 2 X 4 R Ca 2 + channel regulates lysosome function. Yousef Jameel Scholarship and Cambridge Trus...|$|R

I am interested in the seemingly endless problems that the human body can solve as well as working towards understanding its limitations both physically and mentally. The intersection of contrary ideas and the forcing of harmony between them fuels my creative process. The idea of opposites becoming one entity both formally and conceptually is rich for me, as I want to explore those points of friction and resolution. My current work involves a process of arriving at a general concept about the body that peaks my curiosity and then working intuitively with the paint to explore this idea. As I create, I am continuously learning more about the specific scientific process that I choose to inspire each piece. I am also learning more about using color, composition and scale to connect with the viewer.

6000|$|Presently the automobile, after {{speeding}} up the asphalt of Grant Avenue, stopped before the new house. In spite of the change that house had made in my life, in three weeks I had become amazingly used to it; yet I had an odd feeling that Christmas eve as I stood under the portico with my key in the door, the same feeling of the impersonality of the place which I had experienced before. Not that for one moment I would have exchanged it for the smaller house we had left. I opened the door. How often, in that other house, I had come in the evening seeking quiet, my brain occupied with a problem, only to be annoyed by the romping of the children on the landing above. A noise in one end of it echoed to the other. But here, as I entered the hall, all was quiet: a dignified, deep-carpeted stairway swept upward before me, and on either side were wide, empty rooms; and in the subdued light {{of one of them}} I saw a dark figure moving silently about--the butler. He came forward to relieve me, deftly, of my hat and overcoat. Well, I had it at last, this establishment to which I had for so long looked forward. And yet that evening, as I hesitated in the hall, I somehow was unable to grasp that it was real and permanent, the very solidity of the walls and doors paradoxically suggested transientness, the butler a flitting ghost. How still the place was! Almost oppressively still. I recalled oddly a story of a peasant who, yearning for the great life, had stumbled upon an empty palace, its tables set with food in golden dishes. Before two days had passed he had fled from it in horror back to his crowded cottage and his drudgery in the fields. Never once had the sense of possession of the palace been realized. Nor did I feel that I possessed this house, though I had the deeds of it in my safe and the receipted bills in my files. It eluded me; seemed, in my bizarre mood of that evening, almost to mock me. [...] "You have built me," [...] it seemed to say, [...] "but I am stronger than you, because you have not earned me." [...] Ridiculous, when the years of my labour and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bank account were considered! Such, however, is the verbal expression of my feeling.

An innovative nanopore based microfluidic device for SELEX {{has been developed}} for single-stranded DNA generation and <b>sizing.</b> <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> <b>my</b> research is to design, fabricate, test and model this device and make this device applicable for SELEX. The nanopores of the membrane controls fluidic transport between different planes in the device. It adds more functionality and flexibility to the microfluidic device. This device consists of two polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channels separated by a polycarbonate membrane. Channels were designed in a CAD software and a master was fabricated using rapid prototyping of PDMS. Multiple PDMS replicas were then cast from this master. The membrane was sandwiched between two channels. Oxygen plasma treatment was applied to bond two PDMS layers and glass substrates were used to support the whole device. Recovery of fluorescein across the membrane was compared with 10 and 80 nucleotide (nt) single stranded DNA(ssDNA) to characterize the device. Recovery of analytes improved with decreasing flow rate. Size selectivity was observed. Two mathematical models which were built based on conservation of mass and constitutive relationships described the process of DNA transportation in the microfluidic device. Trends in recovery measured at various flow rates {{were consistent with the}} trends predicted in the two models which support the premise that diffusion dominated the molecular transport in this device. In addition to that, Model 2 demonstrated recovery was affected by the ionic strength of the buffer as well. One application of this device was to automate the process to make double stranded DNA(dsDNA) single stranded which can be integrated into an automatic SELEX system. Streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads were immobilized with dual-biotin labeled dsDNA and alkaline treatment was adopted to denature dsDNA and release the non-biotinylated ssDNA. 25 mM sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was optimized to achieve the best purity. 95. 7 % of the strands collected across the membrane were the non-biotinylated ssDNA. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) results confirmed that the non-biotinylated ssDNA was the major component across the membrane...|$|R
40|$|Beloved Microcosm- Logan Weihe 2017 My work is non-objective and abstracted, as it {{references}} {{the human}} form and also invents new forms, combining the matured physicality {{of the human body}} and our beginnings (smaller pieces i. e. cells, atoms). I am interested in the seemingly endless problems that the human body can solve, as well as working towards understanding its limitations both physically and mentally. The intersection of contrary ideas and the forcing of harmony between them fuels my creative process. The idea of opposites becoming one entity both formally and conceptually is rich for me, as I want to explore those points of friction and resolution. My current work involves a process of arriving at a general concept about the body that peaks my curiosity, and then working intuitively with the paint to explore this idea. As I create, I am continuously learning more about the specific scientific process that I choose to inspire each piece. The paintings I produce are spontaneous interpretations of cellular bodily processes, including the illusion of movement as well as the manipulation of composition and color to create energetic worlds. I make oil paintings that speak about microscopic processes visualized through advancing scientific technologies so as to juxtapose the contemporary use of visual technology with a very traditional way of creating. Additionally, I am infatuated with the elements that our bodies are made up of, and employing the gesture <b>of</b> painting, using <b>my</b> physicality to create the image is exciting for me. Jenny Saville’s grotesque depiction of {{the human form}} and the visceral quality of her work coincides with my interest in undesirable reality and experimenting with <b>the</b> <b>size</b> and weight <b>of</b> <b>my</b> marks. Lee Bontecou’s work inspires mine in the way she creates cellular like organic forms, often dealing with space that becomes a sort of vacuum. Arshile Gorky fragments the figure in abstract ways in order to tell stories of his past, and from his paintings I seek to better understand emotive color as well as how to use the figure non-objectively. From the sheer number of processes that occur within us each second to the fleshy quality <b>of</b> our bodies, <b>my</b> attraction to the human form comes from my search for the power or force that created our bodies in all of their complexity, whether it be God, chemistry, chance, or something that is not meant to be explained. I strive for my audience to be fascinated with themselves and to see their own body as something remarkable, in its intricacy and flawless execution of thousands of processes. [URL]...|$|R
