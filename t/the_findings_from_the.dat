5|$|Sir R.E.M.Wheeler, the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, in the 1940s {{saw a few}} {{potsherds}} of Arikamedu site {{displayed in}} the Madras Museum, which he identified as Arrentine ware, an expensive ceramic made until 50 CE in Arizzo, Italy. Thereafter, when he visited the Pondicherry Museum and saw more of <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Arikamedu site, he was impressed and {{thought that he had}} found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the penultimate year of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that could establish its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest led him to the Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were trained on the site.|$|E

25|$|The main {{achievement}} of the Tevatron was the discovery in 1995 of the top quark—the last fundamental fermion predicted by the standard model of particle physics.

25|$|Effective {{blinding}} can {{be difficult}} to achieve where the treatment is notably effective (indeed, studies have been suspended in cases where the tested drug combinations were so effective that it was deemed unethical to continue withholding <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> control group, and the general population), or where the treatment is very distinctive in taste or has unusual side-effects that allow the researcher and/or the subject to guess which group they were assigned to. It is also difficult to use the double blind method to compare surgical and non-surgical interventions (although sham surgery, involving a simple incision, might be ethically permitted). A good clinical protocol will foresee these potential problems to ensure blinding is as effective as possible. It has also been argued that even in a double-blind experiment, general attitudes of the experimenter such as skepticism or enthusiasm towards the tested procedure can be subconsciously transferred to the test subjects.|$|E
500|$|When British {{scientists}} in Antarctica performed airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys {{in the early}} 1970s, they detected unusual radar readings at the site which suggested {{the presence of a}} liquid freshwater lake below the ice. In 1991, Jeff Ridley, a remote sensing specialist with the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, directed the ERS-1 satellite to turn its high-frequency array {{toward the center of the}} Antarctic ice cap. The data from ERS-1 confirmed <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1973 British surveys, but these new data were not published in the Journal of Glaciology until 1993. Space-based radar revealed that this subglacial body of fresh water is one of the largest lakes in the world, and one of some 140 subglacial lakes in Antarctica. Russian and British scientists delineated the lake in 1996 by integrating a variety of data, including airborne ice-penetrating radar imaging observations and space-based radar altimetry. It has been confirmed that the lake contains large amounts of liquid water under the more than [...] ice cap. The lake has at least 22 cavities of liquid water, averaging [...] each.|$|E

2500|$|Integration {{of these}} latest data with <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Human Genome Project suggest that human foragers in subsaharan Africa {{developed}} modern cognition and behaviour {{by at least}} 50,000 BP, before the estimated timing of adaptive radiation out of Africa during the last glacial period. The development of behavioural modernity and sophisticated hunting and foraging methods in subsaharan Africa is thought to date from at least 50,000 years ago. This {{may have been due}} to an earlier climatic change to much drier and colder conditions during the last ice age, between 135,000 and 75,000 years ago. [...] This was what led to human groups who were seeking refuge from the inland droughts, expanded along the coastal marshes rich in shellfish and other resources. Since sea levels were low due to so much water tied up in glaciers, such marshlands would have occurred all along the southern coasts of Eurasia. The use of rafts and boats may well have facilitated exploration of offshore islands and travel along the coast, and eventually permitted expansion to New Guinea and then to Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The company's owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, {{who survived}} the fire by fleeing to the building's roof when the fire began, were indicted on charges of first- and second-degree {{manslaughter}} in mid-April; the pair's trial began on December 4, 1911. Max Steuer, counsel for the defendants, managed to destroy the credibility {{of one of the}} survivors, Kate Alterman, by asking her to repeat her testimony a number of times, which she did without altering key phrases. Steuer argued to the jury that Alterman and possibly other witnesses had memorized their statements, and might even have been told what to say by the prosecutors. The prosecution charged that the owners knew the exit doors were locked at the time in question. The investigation found that the locks were intended to be locked during working hours based on <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fire, but the defense stressed that the prosecution failed to prove that the owners knew that. The jury acquitted the two men of first- and second-degree manslaughter, but they were found liable of wrongful death during a subsequent civil suit in 1913 in which plaintiffs were awarded compensation in the amount of $75 per deceased victim. The insurance company paid Blanck and Harris about $60,000 more than the reported losses, or about $400 per casualty.|$|E
