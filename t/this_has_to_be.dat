5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Control has {{a meaning}} of {{mitigation}} {{by reducing the}} numbers of introduced species down to ecologically and economically less harmful level. Since it is not complete wiping out strategy, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken constantly and repeatedly. This strategy {{is said to be}} feasible but less cost effective due to its incompleteness.|$|E
25|$|The AMA Foundation {{provides}} approximately $1,000,000 {{annually in}} tuition assistance to financially needy students. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{seen on the}} background that in 2007, graduating medical students carried a mean debt load of $140,000 which rose to $220,000 {{after four years of}} negative amortization during residency medical student debt has increased by 7% each successive year. By the time debt is paid off, it is sometimes almost half a million dollars.|$|E

25|$|The {{role of the}} N-terminus is {{revealed}} by using a deletion mutation of the N-terminal plug; the protein {{was still able to}} be inserted into the membrane, but acts as a non-selective pore for larger molecules, exhibited by increased permeability of the cell to maltotetraose, maltopentaose, ferrichrome, as well as several antibiotics including albomycin, vancomycin and bacitracin. However, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated with caution, as the conformation of the barrel may change {{in the absence of the}} N-terminal plug.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} this building, which {{lies on the}} {{southern}} slope of the seventh hill of Constantinople and overlooks the Sea of Marmara, is not certain. The tradition says that in year 325 Helena, the mother of Constantine I, coming back from Jerusalem with the True Cross and entering the City through the Port tou Psomatheou, left in this place some vases ("Gastria") containing aromatic herbs collected on Calvary. Then she founded there a nunnery. In reality, no monastery was established in Constantinople before {{the last quarter of}} the fourth century, so <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered only a legend.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the order}} Diptera have a {{holometabolous}} lifecycle, meaning they go through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa and imago, or adult. C. cadaverina typically has around 17 generations of offspring per year with 25 to 50 eggs per generation if the right conditions are present. Temperature can have an extreme impact on development. If the temperature gets above or below a certain temperature it can cause all development of the fly to stop. In general, the warmer it is, the faster the lifecycle will go; while if it is colder, the lifecycle may take longer than usual. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken into account when estimating the postmortem interval.|$|E
50|$|Construction tender {{had been}} awarded in June 2011 but due <b>to</b> {{unforeseen}} circumstances, <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> delayed <b>to</b> October 2011 due to sewerage works. Road realignment started on 28 January 2012.|$|R
50|$|However, {{even this}} version is not {{definitive}} - {{the original version}} of the film that Chan handed over <b>to</b> Golden Harvest <b>was</b> reportedly three hours in length. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-edited, so over 70 minutes of footage was cut during the first edit.|$|R
50|$|Distribution of {{the film}} beyond West Germany was delayed. This was because, at the time, the wartime German legal {{decision}} that outlawed the White Rose group effectively banned foreign distribution {{of the film}}, and <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rescinded {{before it could be}} released.|$|R
25|$|The Transrapid is an {{electrically}} driven, clean, high-speed, high-capacity {{means of}} transport able to build up point-to-point passenger connections in geographically challenged surroundings. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> set {{in comparison with the}} impact on heritage and or landscape protection areas (compare Waldschlösschen Bridge). Any impact of emissions has {{to take into account the}} source of electrical energy. The reduced expense, noise and vibration of a people-only Transrapid system versus a cargo train track is not directly comparable. The reuse of existing tracks and the interfacing with existing networks is limited. The Transrapid indirectly competes for resources, space and tracks in urban and city surroundings with classical urban transport systems and high speed trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} risk to {{participants}} in an fMRI study is claustrophobia {{and there are}} reported risks for pregnant women {{to go through the}} scanning process. Scanning sessions also subject participants to loud high-pitched noises from Lorentz forces induced in the gradient coils by the rapidly switching current in the powerful static field. The gradient switching can also induce currents in the body causing nerve tingling. Implanted medical devices such as pacemakers could malfunction because of these currents. The radio-frequency field of the excitation coil may heat up the body, and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> monitored more carefully in those running a fever, the diabetic, and those with circulatory problems. Local burning from metal necklaces and other jewellery is also a risk.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the history}} {{published}} by Omala Caldron on its website, the Daughters of Mokanna formed in 1919, in Rock Island, Illinois. This coincides with the secession of Amoo from Chicago and the founding of their own Supreme Caldron. They go one to describe how the ritual was decided upon and list the first four Daughters of Mokanna Caldrons – Amoo No. 1, Mohassan No. 2, Ankara, No. 3, and Zal No. 4. This would lead one to believe that Hapac was No. 5 as listed in the newspaper accounts. However, no account is given {{as to what happened}} to Koom Caldron No. 3, except that it shows up as participating in the Daughters of Mokanna national Convention in 1922. What remains unclear is when the Illinois group officially dropped the Witches and became Daughters; <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> somewhere between 1920 and 1922.|$|E
50|$|After {{a decade-long}} interval, Tokyo was {{included}} in the World Sevens Series again from 2012 to 2015. A preparatory international sevens tournament had been planned for Tokyo in 2011 but <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cancelled due <b>to</b> the earthquake and tsunami aftermath that year.|$|R

50|$|At about 13.00 the {{isolated}} battalions in the German lines began to crumble, and by 16.00 they only held the German front line trench. By nightfall, {{all of the}} 56th Division's gains <b>had</b> <b>been</b> reduced <b>to</b> a single stretch of trench, and <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abandoned after dark.|$|R
500|$|That {{is one of}} {{my biggest}} records ever, hype-wise, the music itself, I love it to the core. I don’t do songs {{thinking}} <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a hit. I do music based on how I feel from my heart and that is typically New Guy. New Guy is like a heart fulfilling type of record and to me, I think it actually hit the major impact that I wanted it to hit and people are loving it [...] My fans love it.|$|E
500|$|School {{officials}} again {{asked students}} about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was more fun than sitting in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I think <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the most important thing that}} has ever happened around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up. Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, Kapadia {{starred in}} Mahesh Bhatt's drama Kaash. Kapadia and Jackie Shroff starred as an estranged couple who, during a {{relentless}} legal {{battle over the}} custody of their only son, learn that the boy is suffering from leukaemia, which makes them reunite to spend together {{the last months of}} his life. Before shooting began, she called it [...] "the most serious artistic challenge I have ever faced in my career." [...] Bhatt said he decided to cast her in the role because he was aware of her own marital experience, and he noted that during the making of the film she [...] "came {{closer and closer to the}} naked truth," [...] so much that [...] "after a certain point, mentally I couldn't differentiate between Dimple and Pooja. She became the character." [...] Kapadia's performance as Pooja was highly praised by critics. In an article discussing her career's best roles, The Times of India wrote, [...] "As... long-suffering wife who tries making a living for herself and her young son by working odd jobs, Dimple showed immense strength as a performer. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of her best and most unrecognised performances." [...] Sukanya Verma from Rediff.com noted, [...] "She rendered her Pooja with stoic determination and touching vulnerability making her character extremely believable and sympathetic at once." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics. A writer from Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Teso Dos Bichos" [...] a C, and sardonically wrote, [...] "No es bueno!" [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C− and criticized the laziness of the writing, saying, [...] "Maybe I'm missing something here. There {{could be some}} subtext in, um, yeah, I got nothing. The dead rats in the toilet were freaky, right? And they did kill that dog off, so that's hardcore. Really, though, I'm just too disappointed to say much else. This is paint-by-numbers at its most tedious, and while it's nice to have evident proof of how far the show has come since it started, that doesn't {{make it any easier}} to sit through." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a scathing review, only awarding it 1/10. He criticized the seriousness of the plot and wrote, [...] "Overall, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the worst episodes of the series. In nearly every possible way, the episode fails {{to live up to the}} usual expectations. Perhaps aware of how silly the whole thing sounds, the cast and crew seem weary of it all from beginning to end. Even some of the bad ideas in the later seasons don’t fall to this level of inadequacy." [...] Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called the Jaguar Spirit one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters" [...] and wrote, [...] "In this fairly ridiculous Season 3 episode, an Ecuadorian artifact possessed by a Jaguar Spirit (or something) causes tabbies to go bonkers and murder people. This scene of Scully fighting a cat deserves the GIF treatment. Make it happen, folks!" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one stars out of five, calling the premise [...] "achingly unambitious". The two roundly criticized the plot, calling it a [...] "retread of a cursed mummy movie without a mummy", as well as the performances of Trevino, Duchovny, and Anderson. Despite the overall negativity, Shearman and Pearson noted that the [...] "much derided" [...] cat sequence was not [...] "that badly handled." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although it {{has often}} been stated that the poor {{performance}} of the Allison engine above [...] was a surprise and disappointment to the RAF and USAAF, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regarded as a myth; aviation engineers of the time were fully capable of correctly assessing the performance of an aircraft's engine and supercharger. As evidence of this, in mid-1941, the 93rd and 102nd airframes from the NA-91 order were slated to be set aside and fitted and tested with Packard Merlin engines, with each receiving the designation XP-51B.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Russian Arktika 2007 expedition, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister, Peter MacKay, said [...] "his is posturing.

[...] In response, Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated [...] "hen pioneers reach a point hitherto unexplored by anybody, it is customary to leave flags there. Such was the case on the Moon, by the way... e from the outset said that this expedition was part of the big work being carried out under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, within the international authority where Russia's claim to submerged ridges which we believe to be an extension of our shelf is being considered.
