50|$|There is {{risk with}} <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> because {{excessive}} use of the front brake {{can result in a}} loss of grip as the tire's adhesion is split between braking and cornering forces. Effective <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> requires finesse from the rider, which can be difficult to learn.|$|R

5000|$|Guides {{such as the}} Motorcycle Safety Foundation Basic RiderCourse {{teach that}} the safest way for a {{beginning}} rider to approach a corner on a motorcycle is by performing all of the slowing before {{the entrance of the}} turn, discouraging the use of any brakes while the motorcycle is leaned over. [...] The argument against <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> on the street, at least for beginners, is that the steep learning curve of <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> makes it appropriate only for the race track. The benefit of learning <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> to the street rider is that knowing and understanding how to slow while entering a corner gives a greater safety margin, particularly in blind, decreasing radius or downhill corners.|$|R
50|$|Freddie Spencer, {{founder of}} the now defunct Freddie Spencer's High Performance Riding School, as well as Nick Ienatsch, author of the 2003 book Sport Riding Techniques and chief {{instructor}} of Yamaha Champions Riding School, both argue that <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> {{should be used in}} nearly every corner as a means to help the motorcycle change direction, stating that <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> gives the rider more control and significantly increases rider safety.|$|R
50|$|In {{a broader}} scope, <b>trailing</b> off the <b>braking</b> {{pressure}} either while straight line braking or, as above, after turn in has begun, {{allows for a}} less abrupt and more accurate final corner entry speed adjustment. Some corner entries, such as decreasing radius turns, are more adapted to the leaned over <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> technique. In turns where a quicker steering action is more applicable, <b>trailing</b> the <b>brake</b> while turning in is unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trail</b> <b>braking</b> is a {{motorcycle}} riding and driving technique where the brakes are used beyond {{the entrance to}} a turn and are gradually released up to the point of apex.|$|R
50|$|Once {{a driver}} has {{mastered}} <b>trail</b> <b>braking,</b> {{it can help}} enter the corners at higher speeds, or avoid an accident if the driver has entered a corner at a speed exceeding the vehicle's (or driver's) capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> is done {{exclusively}} {{with the front}} <b>brake</b> even though <b>trailing</b> the rear <b>brake</b> will effectively slow the motorcycle, also decreasing the turning radius. If the motorcycle is leaned over, forces from the front brake and the deceleration causes the motorcycle to yaw (lean), while use of the rear brake generates a torque that tends to align (straighten) and stabilize the motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|While {{excessive}} brake dive is disconcerting, and {{bottoming out}} can cause loss of traction, {{a certain amount}} of brake dive reduces the rake and trail of the motorcycle, allowing it to more easily turn. This is especially important to racers <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> on entrance to corners.|$|R

50|$|The {{undercarriage}} {{legs were}} made of heavier-gauge metals and the wheels were fitted with the twin <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> of FB Mk VIs.|$|R
50|$|A Vacuum Servo {{also known}} as a power booster or power <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> uses a vacuum to {{multiply}} the drivers pedal effort and apply that effort to the master cylinder.|$|R
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as <b>trail</b> <b>braking.</b>|$|R
50|$|In four wheel {{vehicles}} <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> {{pertains to}} using the brakes past the corner entrance (as opposed to the normally taught practice of releasing the brakes before starting the turn). This practice is used for creating weight transfer towards the front tires, thus increasing their traction and reducing understeer. It works best in light vehicles that have their brake bias to the front.|$|R
2500|$|Braking: Standard finned {{aluminum}} {{drum brakes}} were again offered and were effective. The Bendix 4 piston disk <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> were available. 12" [...] x 1" [...] vented steel rotors were {{coupled with the}} cast iron caliper assemblies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{improved}} design {{incorporated a}} Continental V-12 [...] air-cooled, AVDS-1790-2 diesel engine, extending operational range to over 300 mi while reducing both refueling and servicing.

5000|$|The end of train device (ETD), {{sometimes}} referred to as an EOT, flashing rear-end device (FRED) or sense and <b>braking</b> <b>unit</b> (SBU) is an electronic device mounted on the end of freight trains in lieu of a caboose. They are divided into three categories: [...] "dumb" [...] units, which only provide a visible indication of the rear of the train with a flashing red taillight; [...] "average intelligence" [...] <b>units</b> with a <b>brake</b> pipe pressure gauge; and [...] "smart" [...] units, which send back data to the crew in the locomotive via radio-based telemetry. They originated in North America, and are also used elsewhere in the world, where they may include complete End of Train Air System (ETAS) or Sense and <b>Brake</b> <b>Unit</b> (SBU) devices.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 {{extensive}} refurbishment {{was carried}} out, involving {{replacement of the}} motor, of the hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>unit,</b> of the electronics safety systems, of the control room and of the two cars of the funicular. The railway now runs daily services, with a capacity of about 400 persons per hour.|$|R
50|$|The impact landers are {{equipped}} with flexible solar panels, located on the upper side of the inflatable <b>braking</b> <b>unit,</b> that will provide approximately 0.6 W during the day. As the provided power output is insufficient to operate all instruments simultaneously, they are activated sequentially according to the different environmental constraints.|$|R
5000|$|As {{compared}} to the traditional circular entry, <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> reduces {{the time for the}} requisite direction change needed to reach the driver's chosen apex. [...] With the traditional corner entry where all deceleration is completed prior to steering input, the vehicle carries a constant speed and radius to the apex. The combined peak tire forces act on the car perpendicular to its direction of travel to accelerate it toward its current turn center. The vehicle takes a circular path to the apex at a constant speed.|$|R
5000|$|A drift-inducing {{technique}} called [...] "the brake drift" [...] {{is used in}} racing, involving a series of light rear brake trail-braking pulses (usually 2 or 3), followed by a momentary full-force rear braking and sharp releasing of the rear <b>brakes.</b> Mastering continuous <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> as used under road conditions {{is a prerequisite for}} learning brake drifting. This {{is one of the most}} used drifting techniques in rally racing because - if done properly - allows the driver to enter and exit the corner with full throttle.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that collision mitigation on low grip surfaces might require autonomous vehicles to execute maneuvers such as drift, <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> or Scandinavian flick. In order to achieve this {{it is necessary to}} perceive the vehicle states and their interaction with the environment, and use this information to determine the chassis limits. A first look at the virtual automotive sensing problem is provided, followed by a description of Rally driving modeling approaches. Finally, a co-pilot collision mitigation system for loose surfaces based on a Rally driver Model is proposed...|$|R
50|$|In comparison, <b>trail</b> <b>braking</b> splits up {{the peak}} force the tire {{is able to}} {{generate}} partially toward braking (longitudinal force acting on a tangent to the direction of travel,) and partially toward steering (lateral force acting perpendicular to direction of travel.) See the traction circle for more info. The combined vector force acting on the vehicle's center of gravity accelerates it in a more rearward direction {{as shown in the}} illustration. This causes the vehicle to travel on a Euler spiral shaped path of constant radius and speed reduction.|$|R
50|$|Simulation style racing games {{strive to}} convincingly {{replicate}} {{the handling of}} an automobile. They often license real cars or racing leagues, but will sometimes use fantasy cars built to resemble real ones if unable to acquire an official license for them. Vehicular behavior physics are {{a key factor in}} the experience. The rigors of being a professional race driver are usually also included (such as having to deal with a car's tire condition and fuel level). Proper cornering technique and precision racing maneuvers (such as <b>trail</b> <b>braking)</b> are given priority in the simulation racing games.|$|R
50|$|The {{market was}} largely pioneered by Sturmey-Archer with their Dynohub of the 1930s - 1970s. This competed {{effectively}} with contemporaneous bottle dynamos and bottom-bracket generators, but the Dynohub was heavy with its steel housing and was discontinued in the 1980s. Around 2009, Sturmey-Archer released new hub dynamo/drum <b>brake</b> <b>units</b> with an aluminum housing, designated X-FDD and XL-FDD.|$|R

5000|$|Braking {{choppers}} {{some times}} {{also referred to}} as <b>braking</b> <b>unit</b> are used in the DC voltage intermediate circuits of frequency converters to control voltage when the load feeds energy back to the intermediate circuit.

50|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>unit</b> {{ensures that}} the travel speed of the pig is much slower than the fluid velocity, thus {{allowing}} it to entirely remove deposits from the pipe wall before it travels across the cleaned surface. The deposits removed are immediately flushed down the pipeline with the main jet of the cleaning head which is directed {{to the middle of}} the pipeline. With all deposits removed from the pipe wall and transported downstream by the fluid flow there remains no risk of the pig getting stuck in debris accumulated in front of it.|$|R
