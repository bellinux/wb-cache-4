5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. <b>They</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Mayfly nymphs {{may serve}} as hosts for parasites such as {{nematodes}} and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs' behaviour {{in such a way}} that <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> likely to be predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushrooms}} of Russula brevipes often develop under {{masses of}} conifer needles or leaves of broadleaved trees, and fruit from summer to autumn. Forms of the mushroom that develop a bluish band {{at the top}} of the stipe are sometimes referred to as variety acrior. Although edible, Russula brevipes mushrooms have a bland or bitter flavor. <b>They</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> palatable once parasitized by the ascomycete fungus Hypomyces lactifluorum, a bright orange mold that covers the fruit body and transforms them into lobster mushrooms.|$|E

5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle {{at the same rate}} as before until their sixth month, after which <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.|$|E
5|$|OCD is a {{relatively}} rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Widuchowski W et al. found OCD to {{be the cause of}} articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies. Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1. However, OCD has become more common among adolescent females as <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> active in sports. The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.|$|E

If {{the process of}} social modernization that produces this disorder is not matched by a process of political and institutional modernization—a process which produces political institutions capable of managing the stress of modernization—the result may be violence.|$|E
25|$|As hillslopes steepen, however, <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> {{prone to}} episodic {{landslides}} and other mass wasting events. Therefore, hillslope processes are better {{described by a}} nonlinear diffusion equation in which classic diffusion dominates for shallow slopes and erosion rates go to infinity as the hillslope reaches a critical angle of repose.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} rarity {{and the length}} of time {{involved}} in their growth, heritage turkeys are also far more expensive than their more common brethren.

25|$|The {{basic rules}} system of Cyberpunk 2020 (called the Interlock System) is skill-based instead of level-based, with players being awarded points {{to be spent}} on their skill sets. New skills outside their {{expertise}} can be learned but in-game time needs {{to be spent on}} this. A large part of the system is the player characters' ability to augment themselves with cyber-technology and the ensuing loss of humanity as <b>they</b> <b>become</b> <b>more</b> machine than man.|$|E

Economist Jagdish Bhagwati suggested that programs to help developing countries adjust to the global economy would be beneficial for international economic relations.|$|E
