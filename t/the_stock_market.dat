Employing a cross-correlation function method, {{the results show that}} a unidirectional causality-in-mean exists from <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> of <b>the</b> US and Japan to <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>stock</b> <b>market.</b> Malaysian <b>stock</b> returns immediately react to the shocks received from <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> of <b>the</b> US and Japan and the reaction continues for 12 weeks.

30|$|This paper also {{focuses on}} {{different}} types of interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and government bond markets in the same region. First, the interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> bond markets in the same region {{is much more important}} than the interdependence across different regions (Baur and Lucey 2009). Second, the paper investigates the interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> bond markets in 39 countries. The samples already cover approximately 80 % of the global GDP, and therefore, it can be concluded that this paper’s analysis is reliable. The interdependence across different regions may result in an overly complicated analysis. In addition, over recent years the interdependence between <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> bond markets has become quite valuable because the debt crisis {{is one of the most}} important parts in the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis. The financial derivatives or the real estate markets are less liquid and important than government bond markets in most of the emerging markets. Thus, in this paper, our analysis emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and <b>the</b> government bond markets in 39 countries.|$|R

40|$|Technical trading {{rules have}} been used in {{financial}} markets in order to examine their ability to yield a superior return. In the early empirical literature, a body of studies showed that trading rules do not outperform a simple buy and hold strategy. However, more recent research finds evidence that supports technical trading rules. This study examines the profitability of trading rules in 14 Middle East and North African (MENA) markets. The trading rules that used are: moving average trading rules (MA), trading range breakout (TRB) trading rules, filter trading rules, channel trading rules, Bollinger band (BB) trading rules and moving average coverage divergence (MACD) trading rules. The markets used in this work include <b>the</b> Bahrain <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Jordan <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Kuwait <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Lebanon <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Maltese <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Morocco <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Oman <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Qatar <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Saudi Arabian <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Tunisia <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> Turkey <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> <b>the</b> United Arab Emirates <b>stock</b> <b>markets,</b> <b>the</b> Cyprus <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> and <b>the</b> Egypt <b>stock</b> <b>market.</b> Our results indicate that according to mean return criterion, the best simple moving average (SMA), exponential moving average (EMA), triangular moving average (TMA), trading range breakout (TRB), filter and moving average coverage divergence (MACD) trading rules are for Turkey market. Malta, Bahrain and Oman have the highest percentage of rules that generate positive mean return. In terms of the Sharpe ratio, the best trading rules according to TMA, SMA, filter and channel trading rules are for Turkey market. Furthermore, Turkey has the highest percentage of rules that have a positive Sharpe ratio followed by Cyprus and Egypt. Controlling for data snooping, the results show that the number of trading rules that generate positive return comparing with buy and hold strategy has been reduced but there are still a large number of profitable rules through some markets...|$|R

5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War.

Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, {{it is difficult to}} compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions.
