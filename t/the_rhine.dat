5|$|Moreau sent Desaix's wing to {{the west}} bank of <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> at Breisach and, with the main part of his army, offered battle at Schliengen. Saint-Cyr held the low ground on the left near <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> while Ferino defended the hills on the right. Charles hoped to turn the French right and trap Moreau's army against <b>the</b> <b>Rhine.</b> In the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October, the French {{suffered}} 1,200 casualties out of 32,000 engaged. The Austrians counted 800 casualties out of 36,000 men. The French held off the Austrian attacks but retreated the next day and recrossed {{to the west}} bank of <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> on 26 October.

5|$|On the continent, the {{extension}} of the Empire's borders beyond <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> hung in the balance for some time, with the emperor Caligula apparently poised to invade Germania in 39 AD, and Cnaeus Domitius Corbulo crossing <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> in 47 AD and marching into the territory of the Frisii and Chauci. Caligula's successor, Claudius, ordered the suspension of further attacks across <b>the</b> <b>Rhine,</b> setting what was to become the permanent limit of the Empire's expansion in this direction.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than simply}} quell the mutiny however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers {{and led them}} on a short {{campaign}} across <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus.

Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the Teutoburg forest and the reclaiming of Roman standards lost years before by Publius Quinctilius Varus, when three Roman legions and its auxiliary cohorts had been ambushed by Germanic tribes.|$|E

5|$|After {{conferring with}} Desaix and Saint-Cyr at Renchen, Moreau mounted his assault on 9 July 1796. This {{decision}} preempted Archduke Charles, who {{had planned to}} attack the French on the 10th. The French commander planned to pin the Austrians in <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> plain while turning their left flank among the mountains of the Black Forest. For his part, Charles hoped to outflank the French left near the river and recapture Gernsbach. Latour held the Austrian right near <b>the</b> <b>Rhine,</b> Sztáray was posted in the center near Malsch, Kaim defended the left-center in the hills along the Alb River and Lindt's Saxons held the far left near Neuenbürg.|$|E

5|$|Although the French and the Austrians claimed {{victory at}} the time, {{military}} historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> River at Hüningen. A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on <b>the</b> <b>Rhine,</b> when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E
5|$|An {{alliance}} between the Iazyges and the Dacians led the Romans {{to focus more on}} the Danube than <b>the</b> <b>Rhine.</b> This is reflected by the placement of the Roman legions; During the time of Augustus's rule, there were eight legions stationed along <b>the</b> <b>Rhine,</b> four stationed in Mainz and another four in Cologne. Within a hundred years of Augustus' rule, however, Roman military resources had become centred along the Danube instead of <b>the</b> <b>Rhine,</b> with nine legions stationed along the Danube and only one at <b>the</b> <b>Rhine.</b> However, by the time of Marcus Aurelius, twelve legions were stationed along the Danube. The Romans also built a series of forts along the entire right bank of the Danubefrom Germany {{all the way to the}} Black Seaand in the provinces of Rhaetia, Noricum, and Pannonia the legions constructed bridge-head forts. Later, this system was expanded to the lower Danube, with the key castra of Poetovio, Brigetio, and Carnuntum. The Classis Pannonica and Classis Flavia Moesica were deployed to the right and lower Danube, respectively; however, they had to overcome the mass of whirlpools and cataracts of the Iron Gates.|$|E

5|$|Basel had {{remained}} studiously neutral {{throughout the whole}} war. Although allied with some cantons of the Swiss Confederacy, it also had strong economic ties in the Alsace and further down along <b>the</b> <b>Rhine.</b> But {{the events of the}} war had strengthened the pro-confederate party in the city council, and the Swiss recognized the city's strategic position as a bridgehead on <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> (like Schaffhausen, too). On June 9, 1501, a delegation from Basel and the Swiss cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract, which the city council of Basel ratified on July 13, 1501.|$|E
5|$|By March 1945, the Allies had {{advanced}} into Germany and {{had reached the}} River Rhine. <b>The</b> <b>Rhine</b> was a formidable natural obstacle to the Allied advance, but if breached would allow the Allies to access the North German Plain and ultimately advance on Berlin and other major cities in Northern Germany. Following the 'Broad Front Approach' laid out by General Eisenhower, {{it was decided to}} attempt to breach <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> in several areas. British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the 21st Army Group, devised a plan to allow the forces under his command to breach <b>the</b> <b>Rhine,</b> which he entitled Operation Plunder, and which was subsequently authorized by Eisenhower. Plunder envisioned the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey and the U.S. Ninth Army under Lieutenant General William Simpson crossing <b>the</b> <b>Rhine</b> at Rees, Wesel, and an area south of the Lippe Canal. To ensure that the operation was a success, Montgomery insisted that an airborne component was inserted into the plans for the operation to support the amphibious assaults that would take place, which was code-named Operation Varsity. Three airborne divisions were initially chosen to take part in Varsity, these being the British 6th Airborne Division, the U.S. 13th Airborne Division and the 17th Airborne Division, all of which were assigned to the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps.|$|E
5|$|Charles advised {{his brother}} of the French Directory's offer, but it was flatly refused by the Emperor and the {{civilian}} military advisers on the Aulic Council. Charles was instructed to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible French access to southern Germany via <b>the</b> <b>Rhine.</b> The Aulic Council still believed Austrian forces could relieve Mantua. Consequently, by tying Charles down at <b>the</b> <b>Rhine,</b> besieging the highly defensible Vauban fortresses at the river at Kehl and Hüningen, the Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. After {{it became clear that}} Charles was locked into place on <b>the</b> <b>Rhine,</b> Moreau moved 14 demi-brigades to Italy, leaving behind modest forces on the French border. Two Austrian columns sent from Vienna failed to reach their beleaguered counterparts in Mantua, which fell on 2 February 1797.|$|E

50|$|Even in {{the time}} when the Celts found {{themselves}} having to avoid the Germanic invaders by moving to the west, the Romans were also pushing in from <b>the</b> <b>Rhine's</b> left bank to the southwest. However, the Romans only managed to seize a strip of land on <b>the</b> <b>Rhine's</b> right bank and the so-called Rhine-Westerwald; the Westerwald itself lay outside the Roman-occupied area, for the Romans preferred to maintain a little-settled, most likely pathless wilderness as their border.|$|R
