40|$|Abstract Turbochargers {{have become}} common in {{passenger}} cars {{as well as}} commercial vehicles. They have an excellent mechanism to effectively increase fuel efficiency and engine power, but they unfortunately cause several noise problems. Its noise are mainly classified as structure-borne noises, generated from the vibration of rotating shaft modules (cartridges), and air-borne noises, from air flow inside turbochargers or their coupling ducts. In this study an attempt to reduce the pulsation noise generated from the compressor wheels, whose frequency {{is the same as}} the whine noise is presented. This attempt is based on using the compact high frequency side branch resonators to develop low intake noise system. The design of such system, which is mainly based on the developed 1 D linear acoustic theory and theoretical investigations to use more than one resonator connected to the main duct in series and/or in parallel are introduced. An optimization strategy to choose the appropriate resonator axis offset is presented. In case of complex unsymmetrical geometry in real resonators, a 3 D finite element is used. The presented models are validated via comparison with the measured results at room temperatures. The validated models are used to improve the acoustic performance of the real resonators. Based on the developed models and the optimization results, the internal design of resonators improves its acoustic performance; the serial arrangements increase the damping at the same peak frequency while the parallel arrangements make it wider. The amount of extra damping added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> depends on the resonators geometry and their axis offset which can be around 50 dB a...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2010 SAE International In a {{gasoline}} engine, the cycle-by-cycle fresh trapped charge, and corresponding unswept residual gas fraction (RGF) are critical parameters {{of interest for}} maintaining the desired air-fuel ratio (AFR). Accurate fueling is a key precursor to improved engine fuel economy, and reduced engine out emissions. Asymmetric flow paths to cylinders in certain engines can cause differences in the gas exchange process, which in turn cause imbalances in trapped fresh charge and RGF. Variable cam timing (VCT) can make the gas exchange process even more complex. Due to the reasons stated above, simplified models can result in significant estimation errors for fresh trapped charge and RGF {{if they are not}} gas dynamics-based or detailed enough to handle features such as variable valve timing, duration, or lift. In this paper, a new air flow and RGF measurement tool is introduced. The tool is a combination of 1 -D gas dynamics modeling and imposed, measured dynamic pressure signals in the intake and exhaust manifolds. With this method, the components to be modeled in the gas exchange system are reduced to a minimum, making it possible to model the gas exchange process with adequate detail and still maintain reasonable tool execution time. In this approach, the accuracy of the air flow and RGF estimation are not influenced by the location of pressure transducers and it is possible to “track ” EGR flow from the exhaust <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system.</b> The tool is demonstrated on a 4 -cylinder gasoline engine powered vehicle with dual intake and exhaust cam phasing. Predictions from the tool are compared to AFR and other real-time signals measured during a variety of different real-world transient drive cycles.

The intake system needs to be evaluated as well to ensure {{it is capable of}} handling the upgraded pumps without introducing problems such as increased vortex activities. Even slight increase in pump capacity can create or increase vortex activity. Free surface and subsurface vortices can be extremely damaging to a pump and can cause major problems such as cavitation to the pump?s impeller and casing, vibration, and decreased performance. The challenge here is to modify the existing cooling water intake system without major reconstruction that would be both costly and schedule intense. This paper presents a case study of an existing South Texas petrochemical plant where a turnaround upgrade required an increase in cooling water flow through the existing sump basin and the associated engineering work for a physical hydraulic model study. The main purpose of the physical hydraulic model study was to ascertain simple and low cost modifications to the pump intake bays that allow the required flow increase through the existing pump intake system without flow disruptions from the higher flow volume. The hydraulic model replicated the fundamental flow parameters in the sump?s pump intake bays and led to an inexpensive, timely, and easy to implement solution that did not require major construction changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system.</b> With physical modeling, the intricate interaction between cooling water and air can be analyzed and tested, a task that computational fluid dynamics cannot achieve to the required degree of precision.

Increase in pressure from 5 kPa to 10 kPa exhibits a 43 % increase in flow rate and 90 % increase in swirl coefficient and by removing the manifold, the flow rate only increase by 4 % but the swirl coefficient changes by 30 %.

EGR has no significant effect on carbon monoxide (CO) emission. The addition of EGR also reduces cylinder’s gas temperature and pressure.

Water samples were collected from nearby surface seawater as a reference and from selected individual wells. The percentage of algae and bacterial removal by induced filtration process was evaluated by comparison of the seawater concentrations with the well discharges. Transparent exopolymer particles and organic carbon fractions reduction was also measured. The quality of raw water extracted from the well systems was highly improved compared with the raw seawater source. It was observed that algae were virtually 100 % removed and the bacterial concentration was significantly removed by the aquifer matrix.

In order <b>to</b> clarify <b>the</b> valve. performance it was decided to conduct tests of a 1 : 4 scale-model valve at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Minnesota. The material which follows describes the Woolley valve, the three part test program (static, steady state flow, and dynamic flow), the test facilities, the test results, and the conclusions and recommendations resulting from the tests.

40|$|In {{the rally}} car racing {{there is a}} need for maximum power {{throughout}} the race. While this is not possible through the entire engine speed range, it is possible <b>to</b> manipulate <b>the</b> engine speed at which maximum power is obtained by changing the engine configuration. One of the most effective ways to do this is <b>to</b> modify <b>the</b> <b>intake</b> <b>system</b> <b>to</b> allow for more air into the engine, thus allowing for more fuel to be burnt and more power to be obtained. This dissertation focused on improving the inlet system of a high-performance rally car race engine by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and mathematical optimisation techniques, the combination of which is called a computational flow optimisation (CFO) system. Historically, designers have been aware of the importance of proper intake design and with improving technology and a better understating of wave theory, as applied to manifold flow, development moved at fast pace. The application of wave theory to intakes led to a more academic approach to engine tuning, where mathematical relationships were developed <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> influence of certain engine parameters on air intake. Numerical methods used to solve for flow in <b>intake</b> <b>systems</b> have also developed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> advances in computer capabilities and are used in the study in the form of CFD and 1 -D gas dynamics (as implemented in the engine simulation code used in the study, namely EngMod 4 T). These are combined with optimisation to arrive at an improved design. The CFD simulations are transient in nature in order <b>to</b> capture <b>the</b> pulse interactions and their influence on the mass of air inducted by <b>the</b> <b>intakes.</b> <b>The</b> first case considered is that of a single intake exposed to atmosphere. <b>To</b> relate <b>the</b> results of <b>the</b> single <b>intake</b> simulation <b>to</b> a full-intake simulation, the mass of inducted air is assumed to be equal for all four intakes. This assumption was found to be flawed as shown by the simulation that followed that took into consideration all four intakes also open <b>to</b> atmosphere. <b>The</b> simulation showed that <b>the</b> <b>intakes</b> actually induct differing amounts of air and the total amount is less than for four single trumpets. A more comprehensive simulation was conducted where the airbox was included and the resulting total mass inducted showed that even less air is inducted by this setup. The results of the latter were used as the basis of the optimisation study that followed. Various airbox designs, obtained from the optimisation software LS-OPT, were simulated and resulted in an improved airbox design that inducts 6. 2 % more air than the original airbox. And since there is direct relationship between mass of air inducted and engine power produced, it is expected that the engine power would also increase by 6. 2 %. The study demonstrates the successful implementation of a CFO system to solve a complex industrial flow problem. With the increase of computing power and increasing affordability of such systems coupled with the ease-of-use of commercial CFD software, CFO should become more common in industrial application.

The four-stroke, single cylinder S.
