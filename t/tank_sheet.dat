50|$|The {{remains of}} Moel Tryfan survived {{long enough to}} become part of the fleet of the {{restored}} Ffestiniog Railway in the early 1950s. However, by this time it was little more than a rusting hulk, and on 2 October 1954 it was towed to Harbour Station where it was cut up for scrap. The proceeds from the sales of the remains were used to fund the further restoration of the Ffestiniog Railway. The trailing bogie survived and was ultimately used to provide pony trucks for the locomotives Linda and Blanche when they were converted from s into s along with the bogie frame, one side <b>tank</b> <b>sheet</b> and the air receiver.|$|E

An accurate and efficient finite element model was developed for analysis and prediction of ellipsoidal heads forming quality, with different degrees of reduction deformation at different binder forces considered, and self-adaptive mesh were adopted to improve computational efficiency and quality. And the results of simulation was validated by experimental results. Based on this finite element model, the distributions of stress, strain and wall thickness during this process were obtained...|$|R

On their return, the regiment's <b>tanks</b> were <b>sheeted</b> down so that all markings were hidden and all ranks had to divest themselves of identifying badges to prevent knowledge of their deployment becoming known.

5000|$|There {{are also}} {{daylight}} <b>tanks</b> accepting <b>sheet</b> film, usually adjustable to multiple existing sheet formats - e. g. inch and metric, {{and allowing the}} processing the sheet film in daylight. They have to be loaded in the dark, though. The stainless steel Nikor tank accepts up to 12 sheets of film, 4x5" [...] size maximum, and requires about 1 liter of chemistry. These tanks have long been discontinued, and are only available used. Some people report uneven development and emulsion scratching with this device (a result of steel [...] "spider" [...] presence, separating the <b>sheets</b> in <b>tank's</b> [...] "cage" [...] ), but many users get excellent results with it - the right loading and infrequent agitation are perhaps the keys to success. The current make plastic Combi-Plan tank accepts up to 6 sheets of film, and works nicely, though {{the overall quality of}} manufacture is not too high, and the tank has a number of small plastic details, easy to break or lose. But this tank is also quite capable of excellent performance.|$|R

Once set up is complete nurses, volunteers and Doctors Arrive on site to get dressed into uniforms. There were normally 6 nurses and 15 volunteers, the Nurses would do their preliminary task while the volunteers would split off into groups. One group would unpack and set up the reception ready to record details of some 200 donors over 6 hours. Another group would set up the canteen can prepare food for after donations. The third group will set up the blood bottle table where the blood would be tagged numbered and recorded. From there the site has now been set up ready to take donations.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} is to estimate such value of a tank head depth wherein the maximum capacity of vehicle is provided and a tank vessel durability meets the requirements. Methodo-logy. The problem solution was carried out with using the {{finite element analysis program}} NASTRAN. The finite element model is a tank shell of the railway eight-wheel tank car of model 15 - 1443. The load was presented as pressure. The value was accepted equal 0, 4 MPa. The finite element model strain-stress state was analyzed. The tank head depth changed ranging from 0, 2 m to 1, 5 m. Findings. The rational tank head depth was 0, 47 m from the tank vessel durability condition. This allows to improve the basic tank car parameters. It means to increase the tank vessel volume and to increase the capacity at 0, 7 ton. Authors has investigated that an additional increase of the tank vessel volume and the vehicle capacity can be achieved when the <b>tank</b> head <b>sheets</b> thickness as high as 13 mm. In this case it is necessary to recognize that the rational tank head depth is 0, 4 m. Tank capacity can be increase at 1 ton. Originality. This paper presents the method of analysis of the tank car volume increase. The tank car volume increase and thus Ð° capacity of vehicle increase allows to improve the car productiveness. Calculations results allow to give the dependence of the maximum equivalent stresses in a tank head which the depth of the one change. Practical value. It is shown that the tank head depth reduction will allow to improve parameters of the existing railway tank when the tank vessel durability meets the requirements.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{results from a}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) model for the mixing process used to disperse synthetic fibers in wet-lay process. We used CFD software, FLUENT, together with the MIXSIM user interface to accurately model the impeller geometry. A multiple reference frame (MRF) model and standard k-e turbulence model were used to model the problem. After obtaining a converged solution for the mixing tank with water, a discrete phase model was constructed by injecting spherical particles into the flow. A mixing tank with baffles and a centrally located impeller was used in experiments. PET fibers (1. 5 denier, 6. 35, 12. 7, and 38. 7 mm) at a concentration of 0. 01 % were mixed in water for the study. In regions behind the baffles, where the model predicted higher concentration of particles, experimental results showed a 34 % higher concentration relative to {{the region in the}} high turbulence zone near the center. Instantaneous sheets were formed by rapidly dipping and removing a flat wire mesh strainer into the tank at two different locations to assess the state of dispersion in the <b>tank.</b> The <b>sheets</b> were transferred onto a blotting paper and examined under a microscope to count defects. Results show that the number of rope defects was 43 % higher in sheets drawn from the region behind the baffles than in the sheets drawn from regions {{near the center of the}} tank. Changing baffles from a rectangular to a triangular cross section decreased the number of rope defects, but increased the number of log defects in the sample sheets at the same location. The CFD model can be used to optimize mixing tank design for wet lay fiber dispersion. The model provides further insight into the mixing process by predicting the effect of changes in design parameters on dispersion quality...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The North Muddy Mountains {{are located}} in {{southern}} Nevada, about 65 km northeast of Las Vegas and near the eastern boundary of the Basin and Range province. The north-south-trending range block is bounded on the east and west, respectively, by east- and west-dipping, high-angle normal faults. Sevier age contractional and Cenozoic age extensional structures {{are present in the}} range. The Summit thrust and Willow Tank thrust crop out, respectively, on the southwest and northeast sides of the North Muddy Mountains. A newly mapped thrust segment connects the Summit and Willow Tank thrusts. It juxtaposed Jurassic on Cretaceous age rocks. The most recent displacement on the thrust is bracketed between 95. 8 +/- 3. 5 Ma (age of youngest deformed rocks) and 93. 1 +/- 3. 4 Ma (age of oldest overlying undeformed beds). These numbers indicate an Albian to Turonian(?) age range for the thrust. The Summit-Willow <b>Tank</b> thrust <b>sheet</b> was later folded by a northwest-southeast-trending, southwest inclined fold train by displacement on the Arrowhead fault, a Miocene and possibly younger(?) extensional structure. The oldest (Albian) synorogenic deposits in the area contain exotic clasts of formations that were not involved in local thrusting; the debris was transported eastward from older thrust sheets. Younger (Cenomanian) synorogenic beds are composed of Mesozoic age clasts {{at the base of the}} section, grading to early paleozoic age clasts near the top (reverse clast stratigraphy). This succession represents progressively deeper erosion of thrust sheets during thrusting. The younger synorogenic beds do not contain exotic clasts from older, more westerly, thrust sheets. This observation suggests that local thrust sheets formed highlands that shut off the westerly source provenance. Rotation of horst and graben blocks on Cenozoic normal and oblique-slip faults caused dismembering of older Sevierage fold-thrust structures, and in some cases refolded them into new orientations. Seismic reflection sections show wedge-shaped sedimentary beds, indicating that range-bounding normal faults formed half-grabens. The normal faults appear to be listric impling that the net slip on these faults is a measure of the regional horizontal extension...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum-lithium alloys exhibit high strength, high elastic modulus, and low density {{as well as}} {{excellent}} cryogenic {{mechanical properties}} making them ideal material candidates for cryogenic tanks. NASA has proposed the use of 'built-up' structure for panels fabricated into cryogenic tanks replacing current conventional machining. Superplastically formed stiffeners would be joined to <b>sheet</b> (<b>tank</b> skin) that had been roll formed to the radius of the tank {{in order to produce}} panels. Aluminum-lithium alloys of interest for producing the built-up structure include alloy 2095 -T 6 stiffeners to 2095 -T 8 sheet and alloy 8090 -T 6 stiffeners to 2090 -T 83 sheet. Laser welding, with comparable joint properties, offers the following advantages over conventional welding: higher production rates, minimal degradation within the heat affected zones, and full process automation. This study established process parameters for laser beam welding, mechanical property determinations, metallographic characterization, and fabrication of prototype panels. Tensile tests representing partial penetration of the skin alloys provided joint efficiencies between 65 and 77 percent, depending upon alloy and degree of penetration. Results of tension shear tests of lap welds indicated that the combination of 2095 -T 6 to 2090 -T 8 exhibited significantly higher weld shear strength at the interface in comparison to welds of 8090 -T 6 to 2090 -T 83. The increased shear strength associated with 2095 is believed to be due to the alloy's ability to precipitation strengthening (naturally age) after welding...|$|R
50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the <b>tank.</b> After the <b>sheet</b> is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|R
