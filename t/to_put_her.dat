5|$|The {{advisory}} board for Oregon Shakespeare Festival Portland was reformulated as {{the board of}} directors of the PCS, and Elizabeth Huddle was hired in May 1994 as the producing artistic director. Huddle had previously served on the PCS's search committee for a new artistic director, but decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> name in for consideration.

5|$|As {{the episode}} opens, Mossad Officer Amir Mantel (Dove Meir) is shot dead at point blank range in an American parking garage. At NCIS headquarters, Ziva cancels plans to pursue Eli David's killer, Ilan Bodnar (Oded Fehr), in Rome, having {{come to the}} {{conclusion}} that he will relocate to Berlin shortly. Before she and Tony depart, the new Mossad director, Orli Elbaz (Marina Sirtis), arrives in hopes of collaborating with the agency in the search for Bodnar.

The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police seem to believe {{he had something to}} do with the incident.

She seems to have some connection with him but can't seem <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> finger on what it is.|$|E
5|$|Batwoman is a superheroine {{appearing}} in American comic books published by DC Comics. In all incarnations, {{the character is}} a wealthy heiress who becomes inspired by the superhero Batman and chooses, like him, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> wealth and resources towards a war on crime as a masked vigilante in her home of Gotham City. The identity of Batwoman is shared by two heroines in mainstream DC publications; both women are named Katherine Kane, with the original Batwoman commonly referred to by her nickname Kathy and the modern incarnation going by the name Kate.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E

She refused paramedics' attempts <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> on a stretcher, returned to her vehicle, and continued to refuse to cooperate. She then attempted {{to walk away from the}} scene, but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of assault on a police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail.|$|E
5|$|Hamasaki was {{initially}} a good student, earning good grades {{in junior high}} school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped {{out in the first}} year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she spent much of her time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.|$|E
5|$|Hill was {{a moving}} {{force behind the}} {{development}} of social housing, and her early friendship with John Ruskin enabled her <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> theories into practice {{with the aid of}} his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal.|$|E
60|$|Here Hilda, however, cut {{the subject}} short, and {{deprived}} herself of Mrs. Jacobs' reminiscences by going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on <b>her</b> things.|$|R

5|$|Louise and {{her sisters}} had another {{disagreement}} {{after the death of}} the Queen's close friend, Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill. Determined not <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> mother through more misery, Louise wanted the news to be broken to the Queen gradually. When this was not done, Louise voiced her sharp criticism of Helena and Beatrice. One month later, on 22 January 1901, Queen Victoria died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. In her will, the Queen bequeathed Kent House, on the Osborne Estate, to Louise as a country residence, and gave Osborne Cottage to Louise's youngest sister, Beatrice. Louise and Beatrice were now neighbours both at Kensington Palace and Osborne.|$|E
5|$|The November 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was {{announced}} during her annual two-week holiday, which she spent {{with friends in}} Naharia. Immediately after {{the adoption of the}} resolution by the UN General Assembly, 1947–48 Civil War broke out, leading to an Arab siege of Jerusalem. Desiring to return to her post at the hospital, Schwester Selma spent three weeks petitioning the offices of the British Mandatory government, the incoming Israeli government, and even the underground leaders, to assist her. Finally the army agreed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> on one of its armed convoys supplying food and medicine to the besieged city.|$|E
5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> design principles into practice {{on a larger}} scale. Her practice had grown large {{enough for her to}} need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E

5|$|The outpost is {{evacuated}} {{during the}} dangerous mission, {{leaving only the}} Enterprise away team on surface. The firestorms overwhelm the position that Daren's team occupies {{before they can be}} retrieved. Believing Daren to be dead, Picard sits contemplating his decision in his quarters. He then hears that survivors are being transported aboard, and heads to the transporter room. Daren is not among the initial group of survivors, but is later transported to the ship. Eight members of the team have died. Afterwards, Picard and Daren discuss their relationship. They conclude that it cannot continue, as Picard could not bear <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> in danger once more. They discuss giving up their Starfleet careers to be together. Daren realizes that Picard, still cherishing the family life he experienced as Kamin, has nonetheless chosen duty, career, and loneliness. They both know that Daren must transfer off the Enterprise. They kiss once more, and Daren makes Picard promise not to give up music.|$|E
5|$|The {{successive}} {{rulers of}} Monaco tended to live elsewhere and visit their palace only occasionally. Charles III was succeeded in 1889 by Albert I. Albert married Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton, {{a daughter of}} Scotland's 11th duke of Hamilton, and his German wife, a princess of Baden. The couple had one son, Louis, before their marriage was annulled in 1880. Albert was a keen scientist and founded the Oceanographic Institute in 1906; as a pacifist he then founded the International Institute of Peace in Monaco. Albert's second wife, Alice Heine, an American banking heiress who was the widow of a French duke, did much to turn Monte Carlo into a cultural centre, establishing both ballet and the opera in the city. Having brought a large dowry into the family she contemplated turning the casino into a convalescent home for the poor who would benefit from recuperation in warm climes. The couple, however, separated before Alice was able <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> plan into action.|$|E
5|$|According to Thai tradition, however, Thado Dhamma Yaza and Maha Chakkraphat {{engaged in}} single elephant-combat. (The custom {{of the time}} was for two commanders/leaders of the same status to fight in single combat. It is unclear {{as to why the}} Siamese king would have {{accepted}} to face someone of lesser rank. If he did issue the challenge, he would have challenged his counterpart Tabinshwehti and accepted to face only Tabinshwehti.) The Thai narrative continues that Maha Chakkraphat's elephant panicked and gave flight, charging away from the enemy; Thado Dhamma Yaza swiftly gave chase. Fearing for the life of her husband, Queen Sri Suriyothai charged ahead <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> elephant between the King and the Viceroy, thereby blocking his pursuit. The Viceroy then engaged the Queen in single combat, fatally cleaving her from shoulder to heart with his spear, also wounding her daughter—both mother and child met their deaths {{on the back of the}} same elephant. It is said that the Viceroy did not know he was fighting a woman until his blow struck—as she fell dying her helmet came off, exposing her long hair. Prince Ramesuan and Prince Mahin then urged their elephants forward to fight the Viceroy, drove him and his remaining forces from the field, then carried the bodies of their mother and sister back to Ayutthaya. The Siamese king meanwhile rallied his army, and retreated in good order back towards the capital. The Burmese chronicles however do not mention any instance of single combat (on elephant-back or otherwise) by the viceroy of Prome.|$|E

5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a major threat}} to Allied shipping, the British military sought to damage or destroy the battleship before she could re-enter service. Another midget submarine attack was considered impractical due to improvements to Kaafjord's defences, and the commander of the RAF's Bomber Command refused to attempt heavy bomber raids against the battleship as he believed that such operations were unlikely to be successful and would result in heavy casualties. As a result, the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers were considered the best means of attacking Kaafjord, and the Admiralty directed the fleet to begin planning such a raid in late 1943. Following several months of preparations the Home Fleet's first attack on Kaafjord, which was designated Operation Tungsten, was conducted on 3 April 1944 and involved five aircraft carriers. The two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters were not detected during their flights to Kaafjord, and the battleship was hit by 15 bombs. Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties, but the ship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, the damage inflicted on Tirpitzs superstructure, armament and engines was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> out of service for several months while repairs were completed. The commander of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, placed a priority on returning the battleship to service so that she could continue to tie down Allied naval resources. He and other senior German officers recognised at this time that the threat of further air attacks meant that Tirpitz could no longer operate against Allied convoys.|$|E
5|$|Amira and Anthony's {{relationship}} continues {{and after}} having a small argument with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), Amira goes over to Anthony's house and the pair end up having sex for the first time. However, she later cries afterwards and appears to regret it. She tells him it felt wrong, {{but it is not}} his fault. She then decides to leave Walford without telling him. Anthony later learns that Amira has left after Syed tells him. When Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) takes a liking to Anthony, her father Derek forces Anthony to take her out. Anthony is not interested in Alice, but is scared of Derek so cannot refuse. They have a couple of dates, but they go badly. Several weeks later, Alice receives flowers and assumes they are from Anthony. Anthony is then forced to take her out again, as {{he does not want to}} upset her. However, he tries <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> off by behaving and dressing badly. Later, during a game of spin the bottle, Anthony and Alice kiss, and he then decides that he really does like her and invites her on a proper date. Alice decides she is ready to lose her virginity to Anthony, although he does not pressure her. Her brother Joey (David Witts) overhears and manipulates Anthony into playing poker with Derek. Anthony cannot resist due to his gambling addiction and ends up losing the emporium. Both Derek and Joey tell him to leave and Alice is left stood up. Joey tells her Derek drove Anthony away, so she rushes to the emporium to find Anthony, but is too late as he leaves Walford via the tube station.|$|E
5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E

60|$|There {{were two}} reasons.
