The mechanism of the Coulomb attractive random <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> is attributed to the carrier tunneling between the carbon nanotube and the Coulomb attractive defect. The random <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> is also studied under magnetic field over an entire gate bias range and a wide temperature range. The Coulomb attractive random <b>telegraph</b> <b>signal</b> shows weak magnetic dependence, which {{may be due to}} the broadening of the Zeeman levels of the defect in the p-type carbon nanotube field effect transistor...|$|R

A new noise {{generation}} mechanism resulting from valence-band electron tunneling is proposed. In strong inversion conditions, valence-band electron tunneling from Si substrate to polysilicon gate takes place {{and results in}} the splitting of electron and hole quasi-Fermi-levels in the channel. The excess low-frequency noise is attributed to electron and hole recombination at interface traps between the two quasi-Fermi-levels.
