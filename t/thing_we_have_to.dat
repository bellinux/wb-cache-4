500|$|Later, Doug Herzog from Comedy Central saw the Jesus vs. Santa {{short and}} {{considered}} {{it to be}} [...] "literally the funniest thing 'd ever seen," [...] and requested Parker and Stone to develop a show for his network. During the negotiations, Parker and Stone brought {{up the idea of}} a Mr. Hankey episode, with Parker claiming to have asked [...] "one <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know before we really go any further: {{how do you feel about}} talking poo?" [...] The network's executives were receptive to the idea, which would be one of the main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel. The first episode of the series, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", debuted on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997, while Mr. Hankey debuted a few months later in the ninth episode, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} anti-US sentiments {{would affect the}} film's box office, Feige said, [...] "Marvel is {{perceived}} pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office {{would be a good}} <b>thing....</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E
500|$|Although the Mr. Hankey {{short film}} was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related {{animated}} short films called The Spirit of Christmas, {{which served as}} precursors to the South Park series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived {{the idea of a}} South Park-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it [...] "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend Brian Graden, then a television executive with the Fox Broadcasting Company, but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, [...] "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode. Later, when Comedy Central expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know before we really go any further: {{how do you feel about}} talking poo?" [...] The executives were receptive to the idea, which Parker said was one of the main reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.|$|E

[...] According to Gérard Prunier, a staffer to the Assistant Secretary said that [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do is look the other way", with respect to Rwanda's continued intervention. New York Times correspondent Howard W. French said that according to his sources, Rice herself made the remark. The Congo Wars spearheaded by Rwanda led to over five million deaths. In 2012, when serving as UN ambassador, Rice opposed efforts to publicly censure Rwandan President Paul Kagame for again supporting a Congolese rebel group, {{this time in the}} 2012 Congo conflict, despite the sacking of the regional capital of Goma. The Rwandan government was a client when Rice worked at Intellibridge in 2001–02.|$|E
2500|$|Cumberbatch's {{performance}} {{was met with}} widespread acclaim from critics. TIME ranked Cumberbatch's portrayal number one in its Top 10 film performances of 2014, with the magazine's chief film critic Richard Corliss calling Cumberbatch's characterisation [...] "the actor's oddest, fullest, most Cumberbatchian character yet ... he doesn't play Turing so much as inhabit him, bravely and sympathetically but without mediation". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times declared Turing [...] "the role of Cumberbatch's career", while A.O. Scott of The New York Times stated that it is [...] "one of the year's finest pieces of screen acting". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone asserted that the actor [...] "gives an explosive, emotionally complex" [...] portrayal. Critic Clayton Davis stated that it's a [...] "performance for the ages... proving he's {{one of the best}} actors working today". Foundas of Variety wrote that Cumberbatch's acting is [...] "masterful... a marvel to watch", Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described it as [...] "delicately nuanced, prickly and tragic" [...] and Owen Gleiberman of the BBC proclaimed it an [...] "emotionally tailored perfection". It's [...] "a storming performance from Cumberbatch: you'll be deciphering his work long after the credits roll" [...] declared Dave Calhoun of Time Out. In addition, Claudia Puig of USA Today concluded in her review, [...] "It's Cumberbatch's nuanced, haunted performance that leaves the most powerful impression". The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy reported that the undeniable highlight of the film was Cumberbatch, [...] "whose charisma, tellingly modulated and naturalistic array of eccentricities, talent at indicating a mind never at rest and knack for simultaneously portraying physical oddness and attractiveness combine to create an entirely credible portrait of genius at work". Critic Roger Friedman wrote {{at the end of his}} review, [...] "Cumberbatch may be the closest <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> a real descendant of Sir Laurence Olivier".|$|E

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on September 20, 1993. The lead offscreen talent had {{all worked}} with Tarantino on Reservoir Dogs— cinematographer Andrzej Sekuła, film editor Sally Menke, production designer David Wasco, and costume designer Betsy Heimann. According to Tarantino, [...] "e had $8 million [...] I {{wanted it to}} look like a $20–25 million movie. I wanted it {{to look like a}}n epic. It's an epic in everything— in invention, in ambition, in length, in scope, in everything except the price tag." [...] The film, he says, was shot [...] "on 50 ASA film stock, which is the slowest stock they make. The reason we use it is that it creates an almost no-grain image, it's lustrous. It's the closest <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> 50s Technicolor." [...] The largest chunk of the budget— $150,000— went to creating the Jack Rabbit Slim's set. It was built in a Culver City warehouse, where it was joined by several other sets, as well as the film's production offices. The diner sequence was shot on location in Hawthorne at the Hawthorne Grill, known for its Googie architecture. For the costumes, Tarantino took his inspiration from French director Jean-Pierre Melville, who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor. Tarantino cast himself in a modest-sized role as he had in Reservoir Dogs. One of his pop totems, Fruit Brute, a long-discontinued General Mills cereal, also returned from the earlier film. The shoot wrapped on November 30. Before Pulp Fictions premiere, Tarantino convinced Avary to forfeit his agreed-on cowriting credit and accept a [...] "story by" [...] credit, so the line [...] "Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino" [...] could be used in advertising and onscreen.|$|E
