5|$|Admiral Capelle, <b>the</b> <b>deputy</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the Reichsmarineamt, {{stated that}} by mid November 1906, the testing for the {{underwater}} protection designs would be complete. He {{suggested that if}} the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, {{even if it meant}} increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E

5|$|The {{comedy series}} focuses on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), <b>the</b> <b>deputy</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> {{the parks and}} {{recreation}} department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the show when NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a spin-off of his comedy series The Office, on which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, though it would share the mockumentary style of The Office. Like that show, Parks and Recreation encouraged improvisation among its cast members.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, the author, Stephen Lewis, aged 67 and living in Toronto, worked as the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, a {{position}} he held since 2001. Previously he worked as <b>the</b> <b>Deputy</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> United Nations Children's Fund (1994–99), as the Canadian ambassador to the UN (1984–88), and {{as leader of the}} Ontario New Democratic Party (1970–79). After Lewis optimistically accepted the Special Envoy position he became increasingly distraught by the devastation he witnessed. Already a skilled orator, he became more vocal on the topic. He founded the Stephen Lewis Foundation, hosted Oprah Winfrey as she toured Africa, and was the subject of two award-winning documentaries by The Nature of Things, entitled Race Against Time and The Value of Life. Meanwhile he was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada, awarded the Pearson Medal of Peace, and named Canadian of the Year (2003) by MacLean's magazine. In 2005, he was invited to deliver the annual series of Massey Lectures from which the book, Race Against Time, was adapted. He wrote the text in early to mid- 2005 and delivered the lecture series in October when the book was released. Lewis wrote the book, not as an employee of the UN, but as a citizen concerned with the world's response to the AIDS challenge in Africa.|$|E
