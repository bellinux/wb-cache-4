5000|$|Royal Kaliber {{was a part}} of the US Show Jumping Team at the 2004 Athens Olympics, {{winners of}} the team silver medal. However, while jumping in the final round of the {{individual}} competition, he had an awkward landing from the 15th fence on course, a large oxer. Kappler felt his mount take an odd step and, with only two fences to go, pulled him up and dismounted. A diagnosis by the <b>team</b> <b>veterinarian</b> found that the horse had an acute strain to his superficial digital flexor tendon of his left foreleg. [...] This made him the third show jumping horse to be injured, which brought up questions of the suitability of the footing. Royal Kaliber was pulled from competition, but his previous effort had still earned him the individual bronze. It was decided to keep the stallion in Europe until he had completely recovered from his injury, before shipping him home. Following the disqualification of gold medalist, Cian O'Connor of Ireland, for a drug infraction, Kappler and Royal Kaliber were finally awarded the individual silver medal, with Rodrigo Pessoa moving up to the gold-medal position.|$|E

40|$|Cryptosporidium and Giardia are {{important}} causes of diarrhoeal illness. Adequate {{knowledge of the}} molecular diversity and geographical distribution of these parasites and the environmental and climatic variables that influence their prevalence is important for effective control of infection in at-risk populations, yet relatively {{little is known about}} the epidemiology of these parasites in Africa. Cryptosporidium is associated with moderate to severe diarrhoea and increased mortality in African countries and both parasites negatively affect child growth and development. Malnutrition and HIV status are also important contributors to the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in African countries. Molecular typing of both parasites in humans, domestic animals and wildlife to date indicates a complex picture of both anthroponotic, zoonotic and spill-back transmission cycles that requires further investigation. For Cryptosporidium, the only available drug (nitazoxanide) is ineffective in HIV and malnourished individuals and therefore more effective drugs are a high priority. Several classes of drugs with good efficacy exist for Giardia, but dosing regimens are suboptimal and emerging resistance threatens clinical utility. Climate change and population growth are also predicted to increase both malnutrition and the prevalence of these parasites in water sources. Dedicated and co-ordinated commitments from African governments involving “One Health” initiatives with multidisciplinary <b>teams</b> of <b>veterinarians,</b> medical workers, relevant government authorities, and public health specialists working together are essential to control and prevent the burden of disease caused by these parasites...|$|R

40|$|Stakeholders in the {{livestock}} industry {{are in a}} position to make critical choices that directly impact on animal welfare during slaughter and transport. Understanding the attitudes of stakeholders in livestock-importing countries, including factors that motivate the stakeholders to improve animal welfare, can lead to improved trade relations with exporting developed countries and improved animal welfare initiatives in the importing countries. Improving stakeholder attitudes to livestock welfare may help to facilitate the better welfare that is increasingly demanded by the public for livestock. Knowledge of the existing attitudes towards the welfare of livestock during transport and slaughter provides a starting point that may help to target efforts. This study aimed to investigate the animal welfare attitudes of livestock stakeholders (farmers, <b>team</b> leaders, <b>veterinarians,</b> business owners, business managers, and those working directly with animals) in selected countries in E and SE Asia (China, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Malaysia). The factors that motivated them to improve animal welfare (in particular their religion, knowledge levels, monetary gain, the availability of tools and resources, more pressing community issues, and the approval of their supervisor and peers) were assessed for their relationships to stakeholder role and ranked according to their importance. Stakeholder roles influenced attitudes to animal welfare during livestock transport and slaughter. Farmers were more motivated by their peers compared to other stakeholders. Business owners reported higher levels of motivation from monetary gain, while business managers were mainly motivated by what was prescribed by the company for which they worked. Veterinarians reported the highest levels of perceived approval for improving animal welfare, and all stakeholder groups were least likely to be encouraged to change by a ‘western’ international organization. This study demonstrates the differences in attitudes of the major livestock stakeholders towards their animals’ welfare during transport and slaughter, which advocacy organisations can use to tailor strategies more effectively to improve animal welfare. The results suggest that animal welfare initiatives are more likely to engage their target audience when tailored to specific stakeholder groups...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a widely}} {{recognised}} lack of baseline epidemiological data on the dynamics and impacts of infectious cattle diseases in east Africa. The Infectious Diseases of East African Livestock (IDEAL) project is an epidemiological study of cattle health in western Kenya {{with the aim of}} providing baseline epidemiological data, investigating the impact of different infections on key responses such as growth, mortality and morbidity, the additive and/or multiplicative effects of co-infections, and the influence of management and genetic factors. A longitudinal cohort study of newborn calves was conducted in western Kenya between 2007 - 2009. Calves were randomly selected from all those reported in a 2 stage clustered sampling strategy. Calves were recruited between 3 and 7 days old. A <b>team</b> of <b>veterinarians</b> and animal health assistants carried out 5 -weekly, clinical and postmortem visits. Blood and tissue samples were collected in association with all visits and screened using a range of laboratory based diagnostic methods for over 100 different pathogens or infectious exposures. RESULTS: The study followed the 548 calves over the first 51 weeks of life or until death and when they were reported clinically ill. The cohort experienced a high all cause mortality rate of 16 % with at least 13 % of these due to infectious diseases. Only 307 (6 %) of routine visits were classified as clinical episodes, with a further 216 reported by farmers. 54 % of calves reached one year without a reported clinical episode. Mortality was mainly to east coast fever, haemonchosis, and heartwater. Over 50 pathogens were detected in this population with exposure to a further 6 viruses and bacteria. CONCLUSION: The IDEAL study has demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} mount population based longitudinal animal studies. The results quantify for the first time in an animal population the high diversity of pathogens a population may have to deal with and the levels of co-infections with key pathogens such as Theileria parva. This study highlights the need to develop new systems based approaches to study pathogens in their natural settings to understand the impacts of co-infections on clinical outcomes and to develop new evidence based interventions that are relevant.

40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} costly health concern in the dairy {{industry}} today. Annual losses have been estimated at $ 180 to 185 per cow. Based on this figure, annual losses for Kansas producers may exceed $ 15 million. Nationally, mastitis may cost the industry $ 1. 8 billion annually. Although treatment and premature culling for clinical mastitis are costly, {{about two-thirds of the}} cost is associated with reduced milk production caused by subclinical mastitis. Effective mastitis control programs are necessary for the dairy industry today. Prevention of subclinical mastitis is the key to lowering the somatic cell counts (SCC). Elevated bulk tank SCC (> 250, 000 /ml) are an indication that a significant number of the cattle are infected with mastitis-causing bacteria and corrective action is required. Key areas to evaluate are cow housing, milking equipment, and milking procedures. Utilization of milk culture data is necessary to determine if elevated SCC are due to environmental or contagious organisms. In addition, cultures of milk samples from individual cows may be needed to identify cattle infected with contagious organisms. Correction of deficiencies in housing, milking procedures, and milking equipment will effectively control environmental mastitis. Identification, segregation, and future culling of animals infected with contagious organisms are necessary for control of contagious mastitis. An effective monitoring system that includes individual-cow SCC, individual-cow bacterial cultures, and bulktank bacterial cultures will ensure a low bulk-tank SCC and a low level of mastitis. It is a health issue that requires constant attention, because success is achieved with attention to detail on the dairy as a whole, and lack of attention in only one segment of the dairy may result in significant increases in mastitis. Success of the program requires that all employees and the management <b>team</b> (managers, herdsmen, <b>veterinarians,</b> nutritionists, milking equipment technicians, and consultants) emphasize increasing milk quality by controlling mastitis...|$|R
40|$|Brucellosis is a {{livestock}} disease {{which is}} also transmissible to humans and thus it is of major public health concern. Brucellosis is considered as a major zoonotic disease of public health importance worldwide. However, its prevention and control poses {{a number of problems}} to national authorities, particularly to the Veterinary Services and the Public Health sector. The prevalence of brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan is one of the highest worldwide and has been increasing for animals and humans in recent years. Currently, there is very limited understanding of brucellosis transmission both between livestock species and to humans at the national level. It is important to understand the main transmission routes in order to establish a control strategy of this zoonosis. Brucellosis can ultimately be eliminated only if the disease is controlled in the animal reservoir since animal and human health is inextricably intertwined. It is therefore necessary to consider human and animal health strategies as two aspects of the same aim. The goal of the current study was to describe the distribution and the transmission dynamics of brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan and to determine its impact on livestock production and public health. The results of the study should {{contribute to the development of}} an efficient brucellosis control strategy in Kyrgyzstan. The specific objectives are: 1) a historical review and analysis of brucellosis control measures used in Kyrgyzstan; 2) a representative sero-survey of brucellosis prevalence for humans and animals; 3) assessment of molecular epidemiology of animal and human brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan; 4) brucellosis cost estimations for livestock owners, brucellosis patients and society; 5) assessment of the potential of abattoirs for brucellosis surveillance; 6) evaluation of the current mass livestock vaccination campaign and promotion of effective brucellosis control in Kyrgyzstan. This research has been carried out within an interdisciplinary study with the participation of different projects and operational <b>teams</b> involving <b>veterinarians,</b> health workers, epidemiologists, molecular biologists, and laboratory and field veterinary professionals. The study included: serological studies for humans and animals (2006, 2007 and 2012) and the molecular characterisation of Brucella cultures isolated from aborted foetuses of cattle and sheep, (2007 - 2011) as well as surveillance of abattoirs (2012) and the survey of patients through questionnaires (2013). Based on the collected data, a cross-sector estimation of the societal cost of brucellosis was done. Livestock demographic models were used to estimate the losses in the livestock production.

Following collection of blood, sera were separated and tested by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies against Mycoplasma (General antigen for M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae). The seroprevalence of Mycoplasma in the region was 28 % (29 poultry farms out of 103 were infected). About 50 % (23 out of 47) of poultry farms located in Garian city were infected with Mycoplasma and one significant cluster of Mycoplasma infection in the city was identified. Low level of biosecurity was found in poultry farms of the region. Out of the 103 farms included, 63 % of poultry houses has a ground of soil and 44 % of them has uncoated walls which may influence the proper cleaning and disinfection. Almost 100 % of the farms are at risk of exposure to diseases transmitted by wild birds such as avian influenza and Newcastle disease due to absence of wild birds control program. Although, 81 % of the farms have entry restrictions, only 20 % have disinfectants at entry which increase the risk of exposure to pathogens. The results of this study highlight the weakness points of biosecurity measures in poultry farms of Al-Jabal Al-Gharbi region and high seroprevalence of mycoplasma. Data collected in this study will assist the Veterinary authorities to apply effective disease control strategies...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Serra da Estrela native (SEN) {{breed of}} sheep {{is one of the}} most {{important}} in Portugal, standing responsible for the production of one of the most internationally recognized cheeses in the world, "Queijo Serra da Estrela” (protected designation of origin). One of the major risks to the sustainability of SEN dairy flocks if footrot, an infectious diseases that causes lameness, decrease in milk production, weight loss and decrease in fertility. The aim of this work was to determine which parameters become decisive for the appearance of footrot in SEN dairy flocks, while establishing associations with environmental and nutritional variables. Materials and methods: The present study was carried out by performing an especially designed 27 multiple choice questionnaire, based on the underlying causes of lameness in livestock and in the clinical diagnosis performed by the vet techinichian of the clinical cases evaluated at the moment of the inquiry. The survey was performed during the execution of the oficial veterinary health program between February and September of 2014 by a <b>veterinarian</b> <b>team</b> from the Association of SEN Sheep Breeders (ANCOSE). The ovine producers (N= 30, with a total of 1270 animals) were randomly selected from the extense area of production of “Queijo Serra da Estrela”. The parameters evaluated in the study were: season and consequent weather changes during the period of the study, floor types, hygiene conditions, bed types, the existence and use of footbaths, location of footbaths, foot trimming and foot hygiene procedures. After the construction of the database and using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 16. 0 the frequency response for each item was calculated. Results: All SEN livestock producers are proactive in the treatment of lameness (70 %). About 99. 7 % of lameness was related with footroot and most appeared in winter (36. 7 %). In some occasions there was not a specific season distribution (56. 7 % rainiest years). From the analyzed farms, 70 % use straw as a floor bed, followed by bush (21 %). 45. 6 % of animals were clinically diagnosed with footrot and were sheltered in straw floor. Bed quality is good in 40 %, however frequent changes in the floor bed in the preceding 15 days had a higher rate of footroot diagnosed cases (33, 23 %) compared to monthly changes. Regarding sheepfold animal number, the distribution is proper in 36. 7 %, elevated in 30 %, overcrowded in 6. 7 % and low in 23. 3 %. Clinically ill diagnosed animals in last category were the lowest observed (3 %). Concerning hoof trimming, 76. 7 % trims while 23. 3 % reported not to perform that task. From those that perform trimming, 73. 9 % do it only when necessary, 21. 7 % at the time of clipping and 4. 4 % when the animal is affected. One curious result was that animals who perform trimming at clipping had higher footrot cases (52. 6 %), unlike those who trim only when necessary (40. 2 %) or even when animals are clinically ill (0. 91 %). Mostly all in the presence of footrot choose a local treatment (95. 2 %) using antibiotic sprays, instead of parenteral antibiotic treatment. Footbath is rarely used in the prevention (13. 3 %) of this disease and when it is misconceived (25 %) and incorrectly formulated (100 %). Conclusion: This study is the first performed in Portugal focusing on footrot caracterization in native SEN flocks. The economic impact in SEN dairy flocks is atributed to factors such as the direct decrease in milk and meat production, the early slaughter of affected animals due to a non responsive treatment, and medical expenses. The most effective eradication method combines first of all the ability to understand the problems of SEN producers and then the implementation of preventive measures and treatment of footrot. Often linked to the lack of formation, and the advanced age of portuguese producers, the mentality and social factors block the advance of veterinarian intervention itself...|$|R
