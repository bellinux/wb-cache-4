25|$|In a 1955 {{article in}} the {{philosophy}} journal Mind, J. L. Mackie tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have). An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular <b>time</b> <b>might</b> restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be omnipotent in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie, as to {{the best way to}} formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic.|$|E

25|$|The {{relations}} between the central kadatuan and its member (subscribers) kadatuans were dynamic. As such, the status would shift over generations. In addition to coercive methods through raids and conquests and being bound by pasumpahan (oath of allegiance), the royalties of each kadatuan often formed alliances through dynastic marriages. For example, a previously suzerained kadatuan over <b>time</b> <b>might</b> rise in prestige and power, so that eventually its ruler could lay {{claim to be the}} maharaja of the central kadatuan. The relationship between Srivijayan in Sumatra (descendants of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa) and Sailendras in Java exemplified this political dynamic.|$|E
25|$|In LEED {{the exact}} atomic {{configuration}} of a surface {{is determined by}} a trial and error process where measured I-V curves are compared to computer-calculated spectra under the assumption of a model structure. From an initial reference structure a set of trial structures is created by varying the model parameters. The parameters are changed until an optimal agreement between theory and experiment is achieved. However, for each trial structure a full LEED calculation with multiple scattering corrections must be conducted. For systems with a large parameter space the need for computational <b>time</b> <b>might</b> become significant. This {{is the case for}} complex surfaces structures or when considering large molecules as adsorbates.|$|E

500|$|Son of God (also {{known as}} Jesus: The Complete Story and Jesus: The Real Story) is an award-winning British {{documentary}} series that chronicles {{the life of}} Jesus Christ using scientific and contemporary historical evidence. It was presented by Jeremy Bowen, and its first episode premiered in the United Kingdom on 1 April 2001. The executive producer was Ruth Pitt and it was directed by Jean-Claude Bragard—it took a total of 16 months to produce and cost [...] A full symphonic score was composed by James Whitbourn. Son of God featured interviews with 21 historians and other Biblical experts, live action reenactments {{of the life of}} Jesus with Leron Livo in the lead role, and computer-generated images of what locations from Jesus's <b>time</b> <b>might</b> have looked like. These images, created by design team Red Vision, were praised by critics and received an Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2001 Royal Television Society North Awards.|$|E
500|$|By region, {{studies have}} {{revealed}} specific details {{that have helped}} outline the {{series of events that}} led to the extinction of the local megafauna. [...] In the Central Highlands, dense forests existed until 1600 CE, with lingering patches persisting until the 19th and 20th centuries. [...] Today, small fragments stand isolated among vast expanses of human-created savanna, despite an average annual rainfall that is sufficient to sustain the evergreen forests once found there. [...] Deliberately set fires were the cause of the deforestation, and forest regrowth is restricted by soil erosion and the presence of fire-resistant, exotic grasses. [...] In the southeast, an extended drought dating to 950 cal yr BP led to fires and transition of open grasslands. [...] The drought may also have pushed humans populations to rely more heavily on bushmeat. [...] Had humans not been present, the subfossil lemur populations might have adjusted to the new conditions and recovered. [...] Had the drought not reduced the population of the subfossil lemurs, the pressure from the small number of people living in the region at the <b>time</b> <b>might</b> not have been enough to cause the extinctions. [...] As in the past, all of the factors that {{have played a role in}} past extinctions are still present and active today. [...] As a result, the extinction event that claimed Madagascar's giant subfossil lemurs has not fully concluded.|$|E

500|$|An early {{difficulty}} was {{the implementation}} of texture mapping. Neurath had experimented unsuccessfully with the concept on an Apple II computer in the late 1980s, but {{he believed that the}} more powerful IBM PCs of the <b>time</b> <b>might</b> be able to process it. He contacted Lerner Research programmer Chris Green—an acquaintance from his past work with Ned Lerner—who created a working algorithm. Using the Space Rogue engine, Green's algorithm, assembly code from Lerner Research's Car and Driver and original programming, the Blue Sky team completed a prototype of Underworld after roughly a month of work. Neurath described the prototype as [...] "fast, smooth, and [...] true texture mapped walls, though the ceiling and floor were flat shaded and the corridors and rooms were all 10' [...] high—it looked a lot like Wolfenstein-3D in fact." [...] The team demonstrated it at the June 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and impressed Origin Systems. Origin producer Warren Spector later said, [...] "I remember Paul showing me that demo [...] at CES and being totally floored by it. None of us had ever seen anything like it." [...] The two companies reached a publishing agreement that summer, and Origin suggested that the game be reworked to fit into the Ultima universe. The team agreed, and the game was renamed Ultima Underworld. While Spector had hoped to produce the game, he was not assigned to the role; and he later said that he [...] "sort of watched [...] jealously from the sidelines." ...|$|E
