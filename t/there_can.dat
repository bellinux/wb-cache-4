5|$|And the {{impressive}} personal {{qualities of the}} Communist leaders, their seeming sincerity, and the coherence and logical nature of their program leads me, at least, toward general acceptance of the first explanation – that the Communists base their policy toward the Kuomintang on a real desire for democracy in China under which <b>there</b> <b>can</b> be orderly economic growth through a stage of private enterprise to eventual socialism without the need of violent social upheaval and revolution.|$|E

5|$|As in ski jumping, team {{competitions}} {{are often}} included at ski flying events. These are contested {{as part of}} the World Cup, but points instead count towards a separate Nations Cup for teams; athletes' individual World Cup standings are unaffected. A national team is made up of four athletes selected by their head coach. <b>There</b> <b>can</b> be upwards of eight teams from different countries, providing they are able to field a full team of four.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{is in the}} {{oceanic climate}} zone (Köppen: Cfb ). Its weather is subject to {{low-pressure}} systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, <b>there</b> <b>can</b> also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.|$|E
5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, <b>there</b> <b>can</b> be {{back problems}} within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes {{slip out of}} place, resulting in spinal disc herniation.

5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the boundaries between category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so <b>there</b> <b>can</b> be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E

5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic faith of Islam. He {{explained}} that their faith says that <b>there</b> <b>can</b> be only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar {{took an interest in}} Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E

5|$|The {{deflection}} {{of light}} by gravity {{is responsible for}} {{a new class of}} astronomical phenomena. If a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative distances, the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target. Such effects are known as gravitational lensing. Depending on the configuration, scale, and mass distribution, <b>there</b> <b>can</b> be two or more images, a bright ring known as an Einstein ring, or partial rings called arcs.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral {{upper respiratory tract}} infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and bronchitis the lungs. However, <b>there</b> <b>can</b> be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected. The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
