50|$|Detarium senegalense {{trees are}} {{propagated}} by stones {{which are often}} distributed by elephants and chimpanzees who consume the fruits (elephants and chimpanzees in Senegambia?). Germination occurs 6-10 weeks after propagation, though the germination rate is typically low. Although <b>tallow</b> <b>trees</b> are leguminous, they do not fix significant amounts of nitrogen. The Detarium senegalense tree has two phases of fructification. Trees generally lose their leaves {{at the beginning of}} March and experience a renewal of leaves a few weeks later. After young leaves have developed, flowering occurs. As the fruits ripen, they develop a sweeter flavour and increased vitamin C content. Fruits reach full maturation from August-November depending on the climate of the region they are growing in. Trees are drought tolerant and have the ability to grow on infertile sites as they are relatively insensitive to soil, altitude, heat, and humidity. Their wood has good resistance to termites, pinhole borers, and marine bores; however, the wood is susceptible to Lyctus attack.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Seeds were {{collected}} from locally and naturally grown Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>trees</b> (CTT) and characterized for general {{physical and chemical properties}} and fatty acid composition of the lipids. The effects of four different solvents (petroleum ether, hexane, diethyl ether, and 95 % ethanol) and two extraction methods (supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) and conventional Soxhlet) on the properties of the CTT seed oil, including Chinese vegetable tallow (CVT) and stillingia oil (SO), were also investigated. In general, the yields of CVT and SO did not vary based on solvent for Soxhlet extraction and solvent-free SC-CO 2 extraction, except that the yield of CVT from SC-CO 2 extraction was substantially lower. Nevertheless, the CTT seed oil, extracted by SC-CO 2 displayed better quality than those extracted by Soxhlet extraction in terms of color, residual precipitation, and acid value of the oils. The pretreatment of CTT seed by 3 % aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution likely promoted the hydrolysis o...|$|R

50|$|Detarium microcarpum (Ntamajalan), {{commonly}} known as sweet detar, sweet dattock or <b>tallow</b> <b>tree,</b> is an under-utilized tree legume that grows naturally in the drier regions of West and Central Africa. It is a multipurpose species, {{with a wide range}} of uses due to its medicinal properties, edible fruit (eaten raw, cooked or made into flour with many uses of its own) and hardwood used as fuel-wood.

50|$|In 1900, up to {{one million}} Attwater's prairie {{chickens}} inhabited the coastal grasslands. Loss of habitat {{is believed to be}} the prime reason for their decline. One of the major factors contributing to the habitat loss was the widespread planting, beginning in the early 1900s, of Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>trees</b> (Triadica sebifera) to establish a soapmaking industry. Since that time, T. sebifera has proven to be an aggressive invader of the coastal grasslands where it displaces the diverse native plant assemblage that was dominated by prairie grasses and forbs with dense near monospecific stands, that significantly alter biotic and abiotic ecosystem processes. Urbanization further contributes to habitat loss. As a result of these changes over the last 100 years, the entire grassland ecosystem where Attwaters's prairie chicken once thrived exists in small, scattered patches whose continued existence is threatened. Where once grazing Plains bison and periodic wildfires due to lightning reduced brush, the birds now have difficulty making their way through thick undergrowth. Other, less-apparent changes in the ecosystem possibly have had an effect, as well.|$|R

40|$|Airborne color-infrared {{photography}} (CIR) (1 : 12, 000 scale) {{was used}} to map localized occurrences of the widespread and aggressive Chinese tallow (Sapium sebiferum), an invasive species. Photography was collected during senescence when Chinese tallow's bright red leaves presented a high spectral contrast within the native bottomland hardwood and upland forests and marsh land-cover types. Mapped occurrences were conservative because not all senescing tallow leaves are bright red simultaneously. To simulate low spectral but high spatial resolution satellitelairborne image and digital video data, the CIR photography was transformed into raster images at spatial resolutions approximating 0. 5 m and 1. 0 m. The image data were then spectrally classified for the occurrence of bright red leaves associated with senescing Chinese tallow. Classification accuracies were greater than 95 percent at both spatial resolutions. There {{was no significant difference}} in either forest in the detection of tallow or inclusion of non-tallow trees associated with the two spatial resolutions. In marshes, slightly more tallow occurrences were mapped with the lower spatial resolution, but there were also more misclassifications of native land covers as tallow. Combining all land covers, there was no difference at detecting tallow occurrences (equal omission errors) between the two resolutions, but the higher spatial resolution was associated with less inclusion of non-tallow land covers as tallow (lower commission error). Overall, these results confirm that high spatial (51 m) but low spectral resolution remote sensing data can be used for mapping Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>trees</b> in dominant environments found in coastal and adjacent upland landscapes...|$|R
5000|$|D. microcarpum occurs {{naturally}} in the drier regions of West and Central Africa (Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan and Togo). Unlike the {{other species of}} its family, D. microcarpum grows in dry savanna, while Detarium senegalense grows in the dry forest, and Detarium macrocarpum grows in humid forest. Many different vernacular names exist for this species, including the English, sweet dattock or <b>tallow</b> <b>tree,</b> and the French, dankh or petit détar, as well as Abu-laili (in Sudan) or Tamba Dala (in Mali).|$|E
50|$|As aforementioned, the <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> is a {{non-native}} {{species to}} many {{places around the}} world. Its introduced status in North America along with the harm it causes to ecosystems makes the tree considered an invasive species there. Tallow trees present a danger of expansion that can hurt local ecosystems by out-competing native vegetation and creating a monoculture. The monoculture would then lower the species diversity and overall resilience of the area. The tree’s tenacious nature, high growth rates, and high reproductive ability contribute to its invasive success. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, tallow trees begin producing viable seed in as soon as three years. They can spread by root sprouts and cuttings and are quick to invade after a disturbance occurs in an area, due to the clearing out of land. A single <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> can produce nearly 100,000 viable seeds annually that can remain in the soil for several years before sprouting. A mature stand can produce 4,500 kilograms of seeds per hectare per year. These seeds are easily carried to different places by birds and water. Tallow trees can remain productive for 100 years. It is also extremely hard to kill—its poisonous features in its leaves and berries leave it with few to no predators, and its short generation time means even freshly cut trees can quickly regrow. Currently, herbicides and prescribed fire are the only effective treatments available to contain and control Chinese tallow.|$|E

50|$|On 3 March 1934 Queensland Holiday Resorts Limited, with 97 {{subscribers}} and 1880 allotted shares, was incorporated. A {{flying fox}} was erected soon afterwards using the engineering knowledge of Romeo Lahey and fellow director Lewis Day and Old Bill's previous {{experience in the}} coalmining valleys of New South Wales. It consisted of a huge wheel, the whim, laid horizontally {{at the top of}} the rise, pulled round by draughthorse to draw a heavy-duty cable on which baggage was strung for its ascent, about 150 metres. At night it was festooned with lanterns. The base of the flying fox was a large <b>tallow</b> wood <b>tree,</b> which is still extant, near the Mains Road toilet facilities, about 1.6 kilometres down the road from the lodge. The top pulley and loading/unloading point was right at the (now) concrete edging just west of recent barbecue facilities. A large eucalypt pointing north-west is thought to be the anchor for the top pulley. The flying fox operated until March 1947 when a road was completed to the lodge, largely by the efforts of Queensland Holiday Resorts Ltd after two years of discussion with the Main Roads Commission. The road became all weather in 1951 when it was taken over by the Main Roads Commission and it was laid with bitumen in 1969.|$|R
50|$|Although {{native to}} China and Japan, {{the plant is}} also found {{where it has been}} {{introduced}} in the southeastern United States, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Taiwan, India, Martinique, Sudan, and southern France. Incorrectly thought to have been introduced in colonial times by Benjamin Franklin, the tree has become naturalized from North Carolina southward along the Atlantic and the entire Gulf coast, where it grows profusely along ditchbanks and dikes. It grows especially well in open fields and abandoned farmland coastal prairie regions featuring disturbed ground—such as abandoned farmland, spoil banks, roadsides, and storm-damaged forests—and along the edges of the Western Gulf coastal grasslands biome, sometimes forming pure stands. In the Houston area, Chinese tallow trees account for a full 23 percent of all trees, more than any other tree species and is the only invasive tree species in the 14 most common species in the area. The Texas Department of Agriculture lists Chinese Tallow as one of the 24 most invasive plants, and includes Chinese Tallow in a list of Noxious and Invasive Plants which are illegal to sell, distribute or import into Texas. Herbivores and insects have a conditioned behavioral avoidance to eating the leaves of Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree,</b> and this, rather than plant toxins, may be a reason for the success of the plant as an invasive.|$|E
40|$|Introduced plant success {{often is}} {{attributed}} to release from natural enemies in their new ranges. However, herbivores may accumulate over time and reduce invasiveness but evidence for this process to date is weak. We report here that enemy release is indeed limited to {{the early stages of}} introduction of the Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> (Sapium sebiferum). In bioassays and gardens along a geographical gradient of time since <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> introduction, herbivory was highest and tree performance was poorest where <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> has been present longer (i. e. introduced earlier). Additionally, Asian ecotypes (grown from seeds collected in Asia) had lower survival than North American ecotypes (seeds collected in North America), which is consistent with genetic responses to low herbivory in the introduced range (EICA Hypothesis). Release from insect herbivores appears to contribute to early success of the <b>tallow</b> <b>tree,</b> but accumulation of insect herbivores has apparently reduced this benefit over time...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} flooding adaptation {{mechanisms of}} baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) and Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> (Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb.), we designed field experiments {{to examine the}} changes of morphology, growth, aerenchyma formation, porosity and root O 2 consumption of one-year-old seedlings of both species. Both trees {{were divided into two}} groups. One group was not flooded (NF, soil water content was 75 % of field capacity), while the other group was treated with flooding (FL, water level was 5 cm above soil surface) for 95 days. We found that flooding inhibited growth of both baldcypress and Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree,</b> and biomass increment of baldcypress and Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> under FL decreased 36. 4 % and 74. 5 %, respectively, indicating that baldcypress was more tolerant to flooding. Root/shoot ratio of the two tree species increased significantly under flooding, which was primarily due to the decrease of stem and leaf biomass. Flooding also stimulated aerenchyma formation in the roots (lateral and adventitious), stems and leaves of baldcypress and roots of Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree.</b> Porosity in the roots, stems and leaves of the two tree species increased significantly under flooding. The aerenchyma formation and increased porosity enhanced O 2 diffusion to the roots. Our results indicate that baldcypress and Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> exhibit a number of adaptive mechanisms in response to flooding, including formation of adventitious roots and new lateral ones, aerenchyma formation, increased porosity of the roots, stems and leaves, and increased O 2 release into the rhizosphere...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{success of}} exotic plants {{may be due}} to lower {{herbivore}} loads than those on native plants (Enemies Release Hypothesis). Predictions of this hypothesis include lower herbivore abundances, diversity, and damage on introduced plant species compared to native ones. Greater density or diversity of predators and parasitoids on exotic versus native plants may also reduce regulation of exotic plants by herbivores. To test these predictions, we measured arthropod abundance, arthropod diversity, and foliar dam-age on invasive Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> (Triadica sebifera) and three native tree species: silver maple (Acer saccharinum), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and sweetgum (Liquid-ambar styraciflua). Arthropod samples were collected with canopy sweep nets from six 20 year old monoculture plots of each species at a southeast Texas site. A total of 2, 700 individuals and 285 species of arthropods were caught. Overall, the species richness and abundance of arthropods on <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> were similar to the natives. But, ordination (NMS) showed community composition differed on <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> compared to all three native trees. It supported an arthropod community that had relatively lower herbivore abundance but relatively more predator species compared to the native species examined. Leaves were collected to determine damage. <b>Tallow</b> <b>tree</b> experienced less mining damage than native trees. The results of this study supported the Enemies Release Hypothesis predictions that <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> would have low herbivore loads which may contribute to its invasive success. Moreover, a shift in the arthropod com-munity to fewer herbivores without a reduction in predators may further limit regulation of this exotic species by her-bivores in its introduced range...|$|E

At depths of as little as 5 cm, Sapium mulch damped soil temperature fluctuations and reduced seedling emergence. Reduced seedling emergence was not the result of allelopathic compounds in Sapium mulch because other mulch types suppressed emergence similarly.

A conversion yield higher than 96 % was achieved by using a lower catalyst amount (1 % w/w of oil) with a lower molar ratio of methanol/oil (12 : 1) in a relatively shorter reaction time (10  min) at 60 °C [126]. The transesterification of high FFA jatropha curcas oil was carried out using microwave irradiation with homogenous catalyst.

The increasingly scarcity of wood resources enables us to consider all possible methods of utilizing bark residue as raw material. Many studies have investigated bark utilization [9, 10]. Alma and Yoshioka [11] studied the phenolation of bark from several species in the presence of sulfuric acid, and then used this liquefaction method to prepare novolak resin-type molding materials.

Tallow trees are mainly distributed in the western Gulf section of coastal plains and flatwoods (16. 4 %), the western section of mid-coastal plains (5. 2 %) and the Atlantic coastal flatwoods section (4. 2 %), where oak-gum-cypress, elm-ash-cottonwood, oak-pine and pine (loblolly pine/shortleaf pine) forests dominate.

To that end, we seek to determine {{factors that contribute to}} the spread of Chinese tallow using classification and regression tree (CART) and logistic regression. We also attempt to identify current locations and spread rates across eastern Texas using Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data within major forest types. Distance to formerly infested plots and roads, slope, and disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) were identified as major (either facilitating or impeding) factors for the spread of Chinese tallow across the landscape. The highest probability of occurrence and spread rate of Chinese tallow were found in the oak/ gum/cypress forest type. Continued disturbance, from harvest events or natural disasters will allow the species to continue to spread throughout the region and could threaten overall forest productivity.

40|$|The rate of new exotic {{recruitment}} following {{removal of}} adult invaders (reinvasion pressure) influences restoration outcomes and costs but is highly variable and poorly understood. We hypothesize that broad variation in average reinvasion pressure of Triadica sebifera (Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree,</b> a major invader) arises from differences among habitats in spatiotemporal availability of realized recruitment windows. These windows are periods of variable duration {{long enough to}} permit establishment given local environmental conditions. We tested this hypothesis via a greenhouse mesocosm experiment that quantified how the duration of favorable moisture conditions prior to flood or drought stress (window duration), competition and nutrient availability influenced Triadica success in high stress environments. Window duration influenced pre-stress seedling abundance and size, growth during stress and final abundance; it interacted with other factors to affect final biomass and germination during stress. Stress type and competition impacted final size and biomass, plus germination, mortality and changes in size during stress. Final abundance also depended on competition and the interaction of window duration, stress type and competition. Fertilization interacted with competition and stress to influence biomass and changes in height, respectively, but did not affect Triadica abundance. Overall, longer window durations promoted Triadica establishment, competition and drought (relative to flood) suppressed establishment, and fertilization had weak effects. Interactions among factors frequently produced different effects in specific contexts. Result...|$|E
40|$|The Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} exotic plants may become superior competitors in their introduced ranges {{because they have}} evolved reduced defense allocation and increased growth in response to low herbivory. Long-term common garden studies with Chinese <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> (Sapium sebiferum), a problematic invader in the southeastern United States, support EICA predictions of invasive ecotypes displaying rapid growth with poorly defended leaves, whereas native ecotypes are slower growing and have nitrogen rich, highly defended leaves. We conducted two full-factorial experi-ments designed to assess the effects of leaf herbivory and soil fertility on growth of Sapium seedlings derived from seeds obtained in the species ’ native Chinese range and introduced range along the Texas Gulf Coast. The first was a field study employing simulated defoliation to examine herbivory tolerance, while the second was a pot study using grasshopper bioassays to measure the compensatory regrowth of native and intro-duced Sapium ecotypes. In accordance with EICA predictions, introduced Texas ecotypes compensated for mechanical and natural defoliation regardless of resource conditions while growth of native Chinese eco-types was significantly reduced {{as a result of}} both simulated and natural herbivory damage. These results demonstrate that invasive Sapium ecotypes have a greater capacity to compensate for herbivory damage than native Sapium ecotypes.

In this study, the first comprehensive transcriptome of S. sebiferum flower has been generated by sequencing and de novo assembly. A total of 149, 342 unigenes were generated from raw reads, of which 24, 289 unigenes were successfully matched to public database. A total of 61 MADS box genes and putative pathways involved in S. sebiferum flower development have been identified. Abiotic stress response network was also constructed in this work, where 2, 686 unigenes {{are involved in the}} pathway. As for lipid biosynthesis, 161 unigenes have been identified in fatty acid (FA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis. Besides, the G-Quadruplexes in RNA of S. sebiferum also have been predicted. An interesting finding is that the stress-induced flowering was observed in S. sebiferum for the first time. According to the results of semi-quantitative PCR, expression tendencies of flowering-related genes, GA 1, AP 2 and CRY 2, accorded with stress-related genes, such as GRX 50435 and PRXⅡ 39562. This transcriptome provides functional genomic information for further research of S. sebiferum, especially for the genetic engineering to shorten the juvenile period and improve yield by regulating flower development. It also offers a useful database for the research of other Euphorbiaceae family plants...|$|E
