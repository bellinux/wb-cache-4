The system {{was designed to}} answer user’s query of bilingual collocational usage for nouns, verbs and adjectives. We first obtained collocations from the large monolingual British National Corpus (BNC). Subsequently, we identified collocation instances and translation counterparts in the bilingual corpus such as Sinorama Parallel Corpus (SPC) by exploiting the word-alignment technique. The main goal of <b>the</b> <b>concordancer</b> <b>is</b> to provide <b>the</b> user with a reference tools for correct collocation use so as to assist second language learners to acquire the most eminent characteristic of native-like writing. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{the issues}} of {{receptive}} and productive vocabulary knowledge have been discussed in many vocabulary studies, language learners and practitioners have also tried to reduce {{the discrepancy between the}} two types of vocabulary knowledge. At the same time, with the development of new technology of the Internet, web based concordancers became easily accessible for the language learners. However, there has been little research on investigating the effect of <b>the</b> <b>concordancer</b> with empirical data. The current research, therefore, explores the effects of the concordanccer, an application of the corpus-based language instruction, on ESL learners’ productive vocabulary knowledge. Korean undergraduate students at an American public university were recruited, randomly assigned to an experimental group (concordancer group, n= 10) or a control group (thesaurus group, n= 11) for a series of writing practice, and their vocabulary errors in writing samples were statistically compared. The results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>concordancer</b> <b>is</b> an effective vocabulary reference and learning tool, and it is more effective in improving grammar knowledge of vocabulary than the lexical knowledge. The discussion includes suggestions for the future research of corpus-based language learning in assessing ESL productive vocabulary knowledge. clos...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{the use of}} {{parallel}} <b>concordancers</b> in <b>the</b> classroom has been a largely unexplored area. As a result, there are few guidelines {{on the design of}} these tools or the functions they should offer. Also, the number of fully-developed parallel concordance tools is surprisingly few, and most of these are designed for use by corpus linguists and translators. In this paper, we describe a novel, web-based, parallel concordancer designed specifically for use by beginner-level second and foreign language learners of English. The software is built using standard web application tools, such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, and thus can run in most university server environments. It is also designed on a similar architecture to the Google search engine, allowing it to work comfortably on very large corpora of hundreds of millions of words. To enable the smooth processing of both English and non-English texts, <b>the</b> <b>concordancer</b> <b>is</b> built to Unicode standards. Its internal token definition settings also employ Unicode character classes meaning that no cumbersome user-defined settings are necessary. Preliminary results show that the new software is considerably faster and easier to use than standard desktop parallel concordance programs. Also, because the tool is web-based, it can be accessed outside of class time, thus allowing students more time for hypothesis-verification and production activities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the use of web-based {{discourse}} by three Spanish undergraduate students in Computer Engineering. Key lexico-grammatical features in Computer English have been analysed by means of corpus linguistics techniques, for which word statistics and collocation functions in <b>the</b> WordSmith <b>concordancer</b> have <b>been</b> highly useful. The information was then used to compare the students' results. The students' reading skills have been evaluated in the documentation process of the three final projects, required prior to their graduation as engineers. Overall observations point to code-switching, re-wording, and key vocabulary identification as strategies that the students demonstrate to be able to operate with significantly after on-line reading. The students also rely more on Internet discourse as a main source of feedback for their projects and useful tool for work. Two of the projects have dealt with the design and use of interactive platforms for language learning (via two different approaches), while the third project has focused on the management of e-learning with the use of Squeak, a special language for programming.

40|$|Concordancing {{is a way}} of {{handling}} a collection of texts in order to process it in linguistic terms. The progress of corpus studies shed light on the formation of electronic (computerised) text analysis and along with it: on concordancing. The growing need for new tools and devices didn’t have to wait for long, the quick spread and development of computer systems and networks made it possible even for an everyday user to reach larger corpora {{with the help of a}} single personal computer or laptop. This opened a new chapter in the study of computational linguistics. Today, there is a huge number of <b>concordancers</b> on <b>the</b> market with a spectrum of functions (besides basic functions), but there is a developing need to enhance the functionality of these programmes (in textual, statistic and design terms), mainly because of the continuously growing use of concordances in classrooms.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the degree to which nursing {{students}} in a health science college acquired technical English vocabulary based on a comparison of vocabulary data that appeared in their essays describing what they learned from the English I course over the semester and in two English textbooks. Methods: Based on the concept of corpus linguistics, a computer <b>concordancer</b> program <b>was</b> utilized for word-frequency analysis based on a word list, or 'concordance', which <b>the</b> <b>concordancer</b> produced from <b>the</b> digitalized data from two English textbooks and original essays from 70 students. Furthermore, the extracted words were compared based on the following three categories: 'content words', 'function words', and 'nursing and health care-related words'. Results: The students applied 54 % ofthe nursing and health care-related terms learned from the two textbooks. It appears that the students applied more technical terms from the reading textbook than from the conversation textbook (28 %of from the reading textbook; 14 % from the conversation textbook). In particular, the terms 'nurse' and 'patient' were among the three most frequently used nursing and health care-relatPronouns, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions were the most important function words for producing English sentence structures as indicated by their presence in the top ten lists for the three corpora. Conclusions: From this study, it appears that reading textbooks enrich students' vocabulary more than conversation textbooks as reading textbooks provide a larger volume of vocabulary than a conversational discourse in conversation textbooks. This study on vocabulary acquisition might offer educators some insights into the pedagogy of specific terminology in English for a specific purpose. 目的:本研究は,医療系大学看護学専攻学生の専門英単語の習得度とその特徴を調査することであり, 2 冊の英語教科書と「 1 学期間で英語Iから学んだ事」に関する学生のエッセイに使われた語彙数の比較データを基に実施した. 方法:コーパス言語学に基づき,コンコーダンサープログラムを用い,電子化された 2 冊の英語教科書と 70 名の学生エッセイから各語彙分析表を検出し,この語彙頻度を伴って現れる 3 つのコーパスを内容語・機能語・看護医療系語彙の観点から分析した. 結果:学生は 2 冊の教科書から看護医療系語彙の 54 %を使用し,会話用教科書の語彙数より読解用からの語彙を多く使用した(40 %: 26 %). 語彙の'nurse'と'patient'が内容語分類の看護医療系語彙リストの中で上位 3 位内の共通語彙として検出された. 代名詞,冠詞,前置詞,接続詞が英文構成上最重要で上位 10 位内から共通に検出された. 結論:本研究から,読解用教科書の方が会話用より学生の習得語彙の種類をより豊かにする可能性があり,これは会話体より多い語彙量を提供する故であると考えられる. 語彙習得調査は,教育者に専門語彙教授法の洞察を提供する. 原...|$|R
