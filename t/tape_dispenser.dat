25|$|A <b>tape</b> <b>dispenser</b> holds {{a roll of}} {{tape and}} has a {{mechanism}} on one end to easily shear the tape. Dispensers vary widely based on the tape they dispense. Clear tape dispensers are commonly made of plastic, and may be disposable. Other dispensers are stationary and may have sophisticated features to control tape usage and improve ergonomics. The first <b>tape</b> <b>dispenser</b> with a built-in cutting edge was invented in 1932 by John A. Borden, another 3M employee.|$|E

2500|$|Practical {{application}} of ultrasonic welding for rigid plastics {{was completed in}} the 1960s. [...] At this point only hard plastics could be welded. [...] The patent for the ultrasonic method for welding rigid thermoplastic parts was awarded to Robert Soloff and Seymour Linsley in 1965. [...] Soloff, the founder of Sonics & Materials Inc., was a lab manager at Branson Instruments where thin plastic films were welded into bags and tubes using ultrasonic probes. [...] He unintentionally moved the probe close to a plastic <b>tape</b> <b>dispenser</b> and the halves of the dispenser welded together. [...] He realized that the probe {{did not need to}} be manually moved around the part but that the ultrasonic energy could travel through and around rigid plastics and weld an entire joint. He went on to develop the first ultrasonic press. [...] The first {{application of}} this new technology was in the toy industry.|$|E
5000|$|Gummed (water activated) <b>tape</b> <b>dispensers</b> measure, dispense, moisten, and cut gummed or water-activated {{adhesive}} tape. This tape {{is often}} {{composed of a}} paper backing and adhesive glue that is unable to adhere until it is [...] "activated" [...] by contact with water. To perform this step, gummed dispensers often employ a water bottle and wetting brush to moisten each piece of tape as it is dispensed. Many gummed dispensers feature a heater, which is mounted over the feed area to maintain the dispenserâ€™s water temperature. These heaters ensure maximum wetting, and are ideal in cold climates. Gummed <b>tape</b> <b>dispensers</b> are often used in packaging or shipping departments for closing corrugated boxes.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of the <b>tape</b> <b>dispenser,</b> 3M's standard clear scotch tape was sold as a roll, and had to be carefully peeled from the end and cut with scissors. To make the product more useful, the scotch tape sales manager at 3M, John Borden, designed the first <b>tape</b> <b>dispenser</b> in 1932, which had a built-in cutting mechanism and would hold the cut end of the tape until its next use.|$|E
50|$|Tabletop {{dispensers}} {{are available}} with electrical assists to dispense and cut pressure-sensitive tape to a predetermined length. They are often used in an industrial setting to increase productivity along manufacturing or assembly lines. They eliminate the need to manually measure and cut each individual piece of tape on high volumes of product or packaging. By automating this process, automatic <b>tape</b> <b>dispensers</b> reduce material waste caused by human error. They also reduce {{the time needed to}} cut each piece of tape, therefore reducing labor costs and increasing productivity.|$|R
50|$|In the 2000s, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Peter Koreska, Kores International Product Management began innovating a growing number of products such as Scooter and 2Way correction tapes, Neon coloured glue sticks, Bright Liner highlighters and Desk Pot and Design Line adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>dispensers.</b> Kores also introduced one of the largest ranges of coloured index notes for bookmarking and referencing. In 2009, the Kolores range of coloring pencils were launched worldwide as Kores expanded into school products. Kolores coloured pencils are known for their soft application, vivid colours and clean sharpening. Following the success of Kolores, Kores launched wax crayons, felt tip pens, pencils and sharpeners.|$|R
50|$|Long before {{electronics}} became common, mechanical {{devices were}} used to count events. These are known as tally counters. They typically consist {{of a series of}} disks mounted on an axle, with the digits 0 through 9 marked on their edge. The right most disk moves one increment with each event. Each disk except the left-most has a protrusion that, after the completion of one revolution, moves the next disk to the left one increment. Such counters were used as odometers for bicycles and cars and in <b>tape</b> recorders, fuel <b>dispensers,</b> in production machinery as well as in other machinery. One of the largest manufacturers was the Veeder-Root company, and their name was often used for this type of counter.|$|R

40|$|Current {{solutions}} for industrial manufacturing assembly systems do not suit {{the needs of}} mass customization industry, which is facing low production volumes, many variants and rapidly changing conditions. This technical report explains in detail the concept of Self-Organising Evolvable Assembly Systems, where assembly system modules and product parts to be assembled self-organise and self-adapt (among others, choose their coalition partners, their location and monitor themselves) in order to easily and quickly produce a new or reconfigured assembly system each time a new product order arrives or each time a failure or weakness arises in the current assembly system. This report presents in detail the design of such a system following an architecture for self-organising and self-adaptive systems based on policies enforced at run-time {{on the basis of}} collected and updated metadata. As a case study, the assembly of a adhesive <b>tape</b> roller <b>dispenser</b> is considered. 1 Challenges in manufacturing In the era of mass production, companies needed optimal solutions to produce large quantities of an identical product as fast and as cheap as possible; it was worth paying the big investments for custom-made installations, which would be disposed of once the product is out of production. In the best case some of the equipment could be reused but needed manual re-programming. Any change, even small, in the product design or any failur...|$|R

5000|$|Current body {{cameras are}} much lighter and {{smaller than the}} first {{experiments}} with wearable cameras. There are several types of body cameras made by several different companies. Each camera basically serves the same purpose, yet some function in slightly different ways than others. Some {{are meant to be}} mounted on oneâ€™s chest or shoulder while others can work as an attachment to glasses or may be worn in a function similar to a headband or on a helmet. As far as sizing goes, [...] "most are roughly the size of a Scotch <b>Tape</b> <b>dispenser</b> and weigh anywhere from about 2 ounces (55 grams) to 5 ounces (140 grams). That's somewhere between a large strawberry and a lemon." [...] These lightweight cameras are designed to be worn comfortably.|$|E

5000|$|In a rage, Mike chases Barry. The two fight {{briefly and}} Mike kills Barry with a <b>tape</b> <b>dispenser.</b> The {{building}} is then unsealed, {{as he is}} the last survivor, and the soldiers escort him to the hangar next door. There, he meets {{the owner of the}} voice (Gregg Henry), who introduces himself as a social scientist who believes that discoveries about human nature can only come from placing people in extreme environments. As he and his colleagues begin to ask Mike about his emotional and mental state, Mike notices a panel of switches that correspond to the eighty employees. Having planted Marty's trackers on the soldiers and the voice, he charges across the room and flips every switch except his own. The trackers explode, killing the soldiers. Mike picks up a gun and kills the other scientists before killing the injured Voice, then leaves the warehouse in a state of shock. The view zooms out to reveal that Mike is one of hundreds of sole survivors from similar experiments, being watched by another group through security cameras. A new voice states that [...] "stage one is complete" [...] and [...] "stage two will now commence." ...|$|E
40|$|In today's rapidly {{changing}} marketplace, product demand {{is one of}} the most powerful driving forces behind design, thus rendering product conceptualization full of challenges. As a port can be defined as the point of action between a component and its environment, it plays a crucial role in capturing component concepts and realizing conceptual design. This paper presents a convenient approach to representation of the intended exchange of signals, energy, and/or materials and the generation and management of port-based knowledge (PBK). A port-based ontology modeling (PBOM) process that supports product conceptualization is described. A port definition and port functional representation are provided first with their semantic synthesis then employed to describe a port ontology. Second, details of the construction of a port-based ontology (PBO) repository that contains the assorted primitive functions, similarity calculations, and primitive concepts needed to map component connections and interactions are provided. The hierarchical attributes and taxonomy of ports are established, and the compatibility rules are then used to determine the connectability of two components. Next, the PBOM process is presented and a port-based, multi-view model is articulated, with the definition of each view and the projected relationships among the views given. Furthermore, a port-based ontology language (PBOL) that represents the process of port ontology refinement is presented, and a port-based functionâ€“behaviorâ€“structure (FBS) modeling framework is constructed for primitive system configuration. Finally, the results of a correction <b>tape</b> <b>dispenser</b> case study carried out to validate the efficiency of the port ontology for product conceptualization are presented.
