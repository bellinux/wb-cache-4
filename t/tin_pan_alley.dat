5|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley</b> was an {{area called}} Union Square in New York City, {{which became the}} major center for music {{publishing}} by the mid-1890s. The songwriters of this era wrote formulaic songs, many of them sentimental ballads. During this era, a sense of national consciousness was developing, as the United States became a formidable world power, especially after the Spanish–American War. The increased availability and efficiency of railroads and the postal service helped disseminate ideas, including popular songs.|$|E
5|$|Like the extravaganza and the burlesque, {{the variety}} {{show was a}} comic and ribald production, popular from the middle {{to the end of}} the 19th century, at which time it had evolved into vaudeville. This form was innovated by {{producers}} like Tony Pastor who tried to encourage women and children to attend his shows; they were hesitant because the theater had long been the domain of a rough and disorderly crowd. By the early 20th century, vaudeville was a respected entertainment for women and children, and songwriters like Gus Edwards wrote songs that were popular across the country. The most popular vaudeville shows were, like the Ziegfeld Follies, a series of songs and skits that had a profound effect on the subsequent development of Broadway musical theater and the songs of <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley.</b>|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} rise of popular sheet music in the early 20th century, New York's Broadway musical theater and <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley's</b> songcraft, New York became a major center for the American music industry.

5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet Me in the Land of Grapico. Meet Me in the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley</b> that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{classical}} music scene included Charles Griffes, originally from Elmira, New York, who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley</b> and the Broadway theatres, and his works were {{strongly influenced by}} jazz, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin's work made American {{classical music}} more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. Later, {{he turned to the}} ballet and then serial music. Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance, producing music in a uniquely American style, though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Though jazz {{had long}} since {{achieved}} some limited popularity, it was Louis Armstrong who {{became one of the}} first popular stars and a major force in the development of jazz, along with his friend pianist Earl Hines. Armstrong, Hines, and their colleagues were improvisers, capable of creating numerous variations on a single melody. Armstrong also popularized scat singing, an improvisational vocal technique in which nonsensical syllables (vocables) are sung. Armstrong and Hines were influential in the rise of a kind of pop big band jazz called swing. Swing is characterized by a strong rhythm section, usually consisting of double bass and drums, medium to fast tempo, and rhythmic devices like the swung note, which is common to most jazz. Swing is primarily a fusion of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley.</b> Swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz, leading to bandleaders tightly arranging the material which discouraged improvisation, previously an integral part of jazz. Swing became a major part of African American dance, and came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the swing dance.|$|E
5000|$|... "After the Ball" [...] {{became the}} most {{successful}} song of its era, which {{at that time was}} gauged by the sales of sheet music. In 1892, it sold over two million copies of sheet music. Its total sheet music sales exceed five million copies, making it the best seller in <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley's</b> history. [...] It exemplifies the sentimental ballads published before 1920, whose topics were frequently babies, separation, and death.|$|R

He looks better than ever (somehow his stature has been built up although the faintest suggestion of embonpoint doesn’t quite jell with a Princeton undergrad), but he acts intelligently and sings those tunes. The songs will be no small asset to the film. There are three outstanders, two by Revel and Gordon—‘Straight from the Shoulder (Right from the Heart),’ and ‘I’m Hummin’, (I’m Singin’, I’m Whistlin’) and one by Robin and Rainger (‘Love in Bloom’) — and the latter is the smash hit of the flicker and currently <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley’s</b> No. 1 song, so it’s easy {{to figure out the}} b.o. reaction." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{music of}} New York City is a diverse and {{important}} {{field in the}} world of music. It has long been a thriving home for popular genres such as jazz, rock, and the blues, as well as classical and art music. It is the birthplace of hip hop, freestyle, doo wop, bebop, disco, punk rock, and new wave. It's also the birthplace of salsa music, born from a fusion of Cuban and Puerto Rican influences that came together in New York's Latino neighborhoods in the 1960s. The city's culture, a melting pot of nations from around the world, has produced vital folk music scenes such as Irish-American music and Jewish klezmer. Beginning with the rise of popular sheet music in the early 20th century, New York's Broadway musical theater, and <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley's</b> songcraft, New York has been {{a major part of the}} American music industry.|$|R
25|$|The {{start of}} <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley</b> is usually dated to about 1885, when {{a number of}} music {{publishers}} {{set up shop in}} the same district of Manhattan. The end of <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley</b> is less clear cut. Some date it {{to the start of the}} Great Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph, radio, and motion pictures supplanted sheet music as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider that <b>Tin</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>Alley</b> continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of American popular music were upstaged by the rise of rock & roll, which was centered on the Brill Building.|$|E
