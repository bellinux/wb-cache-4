5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
5|$|Mold {{continued}} to have his supporters. MacLaren later wrote that he believed Mold never intentionally threw; A. N. Hornby consistently defended Mold, partly because, as Mold's captain during the 1890s, {{it would have been}} a slur against his sportsmanship to admit that an unfair bowler had been in his team. Most Lancashire supporters never doubted that Mold's action was fair. Cricket historian Don Ambrose suggests that Mold probably did throw his faster delivery, which may have accounted for the high proportion of his wickets which were bowled. It also explained his ability to produce a delivery that surprised the batsman; W. G. Grace once observed that it was particularly painful to be struck by a delivery from Mold. The lack of action by Phillips' fellow umpires was possibly, according to Ambrose, due to their unwillingness to cause problems for a fellow professional cricketer. However, Ambrose also suggests that in the Somerset match, Phillips was determined to end Mold's career and <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> delivery that he called was actually a throw.|$|E

25|$|In any {{discretised}} wavelet transform, {{there are}} only a finite number of wavelet coefficients for each bounded rectangular region in the upper halfplane. Still, each coefficient requires the evaluation of an integral. In special situations this numerical complexity can be avoided if the scaled and shifted wavelets form a multiresolution analysis. This means that there has to exist an auxiliary function, the father wavelet φ in L2(R), and that a is an integer. A typical choice is a = 2 and b = 1. The most famous pair of father and mother wavelets is the Daubechies 4-tap wavelet. Note <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> orthonormal discrete wavelet basis can be associated to a multiresolution analysis; for example, the Journe wavelet admits no multiresolution analysis.|$|E
25|$|The proper policy, in my view, {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean we deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> effort has yet been made.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, {{incidents}} {{of police brutality}} in Germany appear {{to be caused by}} racism and xenophobic attitudes towards foreign nationals, and occurs predominantly during arrests and in custody. Whilst Germany may be sensitive towards its history in implementing policing practices, this hasn't appeared to stop international bodies from identifying a clear pattern of police ill-treatment to foreigners and members of ethnic minorities. Every year, around 2,000 complaints of police brutality are reported, with the figure most likely being a less than accurate representation given <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> incident is reported. As high profile cases like the Cologne New Years Eve incident become more prevalent, racist and xenophobic attitudes have been reflected in instances of police brutality. Whilst this incident occurred in 2014, high profile cases of police brutality have been reported to occur {{as far back as the}} 1990s.|$|E

25|$|To {{counter the}} virus' use of {{pseudorandom}} domain names, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and several TLD registries began in February 2009 a coordinated barring of transfers and registrations for these domains. Variant D counters this by generating daily {{a pool of}} 50,000 domains across 110 TLDs, from which it randomly chooses 500 to attempt for that day. The generated domain names were also shortened from 8–11 to 4–9 characters {{to make them more}} difficult to detect with heuristics. This new pull mechanism (which was disabled until April 1, 2009) is unlikely to propagate payloads to more than 1% of infected hosts per day, but is expected to function as a seeding mechanism for the virus' peer-to-peer network. The shorter generated names, however, are expected to collide with 150–200 existing domains per day, potentially causing a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) on sites serving those domains. However the large number of generated domains and the fact <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> domain will be contacted for a given day will probably prevent DDoS situations.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the school's life, 95% of {{the student}} body was Hispanic and African-American. Of the GISD school zones, Alamo had the second highest {{population}} of Hispanic students, after Burnet Elementary School. A demographer said that, between March and October 2007, the Alamo school zone was the only area in Galveston that gained children. As of March 2007, almost 500 students resided in the Alamo zone. This is a higher number than the numbers residing in the Rosenberg, Morgan, and San Jacinto zones. Some critics of the school district said that this proves that GISD closed the wrong school. Lynne Cleveland, the superintendent, argued that the correct school closed because Alamo had the fewest students of any school, showing <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> student living in the zone went to that school. Cleveland said that it was not feasible for GISD to continue staffing such a small school. Between 2001 and 2007 all GISD elementary schools had population decreases. Alamo's population fell by 90 students, making up 16% of the district population. Alamo lost fewer students than other schools.|$|E
25|$|Although from {{a modern}} {{perspective}} the vase painters are often considered as artists, and their vases thus as works of art, {{this view is}} not consistent with that held in antiquity. Vase painters, like potters, were considered as craftsmen, their produce as trade goods. The craftsmen {{must have had a}} reasonably high level of education, as a variety of inscriptions occur. On the one hand, the aforementioned Kalos inscriptions are common, on the other hand, inscriptions often label the depicted figures. <b>That</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> vase painter could write is shown by some examples of meaningless rows of random letters. The vases indicate a steady improvement of literacy from the 6th century BC onwards. Whether potters, and perhaps vase painters, belonged to the Attic elite has not been satisfactorily clarified so far. Do the frequent depictions of the symposium, a definite upper-class activity, reflect the painters' personal experience, their aspirations to attend such events, or simply the demands of the market? A large proportion of the painted vases produced, such as psykter, krater, kalpis, stamnos, as well as kylikes and kantharoi, were made and bought to be used at symposia.|$|E

500|$|The {{questions}} of what defines film noir, {{and what sort}} of category it is, provoke continuing debate. [...] "We'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel"—this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics Raymond Borde and Étienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book Panorama du film noir américain 1941–1953 (A Panorama of American Film Noir), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject. They emphasize <b>that</b> <b>not</b> <b>every</b> film noir embodies all five attributes in equal measure—one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal. The authors' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship: in the more than five decades since, there have been innumerable further attempts at definition, yet in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an [...] "elusive phenomenon always just out of reach".|$|E
