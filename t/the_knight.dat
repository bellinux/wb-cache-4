5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and <b>The</b> <b>Knight</b> of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight {{as to whether or not}} he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in <b>The</b> <b>Knight</b> of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format. The player assumes {{the role of a}} knight who enters the plague-infested village of Nightshade to vanquish four demons who reside within. Additionally, all residents from the village have been transformed into vampires and other supernatural creatures. Contact with these monsters infects <b>the</b> <b>knight,</b> with repeated contact turning the character from white to yellow and then to green, which will lead to the character's death. <b>The</b> <b>knight</b> may be hit up to three times by an enemy, however the fourth hit will result in a life being deducted.|$|E
5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head and, {{before he can}} replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle {{to stave off the}} advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and <b>The</b> <b>Knight</b> of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom <b>the</b> <b>knight</b> owes respect, and <b>the</b> <b>knight</b> is tested {{to see whether or not}} he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> of Labor grew explosively {{during the}} 1880s, and <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> raided FOOTALU locals {{and set up}} rival unions. <b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> of Labor sought to {{incorporate}} craft unions into <b>the</b> <b>Knights.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> of Columbus is {{a member}} of the International Alliance of Catholic Knights, which {{includes}} fifteen fraternal orders such as <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Saint Columbanus in ], <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Saint Columba in the United Kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Peter Claver in the United States, <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of <b>the</b> Southern Cross in Australia and New Zealand, <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Marshall in Ghana, <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Da Gama in South Africa, and <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Saint Mulumba in Nigeria.

5|$|Alain Magnan {{returns from}} the Lake and orders Morgan to execute his native allies and Sahin as heathens, but Sahin and Lizzie {{convince}} Morgan that Alain is actually {{the leader of the}} Circle of Ossus. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>knight,</b> the Turk, and the pirate decide to work together to destroy the Fountain of Youth and stop the Circle's plans for domination of the New World permanently.|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because such tactics left <b>the</b> <b>knight</b> unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become a thing of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E
5|$|Each {{circle is}} {{supervised}} by a Knights of Columbus council or assembly, {{and has an}} advisory board made up of either the Grand Knight, the Deputy Grand Knight and Chaplain, or the Faithful Navigator, the Faithful Captain, and Faithful Friar. Circles are either council based, parish based, or school based, depending on {{the location of the}} circle and <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> counselors.|$|E
50|$|John {{was also}} a {{trustworthy}} member of numerous fraternal orders including <b>the</b> National <b>Knight</b> Recorder of <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Friendship, Endowment secretary of <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Tabor and member of <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Orient.

50|$|<b>The</b> New England <b>Knights</b> are a {{minor league}} {{football}} team in the North American Football League NAFL. The team was founded in 2000 by Marvin Tillman as <b>the</b> Bridgeport <b>Knights.</b> In their inaugural season <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> made <b>the</b> playoffs eventually losing to the Harlem Hurricanes by 1 point. In 2001 <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> achieved their goal of winning a Championship by defeating the Connecticut Giants and securing the N.E.F.A. crown. 2002 saw <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> go undefeated until losing in the Championship game to the New Jersey Terminators. <b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> went undefeated in 2003 & 2004 winning 2 more N.E.F.A. Championships. In 2004 <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> were invited {{to play in the}} 1st ever North/South Challenge bowl held in Homestead, Florida. <b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> brought their 1st ever National Championship to Connecticut by defeating the Florida Kings 34-17. In 2005 <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> moved to <b>the</b> G.S.F.L. and continued their streak of making <b>the</b> playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> were again invited to play in the North/South Challenge Bowl and again responded with a victory. In 2006 <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> were purchased by Steven Fleischman and John Anastasio.

5|$|Except for {{any move}} of <b>the</b> <b>knight</b> and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Mayhew was knighted by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, {{receiving}} <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> {{fourth class}} of the Military William Order.

5|$|In February 2008, Ganguly joined as {{the captain}} of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team, owned by Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan, {{as part of the}} Indian Premier League (IPL). On 18 April 2008, Ganguly led the KKR, in the IPL Twenty20 cricket match. They had a 140 run victory over Bangalore Royal Challengers (captained by Rahul Dravid and owned by Vijay Mallya). Ganguly opened the innings with Brendan McCullum and scored 10 runs while McCullum {{remained}} unbeaten, scoring 158 runs in 73 balls. On 1 May, in a game between <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> Riders and the Rajasthan Royals, Ganguly made his second T20 half century, scoring 51runs off of 39balls at a strike rate of 130.76. In his innings, Ganguly hit four 4s and two sixes, topping the scorers list for <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> Riders.|$|E
5000|$|In total, as {{a result}} of these {{military}} needs, five major chivalric orders were formed in the Kingdom of Jerusalem between the late 11th century and the early 12th century: <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Hospitaller (Order of Saint John) (circa 1099), <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of <b>the</b> Holy Sepulchre (circa 1099), <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Templar (circa 1118), <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Saint Lazarus (1123), and <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of <b>the</b> Hospital of Saint Mary of Jerusalem (Teutonic Knights) (1190).|$|R
50|$|Prominent {{examples}} include <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Hospitaller, and <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Templar in Outremer, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> Teutonic <b>Knights</b> in <b>the</b> Baltics.|$|R
50|$|The Chapel of Saint John from <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Templar then <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Hospitaller.|$|R
5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proposals}} {{were made in}} 1715, this time by <b>the</b> <b>knight</b> René Jacob de Tigné {{and a team of}} French engineers. There were several different plans, including building a coastal battery and a redoubt. Other plans included building a four-bastioned fort, or combining all three (fort, battery and redoubt) for the defence of the island.|$|E
5|$|Plain arms {{also often}} {{function}} as a disguise for major characters. In the Chrétien de Troyes' Lancelot, <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> of the Cart, Lancelot bears plain red arms as a disguise. The hero of Cligès competes in a jousting tournament with plain black, green, and red arms on three successive days (Brault, 30).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> Templars had a preceptory here, later {{owned by}} <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Hospitallers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>knights</b> were {{plagued by}} {{internal}} disagreements. For example, Danes from Estonia refused to dismount from their heavy horses, {{which were not}} well-suited for battle in swampy terrain. When the battle started, local Curonians abandoned <b>the</b> <b>knights</b> because <b>the</b> <b>knights</b> did not agree to free any captured Curonians from the Samogitian camp. Peter von Dusburg even alleged that the Curonians attacked <b>the</b> <b>knights</b> from <b>the</b> rear. The Estonians and other local people soon followed the Curonian example and abandoned <b>the</b> <b>knights.</b> After this loss <b>the</b> <b>knights</b> were surrounded and suffered heavy losses. Some 150 knights perished along with hundreds of secular knights and low-ranking soldiers.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross and its higher {{grades were}} based on four {{separate}} enactments. The first enactment, [...] of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (...) , <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (...) [...] Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (...) , was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, {{were based on}} <b>the</b> second <b>Knight's</b> Cross related enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (...) and <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (...) [...] At the end of 1944 the final grade, <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (...) , based on <b>the</b> last <b>Knight's</b> Cross related enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross authorized.|$|R
5|$|The Marshalsea was {{technically}} {{under the}} control of <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> Marshal, but was let out to others who ran it for profit. For example, in 1727 <b>the</b> <b>Knight</b> Marshal, Philip Meadows, hired John Darby, a printer, as prison governor, who in turn leased it to William Acton, a butcher (who was later tried for murdering three of its prisoners). Acton had previously worked as one of the prison's turnkeys. He paid Darby £140 a year (roughly £) for a seven-year lease, giving him the right to act as resident warden and chief turnkey, and an additional £260 for the right to collect rent from the rooms, and sell food and drink.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{supposedly}} {{haunted by the}} Black Knight, who wears the armour and regalia of the Order of St. John, and resembles Grand Master de Vilhena. In the 1940s, <b>the</b> <b>knight</b> began to appear {{out of thin air}} near the ruins of the Chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, which had just been bombed in World War II. The apparition was reportedly seen by Maltese and English men within the fort. When the rubble from the ruined chapel began to be cleared, the workmen reported that <b>the</b> <b>knight</b> was supervising their work. When the crypt beneath the chapel was opened, it was found that it had been vandalized, and the remains of knights which had been buried there were scattered around. After the crypt was restored and the bones were reburied, the Black Knight stopped appearing. In 1980, the crypt was vandalized for a second time, and the Black Knight reportedly began to appear again.|$|E
5|$|Gurnemanz {{asks the}} lead Knight for {{news of the}} King's health. <b>The</b> <b>Knight</b> says the King has {{suffered}} during the night and is going early to bathe in the holy lake. The squires ask Gurnemanz {{to explain how the}} King's injury can be healed, but he evades their question and a wild woman – Kundry – bursts in. She gives Gurnemanz a vial of balsam, brought from Arabia, to ease the King's pain and then collapses, exhausted.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} round of the National League 100 Anniversary Cup <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> were drawn against Sirens FC. <b>The</b> <b>Knights</b> beat Sires FC 6-1, with Mdina's all-time record scorer Francalanza scoring a hat-trick. A place in the second round and a match against Second Division team Mellieha FC was the reward for <b>the</b> <b>Knights.</b> Mellieha FC won 8-0 in the worst ever defeat {{suffered}} by <b>the</b> <b>Knights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Parsons {{was also}} {{involved}} with <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Labor during its embryonic period. He joined <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Labor, known then as [...] "The Noble and Holy Order of <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Labor," [...] on July 4, 1876, {{after having been}} invited to speak at a mass meeting of workers. Parsons remained {{a member of the}} order until his death more than a decade later. Not long after joining <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Labor, Parsons and his friend George Schilling co-founded the first Chicago order of <b>the</b> <b>Knights,</b> later dubbed <b>the</b> [...] "Old 400".|$|R
5000|$|The {{award was}} instituted on 1 September 1939, {{at the onset}} of the German {{invasion}} of Poland. A higher grade, the Oak Leaves to <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross, was instituted in 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross with Oak Leaves were instituted: <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds). At the end of 1944 the final grade, <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds, was created. Over 7,000 awards were made during the course of the war.|$|R

5|$|In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Green Knight appears before Arthur's court {{during a}} Christmas feast, holding a bough of holly {{in one hand}} and a battle axe in the other. Despite {{disclaim}} of war, <b>the</b> <b>knight</b> issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, with the condition that he return the blow the next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.|$|E
50|$|Most {{frequently}} <b>the</b> term <b>Knight's</b> Cross is used {{to refer}} to <b>the</b> <b>Knight's</b> Cross of <b>the</b> Iron Cross, a military decoration of Nazi Germany.
