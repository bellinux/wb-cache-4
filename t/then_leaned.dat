5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by the {{seashore}} towards Mount Urvina when a vila {{told him that}} he was going to die. Marko <b>then</b> <b>leaned</b> over a well and saw no reflection of his face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E
