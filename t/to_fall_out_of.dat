5|$|By 1920 variety theatre {{had become}} popular in Britain, and Robey had {{completed}} the successful transition from music hall to variety star. Pantomime, which relied on its stars to make up much of the script through ad lib, was also beginning <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour, and his contemporaries were finding it too difficult to create fresh material for every performance; for Robey, however, the festive entertainment {{continued to be a}} lucrative source of employment.|$|E
5|$|Iron ships {{had first}} been {{proposed}} for military {{use in the}} 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned {{by the end of}} the 1840s, because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> shape than wood.|$|E
5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although this time it was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was probably nothing more than a single farm.|$|E

5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X {{slammed into the}} {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Brettingham (1699 – 19 August 1769), {{sometimes}} called Matthew Brettingham the Elder, was an 18th-century Englishman who rose from humble origins {{to supervise the}} construction of Holkham Hall, and {{become one of the}} country's best-known architects of his generation. Much of his principal work has since been demolished, particularly his work in London, where he revolutionised the design of the grand townhouse. As a result, he is often overlooked today, remembered principally for his Palladian remodelling of numerous country houses, many of them situated in the East Anglia area of Britain. As Brettingham neared the pinnacle of his career, Palladianism began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fashion and neoclassicism was introduced, championed by the young Robert Adam.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death in 1953, Stalin {{considered}} launching a new purge against Mikoyan, Vyacheslav Molotov, and several other Party leaders. Mikoyan and others gradually began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor and, in one instance, were accused of plotting against Stalin. Stalin's plans never came to fruition, however, as he died before he could put them into motion. Mikoyan originally argued in favor of keeping Stalin's right-hand man Beria from punishment but later gave in to popular support among Party members for his arrest. Mikoyan remained in the government after Stalin's death, in the post of Minister of Trade, under Malenkov. He supported Nikita Khrushchev in the power struggle to succeed Stalin, and became First Deputy Premier in recognition of his services.|$|E

5|$|Drowned God was {{released}} on October31, 1996 for the Windows 95 operating system. In its first two weeks, it sold 34,000copies in the United States. It {{was one of the}} top ten best-selling video games in United States during the first month after its release, but bugs and poor support from the developers caused it <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor with gamers by December. By February 1998, the game had sold over 60,000copies. Around the time of the game's release, Horse stated that its story was incomplete, and {{that the rest of the}} story would be revealed in a sequel called CULT, planned to center around Area51. However, he killed himself, as well as his wife and pets, a decade after the game's release, and no sequel was ever completed.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} for the WWE Championship between Champion John Cena and CM Punk. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon had {{threatened}} to have Cena fired if Punk won. During the match, two separate signature Attitude Adjustment moves by Cena failed to score the victory. More than 30 minutes into the match, Punk performed his Go to Sleep maneuver, striking Cena's ribs and causing Cena <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ring. As Punk rolled Cena back into the ring, McMahon and John Laurinaitis emerged from backstage and distracted Punk, resulting in Cena placing Punk in the STF submission hold. Punk did not submit, but McMahon signaled the referee to award Cena the match and sent Laurinaitis to ring the bell. This was reminiscent of the Montreal Screwjob in 1997, where a conspiracy orchestrated by McMahon led to Bret Hart losing his WWF Championship to Shawn Michaels by submission despite Hart never submitting.|$|E

25|$|Ligatures began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> use due {{to their}} {{complexity}} in the 20th century. Sans serif typefaces, increasingly used for body text, generally avoid ligatures, though notable exceptions include Gill Sans and Futura. Inexpensive phototypesetting machines in the 1970s (which did not require journeyman knowledge or training to operate) also generally avoid them.|$|E
25|$|Until the 18th and 19th century, {{the grape}} {{was a popular}} {{planting}} in Burgundy and Champagne but poor yields and unreliable crops caused the grape <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favor in those areas.

On 5 March 2016, Nilsson scored his first Fleetwood Town goal, in a 2-2 draw against Sheffield United.

25|$|The flow bench tests {{using only}} air while a real engine usually uses air mixed with fuel {{droplets}} and fuel vapor, which is significantly different.

A port which flows dry air well might cause fuel droplets <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> suspension causing a loss of power not indicated by flow figures alone.|$|E
