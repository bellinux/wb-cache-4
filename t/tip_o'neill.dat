5|$|In January 1981, Ted and Joan Kennedy {{announced}} {{they were getting}} a divorce. The proceedings were generally amicable, and she received a reported $4million settlement when the divorce was granted in 1982. Later that year, Kennedy created the Friends of Ireland organization with Senator Daniel Moynihan and House Speaker <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill</b> to support initiatives for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|As the 1984 U.S. presidential {{election}} primary season neared its end and Walter Mondale became the likely Democratic nominee, {{the idea of}} picking a woman as his vice-presidential running mate gained considerable momentum. The National Organization for Women and the National Women's Political Caucus pushed the notion, as did several top Democratic figures such as Speaker <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill.</b> Women mentioned for the role included Ferraro and Mayor of San Francisco Dianne Feinstein, {{both of whom were}} on Mondale's five-person short list.|$|E
50|$|During {{his time}} in the House, Bonker was {{a senior member of the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee and {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade. He also served on the President's Export Council and headed former House Speaker <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill's</b> Trade Task Force, which led to passage of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. During his tenure in Congress, Bonker authored and was a principal sponsor of significant trade legislation, such as the Export Trading Company Act and the Export Administration Act.|$|R
5000|$|Stockman {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{controversial}} OMB directors ever appointed, also known as the [...] "Father of Reaganomics." [...] He resigned in August 1985. Committed to the doctrine of supply-side economics, he assisted in the passing of the [...] "Reagan Budget" [...] (the Gramm-Latta Budget), which Stockman hoped would curtail the [...] "welfare state". He thus gained a reputation as a tough negotiator with House Speaker <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill's</b> Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and Majority Leader Howard Baker's Republican-controlled Senate. During this period, Stockman became well known to the public during the contentious political wrangling concerning the role of the federal government in American society.|$|R
5000|$|Monster Chiller Horror Theatre {{did show}} a wide {{selection}} of cheesy 3D horror films, including 3D House of Beef, 3D House of Slave Chicks, and <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill's</b> 3D House of Representatives ("house" [...] in many of these titles suggesting the classic 3D film House of Wax). The 3D effect of the films usually consisted merely of the actors getting extremely close to the camera (equipped with a fisheye lens to grossly exaggerate perspective) and simply lunging the object of 3D emphasis back and forth at the lens. These objects included such non-scary items as a pen, a forkful of beef, or pancake syrup in Dr. Tongue's Evil House of Pancakes.|$|R
5|$|On 11 March 1976, SAC {{headquarters}} {{announced that}} the 42d Bombardment Wing would be inactivated, citing the poor condition of Loring's facilities. In 1976, {{it was estimated that}} Loring needed up to $300 million in facilities improvements. Between 1976 and 1979, considerable debate took place over the strategic importance of Loring, resulting in a reversal of the Air Force decision to close Loring. When the decision to keep Loring AFB open was made in 1979, Congress committed itself to upgrading Loring's facilities. After 1981, nearly $300 million in military construction and operations and maintenance funds were spent to upgrade the facilities. Congressman <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill</b> of Massachusetts and Senator William Cohen of Maine were firm supporters of the base during the time when it was proposed to be closed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s, Boston's {{population}} grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically {{with the first}} wave of European immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated {{the first wave of}} newcomers during this period, especially following the Irish Potato Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 Irish lived in Boston. In {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settling in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants. Italians inhabited the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community, and the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics since the early 20th century; prominent figures include the Kennedys, <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill,</b> and John F. Fitzgerald.|$|E

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of the neoliberal Silicon Valley venture capital (“VC”) model {{seems to be}} another case of convergence on neoliberal orthodoxy as the spread of Silicon Valley replication ambitions is ubiquitous. But, when looking under the veneer of the Silicon Valley VC policy diffusion trend, I find that VC policy diffusion is not a story of “universal convergence. ” Though more than 40 states deployed VC policies {{in an attempt to}} create local Silicon Valleys, the policies they implemented took different, and interventionist, forms. This thesis seeks explain why variance, rather than convergence, characterizes the {{diffusion of}} this clear, successful model. Diffusion scholarship has made initial attempts at theorizing why and how diffusion does not lead to complete convergence. This thesis contributes to this growing body of work by conceptualizing and investigating how bounded rationality drives incomplete convergence. To do this, the thesis extends Kurt Weyland’s work on cognitive biases to by testing how five economic management norms shape the Silicon Valley VC policy diffusion: (1) pre-existing norms guiding state intervention, (2) private sector financing norms, (3) preferences for supporting large or small companies, (4) international versus local company support preferences and (5) bank or capital market preferences. The five economic management norms are drawn on to develop East Asian comparative typologies (Nightwatch-man State, Private Sector Promoter, Financier and Director and Command Economy) to test the impact of the norms in specific cases. This thesis also tests state-of-the-art diffusion literature’s hypotheses about the sources of variance in the diffusion process, namely: the impact of multiple diffusion items, diffusion items’ levels of specificity and diffusion mechanisms. Empirically, this thesis provides a large-N dataset of forty-six countries' VC policies and four East Asian case study analyses (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam). The case studies reveal how, in the face of competitive pressures, three of the five economic management norms propelled policymakers to choose unique policy formula. As a result, this thesis concludes that <b>Tip</b> <b>O’Neill’s</b> presumption that “all politics is local” rings true in policy diffusion. ...|$|R

25|$|The Browns {{and their}} {{supporters}} were despondent over the loss and returned from Chicago to a station devoid of welcoming fans. Browns players were critical of player-manager Charlie Comiskey's decision to start Caruthers in back-to-back games, noting that Nat Hudson had been ready to start for the visitors until the last-minute {{decision was made to}} bring back the team's ace on zero rest. Star outfielder <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill</b> expressed the view that the pitching situation had been miserably managed and that the entire team had been put off by the decision not to rest Caruthers.|$|E
25|$|Shelly Saltman grew {{up during}} the Great Depression years as the child of Russian and Ukrainian Orthodox Jewish parents in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

25|$|After the {{starting}} bell rang at 3:15 pm, the Chicagos managed to rack up a 3-0 {{lead in the}} top of the first inning with one hit, two walks, two errors, and a sacrifice fly. The Browns narrowed the margin with a run in the second inning on some astute base running by Bill Gleason, with another run notched in the third inning when <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill</b> tripled home a runner. The tide turned decisively in the fifth inning when starting pitcher John Clarkson, pitching a second consecutive game, began to run out of gas, giving up a two-run single to center by Gleason, followed by an RBI single by Browns first baseman Charlie Comiskey.|$|E
500|$|Larry Walker, Jason Bay, Joey Votto, and Justin Morneau are {{the only}} players to win the <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill</b> Award at least three times.

500|$|McCain {{voted against}} a 1983 {{resolution}} allowing President Reagan to keep U.S. Marines deployed {{as part of}} the Multinational Force in Lebanon, on the grounds that he [...] " [...] not foresee obtainable objectives in Lebanon." [...] After the catastrophic Beirut barracks bombing a month later, this stance against his party and president gained him national media exposure and started his reputation as a political maverick. [...] McCain sided with Newt Gingrich's group of young conservatives in some of their battles against the House Democratic leadership, but declined to join Gingrich's Conservative Opportunity Society. [...] McCain felt personal affection for Democratic Speaker of the House <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill,</b> and established good relations with some Democrats in the House, such as Paul Simon and especially Mo Udall.|$|E
500|$|In 1883, Williamson set {{the major}} league record for doubles in a single season by hitting 49, surpassing King Kelly's 37 set the {{previous}} year. [...] Williamson's record for doubles stood until <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill</b> of the St. Louis Browns hit 52 in 1887. Williamson's doubles achievement was attributed to the short dimensions of Chicago's Lakeshore Park; the distances were [...] in left field, [...] in center field, and [...] in right field. [...] Balls that were hit over the fence were counted as doubles until 1884, when they became home runs. [...] On September 6, Chicago scored a record 18runs in one inning during a 266 victory over the Detroit Wolverines. [...] Williamson contributed three hits, and scored three runs in that inning, setting individual records in both categories. [...] Other than runs scored, the other team records set that day included the most hits and total bases in one inning.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Joseph Kennedy II {{announced}} his retirement after six terms {{in what was then}} the 8th District. Capuano entered a crowded 10-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district, which was once represented by John F. Kennedy and <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill.</b> The early front-runner was former Boston Mayor and US Vatican Ambassador Raymond Flynn. However, Capuano won the primary with 23%, largely due to large turnout in Somerville, all but assuring him of election in November. [...] He easily won the general election in November, taking 81 percent of the vote. He has been reelected seven times, never dropping below 80% of the vote. Since his initial run for the seat, Capuano has been unopposed in all but two reelection bids; he faced a minor-party candidate in 2006 and an independent in 2012. To date, he has only faced a Republican once, during his initial run in 1998.|$|E
500|$|The group {{obtained}} a duplicate nuclear football and Gold Codes card, {{and kept it}} in the situation room.

Although others in the room knew that Haig's statement was constitutionally incorrect, they did not object at the time to avoid a confrontation.|$|E
500|$|In {{the major}} leagues, the most batting Triple Crowns {{won by a}} player is two. Rogers Hornsby {{was the first to}} {{accomplish}} it, winning his first in 1922 and then leading all major leagues in 1925 en route to his second Triple Crown, both with the St. Louis Cardinals. Ted Williams later matched this mark in the AL, winning in 1942 and 1947 with the Boston Red Sox. The Cardinals have won the most batting Triple Crowns as a franchise with four. Along with Hornsby's two, <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill</b> won in the now-defunct American Association in 1887 while the team was known as the St. Louis Browns, and Joe Medwick added the Cardinals' fourth in 1937. Eleven of the thirteen eligible players who have offensive Triple Crowns have been elected to the Hall of Fame. [...] Baseball writer and ESPN contributor Tim Kurkjian believes the Triple Crown has become more difficult to win with the advent of more hitters who choose to specialize in either hitting for batting average or power.|$|E
500|$|In total, 20 {{players have}} reached the [...]400 mark in MLB history and five have done so more than once. [...] Of these, ten were {{right-handed}} batters, nine were left-handed, and one was a switch hitter, meaning he could bat from {{either side of the}} plate. [...] Two of these players (Terry and Williams) played for only one major league team. [...] The Philadelphia Phillies are the only franchise to have four different players reach the milestone while on their roster: Delahanty, Billy Hamilton, Sam Thompson, and Tuck Turner, all of whom attained a batting average over [...]400 during the 1894 season. [...] Three players won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in the same year as their [...]400 season. [...] <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill,</b> Nap Lajoie, and Hornsby are the only players to have earned the Triple Crown alongside achieving a [...]400 batting average, leading their respective leagues in batting average, home runs and runs batted in (RBI). [...] Although Shoeless Joe Jackson's [...]408 batting average in 1911 did not earn him the American League's batting title, it established a major league record for a rookie that stands to this day. [...] Fred Dunlap has the lowest career batting average among players who have batted [...]400 in a season with [...]292, while Cobb – with [...]366 – recorded the highest career average in major league history.|$|E
500|$|Barnes' initial NL-leading {{average of}} [...]4286 in 1876 set the single-season record which {{stood for a}} decade. <b>Tip</b> <b>O'Neill</b> topped this total with a [...]4352 average in 1887 (that batting average had to be {{calculated}} without counting walks as hits, because of the walk-as-base-hit rule being in effect that year only), and Hugh Duffy set the current record mark in 1894 by posting a [...]4397 batting average. Under the current 3.1 PA qualification, players have posted a [...]400 batting average for a season 28 times. Ted Williams' [...]4057 in 1941 is the most recent such season, one of 13 to occur since 1900. George Brett in 1980 is the only player to maintain a [...]400 average into September since 1941. Additionally, only Brett and John Olerud in 1993 maintained such an average into August. With the modern scarcity of [...]400 hitters, recent players who have been above [...]400 early in the season, such as Chipper Jones in 2008, have drawn significant attention in the media. Brett's [...]390 in 1980 and Gwynn's [...]394 in 1994 are the only seasons in which a player reached [...]390 since 1941. Carl Yastrzemski's [...]301 in the 1968 American League was the lowest batting average ever to lead a league. Willie Keeler's 1897 and Zack Wheat's 1918 {{are the only two}} title seasons in which the winner hit no home runs. Joe Mauer's 2006 title made him the first catcher to ever win an AL batting title, and his third title in 2009 surpassed Ernie Lombardi's previous record of two titles for a catcher in any league.|$|E
