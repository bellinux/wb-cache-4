5|$|Several {{types of}} incense clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the incense stick and incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. <b>The</b> <b>weights</b> would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that {{a certain amount of}} time had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> to be used together with the decorative tray. Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E
5|$|In England, the {{manufacturing}} of pendulum clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also {{known as the}} grandfather clock) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the anchor escapement mechanism in about 1670. Before then, pendulum clocks used the older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100°. To avoid {{the need for a}} very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39inches) long {{to the center of the}} bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for <b>the</b> <b>weights</b> that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.|$|E

5000|$|The device's {{intriguing}} {{behavior is}} caused by a slight coupling between the two motions or degrees of freedom, due to the geometry of the spring. When <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> is moving up and down, each downward excursion of the spring causes it to unwind slightly, giving <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> a slight twist. When <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> moves up, it causes the spring to wind slightly tighter, giving <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> a slight twist in the other direction. So when <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> is moving up and down, each oscillation gives a slight back and forth rotational impulse to <b>the</b> <b>weight.</b> In other words, during each oscillation some of the energy in the translational mode leaks into the rotational mode. Slowly the up and down movement gets less, and the rotational movement gets greater, until <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> is just rotating and not bobbing.|$|R
