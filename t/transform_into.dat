(In complex analysis, [...] "infinity" [...] is defined in terms of the Riemann sphere.) Inversion has the useful property that lines and circles are always <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> lines and circles, and points are always <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> points. Circles are generally <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> other circles under inversion; however, if a circle passes {{through the center of the}} inversion circle, it is <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> a straight line, and vice versa. Importantly, if a circle crosses the circle of inversion at right angles (intersects perpendicularly), it is left unchanged by the inversion; it is <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> itself.|$|R

5|$|The {{literary}} Dracula transforms into a bat {{several times}} in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of Dracula followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the film, where Béla Lugosi would <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> a bat. The bat transformation scene was used again by Lon Chaney Jr. in 1943's Son of Dracula.|$|E

5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few days}} the larvae sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E

5|$|Actinide salts {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water-soluble. When crystallizing from aqueous solutions, these salts forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO3)4·6H2O, Th(SO4)2·9H2O and Pu2(SO4)3·7H2O. Salts of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> basic salts with formulas Th(OH)2SO4 and Th(OH)3NO3. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts. So phosphates, fluorides, oxalates, iodates and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF4·3H2O and Th(CrO4)2·3H2O.|$|E
5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can <b>transform</b> <b>into</b> a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E

Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical.
