500|$|In a {{negative}} review for PopMatters, Chris Conaton expressed disappointment in the album's predictability, noting, [...] "At this point it’s {{pretty clear that}} the band is comfortably ensconced in their lifestyle and content to just keep doing <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> have been for years." [...] In a lukewarm review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek observed, [...] "there is something here for virtually every fan -- or detractor -- to grab hold of." [...] Sputnikmusic criticized Mangini's drum parts, describing them as [...] "bland", {{as well as the}} decision to include three ballads, but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{break-up}} of Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler has shown {{no interest in}} reforming the band and {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Oh, I don't know whether to start getting all that stuff back together again," [...] and telling reporters that [...] "I would only do that for a charity. I'm glad I've experienced it all – I {{had a lot of fun}} with it – but I like <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are." [...] However, keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler's solo material to date, and Danny Cummings has frequently contributed, notably to three of Knopfler's most recent solo album releases All the Roadrunning (with Emmylou Harris), Kill to Get Crimson and Get Lucky.|$|E

I think they're always testing that relationship and they're always throwing things at it to see how far they can take [...] It's already a very complex relationship. They're very close; they're very good friends; and they trust each other. So, I think the complexity of it all can go further and I think they're going to explore more." [...] Pauley Perrette, who portrays series regular Abby Sciuto, openly opposed it and said, [...] "I don't want any of our cast members to be in relationships on screen at all. I like <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are, so I'm not in [...] that. I'm petitioning against it." ...|$|E

Accessories are identifiable {{by the nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are attached to the principal object, and the intention of the one who attached it.|$|R
2500|$|The {{march of}} the athletes showed a clear example of CCTV proudly {{emphasizing}} a cultural particularity that NBC strained to contain {{within the bounds of}} the acceptable. When the athletes entered the stadium, CCTV [...] pointed out that the banners carrying the names of the countries were written by brush in Chinese and English, reflecting another Chinese cultural particularity. NBC described the arrangement not as an expression of Chinese cultural pride, but in pragmatic terms that covered a sense of dismissiveness. [...] As the athletes began marching into the stadium, Bob Costas explained why Guinea followed Greece: [...] "There is no alphabet here. So if you're expecting one nation to follow another, the way they generally do at an opening ceremony, think again." [...] Matt Lauer added [...] "You're out of luck. So we're going to have the graphics {{at the bottom of the}} screen which will give you an idea, if you look to the right, which countries are approaching the tunnel." [...] In this way, the NBC commentators' coverage intoned that China was not doing <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> were generally done, and as a viewer, you might be [...] "out of luck" [...] if not for the graphics that NBC provided.|$|E

Therefore the spoken lie is of no consequence, and it is not worth while to go around fussing about it and trying to make believe that it is an important matter. The silent colossal National Lie that is the support and confederate of all the tyrannies and shams and inequalities and unfairnesses that afflict the peoples--that is the one to throw bricks and sermons at.

But we may be sure of one thing, and that is that this sort of thing is not universal. If it were, this country would not be. You may put this down as a fact: that out of every fifty men, forty-nine are clean. Then why is it, you may ask, that the forty-nine don't have <b>things</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> want them? I'll tell you why it is.

40|$|Theory is {{something}} that is often not highly valued by youth workers and others who work with young people. "I'm not a great one for theory. I prefer to get on with doing the job," is a not uncommon opinion. Such a view is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of theory and of the relationship between theory and practice. Specifically, it reflects the misguided notion that theory is necessarily both abstract and abstruce, something "academic" and impractical. But in fact, as Kurt Lewin once wrote, "there is nothing as practical as a good theory" (Lewin, 1952 : 346). Theory is essentially concerned with explanation and understanding of why <b>things</b> are <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are; of why <b>things</b> work <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> do.
