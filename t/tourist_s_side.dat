The Horchin region {{was among the first}} that the Han people moved to and the first change that was brought about was in agriculture. The largest number of Chinese-Mongolians lives in large groups. The distinction between native Inner-Mongolian words and borrowed words from Chinese can be recognized. In other words, the terms concerning family relationships are mostly native Inner-Mongolian, and, on the contrary, the kinship terms on the father 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side</b> and mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side,</b> especially on the father 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side,</b> are rather largely influenced by Chinese. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{tremendous}} {{growth in the}} amount of information stored on remote locations and cloud systems, many service providers are seeking ways {{to reduce the amount of}} redundant information sent across networks by using data de-duplication techniques. Data de-duplication can reduce network traffic without the loss of information, and consequently increase available network bandwidth by reducing redundant traffic. However, due to the heavy computation required for detecting and reducing redundant data transmission, de-duplication itself can become a bottleneck in high capacity links. We completed two parts of work in this research study, Hardware Accelerated Redundancy Elimination in Network Systems (HARENS) and Distributed Redundancy Elimination System Simulation (DRESS). HARENS can significantly improve the performance of redundancy elimination algorithm in a network system by leveraging General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU) techniques as well as other big data optimizations such as the use of a hierarchical multi-threaded pipeline, single machine Map-Reduce, and memory efficiency techniques. Our results indicate that throughput can be increased by a factor of 9 times compared to a naive implementation of the data de-duplication algorithm, providing a net transmission increase of up to 3. 0 Gigabits per second (Gbps). DRESS provides further acceleration to the redundancy elimination in network system by deploying HARENS as the server 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side</b> redundancy elimination module, and four cooperative distributed byte caches on the clients 2 ̆ 7 side. A client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side</b> distributed byte cache broadcast its cached chunks by sending hash values to other byte caches, so that they can keep a record of all the chunks in the cooperative distributed cache system. When duplications are detected, a client 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side</b> byte cache can fetch a chunk directly from either its own cache or peer byte caches rather than server 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>side</b> redundancy elimination module. Our results indicate that bandwidth savings of the redundancy elimination system with cooperative distributed byte cache can be increased by 12...|$|R
