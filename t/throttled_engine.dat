40|$|The brake {{efficiency}} of a throttled {{internal combustion engine}} is reduced at low load operation because of the engine work required to drop the intake manifold pressure. These throttling losses are experienced by all throttled engines operating at less than wide open throttle (WOT). By replacing the throttle plate with a suitable air motor, work can be recovered in an expansion process that reduces the induced air pressure to the same intake manifold pressure as the <b>throttled</b> <b>engine.</b> To maximize the benefits from coupling the air motor to the engine cycle, the air {{should be returned to}} a thermal state identical to that of the throttled case at some point prior to combustion. This might be achieved either: (i) prior to cylinder compression via regenerative heat transfer to the inducted air; or (ii) through cylinder compression at an increased compression ratio. The work generated by the Induction Air Motor (IAM) can be directly applied to the engine output thereby increasing the {{brake efficiency}} for the same indicated work. This paper reports on the performance of an IAM designed to reduce intake pressure of an engine for low load operation. Increased brake efficiency will be achieved. The IAM design specifications are explored using a numerical model including isentropic efficiency, friction and service life considerations. A prototype has been constructed and was bench tested at flows and pressures comparable to a <b>throttled</b> <b>engine.</b> These tests indicated that the modelled friction was lower than the friction measured during the experiments. From the experiments performed with the prototype, the net performance of an IAM will give efficiency improvements in excess of 5 % for an equivalent <b>throttled</b> <b>engine</b> operating at loads in the range up to 10 % of its WOT power...|$|E

40|$|Cylinder {{deactivation}} improves {{part load}} fuel economy in spark-ignition engines by reducing pumping losses. The efficiency {{benefits of a}} new intake valve system that enables flexible deactivation of different cylinders are investigated in this study. The intake valve system involves two intake valves in series, with a fast solenoid-actuated valve upstream of a conventional cam-actuated intake poppet valve. Compared to conventional cam-actuated variable valve timing, the new valve system has potential to achieve {{a high degree of}} flexibility in respect of the timing of inlet valve closure, while requiring lower actuation forces than fully-flexible valve actuation systems that act directly on the poppet valves. The fuel economy benefits provided by a number of valve control strategies are evaluated using a one-dimensional modelling approach, considering a vehicle following the New European Drive Cycle. Use of the intake valve system to control load by deactivation of different percentages of firing strokes is predicted to offer a very substantial improvement in fuel economy, achieving as much as a 43 % fuel saving over the New European Drive Cycle compared to <b>throttled</b> <b>engine</b> operation. Use of flexible cylinder deactivation also affords fuel savings and thermal management benefits compared to more conventional cylinder deactivation schemes in which a fixed subset of the cylinders, typically one half, are deactivated at one time. The use of the valve system to make fine adjustments to the intake valve closure timing, as opposed to deactivation, is also discussed...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis describes {{an investigation into the}} use of hydrogen as a fuel for automotive use. Due to problems of backflash into the engine intake when hydrogen is used as the sole fuel, a dual-fuel system using petrol and hydrogen together was studied. Using this system, a spark-ignited engine has been run at all speeds with a wideopen throttle, and the specific fuel consumption and BTE figures indicate a greater part load efficiency than those from a <b>throttled</b> <b>engine.</b> The performance and emissions curves of the engine are presented, both at the standard compression ratio of 8. 9 : 1 and at a higher compression ratio of 11. 7 : 1. Emissions data indicate reduced levels of CO, and NOx at part load due to the very lean mixtures used. No problem of backfiring was experienced since the concentration of hydrogen was very low. A vehicle was modified to run on such a dual-fuel system, and details of this modification are also presented. A major problem with using hydrogen as an automotive fuel is its on-board storage. This is discussed in some detail, with particular reference to the use of metal hydrides as storage media. Metal hydride tanks are now commercially available, and a detailed mathematical model of such a tank has been developed to describe its behaviour under both hydriding and dehydriding conditions. In contrast to other hydride models previously reported in the literature, this model simulates an actual, commercially available containment vessel, rather than that of an abstract ideal situation. Thus the model provides a convenient means of predicting the time taken to release or absorb given amounts of hydrogen. These are calculated from the heat transfer characteristics and diffusion properties of particular metal alloys. Comparisons are given between the actual operating characteristics and those simulated by the model. A brief discussion of the reaction kinetics of hydriding certain metal alloys is also included...|$|E
