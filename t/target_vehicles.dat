40|$|A {{synchronized}} target subsystem {{for use in}} {{an automated}} docking system for docking a chase <b>vehicle</b> with a <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> wherein the chase vehicle is provided with a video camera for feeding digitized frames to an image processing unit which feeds signals to a control circuit. The control circuit turns on the video camera to digitize a background frame which will include the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle.</b> After the camera grabs the background frame the control circuit turns on a light, which is carried by carried on the chase vehicle and aimed at the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and signals the video camera to digitize a foreground frame. A light sensing circuit on the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> receives {{the light from the}} chase vehicle and connects a power supply to lights on the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> such that when the foreground frame is digitized the Lights on the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> will show in the foreground frame.

40|$|Autonomous space {{rendezvous}} scenarios require {{knowledge of the}} <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> state in order to safely dock with the chaser <b>vehicle.</b> Ideally, the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> state information is derived from telemetered data, or {{with the use of}} known tracking points on the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle.</b> However, if the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> is non-cooperative and does not have the ability to maintain attitude control, or transmit attitude knowledge, the docking becomes more challenging. This work presents a nonlinear approach for estimating the body rates of a non-cooperative <b>target</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and coupling this estimation to a tracking control scheme. The approach is tested with the robotic servicing mission concept for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Such a mission would not only require estimates of the HST attitude and rates, but also precision control to achieve the desired rate and maintain the orientation to successfully dock with HST...|$|R
50|$|The first mission {{objective}} was to dock with an Agena <b>Target</b> <b>Vehicle,</b> as had first been achieved on the Gemini 8 mission. Accomplishment was not possible because of a launch preparation error on the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R

2500|$|After the {{successful}} completion of Gemini 7, Collins {{was assigned to the}} prime crew of Gemini 10 with John Young, with White moving onto Apollo program. Their three-day mission called for them to rendezvous with two different Agena <b>Target</b> <b>Vehicles,</b> undertake two EVAs, and perform 15 different experiments. The training went smoothly, as the crew learned the intricacies of orbital rendezvous, controlling the Agena and, for Collins, EVA. For what was to be the fourth ever EVA, underwater training was not undertaken, mostly because Collins just did not have the time. To train to use the nitrogen gun he would use for propulsion, a super smooth metal surface {{about the size of a}} boxing ring was set up. He would stand on a circular pad that used gas jets to raise itself off the surface. Using the nitrogen gun he would practise propelling himself across the [...] "slippery table". For the three day flight, Collins received $24.00 in travel reimbursement.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} find the {{following}} distance, a vehicle is chosen as the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> (if there exist a vehicle in the scene). The <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> is determined as the nearest vehicle in the own lane of host vehicle. The inverse perspective mapping information, that {{were found in the}} previous section, is used to transform the position of the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> to the birds-eye view perspective which enables us to determine the distance between host <b>vehicle</b> <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> in pixel units. This difference in pixel units is converted to metric unit with a constant C which is predefined according to the perspective transformation values before the overall process.|$|R
50|$|Yan et al. {{proposes a}} defense {{mechanism}} against both aforementioned ways to perform position spoofing: attacker using a real car he owns or performing a Sybil attack. It {{makes use of}} front and rear radars that all future VANET-enabled vehicles are expected to have. It computes the cosine similarity between the path history built by the position advertisements by a <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the path history built by the positions calculated using the front/rear radar of either the observer vehicle itself if the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> is in the radius of 200 meters, or radars of a trusted neighbor that is {{close enough to the}} <b>target</b> <b>vehicle.</b> If these two paths are different above a certain threshold, which is set and constantly updated according to the expected inaccuracy of GPS devices, the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> will be marked as a malicious node broadcasting fake positions and all the vehicles in a VANET will isolate it from the communication. If the two paths are similar enough, the path history of the <b>target</b> <b>vehicle</b> that is saved inside the observer vehicle will be updated and the same computations will be repeated every time position advertisements are received.|$|R
