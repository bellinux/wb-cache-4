All four species are endemic to the island, often occurring in dense pure stands, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> proved such a worldwide success as an indoor plant being the kentia or thatch palm (Howea forsteriana). This is a lowland palm with drooping leaflets and seed branches in 'hands' of 3–5 while the curly palm (Howea belmoreana), which occurs on slightly higher ground, has upwardly directed leaflets and solitary 'hands'. Natural hybrids between these species occur {{on the island and}} there is a mature specimen of one growing in the island nursery. On the mountain sides higher than about 350 m there is the big mountain palm (Hedyscepe canterburyana); it has large golf-ball-sized fruits while the little mountain palm (Lepidorrhachis mooreana) has marble-sized fruits and is only found on the mountain summits.|$|E

Thousand of junta military and police forces poured into Yangon to try to control the situation, which rapidly deteriorated. A curfew was imposed and on 25 September troops surrounded Sule Pagoda. The protest continued to grow with regular citizens joining to support and defend the Buddhists. Overnight, junta forces invaded all the kyaungs in the country and imprisoned thousands of monks. It was reported that Nobel prize winning human rights activist and Buddhist Aung San Suu Kyi was removed from her home where she languished under house arrest and moved to the infamous Insein Prison. Mass protests erupted over this and junta troops began firing on monks, civilians, and demonstrators in the largest clash since 1988, which left thousands injured and hundreds dead. Images of the brutality were aired worldwide. Leaders around the world condemned the junta's actions and many nations imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar in protest.

2500|$|Like tragedy, comedy {{arose from}} a ritual {{in honor of}} Dionysus, {{but in this case}} the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult. At Athens, the comedies became an {{official}} part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions. As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the great comedic writers. The only complete surviving works of classical comedy are eleven plays written by the playwright Aristophanes. These are a treasure trove of comic presentation. He poked fun at everyone and every institution. In The Birds, he ridicules Athenian democracy. In The Clouds, he attacks the philosopher Socrates. In Lysistrata, he denounces war. Aristophanes has been praised highly for his dramatic skill and artistry. John Lemprière's Bibliotheca Classica describes him as, quite simply, [...] "the greatest comic dramatist in world literature: by his side Molière seems dull and Shakespeare clownish." [...] Of all Aristophanes's plays, however, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> received the most lasting recognition is The Frogs, which simultaneously satirizes and immortalizes the two giants of Athenian tragedy: Aeschylus and Euripides. When it was performed {{for the first time at}} the Lenaia Festival in 405 BC, just one year after the death of Euripides, the Athenians awarded it first prize. It was the only Greek play that was ever given an encore performance, which took place two months later at the City Dionysia. Even today, The Frogs still appeals to modern audiences. A commercially successful modern musical adaptation of it was performed on Broadway in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Njegoš's {{writings}} {{have received}} {{varying degrees of}} scholarly and critical attention since his death. Some studies {{have been written about}} Luča mikrokozma, though very little has been written about Lažni car Šćepan mali, which Djilas believes contains some of Njegoš's finest verse. Of all Njegoš's writings, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been the subject of most scholarly analysis is Gorski vijenac, which virtually all critics regard as his finest work. It is also his most famous, having been reprinted more than 120 times between 1847 and 1996. By 1913, Gorski vijenac had been translated into ten different languages. It has been translated into English twice– once by James W. Wiles, in 1930, and the second time by Vasa D. Mihailovich, in 1986. Set in the early 1700s, the epic revolves around Njegoš's ancestor, vladika Danilo, as he ponders {{what to do with the}} Montenegrins who have converted to Islam amid increasing Ottoman encroachment. Danilo knows that every Montenegrin has a responsibility towards his family and towards his clan, for to kill a fellow Montenegrin would elicit a blood feud, but he also realizes that each man has a duty towards his faith and towards his nation, and that these two strains of responsibility are completely irreconcilable. Ultimately, the Montenegrin Christians give their Muslim kin the option of returning to Christianity or facing death. On Christmas Day, those that refuse to comply are killed and their villages burned. In light of its subject matter, Gorski vijenac became a source of considerable controversy during and after the Yugoslav Wars, when critics began to re-examine the text within the context of the conflicts' many atrocities. Judah goes as far as to call it a [...] "paean to ethnic cleansing". He writes: [...] "In the wake of another Balkan War, its significance is that of a missing link. It helps explain how the Serbian national consciousness has been molded and how ideas of national liberation became inextricably intertwined with killing your neighbour and burning his village." [...] Some scholars have even claimed that the epic is based on a historical massacre from the late 17th century. Djilas notes that no such event is mentioned in an authoritative history of Montenegro that was written by Danilo's successor, Vasilije, and published in 1756. Thus, Djilas concludes that the Christmas Day massacre is either entirely fictional or that the elimination of Montenegrin Muslims occurred in stages over a long period of time, as opposed to a single atrocity eradicating them all. Srdja Pavlović contends that the massacre is a conflation of two historical events– the widespread conversion of Montenegrins to Islam in 1485 and the expulsion of the Medojević family from Montenegro in 1704, following a property dispute. There is no scholarly consensus as to whether the Christmas Day massacre ever occurred.|$|E
