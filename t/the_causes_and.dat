5|$|A {{series of}} serious crop {{failures}} in the late 19th century led to widespread famines on the subcontinent {{in which it is}} estimated that over 15 million people died.

5|$|The Nemesis of Faith is an epistolary {{philosophical}} {{novel by}} James Anthony Froude published in 1849. Partly autobiographical, the novel depicts <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>and</b> {{consequences of a}} young priest's crisis of faith. Like many of his contemporaries, Froude came to question his Christian faith in light of early nineteenth century developments in history, theology, and science. Froude was particularly influenced by the Catholic teachings of the Oxford Movement and by the new approach to religious scholarship developed by the German Higher Critics.|$|E

5|$|The book {{presents}} {{case histories}} {{of all the}} twin-pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses. Its last chapters put the results {{in the context of}} existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>and</b> continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.|$|E
5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>and</b> then look for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>and</b> risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E
50|$|According to the Theory of the Pre-existent Effect, {{there is}} no {{annihilation}} of the existence, {{nor is there any}} creation of the non-existent, which means, there cannot be anything new or the destruction of what exists; and that {{there is no}} relation between <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect. With regard to the non-difference of <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> effect the general views are that, a) the difference (negation of non-difference) of <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect is <b>the</b> essence (swarupa) of <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> effect, and the non-difference of them is their relation of identity; b) that difference of <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect is their essential quality and that their non-difference is the negation of that difference, and c) that both difference and non-difference are essential qualities of <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect and are equally positive in character and colour. These views lead to the reasoning that non-difference of <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect cannot be taken as absolutely different from them, non-difference is not an attribute different from <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect and if difference is interpreted as constituting the essential nature of <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect, with non-difference qualifying it as an attribute then a rational conception of <b>the</b> relation between <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> effect cannot be formed. It is held that the effect before its manifestation remains undifferentiated in <b>the</b> <b>cause,</b> because <b>the</b> causal substance is the substance of the effect as a substance therefore, the effect cannot be different from <b>the</b> <b>cause,</b> it evolves out of <b>the</b> <b>cause,</b> it exists inseparable from <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> time of destruction it merges in the nature of <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b> Also, specific features that constitute the effect are not different from <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> entire world which prior to its manifestation is existent in an unmanifest state in the nature of Prakrti, the Primal Energy, the modification of Prakrti resulting in the perceivable world does not make it lose its identity.Existence is a manifestation of the unmanifest Brahman, and the individual souls (atman) are the reflections of Brahman and non-different from Brahman, but even then non-difference cannot become the content of awareness without reference to difference. To the Advaitins, non-difference is real and it is not known through reasoning. Brahman is then held to be knowable because it is different from empirical things.|$|R

5|$|While BioShock Infinite, {{developed}} by Irrational Games and released in 2013, shares {{the name and}} many similar gameplay concepts with BioShock, the title is not a sequel or prequel in story, instead taking place aboard the collapsing air-city of Columbia in the year 1912, and following former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt {{as he tries to}} rescue a woman named Elizabeth from the dystopia it has become. Infinite involves the possibilities of multiple universes, and one scene during the game take place at the lighthouse and bathysphere terminus of Rapture as part of this exploration, though any direct canonical connection is not given in the main game. The episodic expansion, , takes place in Rapture in 1959, prior to the war between Atlas and Ryan, while continuing the story of Booker and Elizabeth. This content links the two stories while providing expansion on <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>and</b> behind-the-scenes events alluded to by the in-game background from BioShock.|$|E
