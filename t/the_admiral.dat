5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Admiral</b> Spiridov {{class were}} {{a pair of}} {{monitors}} built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1860s. The sister ships {{were assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon completion and remained there for their entire careers. Aside from several accidental collisions and one grounding, their careers were uneventful. They were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads in 1892 before they became training ships in 1900. <b>The</b> <b>Admiral</b> Spiridovs were stricken from the Navy List in 1907; one ship became a stationary target and the other a coal-storage barge. Their ultimate fates are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The French fleet {{arrived at}} Delaware Bay on 8 July 1778, under Admiral d'Estaing, with whom General Washington planned to attack Newport, Rhode Island, {{the other major}} British base in the north. Lafayette and General Greene were sent with a 3,000-man force to {{participate}} in the attack. Lafayette wanted to control a joint Franco-American force but was rebuffed by <b>the</b> <b>admiral.</b> On 9 August, the American land force attacked the British without consulting d'Estaing. When the Americans asked <b>the</b> <b>admiral</b> to place his ships in Narragansett Bay, d'Estaing refused and, at sea, sought to defeat the British fleet. The fighting was inconclusive as a storm scattered and damaged both fleets.|$|E
5000|$|After one season, the Oilers {{announced}} they had sold <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> franchise to <b>the</b> Mango Media Group. <b>The</b> <b>Admirals</b> continued <b>the</b> Oilers affiliation {{under the new}} ownership {{for the rest of}} the 2016-17 season. In 2017-18, <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> left <b>the</b> Oilers' organization and affiliated with the Nashville Predators. On June 1, 2017, <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> reveled their new logo which is similar to the logo of <b>the</b> original <b>Admirals</b> ECHL team and has similar colors to their NHL affiliate.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Admirals</b> were {{purchased}} in June 2005 {{by a group}} of investors, led by Harris J. Turer, including Milwaukee Brewers owner Mark Attanasio, assistant general manager Gord Ash, and pitcher Ben Sheets.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Admirals</b> {{first game}} was in December 2002. In a rain soaked game <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> lost 28-18 to the Dublin Rebels in an 8-a-side {{challenge}} match. Despite the loss the performance held encouraging signs for the team, and increased enthusiasm in the club.The team {{stepped up to}} 11-a-side {{for the next two}} friendly matches. Unfortunately both games resulted in defeat for <b>the</b> <b>Admirals,</b> going down 26-12 to the Dublin Rebels and 8-0 to the Dublin Dragons.In the 2003 season, the club's first season of IAFL league play, the team managed only a 1-5 record. The first victory came in the spring of 2003, defeating the UL Vikings in an 8-a-side contest. The club would get its first 11-a-side victories against the same side that winter in two challenge games.The following year saw <b>the</b> Cork <b>Admirals</b> improve to a 3-5 record in the expanded IAFL. Despite this the Dublin Dragons, with a similar 3-5 record beat <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> to <b>the</b> final playoff spot. The final game of that season was <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> best performance, beating the Dublin Dragons 68-20 at Pfizer Sports Grounds.The Admirals held a recruitment drive in the Autumn of 2004, adding starting players and depth alike. Many of <b>the</b> current <b>Admirals</b> players were found in this recruitment drive. A victory against Limerick in a November challenge game introduced <b>the</b> rookies to <b>Admirals</b> football and prepared them for <b>the</b> season ahead.The <b>Admirals</b> season got off to a poor start when the U.L. Vikings recorded their first ever win over the Cork side. This started a four-game losing spell for <b>the</b> <b>Admirals,</b> despite some encouraging performances and close losses, as injuries and low squad numbers took their toll. The Summer brought about improved play from <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> and <b>the</b> results followed. <b>The</b> <b>Admirals</b> won three of their final four contests of the season, including two home wins to clinch a playoff spot, and return <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> to playoff contender status.The Belfast Bulls, league winners in 2005, proved too strong for <b>the</b> <b>Admirals,</b> however, ending <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> hopes for a Shamrock Bowl berth that season. In May 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> encountered financial problems and briefly halted playing operations. However, they have now made a return guided by a core nucleus of young players, and having won the IAFL-1 with an undefeated season in 2016, reentered the Shamrock Bowl Conference for 2017.|$|R
5|$|But <b>the</b> <b>Admiral</b> {{was never}} {{assigned}} another command. Concluding {{that he was}} being held up as a scapegoat, and feeling bitter that the country and the Navy had abandoned him suddenly at the moment of the Navy's greatest accomplishment, Murray left Canada for the United Kingdom in September 1945, and officially retired from the Navy on 14 March 1946.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Byzantine {{military}} failures forced another {{change of}} government in Constantinople: <b>the</b> <b>admiral</b> Romanos Lekapenos replaced Zoe as regent of the young Constantine VII in 919, forcing her back into a convent. Romanos betrothed his daughter Helena Lekapene to Constantine and advanced {{to the rank of}} co-emperor in December 920, effectively assuming the government of the empire, which was largely what Simeon had planned to do.|$|E
5|$|National Park Service {{officials}} {{criticized the}} construction of <b>the</b> <b>Admiral</b> Clarey bridge fearing that by connecting road traffic to the mainland, the increased flow of island visitors would {{raise the level of}} theft of historical artifacts from the USS Arizona and other memorials on or around Ford Island.|$|E
50|$|Wilson joined <b>the</b> Milwaukee <b>Admirals</b> of <b>the</b> International Hockey League (IHL) as an {{assistant}} coach, working under Head Coach Ron Lapointe.

50|$|In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> {{made their}} first Shamrock Bowl {{with a victory}} over the Dublin Rebels 8-6 in the Semi finals. The team faced IAFL South {{division}} rivals, the UL Vikings. In a very tight contest, <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> were unable to beat the Vikings. The game finished 22-14.

50|$|Norfolk {{was one of}} two franchises in the AHL named <b>the</b> <b>Admirals,</b> sharing <b>the</b> {{nickname}} with <b>the</b> Milwaukee <b>Admirals.</b> <b>The</b> Milwaukee franchise {{transferred from}} the defunct International Hockey League, and were allowed to keep their previous moniker.Norfolk's geographically closest rivals were the Hershey Bears, Charlotte Checkers, and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. <b>The</b> <b>Admirals</b> had two mascots, a dog named Salty and a rabbit named Hat Trick.|$|R
5|$|Arriving in Mexico on 20 March, {{the fleet}} {{underwent}} {{three weeks of}} target practice. Rear Admiral Evans was relieved of command during this time, as he was completely bedridden and in constant pain, so on 30 March, Connecticut set sail north at full speed. She was met two days later by the schooner , which took <b>the</b> <b>admiral</b> to a hospital. Connecticut traveled back south to rejoin the fleet, and Rear Admiral Charles M. Thomas took Evans's place on Connecticut as {{the commander of the}} fleet, which continued its journey north, bound for California.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1405, the Yongle Emperor {{entrusted}} his favored eunuch commander Zheng He (1371–1433) as <b>the</b> <b>admiral</b> for {{a gigantic}} new fleet of ships designated for international tributary missions. The Chinese had sent diplomatic missions over land since the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE) {{and engaged in}} private overseas trade, but these missions were unprecedented in grandeur and scale. To service seven different tributary voyages, the Nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from 1403 to 1419, including treasure ships measuring 112m (370ft) to 134m (440ft) in length and 45m (150ft) to 54m (180ft) in width.|$|E
5|$|Chikhachov {{instructed}} Andrey Toropov of the Nikolaev Shipyard {{to draft}} two proposals, one armed with 10-inch {{and the other}} with 12-inch guns. Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least 8,880 tons. Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC. <b>The</b> <b>admiral</b> himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12-inch caliber, which had already become a worldwide battleship standard, but the NTC strongly advised against it. The Navy brass spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates. They agreed to increase displacement to 8,880 tons and were leaning toward accepting 12-inch guns when General Admiral Grand Duke Alexey resolved the discussion in favor of the smaller caliber.|$|E

5000|$|On September 15, 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> {{made their}} {{hometown}} debut against the defending league champion Essex 73's. <b>The</b> <b>Admirals</b> would fall 6-0 {{in front of}} a sold-out crowd. Chris Wallace played the entire game for <b>the</b> <b>Admirals,</b> making 29 saves. [...] The next night, <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> traveled to Wheatley, Ontario for their first road game and came home with their first win. Josh Lafromboise scored the Admirals' first ever goal at 10:38 into the first period and Dan Matoski scored the game winner 1:54 in the third to take a 6-4 victory over the Wheatley Sharks. Chris Wallace picked up the first ever victory in net.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Admirals</b> were {{owned by}} Chris Glisson, former {{co-owner}} of fellow ABA teams the Smoky Mountain Jam and Tri-City Racers. Glisson hopes {{to set up}} a similar arena for <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> in time for the 2016 season.|$|R
5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. <b>The</b> <b>admiral</b> {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E
5|$|Diplomacy failed despite {{continuing}} pressure {{applied by}} the Allies against Athens. On 24 November, du Fournet presented a 7-day ultimatum demanding the immediate surrender {{of at least}} ten Greek mountain artillery batteries. Du Fournet was instructed not {{to use force to}} take possession of the batteries. <b>The</b> <b>admiral</b> made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands. He advised the king that he would land an Allied contingent, and occupy certain positions in Athens until all the demands were accepted by Greece. The king said that the citizens of Greece, as well as the army, were against disarmament, and only promised that the Greek forces would not attack the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Foley's {{attack was}} {{followed}} by Hood in Zealous, who also crossed the French line and successfully anchored next to Guerrier in the space Foley had intended, engaging the lead ship's bow from close range. Within five minutes Guerriers foremast had fallen, to cheers from the crews of the approaching British ships. The speed of the British advance took the French captains by surprise; they were still aboard Orient in conference with <b>the</b> <b>admiral</b> when the firing started. Hastily launching their boats, they returned to their vessels. Captain Jean-François-Timothée Trullet of Guerrier shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on Zealous.|$|E

50|$|Two decades later, in 1967, the Vet hosted {{professional}} football again. <b>The</b> Long Beach <b>Admirals</b> were {{admitted to the}} Continental Football League {{as part of the}} league's expansion to the west coast. But <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> wouldn't last long: they drew only 2,475 fans for an exhibition game, then just 950 customers for their regular season opener, a 37-13 loss to the Seattle Rangers. After the disastrous gates, <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> applied for an immediate transfer to Portland, Oregon; this was denied, and <b>the</b> <b>Admirals</b> faded into history.|$|R
50|$|The Painters {{were best}} remembered for its rivalry with <b>the</b> Ysmael Steel <b>Admirals</b> from 1958 to 1967.

5|$|For {{ten minutes}} after the {{explosion}} there was no firing; sailors from both sides were either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. At 22:10, Franklin restarted the engagement by firing on Swiftsure. Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and <b>the</b> <b>admiral,</b> suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of Swiftsure and Defence. More than half of Franklins crew had been killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{does not}} mention {{specific}} figures for casualties, merely saying that losses were heavy on both sides. The Sicyonians in particular suffered, also losing their general Perilaus. On the Persian side, <b>the</b> <b>admiral</b> Mardontes and the general Tigranes were both killed, though Artayntes escaped. Herodotus says that a few Persians troops escaped the battle and {{made their way to}} Sardis. Diodorus claims that there were 40,000 Persian casualties, and also suggests that the survivors made their way to Sardis.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Roa Bastos adapted Yo, el Supremo for the screen.

60|$|The {{wind was}} fair, {{and the next}} morning the Viper passed through the Needles, and soon {{afterwards}} anchored at Spithead. Here a large number of men-of-war and frigates were at anchor, and above two of the largest floated <b>the</b> flags of <b>admirals.</b> <b>The</b> Viper had made her signal as she came in sight of the fleet, and a reply was instantly run up from the masthead of <b>the</b> <b>admiral's</b> ship, directing <b>the</b> captain to come on board immediately the anchor was dropped. The moment this was done the captain's gig was lowered, and calling to Harry to follow him the captain took his seat in the stern-sheets, and rowed for <b>the</b> <b>admiral's</b> ship. Directing <b>the</b> lad to remain on deck, the captain at once entered <b>the</b> <b>admiral's</b> cabin, and a few minutes later <b>the</b> <b>admiral's</b> orderly summoned Harry to enter.|$|R
5|$|In 2001 his work, The Hope, for brass band, choir, {{organ and}} percussion, was given its first {{performance}} during the {{commemoration of the}} 200th anniversary of the Battle of Copenhagen.

5|$|In December 1780, General Clinton sent Brigadier General Benedict Arnold (who {{had changed}} sides the {{previous}} September) with about 1,700 troops to Virginia {{to carry out}} raiding and to fortify Portsmouth.

Seeking to trap Arnold between Lafayette's army and a French naval detachment, Washington sought <b>the</b> <b>Admiral</b> Chevalier Destouches, {{the commander of the}} French fleet at Newport for help. Destouches was restrained by the larger British North American fleet anchored at Gardiner's Bay off the eastern end of Long Island, and was unable to help.|$|E
5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new system that would ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with <b>the</b> <b>admiral</b> wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E
