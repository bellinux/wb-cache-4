People living with HIV (PLWH) have {{numerous}} medical and psychosocial needs that impact HIV disease progression and challenge treatment outcomes. PurposeUsing CDC 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Program Collaboration and Service Integration (PCSI) framework, we examined strategies, challenges, and lessons learned from a local health department 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s efforts to institute PCSI to address the diverse needs of their patients with HIV. MethodsWe captured case study data through: 1) semi-structured interviews with key program administrators, 2) analysis of program documents, and 3) site observations and review of clinic procedures. ResultsFindings highlight the importance of co-locating services, partnering <b>to</b> <b>leverage</b> <b>resources,</b> and conducting cross-training of staff. Providing co-located services reduced wait times and enhanced coordination of care. Partnering <b>to</b> <b>leverage</b> <b>resources</b> increased patient referrals and enhanced access to comprehensive services. Staff cross-training resulted in more coordinated care and efficient service delivery. ConclusionThe results show that PCSI is essential for optimal care for PLWH. Incorporating PCSI was a vital component of the health department 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s comprehensive approach to addressing the multiple medical and support service needs of its HIV-infected clients.
