40|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation negative ions {{have been detected}} by mass spectrometry following vacuum-UV photoexcitation of <b>trifluorochloromethane</b> (CF_ 3 Cl), trifluorobromomethane (CF_ 3 Br) and trifluoroiodomethane (CF_ 3 I). The anions F^-, X^-, F_ 2 ^-, FX^-, CF^-, CF_ 2 ^- and CF_ 3 ^- were observed from all three molecules, where X = Cl, Br or I, and their ion yields recorded in the range 8 - 35 eV. With the exception of Br^- and I^-, the anions observed show a linear dependence of signal with pressure, showing that they arise from unimolecular ion-pair dissociation. Dissociative electron attachment, following photoionization of CF_ 3 Br and CF_ 3 I {{as the source of}} low-energy electrons, is shown to dominate the observed Br^- and I^- signals, respectively. Cross sections for ion-pair formation are put on to an absolute scale by calibrating the signal strengths with those of F^- from both SF_ 6 and CF_ 4. These anion cross sections are normalized to vacuum-UV absorption cross sections, where available, and the resulting quantum yields are reported. Anion appearance energies are used to calculate upper limits to 298 K bond dissociation energies for D^ 0 (CF_ 3 -X) which are consistent with literature values. We report new data for D^ 0 (CF_ 2 I^ [...] F) ≤ 2. 7 ± 0. 2 eV and Δ_fH^ 0 _ 298 (CF_ 2 I^+) ≤ (598 ± 22) kJ mol^- 1. No ion-pair formation is observed below the ionization energy of the parent molecule for CF_ 3 Cl and CF_ 3 Br, and only weak signals (in both I^- and F^-) are detected for CF_ 3 I. These observations suggest neutral photodissociation is the dominant exit channel to Rydberg state photoexcitation at these lower energies...|$|E
