25|$|Throughout {{the course}} of Life on Mars, Sam's {{uncertainty}} is reinforced by frequent paranormal phenomena, such as hearing voices and seeing images from 2006 on radios, telephones, and televisions. The voices discuss his medical condition, leading him to partially {{believe that he is}} in a coma. Other elements suggest to him that he is insane, such as his frequent and unexpected encounters with the <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> Girl from <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F, who speaks directly to him. Annie Cartwright partially persuades Sam that he is truly in 1973, arguing that his mind would be unable to fabricate the amount of detail and tangibility in the world where he finds himself, evidence that he is in fact in 1973.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{repeatability}} and reliability of a new phoria test as compared to established phoria tests and to assess the possibility of mobile or online testing using the auto-flashed presentation. Near dissociated phoria was measured using the von Graefe method, the Howell <b>card</b> <b>test,</b> the modified Thorington test, and a new dichromatic <b>card</b> <b>test</b> (Red-Blue Phoria <b>card</b> test; RBP <b>card</b> <b>test)</b> on 109 subjects. The inter-examiner difference and test-retest difference were calculated. With the auto-flashed presentation of the RBP <b>card</b> <b>test,</b> near dissociated phoria was measured and the intraclass correlation coefficient and test-retest repeatability was assessed on 26 subjects. The variation in inter-examiner repeatability was the smallest for the modified Thorington test (+ 3. 1 /- 2. 6). The RBP <b>card</b> <b>test</b> was + 3. 0 /- 3. 1, the Howell <b>card</b> <b>test</b> was + 3. 5 /- 2. 7, and the von Graefe test was + 6. 2 /- 6. 0. The variation in test-retest repeatability was the smallest for the RBP <b>card</b> <b>test</b> (+ 0. 4 /- 1. 4). The modified Thorington test was + 1. 3 /- 1. 3, the Howell <b>card</b> <b>test</b> was + 1. 27 /- 1. 45, and the von Graefe test was + 1. 59 /- 2. 20. The ICC was 0. 919 for the auto-flashed presentation of the RBP <b>card</b> <b>test.</b> The RBP <b>card</b> <b>test</b> is considered a highly repeatable method clinically and can be made a useful application for testing in mobile or online...|$|R
25|$|Throughout the series, Tyler {{frequently}} hears {{and sees}} things {{from his life}} in 2006.

500|$|... 2007–08: To {{advertise}} Toshiba's television sets, a <b>test</b> <b>card</b> {{based on}} BBC's <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F is shown on a Toshiba Regza TV {{on the new}} Toshiba Spectacular, with a pinhole shutter in the middle instead of the reference photograph. This shutter opens and closes every second to reveal the seconds in silver numbers, which then zoom outwards. After 25 seconds, lightning begins to randomly flash across the countdown, getting more intense as it approaches midnight. At midnight, the card explodes and the words [...] "HAPPY NEW YEAR” fade in as confetti showers down. The background fades from black to orange and back every 10 seconds. [...] This {{was the first time}} Toshiba was involved in the countdown as they took over the screen from Discover Card before the ball drop. From this point onwards, the countdown would involve the numbers zooming out in any matter. Even though the countdowns were sponsored by Toshiba, they were titled [...] "Pontiac G8 Countdowns".|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the whole blood immunochromatographic <b>card</b> <b>test</b> (ICT <b>card</b> <b>test)</b> {{in a survey}} performed in Northeastern Brazil. 625 people were examined by the thick blood film (TBF) and ICT <b>card</b> <b>test.</b> Residents of a non-endemic area were also tested by the whole blood <b>card</b> <b>test</b> and Og 4 C 3. The sensitivity of the ICT <b>card</b> <b>test</b> was 94. 7 % overall, but lower in females than males, based on the reasonable assumption that TBF is 100 % specific. However, since TBF and other methods have unknown sensitivity, the true specificity of the <b>card</b> <b>test</b> is unknown. Nevertheless, {{it is possible to}} estimate upper and lower limits for the specificity, and relate it to the prevalence of the disease. In the endemic area, the possible range of the specificity was from 72. 4 % to 100 %. 29. 6 % of the <b>card</b> <b>tests</b> performed in the non-endemic area exhibited faint lines that were interpreted as positives. Characteristics of the method including high sensitivity, promptness and simplicity justify its use for screening of filariasis. However, detailed information about the correct interpretation in case of extremely faint lines is essential. Further studies designed to consider problems arising from imperfect standards are necessary, as is a sounder diagnostic definition for the <b>card</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} American Dade (Biokit Laboratories) rapid plasma reagin (Dade RPR) <b>card</b> <b>test,</b> {{currently}} used in Spain for {{the diagnosis of}} syphilis, which has been recently released to the U.

Used {{as a basis for}} comparison with the Dade <b>card</b> <b>test</b> were the 18 -mm standard rapid plasma reagin (standard RPR) <b>card</b> <b>test</b> and the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide test, using both fresh sera obtained from 505 individuals and paired serum-plasma specimens from 174 individuals. Results obtained proved the Dade RPR <b>card</b> <b>test</b> with serum to be very similar to the standard RPR card test; sensitivity was 92. 3 % and specificity was approximately 99 % for both RPR <b>card</b> <b>tests.</b> Although the sensitivity of the VDRL slide test was lower at 88. 5 %, its specificity was also approximately 99 %. Quantitatively, the agreement +/- 1 dilution between the two <b>card</b> <b>tests</b> was 93. 6 %. Agreement +/- 1 dilution between the Dade RPR <b>card</b> <b>test</b> and the VDRL slide test was 46. 5 % for sera, comparable to the standard RPR-VDRL agreement of 50 %. In the limited evaluation of the RPR <b>card</b> <b>tests</b> with plasma, the specificity was 99. 4 % and the sensitivity was 100 % for both tests. Quantitative agreement +/- 1 dilution between plasma and serum pairs was 100 % for the Dade RPR <b>card</b> <b>test.</b> Our results showed that the Dade RPR <b>card</b> <b>test</b> is as sensitive and as specific as the standard RPR <b>card</b> <b>test.</b> Therefore, it was concluded that one <b>card</b> <b>test</b> has no particular advantage over the other...|$|R

Instead, a stop-motion {{animation}} video was created by Chris Hopewell. The video debuted on the Times Square Jumbotron in New York on 20 May 2003, and received hourly play that day on MTV2. In June, Radiohead relaunched their website, featuring digital animations on the themes of mass-media culture and 24-hour cities. In the same month, Radiohead launched radiohead.tv, where short films, music videos and live webcasts from the studio were streamed at scheduled times.

Whether this nonadditive genetic variance is due to a major autosomal gene is equivocal based on results from segregation and linkage analysis. There is no evidence for genetic variance for Mental Rotations or Hidden Patterns, in contrast to previous findings suggesting major gene involvement (Ashton et al., 1979). If spatial ability is due, in part, to an autosomal major gene, the gene has variable expression (reflected in different tests) or genetic heterogeneity is pronounced...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{revealed}} in the final episode that Sam's coma had lasted so long {{because he had a}} tumour of the brain. Tyler comes to believe the tumour is embodied by Hunt, and begins to think that by bringing Hunt down, his own body can recover. To this end, Tyler begins to collaborate with Frank Morgan (Ralph Brown) to bring Hunt down. While Tyler and the team are engaged in a firefight with armed robbers, Sam returns to 2008. He eventually comes to realise that he has become used to, and enjoys, the 1970s, seeing it as his [...] "real world". In an attempt to get back to 1973 to save Annie {{and the rest of the}} team from death, Sam leaps off of the roof of the police station, arriving back in 1973 and saving the team, promising never to leave them again. Writer Matthew Graham wrote the scene to indicate that Sam is now in the afterlife, but acknowledged that the ending is ambiguous and open to other interpretations, such as lead actor John Simm's belief that Sam may not have returned to the present. In the final scene, the team drive off, with Sam and Gene bickering as usual. Children run past, including the girl from <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F who symbolizes the death that has been stalking Sam since the beginning.
