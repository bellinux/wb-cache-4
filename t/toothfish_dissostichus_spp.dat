40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} {{was carried out in}} February 1999 at South Georgia (Subarea 48. 3) {{to examine the effects of}} different weighting regimes on the incidental mortality of birds caught on longlines fishing for <b>toothfish</b> (<b>Dissostichus</b> <b>spp.).</b> Three regimes were examined, with weights of 4. 25, 8. 5 and 12. 75 kg attached at 40 m intervals on a Spanishrigged longline. There was a significant reduction in bird mortality when 8. 5 kg was used compared to 4. 25 kg, but no further significant reduction when 12. 75 kg was used. Therefore to minimise seabird by-catch, line-weighting regimes of at least 8. 5 kg at 40 m intervals should be used. Results suggested that seabird by-catch on lines using effective weighting regimes may be even further reduced where all lines being set in the vicinity use effective line-weighting regimes. The importance of a good design in experiments of this type is emphasised, because even though conditions may be held as constant as possible within experiments, the ability to separate treatment effects from other sources of variation (e. g. environmental factors) must be preserved...|$|E
40|$|Key {{aspects of}} illegal, unreported and {{unregulated}} (IUU) fishing are grouped within four tactical challenges. These challenges are {{analogous to the}} four-block military dimensions of immediate action, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and psychological/information operations. They are nested within an overarching strategy focused on sustainable and responsible fishing, and are grouped within a tactical construct of five operational entities (beneficial owner, regulatory authority, Flag State, Port State and consumer). Sustainable and responsible fishing activities converge to meet the tactical challenges above through conservation measures agreed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). For fisheries management purposes, adaptable, flexible and tactical, execution of strategically formulated compliance-enforcement measures must be tailored to address higher-order goals, including coherent action for effective compliance-enforcement.

40|$|Cephalopods have a {{key role}} in the marine {{environment}} though knowledge of their distribution and trophic ecology is limited by a lack of observations. This is particularly true for Antarctic species. Toothfish species are key predators of cephalopods and may be viewed as ideal biological samplers of these species. A total of 256 cephalopod lower beaks were identified from the stomachs of Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> (<b>Dissostichus</b> eleginoides) and Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> (<b>Dissostichus</b> mawsoni), captured in fisheries of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands in the South Atlantic between March and April 2009. Long-armed octopus squid (Kondakovia longimana) and smooth-hooked squid (Moroteuthis knipovitchi) were the main cephalopod prey and both were predated upon wherever toothfish were captured, though this cephalopod species appear to inhabit deeper waters at the South Sandwich Islands than at South Georgia. Measurements of δ 13 C from beak material indicated a clear segregation of habitat use comparing adult and sub-adult sized K. longimana. Variation in δ 15 N with size indicated an ontogenetic shift in the diet of cephalopods and also suggested some trophic plasticity among years. This study provides new insights into the private life of some elusive Antarctic cephalopods in an underexplored region of the South Atlantic...|$|R
50|$|In a study, {{the stomach}} {{contents}} of a top predator in sub-antarctic waters, the Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> (<b>Dissostichus</b> eleginoides), were examined {{in order to see}} what octopuses and squid formed part of the diet.

In waters around the Crozet Islands, 53 beaks of S. gilchristi were found among a total of 1725 cephalopod beaks, and this cirrate octopus formed 3% of the diet of the toothfish. This study extended the range of S. gilchristi into the southern Indian Ocean.|$|R

Overall, the trends looks like a 30-40% reduction over 90 years (3 generations). Illegal or unregulated fishing in the Indian Ocean for the Patagonian <b>toothfish,</b> <b>Dissostichus</b> eleginoides resulted in 10-20,000 dead albatrosses, mainly this species, in 1997 and 1998.

40|$|The diets of Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> <b>Dissostichus</b> mawsoni and Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> <b>Dissostichus</b> eleginoides were {{examined}} around the South Sandwich Islands in the Southern Ocean, one of few regions with overlapping {{populations of the}} two species. Despite large differences {{in the proportion of}} stomachs containing prey (76. 2 % of D. mawsoni compared to 7. 2 % of D. eleginoides), diet composition was broadly similar (Schoener overlap index of 74. 4 % based on prey mass) with finfishes (particularly macrourids and muraenolepidids) and cephalopods (mainly Kondakovia longimana) comprising > 90 % of the prey mass of both species. Predation rates of the main fish prey, as mean counts per stomach sampled, were spatially correlated with their relative abundance around the islands derived from fishery by-catch data, suggesting a general lack of prey selectivity. This study supports the view that bathyal Dissostichus are opportunistic carnivores and finds that D. mawsoni and D. eleginoides occupy a similar trophic niche and are likely to compete for prey in regions where both are distributed. The large increase in rate of prey occurrence and size of prey in D. mawsoni stomachs relative to D. eleginoides suggests, however, species differences in feeding behaviour, which may reflect the increased metabolic demands of a cold-water adapted physiology.

40|$|The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) {{is bound}} by its Article II, 3 to follow an {{ecosystem}} approach to management. This {{approach has been}} extended to {{the application of a}} precautionary approach in the late 1980 s. In our review, we deal primarily with the science-related aspects of CCAMLR and its development towards an ecosystem approach to the management of the living resources of the Southern Ocean. To assist the Commission in meeting its objectives, as set out in Article II, 3, the Scientific Committee established the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Programme to detect possible effects of krill fishing on the performance of top-level predators, such as albatrosses, penguins, petrels and fur seals. Fisheries in the Southern Ocean followed the fate of other fisheries worldwide in which target species were depleted to low level one after the other. Currently, two types of fisheries are open: the longline fisheries on Patagonian <b>toothfish</b> (<b>Dissostichus</b> eleginoides) and Antarctic <b>toothfish</b> (<b>Dissostichus</b> mawsoni) and the trawl fisheries on mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari). Both fisheries are managed in a single-species context, however, with conservation measures in place to protect by-catch species, such as rattails (Macrouridae) and skates and rays (Rajidae). Two major problems still exist in fisheries in the Southern Ocean: the by-catch of birds in longline fisheries primarily in the Indian Ocean and the high level of IUU fishing again in the Indian Ocean. Both, the by-catch of birds and high IUU catches undermine the credibility of CCAMLR to safeguard the marine living resources in the Southern Ocean...|$|R

40|$|During {{seven days}} of {{operations}} involving the setting and hauling of longlines to catch the <b>toothfish</b> <b>Dissostichus</b> eleginoides around the South Sandwich Islands, actual and potential interactions with seabirds were assessed. Bird numbers increased rapidly after dawn and large numbers of Cape, giant and storm petrels and smaller numbers of white-chinned petrels and black-browed albatrosses were present during day hauling operations. No incidental mortality was seen and only one bird was caught on a hook; nevertheless many species in these aggregations of birds are clearly potentially vulnerable to setting operations in daylight hours. Several species of the seabirds present presumably originated from South Georgia populations; however wandering and grey-headed albatrosses, whose populations are in serious decline at South Georgia, were rare; their vulnerability to longlining operations in the South Sandwich Islands may, therefore, be low. Quantitative data and observations of longline vessels fishing around South Georgia, however, indicate significant catch rates of albatrosses...|$|R
