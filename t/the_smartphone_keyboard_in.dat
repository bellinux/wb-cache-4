40|$|Mobile devices with touch {{keyboards}} {{have become}} ubiquitous, but text entry on these devices remains slow and errorprone. Understanding touch patterns during text entry {{could be useful}} in designing robust error-correction algorithms for soft <b>keyboards.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we present an analysis of text input behaviors on a soft QWERTY <b>keyboard</b> <b>in</b> three different text entry postures: index finger only, one thumb, and two thumb. Our work expands {{on the work of}} [1] by considering the entire surface area of digit contact with <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> <b>keyboard,</b> rather than interpreting each touch as a single point. To do this, we captured touch areas for every key in a lab study with 8 participants and calculated offsets, error rates, and size measurements. We then repeated the original experiment described in [1] and showed that significant differences exist when basing offset calculations on touch area compared to touch points for two postures.

40|$|With laptops and desktops, the {{dominant}} method of text entry is the full-size keyboard; {{now with the}} ubiquity of mobile devices like smartphones, two new widely used methods have emerged: miniature touch screen keyboards and speech-based dictation. It is currently unknown how these two modern methods compare. We therefore evaluated the text entry performance of both methods in English and in Mandarin Chinese on a mobile <b>smartphone.</b> In <b>the</b> speech input case, our speech recognition system gave an initial transcription, and then recognition errors could be corrected using either speech again or <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> <b>keyboard.</b> We found that with speech recognition, the English input rate was 3. 0 x faster, and the Mandarin Chinese input rate 2. 8 x faster, than a state-of-the-art miniature <b>smartphone</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Further, with speech, the English error rate was 20. 4 % lower, and Mandarin error rate 63. 4 % lower, than the keyboard. Our experiment was carried out using Deep Speech 2, a deep learning-based speech recognition system, and the built-in Qwerty or Pinyin (Mandarin) Apple iOS keyboards. These results show that a significant shift from typing to speech might be imminent and impactful. Further research to develop effective speech interfaces is warranted. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

5000|$|Smartphone sensors: Researchers have {{demonstrated}} {{that it is possible}} to capture the keystrokes of nearby computer keyboards using only the commodity accelerometer found in <b>smartphones.</b> <b>The</b> attack is made possible by placing a <b>smartphone</b> near a <b>keyboard</b> on the same desk. <b>The</b> <b>smartphone's</b> accelerometer can then detect the vibrations created by typing on the keyboard, and then translate this raw accelerometer signal into readable sentences with as much as 80 percent accuracy. The technique involves working through probability by detecting pairs of keystrokes, rather than individual keys. It models [...] "keyboard events" [...] in pairs and then works out whether the pair of keys pressed is on the left or the right side of the keyboard and whether they are close together or far apart on the QWERTY keyboard. Once it has worked this out, it compares the results to a preloaded dictionary where each word has been broken down in the same way. Similar techniques have also been shown to be effective at capturing keystrokes on touchscreen <b>keyboards</b> while <b>in</b> some cases, in combination with gyroscope.|$|R

40|$|Smartphone {{capabilities}} {{have been}} increasing {{in the last}} years, and many applications have been developed {{in order to take}} advantage of these capabilities. Smartphone users, knowing that there are lots of applications to ease many daily tasks, or simply to have some fun, typically have <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> close by. One of the capabilities that have been explored is the detection of the physical state of <b>the</b> <b>smartphone,</b> through inertial sensors embedded in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone.</b> <b>The</b> smart-phone can detect its own orientation and even detect if it is being moved through sensors like the accelerometer, linear acceleration sensor or the gyroscope. Given that <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> can detect its own physical state and the fact that users often have their <b>smartphone</b> close by, <b>the</b> opportunity of developing a new natural and intuitive way of interacting with <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> arises, and this opportunity is related with gestures.

50|$|<b>Smartphones</b> with <b>the</b> Earthquake Network {{application}} installed are nodes of {{the sensor}} network of the Earthquake Network project.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} twofold: 1) To investigate an impact of software quality attributes of a learning management system (LMS) on students' satisfaction in both the personal computer and <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> settings; 2) To examine whether LMS quality factors have different impacts in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> context and <b>the</b> PC context. We explore five quality attributes of LMS (capability, usability, performance, reliability and documentation). Data from a survey of 193 students were analysed using ordered logit regression. Findings showed that while only usability and reliability significantly affected user satisfaction in the PC context; all the quality attributes except documentation had a significant influence on user satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> setting. We also found that reliability was twice as important to user satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> context as in the PC context.
