5|$|On October 27, 1945, the 65th Infantry sailed {{home from}} France. Arriving at Puerto Rico on November 9, 1945, they were {{received}} by <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> as national heroes {{and given a}} victorious reception at the Military Terminal of Camp Buchanan.|$|E
5|$|The American militias {{reflected}} the racial make-up of <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population.</b> For example, in 1820 the royalist army in Venezuela had 843 white (español), 5,378 Casta and 980 Indigenous soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{involvement}} of <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> and institutions, in relatively high numbers, {{in the destruction}} of Lithuanian Jewry became a defining factor of the Holocaust in Lithuania.|$|E

25|$|A 2012 {{study on}} Ethiopian Jews showed {{that while they}} are {{primarily}} related to <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations,</b> Ethiopian Jews have very distant genetic links to the Middle East from some 2,000 years ago, and are likely descended from a few Jewish founders. It was speculated that the community began when a few itinerant Jews settled in Ethiopia in ancient times, converted locals to Judaism, and married into <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Local {{conservation}} groups in Korea, {{such as at}} Yeosu, have started campaigning {{for the protection of}} <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{provision}} of nest boxes under the eaves of buildings {{and in other}} locations can be very successful in increasing <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population.</b> The upper bound {{to the number of}} barn owl pairs is set by food or nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{was erected}} at St Mary's Church and Grange Road cemetery in Gillingham, Kent. It was used from 1867 until 1973 when {{the site was}} largely cleared of memorials to provide a community open space for <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population.</b> Then Woodlands Road Cemetery was used {{and this is the}} site of HMS Glatton's Memorial with the graves of one officer and 56 men.|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} of Greece by the Ottoman Turks, the area of Trachones {{was turned into a}} Chiflik, and administered according to the Ottoman feudal system, with <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> becoming mandatory land peasants (koligoi). The church of the Presentation of Mary appears to remain the center of the area's civic life in the following centuries of Ottoman rule.|$|E
50|$|In 1900, poisons {{from the}} various {{minerals}} excavated at the nearby copper mine seeped into the river, poisoning <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> downstream.|$|R
50|$|Hayes Cottage Hospital {{opened in}} 1898 in Grange Road Hayes to provide {{medical care for}} <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> of Hayes, Harlington and Hillingdon. The 2-storey red brick {{building}} had five beds.|$|R

5|$|After the killings, Muslim Chetnik leader Ismet Popovac {{arrived in}} the town to console <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> and to advise the Chetniks there against {{committing}} further atrocities. He also attempted to convince local Muslims to join the Chetnik ranks but was unsuccessful due {{to the extent of}} Chetnik atrocities against the Muslim population.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post}} medieval period {{until the early}} 18th century it served as a {{hospital}} for <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population.</b> In 1829 repairs were carried out to the church. Excavations in 1885 found floor tiles with coats of arms and a pavement from the 14th century beneath which were several coffins. According {{to the findings of}} later resistivity and gradiometer surveys there may also have been a formal Tudor garden and there may have been fish ponds.|$|E
50|$|In {{one notable}} {{incident}} the Soviet Army committed mass killing of {{civilians in the}} summer of 1980. In order to separate the mujahideen from <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> and eliminate their support, the Soviet army killed and drove off civilians, and used scorched earth tactics to prevent their return. They used booby traps, mines, and chemical substances throughout the country. The Soviet army indescriminately killed combatants and noncombatants to ensure submission by <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations.</b> <b>The</b> provinces of Nangarhar, Ghazni, Lagham, Kunar, Zabul, Qandahar, Badakhshan, Lowgar, Paktia and Paktika witnessed extensive depopulation programmes by the Soviet forces.|$|R

50|$|Rautanen {{worked in}} Ovamboland over 50 years {{acting as the}} {{director}} of a missionary station established in Olukonda in 1880, translating the Bible, and very patiently educating <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>local</b> people to become pastors emerged in 1925.|$|R
5|$|For generations, Skagen's {{economy has}} been based on its fishing {{industry}} which continues to prosper today, facilitated by its fishing harbour, the largest in Denmark. Skagen also has the country's main herring processing facility and the world's largest fish oil factory. The town's evolving fishing industry led to considerable growth in <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> which reached some 11,500 in the 1960s. A fish auction is held at dawn in the harbour, and between May and October the harbour also attracts yachting enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Cheadle Hulme was rural countryside, {{made up of}} woods, open land, and farms. <b>The</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> {{was made up of}} farmers and peasants, living in small cottages and working the land under the tenancy of the Lord of the Manor. Most {{families}} kept animals for food, grew their own crops, and probably bought and sold produce at Stockport market. Water was obtained from local wells and ponds, and sometimes the Micker Brook.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two days, the Australians {{continued}} to provide protection to the US engineers before being replaced by an American infantry battalion. 1 RAR subsequently flew out on 26 February, returning to Bien Hoa airbase. Meanwhile, following the attack at Tan Binh the Viet Cong attempted to avoid further contact, choosing instead to harass the American work parties with occasional mortar and sniper fire. These tactics proved ineffective, and although the Americans lost a further three killed and 29 wounded, the road was completed by 2 March. The Americans then launched an extensive civic action program {{in an attempt to}} consolidate their gains, repairing damaged houses, distributing food and providing basic health care to <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population.</b> Despite such efforts though, American commanders were pessimistic about the possibility of achieving any long term gains in Binh Duong Province unless the South Vietnamese Army was able to provide lasting protection for <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population.</b> On 7 March, just five days after the completion of Operation Rolling Stone, the US 1st Brigade was redeployed with US 173rd Airborne Brigade and 1 RAR on Operation Silver City, sweeping the south-west sector of War Zone D.|$|E
25|$|Toward the 11th century, the nomadic Turkic tribes from Central Asia moved {{towards the}} Middle East and Anatolia and further altered the ethnic mix, {{at the expense}} of <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> of Kurds, Armenians and other natives.|$|R
50|$|Petroecuador {{has also}} contributed to certain human rights {{violations}} according to some critics. The violations are on the health basis concerning <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> due to bad practice of Petroecuador as well as foreign industries established within Ecuador.|$|R
50|$|According to The Economist, {{despite the}} heavy {{toll on the}} militants, their ranks {{appeared}} only to be growing, {{as a result of}} the harsh methods (such as collective punishment) used against <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> by <b>the</b> Egyptian security forces.|$|R
5|$|If genetic {{differentiation}} between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> {{and this may}} lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important {{for the development of}} the biological species concept.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, {{the missionary}} {{established}} a mission among the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations, where he repeated his Baie-Saint-Paul design: a log chapel at the centre surrounded by small cabins for <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population,</b> with outlying farms. The mission closed ten years later; Belcourt blamed this on mismanagement by oblates he had entrusted with its management. In 1845, Belcourt {{served as the}} chaplain to some buffalo hunters, but returned to his first mission at Baie-Saint-Paul to teach the Chippewa language {{to a group of}} oblates.|$|E
5|$|In 680 Bulgar tribes {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Asparukh moved south across the Danube and settled in the area between the lower Danube and the Balkan, establishing their capital at Pliska. A peace treaty with Byzantium in 681 {{marked the beginning of the}} First Bulgarian Empire. The Bulgars gradually mixed with <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population,</b> adopting a common language on the basis of the local Slavic dialect.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the other}} Indo-Arab Communities in India have {{migrated}} and mixed with <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> or have emigrated out of India for better employment and living conditions with majority of the Diaspora in the Middle East and Western countries.|$|R

50|$|According to oral histories, the Iban {{arrived in}} western Sarawak from Indonesia about 1675. After an initial phase of colonising and {{settling}} the river valleys, displacing or absorbing <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> of Bukitans and Serus, there began {{a period of}} total war.|$|R
5|$|In captivity, sarus cranes {{have been}} known to live for as long as 42 years. Premature adult {{mortality}} is often the result of human actions. Accidental poisoning by monocrotophos, chlorpyrifos and dieldrin-treated seeds used in agricultural areas has been noted. Adults {{have been known}} to fly into power lines and die of electrocution, this is responsible for killing about 1% of <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> each year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of Basil I's reign, Arab raids on the coasts of Dalmatia were {{successfully}} repelled, and the region once again came under secure Byzantine control. This enabled Byzantine missionaries to penetrate to the interior and convert the Serbs and the principalities of modern-day Herzegovina and Montenegro to Orthodox Christianity. An attempt to retake Malta ended disastrously, however, when <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> sided with the Arabs and massacred the Byzantine garrison.|$|E
5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they {{elevate the}} upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>population</b> was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{the devastation}} of <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> by disease, they {{suffered}} considerable enslavement, pillaging and destruction from warfare. The Spanish took thousands of women from <b>the</b> <b>local</b> natives to use as servants and concubines. As Pizarro and his men took over portions of South America, they plundered and enslaved countless people. Some <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> entered into vassalage willingly, to defeat the Inca. Native {{groups such as the}} Huanca, Cañari and Chachapoya fought alongside the Spanish as they opposed Inca rule. The basic policy of <b>the</b> Spanish towards <b>local</b> <b>populations</b> was that voluntary vassalage would yield safety and coexistence, while continued resistance would result in more deaths and destruction.|$|R
