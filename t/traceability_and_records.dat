40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} concept of {{electronic}} food traceability throughout the supply chain, {{with an emphasis on}} Traceable Resource Unit (TRU) identification, data management, and information exchange technologies from farm to fork. To accomplish these tasks, a UML (Unified Modeling Language) was used to create a product centric data model for managing TRU traceability data throughout the chain. After this step XML (Extensible Markup Language) schema was created using the UML model as a model foundation. The schema was used for the validation of XML files, which was written as an example of <b>traceability</b> information exchange <b>and</b> <b>record</b> keeping within <b>and</b> between supply chain parties. The model was able to represent production lots/batches and their sub components. The composition of a certain end product is then represented through modeling all its previous materials along with their intermediate relations. By registering all relations between each TRU, a method of tracking the composition of the end product was achieved. The second part of the thesis investigates the use of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for creating a farm based traceability system. The system was able to visually identify <b>and</b> <b>record</b> each activity at the farm level, therefore enhancing upstream supply chain traceability...|$|R

In response to this emerging requirement for product <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> verification of kangaroo meat integrity, the Queensland Kangaroo Industry Development Committee (KIDC) requested that an examination of options for traceability be undertaken. The report explores a number of options that will guarantee product <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> verification, and looks at how the system is integrated along the supply chain and the associated costs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to improve Icelandic and Capverdian fresh fish exports, by means of <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> quality related information. For that purpose, EU and US {{regulations}} regarding traceability were reviewed. Traceability is now a clear legal requirement and companies have to implement appropriate systems to stay competitive. An Icelandic fresh fish export chain was used to verify the implementation of <b>traceability</b> systems <b>and</b> to find the correlation between <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> quality management systems. The TraceFish standard for captured fish was also used as a tool to evaluate the traceability system implemented by each member in the chain. The quality related information kept by each member, especially the temperature records, was also studied. The results show that the TraceFish standard is practical and can be used by companies as a tool to implement/improve the traceability systems; they also showed that <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> quality related information is already combined to some extent. In a fresh fish export chain, the key factor is to maintain freshness. Although the chosen chain was short, relatively large fluctuations in the surrounding temperature were experienced. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} {{and organization of}} industries evolves over time in response {{to changes in the}} price and availability of inputs, changes in the demand for outputs and output attributes, and changes in technology. The growing demand for <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> assurance is a change in the demand for credence attributes. Firms that are able to organize to provide <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> assurance at low cost will, ceteris paribus, have an advantage. In recent years, many segments of the food and agribusiness industry have become more concentrated through horizontal or vertical integration within firms or within associations of firms (cooperatives).

40|$|<b>Traceability</b> <b>and</b> the {{management}} of tracing links are important for various reasons, including to manage knowledge about a complex software system, to monitor the progress of its development, and {{to prove that it}} is developed in accordance to regulations. However, maintaining tracing links and using them in a beneficial way proves to be challenging in practice. In this paper, we investigate <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> its management as a collaboration problem. Based on 15 industrial cases and 24 semi-structured interviews we identify a) challenges in collaborative <b>traceability</b> management <b>and</b> b) how <b>traceability</b> management can be used to enable collaboration. Our findings show that main challenges are boundaries between organizations and tools, a lack of common goals and responsibilities, and the difficulty of collaboratively maintaining trace links.

40|$|Currently {{the food}} safety {{has been the}} main issue of the customers' concerns, {{industries}} and government policies. Therefore, this study examines <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> recall plan in the plant processing and small medium enterprises (SMEs) in Sungai Petani, Kedah. Traceability is the process of tracking the flow of product through a supply chain. There are two types of traceability which are internal <b>and</b> external <b>traceability.</b> <b>Traceability</b> involves tracking <b>and</b> tracing activities. Malaysia had launched Malaysia Food Information <b>and</b> <b>Traceability</b> System since 2005 but the information are not published and rarely known. The objectives of the study for a food traceability system is to determine the level of <b>traceability</b> (internal <b>and</b> external) in the food processing plants, to examine the <b>traceability</b> method used <b>and</b> to document the constraints faced <b>and</b> benefits of <b>traceability</b> to the companies. To know the current situation of traceability system, a survey was conducted to 80 participants from processing plants and SMEs. Based on the survey, only 27. 5 % respondents knows about <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> only 31. 2 % implemented and plan to implement traceability system. The reasons why participants did not know about traceability were because they had never heard of it, no time, no training and bring no benefits to them. Hence, by this study, we can determine effectiveness of <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> examine what is the traceability used by the processing plants/SMEs. Most of the processing plants/SMEs used paper document <b>and</b> barcode as <b>traceability</b> method. However, there are some difficulties faced and benefits for implementing traceability in the industries. The difficulties faced by the companies for implementing traceability include cost, problem to get external funding to support traceability system, lack of qualified staff because of lack of education <b>and</b> training in <b>traceability</b> system <b>and</b> change to the production process needed if traceability were implemented. The outcomes of this study will provide information and awareness regarding the traceability system for the food processing plants/SMEs and other stakeholders in future...|$|R

30|$|This paper proposes two {{criteria}} {{to assess and}} compare the quality of (integrated) scenarios, namely scenario <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> scenario consistency. From a futures research perspective, both are identified as being central challenges to scenario quality. Traceability is a recognized standard of scenario communication but difficult to achieve in practice. Consistency, simultaneously a construction principle and a constitutive element of scenarios, {{is not easy to}} accomplish either. Integrated scenario methodologies, i.e., those approaches combining, e.g., ‘story and simulation’ (SAS), are especially challenged by both issues. In this paper, scenario <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> scenario consistency are more precisely defined and operationalized to allow for qualitative measurement, assessment and comparisons of different (integrated) scenario methodologies and their resulting socio-environmental scenarios. The criteria are applied empirically to new forms of integrated scenario methodologies. They serve to analyze two explorative case studies combining the systematic yet qualitative cross-impact balance analysis (CIB) with simulation. The criteria allow illuminating whether and on what dimensions and levels these new forms of integrated scenario methodologies do (or do not) support scenario consistency <b>and</b> scenario <b>traceability.</b> The empirical analysis shows that new integrated scenario methodologies combining CIB with numerical simulation present some new answers to the <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> consistency challenges of classical SAS approaches. The application suggests that the two criteria are appropriate and useful for assessing scenario quality from an academic perspective. Still, {{further research is needed to}} understand the relation of <b>traceability</b> <b>and</b> consistency to additional quality criteria that influence the practical usefulness of scenarios from a policy advice-oriented perspective.|$|R
