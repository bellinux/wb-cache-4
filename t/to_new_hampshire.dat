5|$|In New Hampshire {{the timber}} dispute was {{overlaid}} by ongoing disputes between local landowners and Samuel Allen, a London merchant who had acquired the territorial {{claims of the}} heirs of John Mason, the province's founder, and was pursuing them against those landowners. Allen, who had been commissioned governor of the province in 1692, only came to the colony in 1698 to take a direct interest in its affairs. During Bellomont's brief visit <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> in July and August 1699, Allen attempted to buy him to his side. Allen offered his daughter (with a large dowry) as a marriage match for the earl's son; Bellomont refused the offer.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable Crabbet-bred stallions Brown {{eventually}} kept at Maynesboro was *Astraled, {{who had come to}} America in 1909. This horse had been sold by Wilfrid Blunt to an American buyer from Massachusetts, but after siring only two purebred foals in New England, was sold to the remount, shipped west, and lived in obscurity in Oregon, where he sired no purebred Arabian offspring. *Astraled was ultimately obtained by Brown in 1923, who shipped the aged horse by rail from Idaho <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire.</b> *Astraled only sired one foal crop at Maynesboro, but that group of foals included his most notable American-bred son, Gulastra.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to run for President in 2016.

He instead moved <b>to</b> <b>New</b> <b>Hampshire</b> and ran for the Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen.
