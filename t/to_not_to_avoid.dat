The studio trained butoh artists Setsuko Yamada, Kota Yamazaki and others.

50|$|Pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} symptoms in patients undergoing surgery or cancer chemotherapy and various treatments are proposed for its relief, including relaxation techniques. Progressive muscle relaxation technique is suggested to lead to an increase in blood flow which supplies more oxygen, thus enhancing local metabolism, resulting in reduced pain and muscle spasms.Additionally, progressive muscle relaxation might reduce the perception of pain as well as providing pain relief by the patients after undergoing surgery. One of the recent study has been indicated “a significant tension decrease in all the types of muscle between pre- and post-relaxation situations for patients after surgery a result of Progressive Muscle Relaxation”. Also, the progressive muscle relaxation technique has been indicated to show some positive achievements in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain in women. In case of chronic pain it seems <b>to</b> be <b>not</b> possible <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the pain but possible <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the perceived threat (pain). Chronic pelvic pain often associated as results from abdominal functioning of the nervous system (often called “neuropathic pain“).

Here, the treatment aims to release tightness of the muscles in the abdomen and lower back, as well as musculoskeletal tension.|$|R
40|$|Question: Among {{women in}} labour, does {{sequential}} application of non-pharmacological interventions relieve labour pain, shorten labour, and delay pharmacological analgesia use? Design: Randomised trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: Eighty women admitted in labour {{at the end}} of a low-risk pregnancy. Intervention: Participants in the experimental group received three interventions for up to 40  minutes each in particular stages of labour: exercise on a Swiss ball at 4 to 5  cm of cervical dilation; lumbosacral massage at 5 to 6  cm dilation; and a warm shower at > 7  cm dilation. Participants in the control group received usual maternity unit care. Participants in both groups were encouraged <b>to</b> try <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> or delay use of pharmacological analgesia. Outcome measures: Pain severity was reported on a visual analogue scale. Maternal and neonatal data were collected from official birth records. Satisfaction with care was recorded with a questionnaire. Results: Some participants took analgesic medication before the study was complete, so pain was analysed with a last observation carried forward approach. In this analysis, the experimental group had significantly lower pain severity immediately after: exercises (MD 24  mm, 95 % CI 15 to 34), massage (14  mm, 95 % CI 4 to 25), and showering (17  mm, 95 % CI 5 to 29), which allowed delayed and reduced use of analgesic medication. Other significant benefits included: faster expulsion (MD 18  minutes, 95 % CI 5 to 30), improved neonatal status, and higher maternal satisfaction. No adverse effects were identified. Conclusion: This sequence of non-pharmacological interventions significantly reduced labour pain from 4  cm to beyond 7  cm of cervical dilation, as reflected in decreased and delayed use of analgesic medication. Women in labour could be encouraged to use these interventions, especially if they seek to minimise or delay use of analgesic medication. Trial registration: NCT 01389128.

40|$|Background: Although {{the use of}} TNF inhibitors has {{fundamentally}} {{changed the}} way rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is treated, not all patients respond well. It is desirable to facilitate the identification of responding and non-responding patients prior <b>to</b> treatment, <b>not</b> only <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> unnecessary treatment but also for financial reasons. In this work we have investigated the transcriptional profile of synovial tissue sampled from RA patients before anti-TNF treatment with the aim to identify biomarkers predictive of response. Methodology/Principal Findings: Synovial tissue samples were obtained by arthroscopy from 62 RA patients before the initiation of infliximab treatment. RNA was extracted and gene expression profiling was performed using an in-house spotted long oligonucleotide array covering 17972 unique genes. Tissue sections were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry to evaluate cell infiltrates. Response to infliximab treatment was assessed according to the EULAR response criteria. The presence of lymphocyte aggregates dominated the expression profiles and a significant overrepresentation of lymphocyte aggregates in good responding patients confounded the analyses. A statistical model {{was set up to}} control for the effect of aggregates, but no differences could be identified between responders and non-responders. Subsequently, the patients were split into lymphocyte aggregate positive- and negative patients. No statistically significant differences could be identified except for 38 transcripts associated with differences between good- and non-responders in aggregate positiv...|$|R
40|$|The ‘in vitro’ {{assessement}} of hydrodynamic {{performance of}} cardiac valve prostheses is {{regulated by the}} European Committee for Standardization - International Organization for Standardization (EN ISO) standard 5840, for both steady and unsteady flow conditions. From the engineering point of view, standard prescriptions for the experimental apparatus seem <b>to</b> be <b>not</b> sufficient <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> misleading evaluation of valve functionality under pulsatile flow. In particular, we here underline that the in vitro estimation of the valvular effective orifice area requires the measurement of the transvalvular pressure drop, but the standard does not specificy neither the geometry of the pulse duplicator in the proximity of pressure measuring sites nor the exact position of the pressure sites. Moreover, following standard prescription, pulsatile experiments {{must be carried out}} under a mean aortic pressure of 100 mmHg. However, literature data show that this latter mean pressure usually arises from quite different aortic pressure waveforms. We here underline that not only the mean pressure but pressure waveform as well affects the prosthetic valve performance in ‘in vitro’ tests. From the clinical perspective, the above sources of possible misleading evaluation of prostheses performance might lead to patience-prostesis mismatch, i. e. to hemodynamic performance lower than expected after valve implantation. For these reasons, we encourage an open discussion on possibile improvements of standard prescriptions and prosthetic valve assessment criteria...|$|R
40|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether anti-thrombotic treatment reduces {{the incidence of}} thrombo-embolism in patients with heart failure, {{so there is a}} need for a large scale controlled study to assess the effects of anti-thrombotic therapy in this setting. We report the design of a randomized controlled multicenter double blind trial examining the effects of aspirin, warfarin and placebo in patients with heart failure on the risk of thrombo-embolism. We planned to recruit 6000 patients with heart failure without contraindications to anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents and to follow them for a mean time of 2 years following randomization. The study was planned to determine the rate of thrombo-embolic and haemorrhagic events and death among patients randomized to aspirin, warfarin and placebo, strati®ed according to the presence or absence of underlying coronary disease. Ancillary studies parallel to the main study will attempt to identify clinical and echocardiographic risk factors for thrombo-embolism and will also examine whether hemostatic or neurohormonal mechanisms contribute to an increase in the risk of thrombo-embolism in patients with heart failure. We hoped that the results of the study would improve the clinical management and cost-effectiveness of treatment for patients with heart failure. However, the recruitment of patients proved more dif®cult than expected and a number of centers decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> participate. <b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> a great delay it was decided by the principal investigators and submitted to the executive committee to terminate enrolment in this study when 300 patients had been enrolled, and accept that this is a pilot study.

40|$|S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the {{substrate}} {{used in the}} methylation of homogalacturonan (HGA) in the Golgi apparatus. SAM is synthesized in the cytosol, {{but it is not}} currently known how it is then transported into the Golgi. In this study, we find that HGA methyltransferase is present in Golgi-enriched fractions and that its catalytic domain faces the lumen of this organelle. This suggests that SAM must be imported into the Golgi. We performed uptake experiments using [methyl- 14 C]SAM and found that SAM is incorporated into the Golgi vesicles, resulting in the methylation of polymers that are sensitive to pectinase and pectin methylesterase but <b>not</b> <b>to</b> proteases. <b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> detecting the transfer reaction, we also used [carboxyl- 14 C]SAM, the uptake of which into Golgi vesicles was found to be sensitive to temperature, detergents, and osmotic changes, and to be saturable with a Km of 33 μm. Double-label uptake experiments using [methyl- 3 H]SAM and [carboxyl- 14 C]SAM also revealed a time-dependent increase in the 3 H to 14 C ratio, suggesting that upon transfer of the methyl group, the resulting S-adenosylhomocysteine is not accumulated in the Golgi. SAM incorporation was also found to be inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine, whereas UDP-GalA, UDP-GlcA, and acetyl-CoA had no effect. DIDS, a compound that inhibits nucleotide sugar transporters, also had little effect upon SAM incorporation. Interestingly, the combination of UDP-GalA + acetyl-CoA or UDP-GlcA + acetyl-CoA produced a slight increase in the uptake of SAM. These results support the idea that a SAM transporter is required for HGA biosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Reserve took {{almost no}} steps {{to halt the}} slide into the Great Depression over 1929 – 33. Instead, the Federal Reserve acted as if {{appropriate}} policy was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the oncoming Great Depression, but {{to allow it to}} run its course and “liquidate ” the unprofitable portions of the private economy. In adopting such “liquidationist ” policies, the Federal Reserve was merely following the recommendations provided by an economic theory of depressions that was in fact common before the Keynesian Revolution and was held by economists like Friedrich Hayek, Lionel Robbins, and Joseph Schumpeter. This paper reconstructs the logic of this “liquidationist ” view, and argues that the perspective was carefully thought out (although <b>not</b> adequate <b>to</b> the Depression) and may have held some truth as applied to business cycles that came before the Great Depression. The inaction of the United States government during the 1929 – 33 slide into the Great Depression is both astonishing and puzzling when viewed from any of the perpectives held today. All points of view today hold that governments should strive to provide a stable environment in which the private economy can operate, and should do this by keeping some broad nominal aggregate measure of spending or liquidity on a stable growth path. For monetarist economists, the measure to be stabilized is some definition of the nominal money supply. 1 For Keynesians, the appropriate aggregate is total nominal demand itself. 2 As the conduct of economic policy while a depression is pending is concerned, these differences of opinion are relatively minor, for they all teach one central lesson: the central bank should pour reserves and liquidity into the banking system as fast a...|$|R

Human Rights Watch reports that there was mounting tension between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Taungoo for weeks before it erupted into violence in the middle of May 2001. Buddhist monks demanded that the Hantha Mosque in Taungoo be destroyed in [...] "retaliation" [...] for the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan. Mobs of Buddhists, led by monks, vandalised Muslim-owned businesses and property and attacked and killed Muslims in Muslim communities. On 15 May 2001, anti-Muslim riots broke out in Taungoo, Bago division, resulting in the deaths of about 200 Muslims, in the destruction of 11 mosques, and setting ablaze of over 400 houses. On this day also, about 20 Muslims praying in the Han Tha mosque were beaten, some to death, by the pro-junta forces. On 17 May 2001, Lt.

30|$|Progress {{in science}} and {{technology}} in recent decades, such as that made in medicine, has helped considerably to improve the living conditions and health of the populations of the industrialised countries, enabling people to reach a greater age and to live longer, quite often in full possession of their physical and cognitive faculties. Yet this progress has not intrinsically altered our perception of death, except to make it more unacceptable. Although death is seen as a natural phenomenon, part of the normal order of things, it is often an ordeal and a tragedy for those who witness it, as death is not merely the end of a life, but also the end of an existence, the loss of a unique individual who is special and irreplaceable. Death is thus experienced sometimes as an injustice, an outrage, whatever ideas, representations, and beliefs are held on what happens to the person after death, whether death is seen as annihilation or not, as an enigma, a mystery, a passage, a metamorphosis… For many people, whether or not death has meaning depends more on the sense, or lack of it, accorded to life, in accordance with their religious, spiritual or philosophical views. The perception of death differs according, for example, to whether life is held to have no meaning unless it is lived with full possession of all physical and mental faculties, or rather that {{it is part of a}} greater whole that includes, for example, an afterlife, which gives transcendent meaning to the hardships of the life that is coming to an end. It is the tension between the natural side of death and what death contributes to the meaning of life that is today at the heart of debates in France on the end of life. Medicine obviously is <b>not</b> immune <b>to</b> this tension. It responds to the tension through a form of prudential wisdom. Because medicine above all relates to human existences prey to diseases that may be seriously debilitating, life-threatening or life-ending. In the struggle for life, it is medicine’s task to preserve the conditions of a life sufficiently viable to give rise to a veritable existence, and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> seek <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> death indifferent <b>to</b> the conditions of the existence that ensues. It was in this spirit that the SRLF made its recommendations of 2002 on the withholding and withdrawal of treatment in intensive care [1]. These recommendations were updated in 2009 [2] and were fundamental in the drawing up of Leonetti’s law on the rights of patients and the end of life (No. 2005 – 370 of 22 April 2005). In 2010 an end-of-life issues group was tasked, among other things, with reviewing the state of knowledge on end-of-life conditions and related healthcare practices and with bringing to the public debate objective and reliable data on the reality of end-of-life situations in France. Once again it was the same spirit that drove the recent public debate led by Professor Didier Sicard, Honorary President of the French National Ethics Committee, who was asked by the French President to review end-of-life issues, with a view to drawing up a draft law on the end of life and palliative care.|$|R
