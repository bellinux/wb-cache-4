5|$|In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez {{became the}} first elected {{president}} of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> in 1974 {{and the end of}} Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability {{both on and off the}} pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such world-class players as Diego Maradona, Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, SBA became Subterráneos de Buenos Aires Sociedad del Estado (SBASE) under Buenos Aires mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore of the National Reorganisation Process {{military}} junta. After a {{long period}} of stagnation, the Underground began to be expanded again with Lines B and E within the scope of these plans, though only the extension of Line E was commenced and completed before the <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> where expansion was once again stalled. During this time, four Premetro feeder lines were planned leading out from the western termini of Lines D and E as well as one in Puerto Madero, however only Line E2 was completed in 1987 and these plans were scrapped in 1994 when operation of the Underground changed hands.|$|E
5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including a second one to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E

The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} super Barcelona {{has often been}} political. Though it is a club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona {{gradually}} became a club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced Barcelona's image as {{a focal point for}} Catalonism, and when Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the stadium of Barcelona became {{one of the few places}} the people could express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the 2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for Catalonia to become an independent state.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Diệm regime, Thảo was {{designated}} by the head of state Minh and the civilian Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ to create the nucleus of a group called the Council of Notables, and promote it to the public. which, as an interim body of prominent civilians, would advise the military junta before it handed over power to an elected legislature under civilian rule. The Council of 60 people, 58 men and 2 women, held its first meeting on 1 January 1964 in Saigon. The council was composed almost entirely of well-known professionals and academics and, as such, was hardly representative of South Vietnamese society; there were no delegates from the agricultural or labour sectors of the economy. It gained a reputation for being a forum of debate, rather than a means of enacting policy change and government programs for the populace. Thơ and Minh assigned Thảo with the task of encouraging a <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> by facilitating the formation of a few political parties. This was ineffective, as many political parties with only a handful of members sprang up and squabbled. Within 45 days of the coup, 62 parties had formed but nothing meaningful resulted. In the end, these efforts proved to be irrelevant as Minh's junta and the accompanying Council of Notables were overthrown {{before the end of the}} month. During this period, Thảo served as the head of military security and played a role in replacing Colonel Đỗ Khắc Mai with Nguyễn Cao Kỳ as the head of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. In the aftermath of the coup, Vietcong attacks increased markedly amid infighting among the Saigon leadership, which Thảo had helped to stir up.|$|E
5|$|Municipal {{elections}}, {{during which}} mayors are elected, take place every four years; they take place {{one year before}} presidential elections (since 2008) in the last Sunday of October. Candidates must comply a number of requisites in order {{to run for mayor}} of Pichilemu; those include: to have completed secondary education (Enseñanza Media), to be a citizen, literate, to have resided in the Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region {{for at least two years}} before the election, and to have their military status regularized. The mayor is usually sworn in on the 6 December following the election. The next election for the mayor will be in 2016. Municipal elections originally elected three mayors, called primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde, and a number of regidores. For example, the results of the first elections in Pichilemu, for the term between 1894 and 1897, showed José María Caro Martínez, Pedro Nolasco de Mira, and Francisco Reyes elected as the first primer, segundo, and tercer alcalde of Pichilemu, respectively. The role of the primer alcalde equals that of the current mayor of Pichilemu. However, voting was not popular: only taxpayers and landowners could vote. According to the Decree #5655 of 4 December 1945, regidores were popularly elected, and they had the faculty to vote for the mayor that would rule for the local government three-year term. The 1973 Chilean coup d'état interrupted Washington Saldías Fuentealba's mayoral term, hence terminating possibilities of new elections. The military regime of Augusto Pinochet appointed seven mayors, who held the office in a period of nineteen years. Following the Chilean <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy,</b> the D'Hondt method of proportional representation was used in the municipal elections of 1992, 1996, and 2000: all candidates run in a single list, the most voted candidate becomes the mayor and other five/six become councilors, according to the aforementioned method. For the municipal elections beginning in 2004, candidates for mayor and councilor run in separate lists, and mayors are elected by simple majority of votes.|$|E
40|$|Recent 'democratic revolutions' in Islamic {{countries}} {{call for}} a re-consideration of <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> and from <b>democracy.</b> <b>Transitions</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> have often been considered the outcome of socio-economic modernization and therefore slow and incremental processes. But as a recent study has made clear, in the last century, <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> have mainly occurred through rapid leaps rather than slow and incremental steps. Here, we therefore apply an innovation and systems perspective and consider <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> as processes of institutional, and therefore systemic, innovation adoption. We show that <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> starting before 1900 lasted {{for an average of}} 50. years and a median of 56. years, while transitions originating later took an average of 4. 6. years and a median of 1. 7. years. However, our results indicate that the survival time of democratic regimes is longer in cases where the transition periods have also been longer, suggesting that patience paid in previous democratizations. We identify a critical 'consolidation-preparing' transition period of 12. years. Our results also show that in cases where the transitions have not been made directly from autocracy <b>to</b> <b>democracy,</b> there are no main institutional paths towards democracy. Instead, democracy seems reachable from a variety of directions. This is in line with the analogy of diffusion of innovations at the nation systems level, for which assumptions are that potential adopter systems may vary in susceptibility over time. The adoption of the institutions of <b>democracy</b> therefore corresponds <b>to</b> the adoption of a new political communications standard for a nation, in this case the innovation of involving in principle all adult citizens on an equal basis. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In {{the last}} several decades there has been immense {{international}} emphasis and promotion of gender equality and female participation in the social, economic, and political spheres of society. There has also been an increase in civil conflict recurrence in countries as well as countries <b>transitioning</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy.</b> This study explores the effect of female participation on peace and democracy. In the first part, I focus on the effect female participation has on decreasing the risk of peace failing in post-civil conflict countries. In many countries, women are marginalized and conflict further marginalizes them. However, I argue that the post-conflict environment allows women to escape this cycle of marginalization and their inclusion and participation is very crucial to sustaining peace. I find that female political and social female decreases the risk of peace failing in post-civil war countries. In the second part, I focus on the effect female participation has on decreasing the risk of authoritarian reversals in countries that have <b>transitioned</b> <b>to</b> and toward <b>democracy.</b> Previous empirical research has focused on women’s role in <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy,</b> factors that contribute to the survival of democracy, as well as how women’s participation affects the stability country. I argue that women’s social, economic, and political participation decreases the risk of authoritarian reversals in countries that have newly <b>transitioned</b> <b>to</b> and toward <b>democracy.</b> I find that female social participation sustains democracy in countries that have <b>transitioned</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> and that female economic participation sustains democracy in countries that have transitioned toward democracy. Overall I find support that female participation matters for both peace and democracy...|$|R

40|$|This thesis seeks <b>to</b> {{explain how}} <b>democracies</b> emerge {{out of the}} ashes of civil wars. This paper envisions <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> after a civil war largely as a {{function}} of the peace process. Democracy is thought of as a medium through which solutions to the problems and issues over which the civil war was fought can be solved without violence. <b>Transitions</b> <b>to</b> <b>democracy</b> are more likely if there is a large bargaining space and the problems of credible commitments to democratization can be solved. Democratization is more likely if four conditions exist in a state after the civil war: a negotiated settlement, credible commitments via international enforcement, demobilization, and a cooperative international environment. The hypotheses derived are tested through an event history analysis for two different standards of democracy. The results suggest that factors indicative of all four theoretical concepts contribute to the likelihood of democratization after a civil war...|$|R
