In the Golden Gate (San Francisco) inlet, tidal currents are dominant and have complex {{spatial and temporal}} variations owing to the large size of estuary connected through a narrow channel and the shallow ebb shoal (bar) at the mouth. To capture such variations, shipboard ADCP profiling is a technically viable approach that can yield unique insight into the vertical structure of currents. Shipboard ADCP data from four cruises conducted by the R/V Point Sur in the San Francisco Bight {{are used in the}} study. Transects along the channel axis were automatically extracted from the irregularly sampled underway data using changes in speed and heading in combination with geographic criteria. Processed data contains transects traversed in various <b>tidal</b> conditions. <b>Flood</b> <b>currents</b> are bottom intensified with more strength in the relatively deeper area of the channel.

40|$|The hydrodynamics, {{morphology}} and sedimentology of the Taperacu estuary were investigated. This is one {{of several}} estuaries located within the largest mangrove fringe in the world, bordering the Amazon region, subject to a macrotidal regime and regionally atypical negligible fresh water supply. The results reveal widespread sand banks that occupy the central portion of the estuarine cross-section. Well-sorted very fine sandy sediments of marine origin prevail. Shorter flood phases, with substantially higher current velocities, were observed in the upper sector of Taperacu, as expected for a shallow, friction-dominated estuary. However, ebb domination can be expected for estuaries with large associated mangrove areas and substantial estuarine infilling, both of which situations occur on the Taperacu. The <b>tidal</b> asymmetry favoring <b>flood</b> <b>currents</b> could be the result of the absence of an effective fluvial discharge. Furthermore, it was observed that the Taperacu is connected by tidal creeks to the neighboring Caete estuary, allowing a stronger flux during the flood and intensifying the higher <b>flood</b> <b>currents.</b> As a whole, the results have shown a complex interaction of morphological aspects (friction, fluvial drainage, connections with neighbor estuaries, infilling and large storage area) in determining hydrodynamic patterns, thus improving the understanding of Amazon estuaries.
