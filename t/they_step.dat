Such pensions will be paid after <b>they</b> <b>step</b> down or retire from office. If the removal of pensions is taken into account, the Prime Minister's annual salary will be reduced from the 2010 figure by 36%, and that of MR4-grade ministers by 37%.|$|E

25|$|A {{multinational}} collaboration {{to study}} the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing (AIRS). Singing provides physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits to participants. When <b>they</b> <b>step</b> on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual’s overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphin's, and increased lung capacity.|$|E

[...] Dining car specialties included oysters and Chesapeake Bay fish served with cornmeal muffins. B president Daniel Willard personally sampled his dining cars' cuisine while traveling about the line, and recognized particularly pleasing meals with letters of appreciation and autographed pictures given to the dining car chefs.|$|E
500|$|Various tour {{performances}} {{were used to}} comprise a music video for [...] "Fearless", directed by Todd Cassetty. The video premiered on February 17, 2010 on CMT.

[...] The video intermingles footage from the tour itself with fans excitedly showing off signs to Swift with behind-the-scenes footage of Swift and her band as they travel on the Fearless Tour. It ends with the singer waving goodbye as she exits the stage. Upon watching the video, Vena interpreted it to be [...] "Swift's love letter to her fans", as it showed an [...] "inside view of what it's like to go on tour".

It was not successful, however, and closed just two years later in May 2013, with Mr Kraatz saying that the space was {{insufficient}} as [...] "customers expect a full-fledged department store which sells everything when <b>they</b> <b>step</b> into Robinsons". In June 2013, the store opened its first sub-urban branch with four floors of retail space at nearly 85,000 square feet,at Jem in Jurong East and in November 2013, the Centrepoint flagship store closed when the lease expired.

2500|$|Medieval Scotland was {{a patriarchal}} society, where {{authority}} was invested {{in men and}} in which women had a very limited legal status. Daughters {{were meant to be}} subservient to their fathers and wives to their husbands, with only widows able to own property and to represent themselves in law. How exactly patriarchy worked in practice is difficult to discern. Literary sources, particularly romantic poems, indicate that women were seen as passive subjects for love and inspiration for the great deeds of knights. They take {{a more active role in}} the historical epics like John Barbour's Bruce (c. 1375) and Blind Harry's Wallace (late 1470s). They were also seen as weaker creatures, morally and physically. Considerable emphasis was placed on their chastity, with [...] "whore" [...] being the most common form of abuse, and their conduct was constrained by the informal sanctions of community gossip, should <b>they</b> <b>step</b> outside of the accepted roles of wife or mother.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, DeLorean was {{appointed}} to the position of vice president of car and truck production for the entire General Motors line, and his eventual rise to president seemed inevitable. However, the idea of him assuming that position was almost intolerable to GM executives, and on April 2, 1973, he announced that he was leaving the company, telling the press [...] "I want to do things in the social area. I have to do them, and unfortunately the nature of our business just didn't permit me to do as much as I wanted." [...] although it was rumored that he had been fired. GM gave him a Florida Cadillac franchise as a retirement gift, and DeLorean did in fact take over the presidency of The National Alliance of Businessmen, a charitable organization with the mission of employing Americans in need, founded by Lyndon Johnson and Henry Ford. GM was a major contributor to the group, and agreed to continue his salary while he remained president of NAB. DeLorean was sharply critical of the direction GM had taken by the start of the 1970s, saying [...] "There's no forward response at General Motors to what the public wants today." [...] He also objected to the idea of using rebates to sell cars on the grounds that [...] "A car should make people's eyes light up when <b>they</b> <b>step</b> into the showroom. Rebates are merely a way of convincing customers to buy bland cars they're not interested in." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the old time, festivals {{happened}} on the month of Chaitra in temple complex of Dhakeswari. This place was crowded by various coloured shops. Virtous people used to visit the temple to gather religious merit {{and get back to}} their home. Millions of Hindu religious people would take bath at Langolbondon on the month of Choitra on Sukla Ostomi time to get rid of their sins. People in huge numbers used to come to Dhakeswari temple on foot from different roads to be blessed by the deity Durga. It was the best moment of their whole year. With great hope they would come out from their home, and it was reflected on their faces, to get rid of their sins by worshiping the Deity with exclusive devotion and bowing their head to meditation of Bhagaban. They forget about everything- hunger, sleep, restlessness – and they just believe that they will be blessed and <b>they</b> <b>step</b> up for the temple. All those people were divided into small groups with each group having ten to twenty people. The groups consisted of mainly women, only one man, who is the oldest of the village, was there for taking care of them. They came from very long distance by forming groups. People of different ages, including the oldest and skinniest, were also gathered with these groups. [...] Young people from the nearest city to the temple volunteering for the people would come from long distance to be blessed by the Deity, with a great concentration, eagerness to the worship of the Deity and often bowing by shouting [...] "Oom Dhaka eswari".|$|E
