5|$|The {{earliest}} {{routes to}} elemental boron involved {{the reduction of}} boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However, the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>industry</b> is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the zone melting or Czochralski processes.|$|E

5|$|Extremely high-purity (99.9999+%) gallium is commercially {{available}} to serve <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>industry.</b> Gallium arsenide (GaAs) and gallium nitride (GaN) used in electronic components represented about 98% of the gallium {{consumption in the}} United States in 2007. About 66% of semiconductor gallium {{is used in the}} U.S. in integrated circuits (mostly gallium arsenide), such as the manufacture of ultra-high speed logic chips and MESFETs for low-noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones. About 20% of this gallium is used in optoelectronics. Worldwide, gallium arsenide makes up 95% of the annual global gallium consumption.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>industry,</b> in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies {{strongly}} with temperature {{can be used}} as crude liquid crystal thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers as well as on thermometers for infants or baths. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

5|$|In many applications, {{the noble}} gases {{are used to}} provide an inert atmosphere. Argon {{is used in the}} {{synthesis}} of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography, as a filler gas for thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber. Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service <b>the</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>industry.</b> To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
