25|$|Author Edgar Allan Poe {{spent the}} last years of his life (1846 to 1849) in the Bronx at Poe Cottage, now located at Kingsbridge Road and the Grand Concourse. A small wooden {{farmhouse}} built around 1812, the cottage once commanded unobstructed vistas over the rolling Bronx hills to the shores of Long Island. Poe moved <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from the Manhattan city air and crowding in hope that the then rural area would be beneficial for his wife's tuberculosis. It was in the Bronx that Poe wrote one of his most famous works, Annabel Lee.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco was {{designated}} the official {{port of entry}} for all California ports where U.S. customs (also called tariffs and Ad valorem taxes) (averaging about 25%) were collected by the Collector of Customs from all ships bearing foreign goods. The first Collector of customs was Edward H. Harrison, appointed by General Kearny. Shipping boomed from the average of about 25 vessels from 1825 to 1847 to about 793 ships in 1849 and 803 ships in 1850. All ships were inspected for what goods they carried. Passengers disembarking in San Francisco {{had one of the}} easier accesses to the gold country since they could take another ship from <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to Sacramento and several other towns.|$|E
25|$|His wife Mary has {{recently}} returned from treatment for drug addiction and has put on weight as a result. She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from insomnia, which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, {{because this is the}} room where, in the past, she would satisfy her morphine addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she just went <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from her husband's snoring.|$|E

500|$|Patrice Valenton (Arnaud Tsamere) {{introduces}} {{himself as}} an economics teacher at the University Institute of Technology in Vincennes. He explains that he is there to honour a promise he made to his best friend Rémi, who was hospitalised by a car accident. Patrice arrived to see Rémi on his deathbed, and Rémi asked Patrice to perform a one-man show on his behalf. Patrice answered [...] "I promise...", and Rémi died, not knowing {{that the end of}} the sentence was [...] "...that you'll get better" [...] and that Patrice did not want to perform. Patrice explains that he will keep his promise because becoming a comedian was Rémi's dream, but that he is not a comedian and is not <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> laughs or applause.|$|E
500|$|Several of the {{characters}} are given [...] "I am" [...] songs that introduce them to the audience, allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for onlookers to establish empathy with the character. [...] Linda Low, for example, expresses her self-confidence with [...] "I Enjoy Being a Girl"; we learn Mei Li's hopes with the quieter [...] "I Am Going to Like It Here". [...] Although not a formal musical number, the brief [...] "You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll", sung and danced by Linda and by Wang San, Ta's Americanized teenage brother, was described by Lewis as [...] "virtually the first self-consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung" [...] in a Broadway musical. [...] Patrick Adiarte, who originated the role of Wang San, however, saw it as [...] "corny stuff... put in <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a laugh". [...] Helen Chao's sad [...] "Love, Look Away" [...] is described by Lewis as [...] "arguably the most tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote".|$|E
500|$|Both Editor and Publisher and Salon, which {{published}} {{extensive and}} early {{coverage of the}} Colbert speech, drew record and near-record numbers of viewers to their web sites. 70,000 articles were posted to blogs about Colbert's roast of Bush on the Thursday after the event, {{the most of any}} topic, and [...] "Colbert" [...] remained the top search term at Technorati for days. Chicago Sun-Times TV critic Doug Elfman credited the Internet with promoting an event that would have otherwise been overlooked, stating that [...] "Internet stables for liberals, like the behemoth dailykos.com, began rumbling as soon as the correspondents' dinner was reported in the mainstream press, with scant word of Colbert's combustive address". Three weeks after the dinner, audio of Colbert's performance went on sale at the iTunes Music Store and became the No. 1 album purchased, outselling new releases by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, and Paul Simon. The CEO of Audible.com, which provided the recording sold at iTunes, explained its success by saying, [...] "you had to not be <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it". It continued to be a top download at iTunes for the next five months.|$|E

He {{repeatedly}} insulted Le Batard, Stugotz, and the show's producers saying they were only <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his coffee. Simmons was uncomfortable for the entirety of Rapaport's rant against the show saying, “I still feel awkward because I like all those guys. I wish this would work out.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Ernie Pyle {{once wrote}} {{in one of}} his columns, [...] "All the people you saw on the streets in Reno were {{obviously}} <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> divorces." [...] In Ayn Rand's novel The Fountainhead, published in 1943, the New York-based female protagonist tells a friend, [...] "I am going to Reno," [...] which is taken as a different way of saying [...] "I am going to divorce my husband." [...] Among others, the Belgian-French writer Georges Simenon, at the time living in the U.S., came to Reno in 1950 in order to divorce his first wife.|$|E

2500|$|Critics of {{marriage}} {{argue that it}} is complicit in the mistreatment and subjugation of women across the world. Common concerns raised today focus on the health and general well-being of women, who, in parts of the world, have virtually no protection in law or in practice, against domestic violence within marriage. It is also nearly impossible for women <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of abusive relationships. Abuses are upheld by claims of possession and entitlement in some cultures and the [...] of women is undermined by a powerful act of subordination. According to Gerstel and Sarkisian, domestic violence, isolation, and housework tend to increase for women who sign marriage contracts. Those with lower income draw even fewer benefits from it. Bad marriages, according to Gerstel and Sarkisian, result in higher levels of stress, suicide, hypertension, cancer, and slower wound healing in women.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on Wellington's record, Newby-Fraser said, [...] "But {{the revelation}} I had was {{watching}} how hard {{she worked for}} it ... {{and it was clear}} she was going to the well. And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out <b>there</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. Part of me was gratified by that. I know what she had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there." [...] A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, [...] "Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009." [...] Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, [...] "But I knew, and she knew, and I told her in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day." ...|$|E
