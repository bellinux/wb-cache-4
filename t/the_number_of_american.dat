5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan {{pursued a}} hard line {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming it to be puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters – in August 1981 the US shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country to reduce <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the Libyan government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after Libyan diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several Libyan ships.|$|E

In total during that year, the number of Israeli Jews (those who were born in Israel and those who only lived there for a certain period of time) who lived in the United States stood between 153,000 and 175,000.|$|E

Wall was a strong proponent of mergers between various maritime unions, and the organizing of an international union to cover all maritime workers.|$|E

25|$|In foreign policy, Johnson {{escalated}} American {{involvement in}} the Vietnam War. In 1964, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power {{to use military force}} in Southeast Asia without having to ask for an official declaration of war. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, from 16,000 advisors in non-combat roles in 1963 to 525,000 in 1967, many in combat roles.

The majority of the remainder were killed in action, although it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards, eventually succumbing to their injuries or surrendering weeks later.|$|E
25|$|All of the {{professional}} leagues including the NFL were gate driven enterprises, thus, although the NFL enjoyed a noticeable financial dominance over the game it was quite modest by modern standards. In any event, the Canadian league enforced strict limits on <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> players on their rosters while the dominance of ice hockey in Canada kept the Canadian football talent base small. This meant that NFL owners {{did not need to}} significantly outspend Canadian teams in order to dominate the game on the field. In the absence of a players union or another U.S. league, NFL owners' main concern was to make their league as profitable as possible. Teams spent as little as possible on player salaries.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, had Stilwell {{been given}} <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> regular {{infantry}} divisions he had continually requested, the American experience in China and Burma {{would have been}} very different. Certainly, his Army peers, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Gen. George Marshall had the highest respect for his abilities, and both saw he replaced Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. as commander of Tenth U.S. Army at Okinawa after the latter's death. During the last year of the war, however, the U.S. was strained to meet all its military obligations, and cargo aircraft diverted to supply Stilwell, the 14th Air Force, and the Chinese in the East left air-drop-dependent campaigns in the West, such as Operation Market Garden, woefully short of aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Obama {{increased}} <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> {{soldiers in}} Afghanistan {{during his first}} term before withdrawing most military personnel in his second term. On taking office, Obama announced that the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be bolstered by 17,000 new troops by Summer 2009, {{on top of the}} roughly 30,000 soldiers already in Afghanistan at the start of 2009. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Michael Mullen all argued for further troops, and Obama dispatched additional soldiers after a lengthy review process. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> soldiers in Afghanistan would peak at 100,000 in 2010. In 2012, the U.S. and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement in which the U.S. agreed to hand over major combat operation to Afghan forces. That same year, the Obama administration designated Afghanistan as a major non-NATO ally. In 2014, Obama announced that most troops would leave Afghanistan by late 2016, with a small force remaining at the US embassy. In September 2014, Ashraf Ghani succeeded Hamid Karzai as the President of Afghanistan after the U.S. helped negotiate a power-sharing agreement between Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah. On January 1, 2015, the U.S. military ended Operation Enduring Freedom and began Resolute Support Mission, in which the U.S. shifted to more of a training role, although some combat operations continued. In October 2015, Obama announced that U.S. soldiers would remain in Afghanistan indefinitely in order support the Afghan government in the civil war against the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and ISIL. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey framed the decision to keep soldiers in Afghanistan as part of a long-term counter-terrorism operation stretching across Central Asia. Obama left office with roughly 8,400 U.S. soldiers remaining in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Mosques {{from the}} Ottoman period are still {{scattered}} across Eastern Europe, {{but the most}} rapid {{growth in the number}} of mosques in Europe has occurred within the past century as more Muslims have migrated to the continent. Many major European cities are home to mosques, like the Grand Mosque of Paris, that incorporate domes, minarets, and other features often found with mosques in Muslim-majority countries. The first mosque in North America was founded by Albanian Americans in 1915, but the continent's oldest surviving mosque, the Mother Mosque of America, only dates back to the 1930s. As in Europe, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> mosques has rapidly increased in recent decades as Muslim immigrants, particularly from South Asia, have come in the United States. Greater than forty percent of mosques in the United States were constructed after 2000.|$|E
25|$|Spirou {{expanded}} from 12 pages of newspaper quality to 52 full colour pages, and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> comics, reintroduced {{after the end}} of the war, dwindled to near nil in 1950. Their place was taken by Victor Hubinon and Jean-Michel Charlier (Buck Danny), Maurice Tillieux (Gil Jourdan), Eddy Paape, Will, and most importantly André Franquin, Morris, and Peyo. Their respective series Gaston Lagaffe, Lucky Luke and The Smurfs became international bestsellers. While the first generation learned much of the art while working with Jijé, many younger artists started their professional career in the Studio Peyo before creating their own series, assuring the continuation of the School of Marcinelle. The humour aspect of the magazine was assured by the editor-in-chief Yvan Delporte, writer for Franquin, Will and Peyo. Together with the main artists of Tintin, they defined the Franco-Belgian comics for decades to come.|$|E

[...] As <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>American</b> living in Texas increased, Mexican authorities became apprehensive that the United States intended to annex the area, possibly by force.

500|$|The Vietcong commanders {{had planned}} the venture with two aims in mind.

Secondly, the attack would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese public that the Americans were vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection. Xuan added that [...] "all the crimes committed by the Americans were directed from this nerve center".
