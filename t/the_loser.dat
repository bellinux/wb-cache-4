50|$|Either of <b>the</b> Condorcet <b>loser</b> {{criterion}} or <b>the</b> mutual majority criterion implies <b>the</b> majority <b>loser</b> criterion.

Also, <b>the</b> majority criterion is logically independent from <b>the</b> majority <b>loser</b> criterion, since <b>the</b> plurality rule satisfies the majority but not <b>the</b> majority <b>loser</b> criterion, and <b>the</b> anti-plurality rule satisfies <b>the</b> majority <b>loser</b> but not <b>the</b> majority criterion. There is no positional scoring rule which satisfies both the majority and <b>the</b> majority <b>loser</b> criterion, but several non-positional rules, including many Condorcet rules, do satisfy both criteria.|$|R
