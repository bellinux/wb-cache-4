50|$|The {{speed and}} {{ease with which}} a quilter can have a quilt <b>top</b> <b>finished</b> by a longarm quilter has caused an {{increase}} in recent years for quilting. These machines allow quilters to have their quilts finished without going through the time-consuming process associated with normal machine quilting or hand quilting. Sewers (or sewists, piecers, or quilters) can now take their finished quilt tops to professional longarm quilting businesses and pay a fee to have their quilting done by a longarm quilter. The availability of relatively quick and reasonably affordable quilting services has helped to cause a surge in the quilting business and an overall growth in interest in quilting as an art form.|$|E
5000|$|Flame maple (tiger maple), {{also known}} as flamed maple, curly maple, ripple maple, fiddleback or tiger stripe, is a feature of maple in which {{the growth of the}} wood fibers is {{distorted}} in an undulating chatoyant pattern, producing wavy lines known as [...] "flames". This effect is often mistakenly said {{to be part of the}} grain of the wood; it is more accurately called [...] "figure", as the distortion is perpendicular to the grain direction. Prized for its beautiful appearance, it is used frequently in the manufacturing of musical instruments, such as violins and bassoons, and fine furniture. Another well-known use of the material is its use in guitars, especially the venerated Gibson Les Paul. The Gibson Les Paul [...] "Standard", initially manufactured from 1958 to 1960, sported a flame maple <b>top</b> <b>finished</b> in a cherry-red sunburst on a mahogany body. Today, these instruments are some of the most prized on the vintage guitar market, and as such are unaffordable to most musicians.|$|E

50|$|Koordes {{began his}} career at Telstar, who {{finished}} the 1994-95 season in 11th place in the Eerste Divisie, and then ninth place in 1995-96 under Cor Pot's stewardship. Koordes left the TATA Steel Stadion when he was purchased by English First Division club Port Vale in February 1997 for a £75,000 fee. He played 13 league games {{in the remainder of}} the 1996-97 season, but featured just nine times in the 1997-98 campaign.

5000|$|Cheape {{is said to}} have {{believed}} in reincarnation, or transmigration of the soul, and to have been so convinced that he would return {{in the form of a}} bird that next to his mansion house he built a large tower with an octagonal roof, housing a dovecote on <b>top.</b> <b>Finished</b> in 1843, it stands 80 ft tall, has four clock faces, a coat of arms and a motto—Didus Fructus ("Let it spread its fruit abroad")—all on the outer surfaces. A shield on the tower records that it was [...] "Designed and built by Captain John Cheape, 1843". A local tale is that Captain Cheape was in league with smugglers and would light a lamp in the top of the tower when he knew the coast was clear. The nearby ruins of Auchenharvie Castle and Darnshaw Farm are linked to stories of smuggling corpses for dissection by Glasgow medical students. The tower bears a striking resemblance to the typical Italian 'Campanile' and this may reflect his interest in the Italian culture as indicated by the name 'Girgenti'. He is also said to have constructed the tower to be able see the ocean.|$|E
5000|$|Roma prospered {{during the}} first three decades of the twentieth century, despite the impact of World War I (1914-1918), and many of its {{buildings}} were reconstructed in brick at this period. Work on erecting Hunter's new emporium commenced {{in the first week of}} August 1916 and was completed in late December that year. It was an imposing, two-storeyed brick building, designed and built by local contractor John Hill. The street facades were [...] "tastefully worked in selected bands of salt glazed bricks, as also around all doors and window openings ... over the first floor windows has been fitted a plastered cornice about 20 inches and a coping mould about 10 inches with the <b>top</b> <b>finished</b> artistically in scrolls and ball finials". The ground floors of both street facades had awnings supported on timber posts, and the McDowall Street elevation featured three island display windows. At the rear of the main structure a single-storeyed rectangular brick building, lit and ventilated by a large roof lantern, accommodated a large show-room and offices, which were accessed from the back of the main shop. A strong room, office and underground cold storage were provided.|$|E
