40|$|Trade and <b>transport</b> <b>statistics</b> are {{two sides}} of the same coin. Ideally we would like to have the data on the trade flow between two {{countries}} in combination with the information about the split of this flow between various (multi-modal) routes linking the pair of countries. In reality trade and <b>transport</b> <b>statistics</b> are quite difficult to match due to differences in methodology for data collection and the use of surveys. In particular <b>transport</b> <b>statistics</b> show us only the location of loading and unloading and does not say anything about origin and destination of the commodity flows. Trade data provides information on the origin and destination of the flows but may also include re-exports and transit flows. The unification and reconciliation of transport and trade statistics is of great value to both policy makers and the scientific community. The methodological approach presented in the present paper attempts to combine trade and transport data into a single consistent multi-commodity and multi-modal freight OD matrix for Europe. We apply logit shares for route choice in combination with a cross-entropy function in order to find the optimal trade-off between available trade and <b>transport</b> <b>statistics.</b> The result of this exercise is the identification of the transhipment flows and pure trade flows for the intra and extra-European trade.

30|$|The {{authors have}} {{detected}} some differences of {{views on the}} use of eLogistics applications. The results are presented in Table  8 showing that a majority (more than 50  %) of the SME sub-group uses the eLogistics applications in the following functional areas: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, <b>Transport</b> <b>Statistics</b> and Assessment Systems and EDI. But the Non-SME sub-group had more usage of eLogistics applications: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Cargo Monitoring Systems, Vehicle Tracking and Tracing, <b>Transport</b> <b>Statistics</b> and Assessment Systems and EDI. The TLSP even have a higher (than the Non-SME group) usage: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Cargo Monitoring Systems, Vehicle Tracking and Tracing, Route Guidance Systems- GPS, <b>Transport</b> <b>Statistics</b> and Assessment Systems and EDI as well. The Terminal Operators have usage of eLogistics system in the following six functional areas: Order Management Systems, Booking, Invoicing, Cargo Monitoring Systems, <b>Transport</b> <b>Statistics</b> and Assessment Systems and EDI. The Shippers have a limited usage of eLogistics applications: only in Order Management Systems and Invoicing. The authors find that the similarity among the usage of eLogistics applications of the Non-SME, the TLSP and the Terminal Operator groups is possibly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the TLSP and Terminal Operator participants belong to Non-SME group. And these groups have higher technical and financial capacity and skills to use the eLogistics applications. On the other hand the lower usage of eLogistics applications by the SME (and the Shipper) sub-group is possibly due the fact that they lack technical and final capacity and skills.|$|E
