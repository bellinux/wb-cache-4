5|$|In the game's primary single-player mode, titled GH Live {{within the}} game, the player completes songs while {{experiencing}} full-motion video {{taken from the}} first-person perspective of a band's lead guitarist. The video includes shots of the audience and the band members. As the player performs the songs, the audience responds positively to good performances when few mistakes are made. If the player makes several mistakes in a row, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> become critical and start to jeer at the performer. To win back the crowd, the player can either match more notes correctly, or can use collected Hero Power to rapidly regain their interest. Hero Power, replacing Star Power from previous Guitar Hero games, is collected by correctly playing marked series of notes on the track; Hero Power can be accumulated, marked as on-screen guitar picks next to the track, to be used at later times. The player can release Hero Power for a limited time by either tilting the guitar controller upward or hitting a special button on the controller.|$|E

25|$|He {{extensively}} discusses playwright Molière's work, {{and uses}} the play Le Misanthrope to exemplify a comedy in which the audience derives immoral pleasure. In the play, the main character, Alceste, is good and honest in his relationships with men and made to look ridiculous, whereas Philinte, a deceiver and manipulator, is shown as superior. Rousseau considers this play to be a work of genius, but it is, of course, morally backwards. He reasons that even if comedy writers write a play that is morally acceptable, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> not find it funny. Therefore, theatres are of little use.|$|E

500|$|Salegy is an {{electrified}} {{version of}} the traditional antsa musical style that Tandroy singer Mama Sana used to perform at Betsimisaraka and Tsimihety rituals. [...] In addition to their commonalities in tempo, vocal style, and tendency toward minor keys (which some attribute to an Arab influence, and which stands {{in contrast to the}} major key dominance of Highland music), the salegy shares the antsa's structure in that it always features a middle section called the folaka ("broken") which is primarily instrumental—voice serves only to urge on more energetic dancing—and during which the vocalists (and <b>the</b> <b>audience)</b> <b>will</b> launch into intricate polyrhythmic hand-clapping to the beat of the music.|$|E
500|$|This {{would cause}} {{problems}} for the studio, Universal and partner MGM.

500|$|The {{season finale}} {{of the second}} season {{introduced}} the parallel universe to viewers. Fringes producers debated over {{how much of this}} universe to depict in the third season, but ultimately decided that showing the doppelgangers would [...] "fit more into our own character’s lives and show different aspects of their personalities". As a result, Fringe began its third season by alternating between episodes, with each depicting one universe. The Fox network was initially resistant to this design, as executives were [...] "really concerned that if the episodes didn't have [...] Walter or Peter in them, it wouldn’t feel like our show anymore." [...] Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman explained that the series had to constantly evolve, [...] "otherwise we’ll get bored, the cast will get bored, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> get bored"; after the first several episodes of the season, Fox agreed it was a positive change.|$|E
500|$|Adamson also {{desired to}} make the film larger in scale; [...] "I've gained {{confidence}} having gone through the first. This time, I {{was able to go}} larger [...] scale, with more extras and bigger battle scenes." [...] Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle, a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz's castle was created. Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original. Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian's conflict and Edmund's maturity, in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama. Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes, asking his young male actors not to perform angrily. Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by [...] "tell people {{at the end of the}} scene, 'Now just give me something where you're not thinking about anything.' By using it in context, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> read an emotion into it." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Warner Bros. took pitches from {{comic book}} writers, screenwriters and {{directors}} {{on how to}} successfully restart the Superman film series.

Just treat Superman Returns as the Ang Lee Hulk," [...] Morrison said. [...] "The Incredible Hulk has proven <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> forgive you and let you redo the franchise," [...] said Waid. Morrison's idea was similar to his work on All-Star Superman, while Waid's was akin to [...] Mark Millar, teaming with director Matthew Vaughn, also planned an epic eight-hour Superman trilogy, each installment released a year apart, similar to The Lord of the Rings. Millar compared it to the Godfather trilogy, in which it would chronicle the entire life of Superman, {{from the early days}} of Krypton to the finale where Superman loses his powers as the Sun starts to go supernova.|$|E

The body's chief executive David Poley claimed that in failing to show {{the negative consequences of}} this action, the series was presenting a [...] "highly irresponsible portrayal of excessive and rapid drinking". Ofcom received a total of eight complaints about the incident. In response to the accusation that [...] "We would expect the BBC to take greater care with the portrayal of alcohol in programmes", the BBC released a statement tying the complaint closely to the alcoholism storyline being played out with Kyla at the time, explaining that: [...] "Holby City {{is in the middle of}} a storyline in which a key character (Kyla) has spiralling problems in her personal and professional life because of alcohol — a storyline that fully and realistically depicts the negative impact of alcohol dependency in the workplace.

500|$|Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman {{decided to}} {{alternate}} the episodes between the prime and parallel universes because they [...] "thought {{that the best}} way to really thoroughly tell these stories was to dive into them wholeheartedly... the journey that our heroine is on and then come back over here because [...] is embedded in our team, we have point of view characters in both universes and it seemed to us the perfect opportunity to really explore in a really thorough fulsome way the alternate universe". Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would really appreciate a mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike a show like Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll get bored, the cast will get bored, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> get bored". After the first three episodes, both Fox and Warner Bros. became more favorable to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|Although Paul {{changed his}} ways to an extent, he still {{shows signs of}} being evil. Dennis has stated that he and fellow cast member, Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) {{purposely}} portray hints of his former self. Of this Dennis stated: [...] "I like to keep that boiling under the surface so that <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> always think 'what is he up to next?'. You never quite know if he will burst out into Mr. Evil or stay as the character {{he is at the}} moment. Alan Fletcher keeps it alive as well, by always looking out {{the corner of his eye}} and thinking 'I just don't trust you!'" [...] Dennis later defended his character to the Birmingham Post after he was branded an evil character, describing him in his early years: [...] "Paul started out as a university student, which people have forgotten, he was studying engineering then, much to his father's disgust, left to join an airline and became a trolley dolly. He later became a bit of a cad but I wouldn't call him a villain. I'd describe him as a bad boy with a conscience". Dennis has also stated that he loves playing Paul as a [...] "baddie", because in his opinion he is so colourful, not just an average bad guy, adding: [...] "He's not just a black and white bad guy, he's a sneaky bastard. He's the smiling baddie".|$|E

500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> <b>will</b> no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E
