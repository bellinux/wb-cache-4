The Jamaican government finalized evacuation plans, which included converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political {{parties in the}} island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections to allow residents {{to prepare for the}} storm. The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA), which was already responding to Hurricane Dean's impact in the Lesser Antilles, contacted the Jamaican Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management to confirm technical and logistics support, and to notify the Jamaican government that utilities teams had been placed on standby should they be needed.

25|$|On Tuesday, September 4, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, adelantado of La Florida, {{set sail}} from the harbor of St. Augustine, and {{coasting}} north, came upon four vessels {{lying at anchor}} off {{the mouth of a}} river. These were Jean Ribault's flagship, the Trinity, and three others of his ships, which the Frenchman had left {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns because they were too large to pass the bars in safety. One of them was flying the Admiral's flag, another the flag of the Captain. Menéndez recognized at once that the French reinforcements had arrived before him, and called a council of his captains <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> action should be taken.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} ships were being pummeled. Weehawken had {{advanced}} {{to a line}} of buoys that Captain Rodgers thought might mark torpedoes, so he swerved from the channel and stopped <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> to do next. At this time, an underwater explosion rocked the vessel; Rodgers {{thought that it was}} a torpedo, but some historians believe that it was more likely the explosion of a shell from one of the forts. In either case, the ship suffered no significant injury. Because she had left the channel, however, the line of ships following her were thrown into confusion, and whatever was left of Du Pont's battle plan collapsed. The intense fire the ships received from the forts kept them farther from Fort Sumter than the admiral had envisioned, so their return fire was less accurate than planned. It was not accuracy that determined the result, however, but the sheer disparity in firepower. In the course of the two hours of the engagement, the Confederate forces got off more than 2000 shot and shell, of which 520 hit. By contrast, the Union fleet fired only 154 shots. Their armor protected the crews, but several ships suffered damage that impaired their fighting abilities, such as jammed turrets and gunport stoppers. Worst hit was Keokuk, which was hit 90 times, including 19 shots at or below the waterline. Captain Rhind withdrew his ship from the fight, barely able to keep her afloat until she was beyond enemy gunfire. By this time, the tide had turned, so Admiral Du Pont decided to suspend the attack until the following day.|$|E

However this interpretation, which first appeared in the writings of John Harington, around 100 years after it was supposed to have happened, has been challenged.|$|E
500|$|Symbols {{of death}} proliferate {{throughout}} The Wind Will Carry Us with scenes {{set in a}} graveyard, the imminence of the old woman’s passing, and the ancestors that the character of Farzad mentions in an early scene.

[...] In the film’s opening sequence, Behzad tells Farzad that like people, cars have ghosts. This becomes the theme of the work and the subject of the film — they are waiting for the old woman to give up the ghost. The viewer is asked <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> constitutes the soul, and what happens to the soul after death.

500|$|However, Hobson {{noted that}} Rihanna [...] "rejects [...] the victim stance" [...] {{in the video}} for [...] "Man Down", and elucidated that she {{played the role of}} a rape {{survivor}} who shot her attacker. She attributed the location of shooting the video in Jamaica as significant, due to how the image of a gun proliferated during 1990s Jamaican dance hall's to [...] "express female rage". The prologue depicts Rihanna as a [...] "dark-hooded" [...] femme fatale whereby the narrative explains her motives for murder and provokes the spectator to sympathize with her because she danced in a provocative manner with a man in a club, which Hobson suggests is [...] "somehow deserving of rape". She continued to explain that Rihanna is inviting the audience <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> justice means by [...] "pointing both a literal and lyrical gun at the issue". Hobson concluded that Rihanna is protecting her vulnerability and countering the image of the abused black woman who is looked at unsympathetically in society.|$|E

5000|$|A rationalistic {{approach}} to the Bible. The rationalism that was characteristic of the Enlightenment took a protomaterialistic view of miracles and of the historicity of biblical narratives.

This method was readily accepted by Protestants and Anglicans. It was the natural consequence of Martin Luther’s sola scriptura doctrine, which asserts that Scripture is the highest authority, and that it can be relied on [...] in all things pertaining to salvation and the Christian life.|$|R

500|$|In May 1985, Rajneesh's {{personal}} {{secretary and}} second-in-command, Sheela Silverman (Ma Anand Sheela), gathered the leader's key followers {{and formed a}} group of conspirators in order <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> {{to do with the}} growing concern of Turner's continuous involvement with the Ranch. Sheela stated that Turner's grand jury investigation [...] "threatened the existence of the commune", and exposed Rajneesh and several of his disciples to criminal prosecution. Sheela hoped that by removing Turner's influence {{they would be able to}} thwart the federal immigration investigation which could have resulted in deportation of Rajneeshee leaders. Three former leaders of the commune including Ma Anand Sheela, Dianne Yvonne Onang (Ma Anand Puja), a registered nurse from the Philippines who managed the Rajneeshee medical corporation, and former treasurer of Rajneesh Foundation International and Catherine Jane Stork (Ma Shanti Bhadra) of Australia, put together a hit list which included U.S. Attorney Charles Turner and Oregon Attorney General David Frohnmayer.|$|E
500|$|In May 1937 Birkett was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee for Abortion {{set up by}} the Minister of Health and Home Secretary, preparing a report [...] "to inquire into the prevalence of abortion, and the law relating thereto, and <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> steps can be taken by more effective enforcement of the law", something which occupied him for two years. During the summer of 1937, Birkett was asked to represent the English Bar {{at the annual meeting of}} the Canadian Bar Association in Toronto, where he was a popular speaker. In January 1938, he was asked to act as a Commissioner of Assize to open the Assize Court in Aylesbury, dealing with an average of ten cases a day. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he became a member of a committee advising the Home Secretary on the detention of suspected enemy agents. The committee dealt with more than 1,500 cases in two years. Although the work was unpaid, he was knighted on 6 June 1941 as a reward for his work. He also delivered weekly radio broadcasts after the Friday night news to counter the broadcasts of William Joyce, known as Lord Haw Haw. The first broadcast took place on 9 February 1940, and they were considered to be a morale boost during the so-called Phony War.|$|E
500|$|On 29 May 1900, Tiger was reactivated, {{and she was}} {{assigned}} as the flagship of the II Division the following day. She served in this role for three months during the summer training period, {{before returning to the}} reserve fleet. In 1901, the navy decided to add bilge keels to the ship to reduce her tendency to roll in heavy seas. In addition, a [...] dynamo, a steam control system, and electric lights were also installed. She participated in the summer training exercises in 1902 and 1903, before returning to reserve status on 15 September 1903. In late 1903, the navy began <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>what</b> would be done with Tiger, now 15 years old, for the remainder of her career. The navy considered four options in a meeting on 19 February 1904: to keep the ship armed with her original gun batter, to disarm her, to replace them with new 40-cal. versions, or replace them with 7cm 45-cal. guns. Ultimately, the Marinesektion rejected all four proposals, since the ship's boilers were in poor condition by that point. Instead, they decided to convert the ship into an admiralty yacht, since she had little combat value by that time anyway. Additionally, the current yacht, Pelikan, was to be converted into a depot ship for the torpedo training school. The plan was prepared in June, and the work was to be done at the Pola Naval Arsenal. The conversion work was done in 19051906 and she was renamed Lacroma on 29 January 1906. Her armament reduced to six 47mm QF guns and the sponsons for her main battery were removed.|$|E
