5|$|In October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar {{of first-degree}} murder and sentenced her {{to life in prison}} with <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole</b> after 30 years in 2025. Life with <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole</b> was the maximum prison term allowed in Texas that could be imposed at the time. In 2002, under a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was {{destroyed}} and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay. Fans and historians disapproved of the decision to destroy the gun, saying the event was historical and the gun should have been in a museum.|$|E
5|$|Lee Woods {{was tried}} twice, {{after his first}} trial ended in a mistrial due to a juror in her 20s falling ill. Wood's attorney, Samuel J. Karlin, told the judge his client wanted to {{continue}} with the ill juror, instead of using an alternate. At his second trial on March 16, 2009, Lee Woods was found guilty of aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, and 3 charges of gun possession. He was also {{sentenced to life in prison}} without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 11, {{two days}} after the murder, police arrested their suspect. Hayden {{provided}} a confession and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. Hayden's legal representative, Randolph Williams, urged the judge to show leniency because the suspect had shown remorse for his crime from the moment of his arrest. The judge, Justice Basil Reid, sentenced Hayden to life in prison with <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole</b> after fifteen years.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, the United States Supreme Court {{decided the}} case of Simmons v. South Carolina. The U.S. Supreme Court held {{in this case that}} where a capital defendant's future {{dangerousness}} is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole,</b> due process requires that the jury be informed <b>of</b> the defendant's <b>parole</b> ineligibility. The state of South Carolina had changed its sentencing laws in the succeeding years to include <b>the</b> actual <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole</b> in absence <b>of</b> the death penalty, after sentencing questions were answered by the jury.|$|R
50|$|SD {{wishes to}} instate <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> life without <b>parole</b> {{for the worst}} crimes and to {{repatriate}} foreign citizens found guilty of serious crime (which already is general practice in Sweden, though the repatriation is usually limited to {{a few years after}} which the offenders are able to reapply for asylum). SD also wants to establish a public register of convicted pedophiles.|$|R
5|$|On April 13, {{the defense}} team {{notified}} Paul Morrison that Green wished to plea bargain. On April 17 the plea was made public when Debora Green appeared in court to plead no contest to five charges—two counts of capital murder, one of arson, and two of attempted first-degree murder. In exchange for avoiding the death penalty, the no contest plea called for Green to accept a prison sentence of a minimum of forty years without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole.</b> Green denied being {{under the influence of}} any drug which would affect her judgment in making her plea or her ability to understand the proceedings in which she was participating.|$|E
5|$|Nichols stood trial twice. He {{was first}} tried {{by the federal}} {{government}} in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build {{a weapon of mass destruction}} and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161counts of first-degree murder (160non-federal agent victims and onefetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylor then determined the sentence of 161consecutive life terms without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole.</b> In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols' former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Soriano's final {{assignment}} was command of I Corps and Fort Lewis, beginning in August 2002. Under his leadership, Fort Lewis became a force provider for Operation Iraqi Freedom, {{including the first}} deployment of the Stryker with the 2nd Infantry Division. In June 2004, as the commander of Fort Lewis, Soriano ordered the court-martial of Ryan G. Anderson, {{who was convicted of}} providing aid to al-Qaeda and was sentenced in September 2004 to life in prison with <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole</b> after Soriano removed the death penalty as a possible sentencing option. In September 2004, Soriano met with Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo at Malacanang, who he had met before during Arroyo's state visit in May 2003,As they shook hands, the President said Soriano thanked her for going to his hometown of Alcala, Pangasinan to save his fellow townmates from discrimination after the countrys first two reported deaths from Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome were from Alcala. }} after being invited by General Narciso Abaya, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In November 2004, Soriano turned over command of I Corps and Fort Lewis to Lieutenant General James M. Dubik, and finally retired from active duty on 1 March 2005.|$|E
2500|$|After {{two years}} of {{preliminary}} hearings, Meinhof was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment on 29 November 1974. Eventually Meinhof, Baader, Ensslin, and Raspe were jointly charged on 19 August 1975, with four counts of murder, fifty-four of attempted murder, and a single count of forming a criminal association. However, before the trial was concluded, Meinhof was found hanged by a rope, fashioned from a towel, in her cell in the Stammheim Prison on 9 May 1976. It is highly probable that, if not for her death, {{she would have been}} sentenced to 'life imprisonment plus 15 years'. (The remaining three defendants received such a sentence, designed to minimize <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> early <b>parole.)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Justice Martin {{determined}} that Bunting was the ringleader, and {{sentenced him to}} 11 consecutive terms of life imprisonment without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> release on <b>parole.</b> Wagner was sentenced to 10 consecutive terms under the same conditions, and at his sentencing, he stated from the dock: [...] "Paedophiles were doing terrible things to children. The authorities didn't do anything about it. I decided to take action. I took that action. Thank you." [...] Vlassakis was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences with a non-parole period of 26 years and Haydon was sentenced to 25 years with no <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole</b> for 18 years.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, Judge Hall {{decides to}} release Armstrong from jail, {{as he is}} {{convinced}} she will never divulge her source and, therefore, cannot be pressured through continued incarceration. On the day she is released, Dubois has the U.S. Marshals arrest her for obstruction of justice and convinces her to take a deal for a shortened sentence rather than go to trial. She agrees {{to two years in}} prison, with <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> early <b>parole</b> for good behavior. As Armstrong is taken to the facility, she reminisces about her time as a volunteer at Timmy's school, and when she spoke to Van Doren's daughter, Alison, who revealed to her on a school field trip that her mother worked for the government and recently went to Venezuela on [...] "business", thus revealing Alison as the original source.|$|R
25|$|On July 7, 2008, {{the hearing}} for {{sentencing}} for Álvarez started.

2500|$|The defence {{suggested}} that the DNA evidence had been contaminated in the laboratory, but the claim was rebutted by the prosecution after they demonstrated {{that this was not}} possible. Butler was not called to give evidence. He was found guilty by the jury after only 90 minutes of discussion, after which Supreme Court Judge Justice John Helman jailed Butler for life without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> release on <b>parole,</b> saying: “For this savage crime you will spend [...] the rest of your days in captivity. Parole will always be out of the question.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Thirty lawmen {{appeared}} to capture Silman, including deputies Rollins, Jody R. Bullock, and Bob Sanders. Bullock and Sanders dragged Fletcher's {{body into a}} patrol car to carry him to assistance via helicopter to Alexandria, where he was treated at Rapides General Hospital. Silman claimed to have killed his father by accident and then snapped into a fit of insanity when he murdered the three other kinsmen. He retained the Alexandria attorney James Michael [...] "Mike" [...] Small after he was declared capable of paying his own legal fees. Silman underwent examination by a court-appointed sanity commission which declared him competent for trial. The trial judge found Silman not guilty for the killing of his father, {{who had tried to}} disarm his son, but concluded that the defendant was guilty as charged with the first-degree murder of his sister, brother-in-law, and uncle. He was sentenced to three concurrent life sentences at hard labor, without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> probation, <b>parole,</b> or suspended sentence. The sentence was thrown out by the Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Third Circuit in Lake Charles but reinstated in 1995 by the Louisiana Supreme Court.|$|R
2500|$|On October 26, 2007, the Georgia State Supreme Court ruled 4–3 that Wilson's {{sentence}} was cruel and unusual, {{and ordered him}} released. He {{was released from prison}} in the late afternoon that day. [...] The majority opinion said that the new law (which made oral sex between minors a misdemeanor instead of a felony) “represent a seismic shift in the legislature’s view of the gravity of oral sex between two willing teenage participants” and “reflect a decision by the people of this State that the severe felony punishment and sex offender registration imposed on Wilson make no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment. ... Although society has a significant interest in protecting children from premature sexual activity, we must acknowledge that Wilson’s crime does not {{rise to the level of}} culpability of adults who prey on children and that, for the law to punish Wilson as it would an adult, with the extraordinarily harsh punishment of ten years in prison without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> probation or <b>parole,</b> appears to be grossly disproportionate to his crime." ...|$|R
25|$|Baddour {{subsequently}} sentenced Lovette to life {{in prison}} without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole.</b> Neither Lovette nor Carson's parents spoke before the sentence was handed down. On February 5, 2013, the North Carolina Court of Appeals vacated Lovette's life sentence and ordered a new sentencing hearing. The decision relied on Miller v. Alabama, where the Supreme Court ruled that a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole for defendants under 18 at the time of a crime is cruel and unusual punishment. On June 3, a re-sentencing hearing was held. After Baddour considered mitigating circumstances, Lovette was again sentenced to life without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 19 November 2010, Dupas {{was again}} {{convicted of the}} murder of Mersina Halvagis after three and half days of {{deliberations}} by the jury. On 26 November 2010, Dupas was sentenced to life in prison, without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>parole.</b>|$|E

5000|$|What {{became known}} as the [...] "Rockefeller drug laws" [...] were a product of Rockefeller's attempt to deal with the rapid {{increase}} in narcotics addiction and related crime. In 1962, he proposed a program of voluntary rehabilitation for addicted convicts rather than prison time. This was approved by the legislature, but by 1966 it was evident that this program was not working, as most addicts chose short prison terms rather than three years of treatment. Rockefeller then turned to a program of compulsory treatment, rehabilitation, and aftercare for three years. While this program saw success in rehabilitating addicts, it did little to reduce the narcotics trade and associated crime. Rockefeller was also frustrated believing that the federal government was not doing anything significant to address the problem. Feeling that existing laws and the way they were being implemented did not solve the problem of the [...] "drug pusher", and pressured by voters angry about the drug problem, Rockefeller proposed a hard-line approach. As approved by the legislature in 1973, the new drug laws included mandatory life sentences without <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> plea-bargaining or <b>parole</b> for all drug users, dealers, and those convicted of drug-related violent crimes; a $1,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of drug pushers; and deleting less harsh penalties for youthful offenders. Public support for the measures was mixed, as were the results. They did not lead more addicts to seek rehabilitation as hoped, and ultimately did not solve the problem of drug trafficking. These were among the toughest drug laws in the United States when they were enacted and are still on the books, albeit in moderated form. To carry out the rehabilitation program Rockefeller created the State Narcotics Addiction Control Commission (later the State Drug Abuse Control Commission.) New York also provided the financial support for research in methadone maintenance and the administration of the largest methadone maintenance program in the US.|$|R
