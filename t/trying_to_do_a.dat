25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E

500|$|As {{the series}} progressed during its {{broadcast}} season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, [...] "I {{think we did}} a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network." [...] However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, [...] "We were biting off more than we could chew... we were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously."

500|$|Into Temptation {{marks the}} second film by {{independent}} filmmaker Patrick Coyle, who {{wrote and directed}} the 2003 drama film Detective Fiction. Coyle said Into Temptation was partially inspired by his father, James Patrick Coyle, a kind but belligerent {{man who had been}} encouraged by his mother to become a priest. James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in World War II and met Margaret Mary Quinlan, who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle's mother. Coyle conceived of the script for Into Temptation while imagining what kind of priest his father would have been. His father strongly approved of the project, and told Coyle, [...] "Go make that movie. And tell the truth." [...] Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend, the Reverend Damian Zuerlein, who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children. Coyle said of him, [...] "He's just a young, energetic, competent, committed, devoted man working with a poor parish. And he loves his work. I was inspired by that." [...] Coyle said when writing Into Temptation, he did not intend to make a religious film, and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein, [...] "The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender. He's a good man <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> job the best he can." ...|$|E
