Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E
5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? <b>That</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> the basic issue.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. <b>That</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

500|$|Hand is also {{remembered as}} a pioneer of modern {{approaches}} to statutory interpretation. His decisions in specialist fields, such as patents, torts, admiralty law, and antitrust law, set lasting standards for craftsmanship and clarity. On constitutional matters, he was both a political progressive and an advocate of judicial restraint. He believed in the protection of free speech and in bold legislation to address social and economic problems. He argued, however, that the United States Constitution does not empower courts to overrule the legislation of elected bodies, except in extreme circumstances. Instead, he advocated the [...] "combination of toleration and imagination <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> the epitome of all good government".|$|E
500|$|Quesada sees Peter's {{making a}} [...] "deal with the Devil" [...] as a villain (Mephisto) taking {{advantage}} of someone at his weakest moment. This, he feels, is a better resolution than Peter and Mary Jane getting divorced, which would indicate [...] "they gave up on their love, that their life in love together was so awful, so stressful, so unfulfilling {{that they had to}} raise a red flag and walk away from it. They quit on their marriage and even more tragic, (they) quit on each other. Instead, we had them make a deal with the devil. [...] 'Cause that isn't as bad." [...] Quesada went on to say, [...] "Peter and MJ didn't quit on their love, they sacrificed it to save a life, <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> a pretty heroic story." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, Clark Gregg {{explained}} how the series would tie into the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: [...] "...the exciting part {{is going to}} be seeing the way that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in , and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show." [...] Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from The Avengers, saying [...] "It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think." [...] He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, explaining [...] "It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent ... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> that they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [...] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me." ...|$|E

500|$|Hunt played several instruments, {{including}} guitar, keyboards, drums, bass synthesizer, and {{the electronic}} drum. When he finished writing and recording the demos, Hunt began the album's primary recording sessions at Santa Fe Tracking Station in Los Angeles. With What Were You Hoping For?, Hunt pursued a [...] "harder edge" [...] and rawer aesthetic than featured on his previous work. He {{also wanted to}} explore a self-described [...] "gnarly" [...] guitar sound inspired {{by the work of}} Muddy Waters and The Stooges' 1973 album Raw Power. Hunt attempted the sound in the past, but encountered discouragement from management. He discussed his direction for the album in an interview for The Boombox, stating [...] "t wasn't necessarily punk music. It was more about trying to capture the growl of a cello. <b>That</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> as nasty as it can get. That's a beautiful sound to me. When people talk about the distortion on the guitar, I hear the same thing with that growl of a cello." [...] Hunt wanted to take advantage of his newfound feeling of artistic freedom and lack of concern over marketability.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] <b>That</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That is the thing that made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. <b>That,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

5000|$|John Stagliano {{attributed}} {{the success of}} his 1989 film The Adventures of Buttman to its [...] "unique style", especially during the opening scene. The scene features Stagliano, Tianna, and Jamie Gillis; Stagliano recalled: [...] "Tianna looked right at me, actually looking at the camera, {{it was the first time}} that something like this had really happened [...] <b>That</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>was</b> a vehicle for being creative and doing weird stuff. It quickly became tremendously popular".|$|R
2500|$|Composer Terry Riley {{describes}} how {{he works with}} the Kronos Quartet, an ensemble devoted to contemporary music: [...] "When I write a score for them, it's an unedited score. I put in just a minimal amount of dynamics and phrasing marks...we {{spend a lot of}} time trying out different ideas in order to shape the music, to form it. At the end of the process, it makes the performers actually own the music. [...] <b>That</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> the best way for composers and musicians to interact." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2006 {{edition of}} the ABC News program Nightline, Parker {{expressed}} his views on religion, stating that he believes in [...] "a God" [...] and that [...] "there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess" [...] while cautioning {{that it would take}} a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are [...] "silly". He states that [...] "All the religions are superfunny to me… The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. Why could God only have one son and why would he have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act." [...] Parker further remarked, Basically… out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah… there's this big giant universe and it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause… just cause. <b>That,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> the most ridiculous explanation ever.|$|E
2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. <b>That,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong {{when you go to the}} closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|E
