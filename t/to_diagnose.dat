5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and <b>to</b> <b>diagnose</b> heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used <b>to</b> <b>diagnose</b> heavy metal poisoning.

This study investigates the four separate outcomes of susceptibility, likelihood <b>to</b> be <b>diagnosed,</b> worry, and fear for contracting Lyme disease. University students (n= 713) were surveyed about demographics, perceived health, Lyme disease knowledge, Lyme disease preventive behaviors, Lyme disease history, and Lyme disease miscellaneous variables. We {{found that women}} were associated with increased susceptibility and fear. Asian/Asian-American race/ethnicity was associated with increased worry and fear. Perceived good health was associated with increased likelihood <b>to</b> be <b>diagnosed,</b> worry, and fear. Correct knowledge was associated with increased susceptibility and likelihood <b>to</b> be <b>diagnosed.</b> Those who typically {{spend a lot of}} time outdoors were associated with increased susceptibility, likelihood <b>to</b> be <b>diagnosed,</b> worry, and fear. In conclusion, healthcare providers and public health campaigns should address susceptibility, likelihood <b>to</b> be <b>diagnosed,</b> worry, and fear about Lyme disease, and should particularly target women and Asians/Asian-Americans to address any possible misconceptions and/or offer effective coping strategies...|$|R

40|$|Background:Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} locality differences of sickness absence {{in the context of}} health and social conditions of inhabitants. Aim:To examine the number of days of sickness absence among blue- and white-collar workers according <b>to</b> the <b>diagnoses</b> in four factories of a food industry in Finland during a 6 -year period (2003 - 2008).     Methods:The study was carried out at the main four food factories of a large food industry   in Finland.   The data was collected in a 6 -year period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008 from the personnel register of the company. The data included age, gender, occupational status, target units, sickness absence of all members of staff due <b>to</b> <b>diagnoses,</b> and person years of work.   The study participants were represented by blue (88. 3 %). and white collar workers (11. 7 %). The age structure of the study was from 17 to 69, the mean age by 2006 was 36. 8 with range equal to 13. 1. Descriptive analyses were done by using frequency tables. The number of sickness absence days per person years among blue and white collar workers was calculated separately for each factory due <b>to</b> <b>diagnoses.</b> Differences in sickness absence for each diagnosis in different factories among blue and collar workers were evaluated with rate ratio and 95 % CI from general linear models, presuming negative binominal distribution for the days. Results:There were significant differences in number of sick leave days due <b>to</b> <b>diagnoses</b> in the studied target units. The highest rate of sickness absence days according <b>to</b> <b>diagnoses</b> was among blue (127. 3) and white (53. 5) collar workers at one of the factories. Also, the highest incidence rate of diseases was noted in blue (RR= 2. 16, 95 %CI 1. 04 - 4. 50) and white (RR= 2. 73, 95 %CI 1. 86 - 4. 00) collar workers of the same factory. Musculoskeletal diseases were the most common reason for sick leave, followed by injury or accident for blue and flu for white collar workers. Conclusion:The study showed that there are differences in number of sick absence days due <b>to</b> <b>diagnoses</b> between four food factories belonging to the same company.

40|$|Rural {{residents}} report lower {{likelihood of}} exercising, and {{higher rates of}} obesity, heart disease, and diabetes compared to their urban counterparts. Our goals were to (1) investigate the outcomes of telemedicine consultations for pediatric obesity on changes/additions <b>to</b> <b>diagnoses,</b> diagnostic evaluation or treatment, and (2) determine whether changes in diagnostic and management recommendations made by the consultant were associated with improvements in patient nutrition, activity level, and weight. We conducted a retrospective medical record review of patients referred to a University-affiliated Children's Hospital Pediatric Telemedicine Weight Management Clinic for a diagnosis of obesity. Of the 139 children and adolescents who received pediatric weight management consultations during the study period, 99 patients met inclusion criteria. Weight management consultations resulted in changes/additions <b>to</b> <b>diagnoses</b> in 77. 8 % of patients and changes/additions to diagnostic evaluation in 79. 8 % of patients. Of patients seen more than once, 80. 7 % showed improvement in clinical outcomes. Of patients seen more than once, 80. 6 % improved their diet, 69. 4 % increased activity levels, 21. 0 % showed slowing of weight gain or weight maintenance, and 22. 6 % showed weight reduction. Improvements in clinical outcomes were not associated with changes/additions <b>to</b> <b>diagnoses</b> (Odds Ratio [OR][*]=[*] 0. 98; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI][*]=[*] 0. 25 – 3. 98) and were weakly associated with changes/additions to diagnostic evaluations (OR[*]=[*] 2. 23; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 58 – 8. 73). However, changes/additions to treatment were associated with improvement in weight status (OR[*]=[*] 9. 0; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 34 – 76. 21). Obesity consultations were associated with changes/additions <b>to</b> <b>diagnoses,</b> diagnostic evaluation, and treatment. Treatment changes were associated with improvement in weight status.
