50|$|PRINCE2 asserts regular meetings, like weekly team meetings, are {{inefficient and}} unnecessary. Instead, work {{packages}} are assigned by <b>team</b> <b>managers</b> to <b>team</b> members including deliverables {{with time and}} quality tolerances. If work progresses smoothly then the workers have no need {{to interfere with the}} <b>team</b> <b>manager's</b> time. Only if something deviated from the plan is communication and management required from them. Some <b>team</b> <b>managers</b> may request short status updates such as weekly emails or informal chats, to monitor for any exceptions, but no formal management is required unless an exception occurs.|$|R

50|$|Additionally, fantasy {{football}} <b>team</b> <b>managers</b> pour {{money into}} the industry themselves. Many fantasy leagues require an entry fee, which are used to fund prizes for the league winners. These fees and their resulting payoffs are typically small, and represent more of a transfer of wealth between players than contributions to the overall economy. However, fantasy football <b>team</b> <b>managers</b> {{are also more likely}} to spend on other industries. When compared to non-fantasy sports fans, <b>team</b> <b>managers</b> are significantly more likely to purchase alcohol, airline tickets, and sports magazines. They {{are also more likely to}} purchase fast food and soft drinks.|$|R

5|$|Midway {{through the}} 2010 season, Bouygues Telecom {{announced}} that they wished to reduce their involvement in financing the team, and were interested in continuing their partnership with the squad. This was on the proviso that <b>team</b> <b>manager</b> Jean-René Bernaudeau could find a primary sponsor that would allow Bouygues Telecom to contribute €1 million to the team's budget, {{but the rest of}} its finances would be covered by an incoming sponsor. At this point in time, the team had lodged an application to become a UCI ProTeam once again in 2011. Following his victory in the inaugural Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, Voeckler was complacent about his team's future, believing his <b>team</b> <b>manager</b> Bernaudeau would eventually find a sponsor. Bernaudeau himself was still hopeful of acquiring a deal at that point, but that deadlines were working against him in order for the team to return as a professional team from the 2011 season onwards.|$|E

5|$|After the {{appointment}} of Geoff Henke—who {{had been unable to}} compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team's application—as <b>team</b> <b>manager</b> in 1976, the results slowly began to improve, and by the 1990s, some Australians were regarded as medal prospects. The upturn in performance was accompanied by increased government funding for winter sports, the creation of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria.|$|E
5|$|As {{with each}} All-Star Game since 1970, the eight {{starting}} position players (with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium) of each league were elected by fan balloting.

5|$|Chance {{began his}} career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through the 1902 season. Due in part to finger {{injuries}} suffered while catching, Chance played in no more than 75 games in a season through 1902. In 1903, Johnny Kling became the Cubs' full-time catcher. As Bill Hanlon, the Cubs' first baseman, left the <b>team,</b> <b>manager</b> Frank Selee moved Chance to first base. Though Chance initially balked at the position change, he agreed when he received a pay raise.|$|E
5|$|During the 1978 FIFA World Cup, held in Argentina, Rudel {{visited the}} German {{national}} football team in their {{training camp in}} Ascochinga.
