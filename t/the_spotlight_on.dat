5|$|Webber {{started from}} fourth {{place in his}} final Formula One Grand Prix at the Interlagos circuit for the Brazilian Grand Prix held on 24 November. After a race-long duel with the Ferrari of close friend Fernando Alonso, Webber {{finished}} his final race in second place behind teammate Sebastian Vettel, setting the fastest lap of the race. By finishing second, Webber jumped from fifth to third in the final championship standings, overtaking both Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen, who did not compete {{in the final two}} races of the season. Despite their frosty relationship and winning his thirteenth race of the year (and ninth in succession), Vettel was happy to hand <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> the podium in Brazil to his retiring teammate, congratulating him on his career.|$|E

25|$|During the Joshua Tree Tour, Bono would {{frequently}} grab a large spotlight {{and shine}} into peoples' {{faces in the}} audience, and would also make numerous political references to figures such as Ronald Reagan and Jerry Falwell.

25|$|It was {{not long}} before the Liberals' {{campaign}} against ruling-party sleaze faltered. On 16 November, Debnam suggested in parliament that Debus was under investigation by the Police Integrity Commission. In response the Government released a police report stating that a minister had been the subject of complaints (not an investigation) which were dismissed in 2003 as spurious and groundless. The report did not name the minister concerned as it was deemed to be 'not in the public interest'. Debnam's attack backfired spectacularly, throwing <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> his judgement and not Iemma's.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the trailing}} interest issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. US Senator Carl Levin {{raised the issue of}} millions of Americans affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry. In 2009, the C.A.R.D. Act was signed into law, enacting protections for many of the issues Levin had raised.|$|E
25|$|Between 1900 and 1924, {{approximately}} 1.75 million Jews {{migrated to}} America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted {{to less than}} 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the upward social mobility of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, in the USA, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of Leo Frank by a mob of prominent citizens in Marietta, Georgia in 1915 turned <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> antisemitism in the United States. The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the Ku Klux Klan which had been inactive since 1870.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by critics. Times reviewer James Poniewozik called [...] "You Win or You Die" [...] the [...] "most thrilling and thematically rich hour to date," [...] AOL TV's Maureen Ryan found it an excellent outing that [...] "saw the stakes raised in satisfying and suspenseful ways," [...] and HitFix's Alan Sepinwall {{called it a}} terrific episode and commended how [...] "it turned <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> the characters who are villains in Ned Stark's version of the story." ...|$|E

The protest letter said that <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> Tel Aviv was part of [...] "the Israeli propaganda machine" [...] because it {{was supported in part by}} funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Other signers included actor Danny Glover, musician David Byrne, journalist John Pilger, and authors Alice Walker, Naomi Klein, and Howard Zinn.|$|E

500|$|Fellow Jezebel writer Jia Tolentino {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of Erdely's story and reported on fraternity rush after the Rolling Stone article was discredited. [...] In her article Tolentino stated: [...] "Five years after I'd left the UVA Greek system, I read 'A Rape on Campus' as an outsider account about a true problem, written by someone good at cherry-picking... So {{it took me a}} day or two to admit that I found many of Erdely's details unrecognizable. No one says 'UVrApe'; no one I know has ever heard the Rugby Road-themed 'traditional fight song' that poetically ('fuck for 50 cents'/'panties on the fence') separated the article's sections... Jackie was lying, and railroaded into <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> a story that now appears to be a PTSD-laced delusional flashback." ...|$|E
500|$|Artist V. Jeevananthan {{compared}} Aval Appadithan {{to other}} films whose central theme was women, such as Charulata (1964), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), and Panchagni (1986), while also labelling them as [...] "classics that put <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> women." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, {{in their book}} Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, Dhakam, which starred R. Muthuraman and Pandari Bai. They also note that Aval Appadithan uses a [...] "fluid narrative style" [...] and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and [...] "glossy pictorialism". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks [...] "what {{do you think of}} 'women's liberation'", [...] Arun's wife answers, [...] "I don't know", [...] to which Manju says [...] "that is why you are happy", send the message that one will inevitably get into trouble if one exhibits assertive behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Christina Lee from Idolator {{called it}} [...] "extravagant" [...] and found {{similarity}} {{to the release}} of Jackson's music video for [...] "Remember the Time", with Gaga building up anticipation for [...] "G.U.Y." [...] with teasers and premiere. Marissa G. Muller from MTV News commended the fashion, the choreography, the appearance of RHOBH in the video, and all who worked in it in the credits, saying [...] "While it's a humbling move to put <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> everyone else's contributions, it's also a reminder of how truly epic this production is. It's gonna be really hard for Gaga to out-Gaga this one." [...] Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly was impressed by the grandiose of the video calling it [...] "camp-pop delirium". He compared it with director Jean Cocteau's films and proposed different theories as to the plot of the video, including ode to old and new Hollywood and a satire of [...] "corporate subservience". This view was shared by Whitney Phaneuf from HitFix who called it a [...] "heavy dose of camp and pop culture".|$|E

500|$|The book is {{categorized}} as non-fiction science but some commentators emphasize {{it may be}} better described as speculative fiction. The World Without Us is grounded in environmental and science journalism. Like other environmental books, it discusses the impact that the human race has had on the planet. Weisman's thought experiment removes the judgments and sufferings of humans by focusing on a hypothetical post-human world. This approach to the genre, which [...] "throw <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> the earth itself", {{was found to be}} creative and objective. There have been other books that address similar topics, such as Gregory Benford's 1999 book Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia. Science fiction writers such as H. G. Wells (The War of the Worlds, 1898) and John Wyndham (The Day of the Triffids, 1951) had earlier touched upon the possible fate of cities and other man-made structures after the sudden removal of their creators. Similar parallels in the decay of civilization are detailed in 1949 post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by Berkeley English professor George R. Stewart, Earth Abides.|$|E
500|$|Television critics {{tended to}} view [...] "Cocktails" [...] positively. Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO Networks praised the episode's writing and directing, {{explaining}} that [...] " [...] {{of the credit}} goes to Paul Lieberstein for his ruthlessly funny writing, but ol' J.J. really knows how to run with the material and make awkward situations just that much more painful with his direction, {{one of the best}} episodes of the series." [...] Buddy TV writer Oscar Dahl noted that [...] "besides a couple of crafty camera moves, his work was mostly invisible, which is exactly what you want from a director on The Office." [...] IGN's Brian Zoromski appreciated <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> female characters Jan, Pam, and Karen, and thought there were [...] "quite a few great little moments this episode," [...] including [...] "a great Creed moment as he revealed he runs a fake ID company out of his car." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed Karen conning Jim at the party, called Rashida Jones' performance [...] "brilliantly played"; West also liked Pam's newfound confidence, but believed she was [...] "dumb" [...] for telling Roy of her kiss with Jim.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Abby West commented of Dwight's ouster, [...] "There's no way Rainn Wilson {{is off the}} show, {{but it was a}} bold move to let him {{appear to}} be bested by the (slightly) more Machiavellian Andy. I can't wait to see how they play out this storyline." [...] West {{referred}} to [...] "Phyllis' expert psychological move" [...] with the makeovers as her favorite subplot of the night, and appreciated <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> <b>on</b> the sales pairings; she expanded on this latter point, [...] "The trip out of the office was also a great reminder of what these Dunder Mifflin-ers actually do and how good most of them are. Isn't it interesting that as much as they normally clash, Dwight and Jim make a very effective sales team, while the seeming bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to keep Andy from punting their pitch? When Dwight started using the client's phone, Jim didn't skip a beat. They'd either used the ploy (of dialing the competition's customer service number and showing how long the wait time was) before, or Jim is comfortable going with Dwight's flow, at least in that kind of setting. They essentially played good cop/bad cop... or good cop/weird cop." [...] Other television critics also praised the various sales call pairings.|$|E
