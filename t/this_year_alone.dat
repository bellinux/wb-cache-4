[...] "There is below us--the 'Double-Four'--the eight gentlemen now present, an executive council composed {{of five of}} the shrewdest men in France. They take their orders from us. We plan, and they obey. We have imagination, and special sources of knowledge. They have the most perfect machinery for carrying out our schemes {{that it is possible}} to imagine. I do not wish to boast, Mr. Ruff, but if I take a directory of Paris and place after any man's name, whatever his standing or estate, a black cross, that man dies before seven days have passed. You buy your evening paper--a man has committed suicide! You read of a letter found by his side: an unfortunate love affair--a tale of jealousy or reckless speculation. Mr. Ruff, the majority of these explanations are false. They are invented and arranged for by us. <b>This</b> <b>year</b> <b>alone,</b> five men in Paris, of position, have been found dead, and accounted, for excellent reasons, suicides. In each one of these cases, Monsieur Ruff, although not a soul has a suspicion of it, the removal of these men was arranged for by the' Double-Four.'" ...|$|E

50|$|The Weeks Act also {{provided}} measures for more cooperation between {{federal and state}} governments in regard to fire control. This legislation was heavily influenced by the fire season of 1910 because it wreaked havoc across the western United States, particularly in Idaho, where 85 people, including 72 firefighters, were killed in fires and more than 3 million acres (12,000 km2) of land and roughly 8,000,000,000 board feet (19,000,000 m3) of timber were destroyed by fires that <b>year.</b> <b>This</b> <b>year's</b> fire season <b>alone</b> put the US Forest Service $1.1 million in debt.|$|R
50|$|Alfalfa is also {{important}} due to its high biomass production. It is a widely adapted crop, energy-efficient, and {{an important source of}} biological nitrogen fixation.

In some years, losses can be minimal, while in others they can be detrimental.|$|R

40|$|The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) has {{introduced}} substantial risk into {{the investment of}} Canadians’ public pensions by moving assets from secure government bonds to market-based equities, real estate and hedge funds. This risk, because of the recent economic recession, has resulted in substantial losses to the Board’s portfolio assets of over $ 17. 5 billion in <b>this</b> current fiscal <b>year</b> <b>alone.</b> Under the guise of its internally developed “Policy on Responsible Investing,” the CPPIB invests the assets without concern for corporate social responsibility, promising to engage with rather than divest from irresponsible corporations. This adherence to a market-based investment philosophy has resulted in Canadians’ pension assets being risked and lost. The CPPIB therefore eschews its fiduciary responsibility to protect Canadians’ pensions for the foreseeable future. Failing the implementation of better risk management strategies including the reallocation of assets, new contributions {{may be required to}} fund future pension liabilities...|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as colobus monkeys. Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing {{with other members of}} the troop in response to begging behaviours. The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each <b>year.</b> <b>This</b> <b>alone</b> was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.|$|R
