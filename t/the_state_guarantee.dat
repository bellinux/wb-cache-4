Although {{only a small number}} of introduced aquarium species, such as tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus (Cichlidae), goldfish Carassius auratus (Cyprinidae), carp Cyprinus carpio (Cyprinidae), one-spot livebearers Phalloceros caudimaculatus (Poeciliidae) and the mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki (Poeciliidae), are presently entrenched in Western Australian inland waters (Trendall and Johnson, 1981; Allen, 1989; Pen and Potter, 1991; Morgan et al., 1998; Kailola et al., 1999; WA Museum Records; unpublished data), the sheer numbers of these and other species entering <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>guarantee</b> an uncertain future.

40|$|Difficulties {{in finding}} {{appropriate}} financing weigh {{heavily on the}} ability to grow of Italy’s small enterprises, due to their narrow equity base and limited access to credit markets. The State Fund for guarantees to SMEs is one of the instruments used to overcome such difficulties. This essay provides the first evaluation of the impact of this Fund in terms of ability to increase the availability of credit, reduction of borrowing costs and financial sustainability. Extensive econometric tests have been carried out by comparing the performance of the SMEs that benefited from this guarantee with a control group made out of a sample of comparable firms. The findings confirm the presence of a causal relationship between <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>guarantee</b> and the higher debt leverage of guaranteed firms, as well as their lower debt cost. The guarantee instrument has proved to be an effective instrument, although it has had a limited economic impact because of its narrow capital base and selective approach.
