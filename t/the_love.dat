5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of <b>the</b> <b>love</b> story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to <b>the</b> <b>love</b> triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of <b>the</b> <b>love</b> story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from <b>the</b> <b>love</b> triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue to invent their own resolutions.|$|E

5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} <b>the</b> <b>love</b> of Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The confusion that follows results in the outwitting and humiliation of the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, {{takes advantage of the}} situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also mending her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon, in reality they are mere spectators, not the movers, in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about <b>the</b> <b>love</b> of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E
