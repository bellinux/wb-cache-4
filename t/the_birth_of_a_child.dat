5|$|Stay-at-home dads are not {{prevalent}} in East Asian countries, which generally have strict traditional gender roles. However, {{a survey conducted}} in 2008 in Japan suggested that nearly one third of married men would accept the role. The Japanese government passed a law in April 1992 allowing time off following <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> for {{both male and female}} employees. In 1996, 0.16% of Japanese fathers took time off of work to raise children. In South Korea, about 5,000 men were stay-at-home dads in 2007. Even so, stay-at-home dads face discrimination from stay-at-home mothers, and are often ostracized.|$|E
25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> {{men were}} rarely present.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Race is a 1918 American silent drama film {{directed}} by John W. Noble.

25|$|The {{substance}} of the Brahmana text varies with each Veda. For example, {{the first chapter of}} the Chandogya Brahmana, one of the oldest Brahmanas, includes eight ritual suktas (hymns) for the ceremony of marriage and rituals at <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> The first hymn is a recitation that accompanies offering a Yajna oblation to Agni (fire) on the occasion of a marriage, and the hymn prays for prosperity of the couple getting married. The second hymn wishes for their long life, kind relatives, and a numerous progeny. The third hymn is a mutual marriage pledge, between the bride and groom, by which the two bind themselves to each other. The sixth through last hymns of the first chapter in Chandogya Brahmana are ritual celebrations on <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and wishes for health, wealth, and prosperity with a profusion of cows and artha. However, these verses are incomplete expositions, and their complete context emerges only with the Samhita layer of text.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these festivals, ceremonies marking rites of passage are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and the Shichi-Go-San. When a child is born they are brought to a shrine {{so that they can}} be initiated as a new believer and the kami can bless them and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. It is a time for these young children to personally offer thanks for the kami’s protection and to pray for continued health.|$|E
25|$|From 3 December 2004 onwards, persons born {{outside of}} India {{shall not be}} {{considered}} citizens of India unless their birth is registered at an Indian diplomatic mission within one year of the date of birth. In certain circumstances {{it is possible to}} register after one year with the permission of the Central Government. The application for registration of <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> must be made to an Indian diplomatic mission and must be accompanied by an undertaking in writing from the parents of the child that he or she does not hold the passport of another country.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} further {{follow-up}} studies conducted {{using a different}} approach. In these follow-up studies the experimenters contacted certain individuals after foreseeable emotional experiences, such as <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> giving blood, or taking an exam. This way, the experimenters chose not only the emotional event to be recalled, but furthermore the types of emotional events they would be studying {{so that they could}} examine possible differences between types of emotional events. The findings of these studies supported those of the retrospective studies: 96–100% of emotional events were socially shared. Furthermore, no significant difference was found in the frequency of social sharing between different types of emotional events.|$|E

25|$|Adolescence {{and early}} {{adulthood}} {{have been described}} as special times in memory encoding because individuals typically recall a disproportionate number of autobiographical memories from those periods. The reminiscence bump accounts for this disproportionate number of memories. The reminiscence bump typically occurs between 10 years of age and 30 years of age and is the period that individuals produce the most memories during free recall tasks. Research suggests that memories are easily accessible from the reminiscence bump because they are linked to self-identity. The memories found within the reminiscence bump significantly contribute to an individual's life goals, self-theories, attitudes, and beliefs. Additionally, life events that occur during the period of the reminiscence bump, such as graduation, marriage, or <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> are often very novel, thus, making them more memorable.|$|E
25|$|Sea salt was {{a common}} {{condiment}} in ancient Hawaii, and Inamona, a relish made of roasted, mashed kukui nutmeats, sea salt and sometimes mixed with seaweeds, often accompanied the meals. At important occasions, a traditional feast, ‘aha‘aina, was held. When a woman was to have her first child, her husband started raising a pig for the ‘Aha‘aina Mawaewae feast that was celebrated for <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> Besides the pig, mullet, shrimp, crab, seaweeds and taro leaves were required for the feast. The modern name for such feasts, lū‘au, was not used until 1856, replacing the Hawaiian words ‘aha‘aina and pā‘ina. The name lū‘au came from {{the name of a}} food always served at a ‘aha‘aina — young taro tops baked with coconut milk and chicken or octopus.|$|E
25|$|The {{loss of a}} {{significant}} person in one's life will typically initiate a grief response; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while {{in the company of}} others. Loneliness may also occur after <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> (often expressed in postpartum depression), after marriage, or following any other socially disruptive event, such as moving from one's home town into an unfamiliar community, leading to homesickness. Loneliness can occur within unstable marriages or other close relationships of a similar nature, in which feelings present may include anger or resentment, or in which the feeling of love cannot be given or received. Loneliness may represent a dysfunction of communication, and can also result from places with low population densities in which there are comparatively few people to interact with. Loneliness can also be seen as a social phenomenon, capable of spreading like a disease. When one person in a group begins to feel lonely, this feeling can spread to others, increasing everybody's risk for feelings of loneliness. People can feel lonely even when they are surrounded by other people.|$|E

25|$|Magic {{texts and}} amulets attest by {{name to the}} {{prevalence}} of a belief in reproductive demons in the Greco-Roman world. During the Byzantine period, textual evidence of the child-harming demon is most often found in exorcisms or demonologies. Historian of ancient religion Sarah Iles Johnston suggests that this belief is expressed more commonly in earlier literature than has been noticed. The Homeric epics allude to the unmarried dead, who are excluded from the Underworld and might harm the living. In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Demeter {{in her role as}} a kourotrophic ("youth-nurturing") goddess promises to protect her hosts' infant from demonic attack in language that recalls known magical incantations. Centuries later, in Augustan Rome, Ovid describes the practice of protecting doorways with buckthorn after <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to ward off striges, winged female demons who were thought to suck the blood of newborns. One of the twelve-and-a-half names of Gylo (see above) is Strigla, a form of the word strix as a kind of witch.|$|E
25|$|A Federal Education Grants Act {{was also}} introduced, which opened up better chances of higher {{education}} for low-income children. In addition, labor-protection and anti-trust laws were significantly strengthened, while from 1969 to 1975 alone some 140 laws were passed that entitled various socially disadvantaged groups to tax subsidies. During the mid-Seventies recession, eligibility for short-term unemployment benefits was extended from 6 to 12 months, and to 24 months in some cases. Active Labour Market Policies were substantially expanded, {{with the number of}} people benefiting from such schemes increasing from 1,600 in 1970 to 648,000 by 1975. In addition, the SPD-FDP government gave more priority to raising minimum housing standards. The Law on Nursing Homes and Homes for the Elderly (1974) sought to guarantee minimum standards in an important area of social services, while the Beratungshilfegesetz (Legal Advice Act) of 1980 strengthened the position of the indigent in need of out of court legal advice and representation. The Maternity Leave Act of 1979 permitted mothers in work to take leave of 6 months after <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> granted a maternity allowance, and safeguarded jobs for 8 months.|$|E
500|$|Davidson {{points out}} a {{potential}} connection between the descriptor apaldr (Old Norse [...] "apple tree") {{and the birth of}} King Völsung, which is described earlier in the Völsunga saga as having occurred after Völsung's father Rerir sits atop a burial mound and prays for a son, after which the goddess Frigg has an apple sent to Rerir. Rerir shares the apple with his wife, resulting in his wife's long pregnancy. Davidson states that this mound is presumably the family burial mound, and proposes a link between the tree, fruit, mound, and <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{scholarly}} {{consensus is}} that Virgil began the hexameter Eclogues (or Bucolics) in 42 BC and {{it is thought that}} the collection was published around 39–8 BC (although this assertion is not without its detractors). The Eclogues (from the Greek word for [...] "selections") are a group of ten poems roughly modeled on the bucolic hexameter poetry ("pastoral poetry") of the Hellenistic poet Theocritus. The fourth of these Eclogues can be dated to around 40 BC, during a time when the Roman Civil war seemed to be coming to an end. ‘’Eclogue’’ 4 largely concerns <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> (puer) who will become divine and eventually rule over the world. Classicist H. J. Rose notes that the poem “is in a sense Messianic, since it contains a prophecy (whether meant seriously or not) of the birth of a wonder-child of more than mortal virtue and power, who shall restore the Golden Age.” ...|$|E
500|$|Lettice Dudley {{continued}} to style herself Countess of Essex {{for several years}} into her new marriage. She lived very discreetly, often with her relatives at the Knollys family home in Oxfordshire. In February 1580 she was expecting <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> there. For the birth of Leicester's heir, Robert, Lord Denbigh, in June 1581, she moved to Leicester House on the Strand. A further advanced pregnancy was reported in September 1582 by the French ambassador, yet the outcome is again unknown. The next year Lettice Dudley became officially resident at Leicester House, and Elizabeth was once again furious with the Earl [...] "about his marriage, for he opened the same more plainly than ever before". A few weeks later Michel de Castelnau was a guest at Leicester's palatial mansion: [...] "He especially invited me to dine {{with him and his}} wife, who has much influence over him and whom he introduces only to those to whom he wishes to show a particular mark of attention." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{several months}} Verdi was preoccupied with family matters. These {{stemmed from the}} way in which the {{citizens}} of Busseto were treating Giuseppina Strepponi, with whom he was living openly in an unmarried relationship. She was shunned in the town and at church, and while Verdi appeared indifferent, she was certainly not. Furthermore, Verdi was concerned about the administration of his newly acquired property at Sant'Agata. A growing estrangement between Verdi and his parents was perhaps also attributable to Strepponi (the suggestion that this situation was sparked by <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> to Verdi and Strepponi which was given away as a foundling lacks any firm evidence). In January 1851, Verdi broke off relations with his parents, and in April they were [...] ordered to leave Sant'Agata; Verdi found new premises for them and helped them financially to settle into their new home. It may not be coincidental that all six Verdi operas written in the period 1849–53 (La battaglia, Luisa Miller, Stiffelio, Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata), have, uniquely in his oeuvre, heroines who are, in the opera critic Joseph Kerman's words, [...] "women who come to grief because of sexual transgression, actual or perceived". Kerman, like the psychologist Gerald Mendelssohn, sees this choice of subjects as being influenced by Verdi's uneasy passion for Strepponi.|$|E
