According to the actress, [...] "That {{was a lot of}} fun; I thought it was funny as well [...] It really was wonderful to be able to stretch and play this driven woman who has a goal and is going to reach it, and in the meantime she's going to be sexy doing it. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun for me because the show [...] isn't realistic so, as actors, we get to play with different types of things." [...] Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's [...] "Thirst", an experience she remembers as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] due to the fake blood they covered her in. Kreuk left the series {{at the end of the}} seventh season, but appeared in five episodes in season eight as a guest star.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} film in Atlanta {{because of its}} proximity to Cynthiana, Kentucky, Kirkman's hometown and the setting of his comic's first issue. [...] "At the beginning they talk about how {{some of the people}} in neighboring states would have gone to larger cities so they could fortify them and protect the population." [...] Kirkman had considered other cities, particularly New York City, Miami, and Chicago. Hurd had previously filmed in the city for Lifetime. Darabont felt that Atlanta offered the essentials; [...] "Atlanta and Georgia all-told is proving to be brilliant for us in terms of what it has to offer, in terms of what the story needed, in terms of the variety of locations—it really is a fantastic place to shoot." [...] Prior to filming, Kirkman toured with Darabont around the central business district. He stated, [...] "I tagged along on a location-scouting expedition, and that was pretty fun—watching Frank Darabont walking through the streets of Atlanta as if he owned the entire city, daring cars to hit him. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun." [...] Darabont ventured onto the middle of a street to grasp a perfect shot, oblivious to oncoming traffic.|$|E

He thought that having Kurt {{sabotage}} his own audition sent out a [...] "mixed message", and believed that actress Lauren Potter was [...] "used as a prop in the continuing humanization of Sue Sylvester." [...] Hale wrote that the storyline felt [...] "smarmy and artificial", though praised Lynch for making the scene with Sue's sister [...] "warm and real". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson {{felt that the}} revelation about Sue's sister was [...] "a little manipulative", though wrote that he [...] "didn't care in that glorious moment." [...] He hoped that Glee writers would not humanize Sue too often, however, fearing that she would lose her [...] "dictatorial swagger". Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 7.5/10, commenting: [...] "I really hope that episode was about {{getting a lot of}} 'issue' storylines out of the way all at once, because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of overkill." [...] He felt that, although the episode contained [...] "the usual strong humor, warm character moments and catchy musical performances", overall it felt [...] "very afterschool special".|$|E

John Lutz appears {{as the mother of}} his character, TGS writer J.D.

In addition, actress Novella Nelson guest starred as herself as Tracy Jordan's fake [...] "mother" [...] for the first time. Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin played himself in the episode as it is revealed that he was in a relationship with Liz's mother.
