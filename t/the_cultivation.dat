5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the field}} trial was to quantifiy yield, fibre content and fibre quality of 5 fibre nettle clones {{cultivated}} according {{to the principles of}} organic farming. The field trial started in 1997 and was organized in a randomised block design with 4 replications per clone. The field trial was situated in Neulengbach, Lower Austria. Since fibre nettle does not provide sufficient yields in <b>the</b> first <b>cultivation</b> year, <b>the</b> harvest of the second and third cultivation year (1998 respectively 1999) was used for calculation of yield per hectar and for the analysis of fibre content and quality. The dry matter yield (stalks) of the 5 nettle clones in <b>the</b> second <b>cultivation</b> year (1998) lies between 2, 3 – 4, 7 t/ha. Clone 1 and Clone 7 achieve the highest yields. This result was statistically significant. The dry matter yields of that year correspond with the dry matter yield achieved under extensive cultivation conditions (without nitrogen fertilizer) as described by SCHMIDKE ET AL. (1998). The dry matter yields of <b>the</b> third <b>cultivation</b> year (5, 6 – 9, 7 t/ha), however, are more than twice as high as those of <b>the</b> second <b>cultivation</b> year. They are also higher than the yields from <b>the</b> nitrogen intensive <b>cultivation</b> system described by VETTER ET AL. (1996) with 200 kg N/ha + 100 kg N/ha after the first cutting (per year; the fertilizer used was calcium ammonium nitrate). This large increase in yield in <b>the</b> third <b>cultivation</b> year is caused by an increase in the height (20 – 40 cm higher) and by the production of runners: the number of stalks per plot more than doubled in <b>the</b> third <b>cultivation</b> year. Additionally <b>the</b> undersowing of clover (Trifolium repens) seems to have had a positive effect on the growing of fibre nettle. The fibre yields lie between 335 – 411 kg/ha in <b>the</b> second <b>cultivation</b> year and between 743 – 1. 016 kg/ha in <b>the</b> third <b>cultivation</b> year. Clones with a high dry matter yield have a low fibre content and vice versa. Therefore the differences between the clones in dry matter yield/ha and fibre content are balanced and there is no more difference between the fibre yield/ha of the clones.
