30|$|The {{elevated}} background variability {{is assumed}} to be caused by the choice of the <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> and the data processing techniques specific to CTM acquisitions. The <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> was estimated to cover a standard FOV in approximately the same time in CTM and SS mode. For example, for a five-bed position acquisition, this is total axial FOV[*]=[*]axial FOV[*]+[*] 4 [*]×[*]axial FOV[*]×[*] 0.54 [*]=[*] 69.8  cm were the 0.54 is accounting for the bed overlap. With a total scan time of 5 [*]×[*] 4  min, this corresponds to a <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> of 0.58  mm/s. For an axial FOV excluding the low sensitivity regions at the axial endpoints of the scan range (a hypothetical scan with an unlimited number of bed positions), a 4 -min acquisition per bed position corresponds to a <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> of 0.5  mm/s (this <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> is also recommended in [12] for a similar image quality). In this study, the IQ phantom images were acquired with a <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> of 0.6  mm/s in CTM mode. Therefore, the CTM acquisitions resulted in a lower number of collected true events than in SS mode, which in turn resulted in an elevated background variability [33]. Nevertheless, based on the findings of Molina-Duran and colleges, [33] not the entire increase in BG variability can be explained from the decrease in count density. This is further supported by the findings of Braun and colleges [34] who showed increased noise in CTM acquisitions in comparison to SS acquisitions with equivalent numbers of true events. Therefore, we suspect at least a part of the increase is caused by noise added during the subtraction of delayed sinograms due to difficulties in creating a mean random sinograms in CTM mode, the normalization technique [35] and/or the multiple interpolation steps implemented in the “on the fly rebinning” of the projection data [22].|$|E

Based on a simple model of heat transfer in wet grinding in such that some portions of the total grinding energy (=q) is conducted into workpiece as heat (=qw) and part of qw flows into grinding fluid by convection (=qf) through the ground surface in the wheel-work interference zone, the heat partition into workpiece Rw is calculated. The heat partition of SSC is not affected so much by both <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> and wheel depth of cut with water-based grinding fluid. In the case of SSN, on the other hand, Rw increases from approximately 5 % to 35 % as <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> increases from 0. 2 to 15 m/min.

It is applied at the last stage of manufacturing process so that the high dimensional accuracy and desirable surface finish product can be achieved. However, {{there is a lot of}} problem occur in order to achieve the high dimensional accuracy and desirable surface finish. For examples, surface burning due to excessive heat produce and undesirable surface finish outcomes. The work presented in this paper aims at evaluating the surface temperature after grinding as well as the surface finish of the Stainless Steel AISI 304 grinds with Aluminium Oxide wheel by study the effect of the independent variable such as depth of cut (μm), <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> (m/s), and grinding passes. This experiment is held in two conditions which are dry and wet grinding with every condition is 18 runs of experiments. Soluble oil is used at wet grinding. The grindability results have shown that while dry grinding generates higher surface temperature and higher surface finish of the Stainless Steel workpiece rather than wet grinding. In comparison with independent variables, it is found that, the depth of cut can be labelled as the predominant effect to the rise of surface temperature and higher surface roughness of the Stainless Steel workpiece for both conditions. At the constant depth of cut, varied <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> and grinding passes, it is found that at the lowest <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> will generate higher surface temperature and smoother surface roughness for both of the experiments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to design, evaluate, and simulate passive safety devices for passive safety control. Simulations were conducted in CarSim to determine if passive safety devices, such as chicanes and <b>speed</b> <b>tables,</b> would allow non-threat vehicles to pass safely through an access control point (ACP) but adversely affect threat vehicles. Chicanes are beneficial by forcing vehicles traveling in an ACP to navigate around a series of barriers which are spaced apart at distances determined by a selected design speed. Vehicle performance limits evaluations were conducted by using a calibrated vehicle model in CarSim, which used steering, driver control, engine model, and system control features. Simulation results determined that existing guidelines were not conservative for roads narrower than 40 ft and design speeds greater than 30 mph, but were conservative for wider roads and lower design speeds. Therefore, researchers recommended full-scale testing to validate findings for the UNL proposed chicane designs. On the Phase I study, it was discovered that vehicles can be launched off of the top of the <b>speed</b> <b>table</b> at high <b>speeds.</b> Simulation studies were conducted to determine an optimized <b>speed</b> <b>table</b> shape that achieved comfort for non-threat vehicles but launched threat vehicles. Two <b>speed</b> <b>tables</b> were recommended: (1) a 10 -ft approach slope with a 10 -ft table top and (2) an 8 -ft approach slope with a 10 -ft table top.

This research proved that by using silicon carbide as a grinding wheel, it will give higher thermal effect to the workpiece instead using aluminium oxide grinding wheel. Silicon carbide wheel grinder, that have rough grain will produce high friction force during grinding process occur. This friction force then will produce heat and will produce higher value of temperature instead using aluminium oxide. Aluminium oxide that have smaller grain, will also produce heat but the value of the temperature are smaller than using silicon carbide. After that, <b>table</b> <b>speed</b> is most significant factor that effect thermal on mild steel grinding process with silicon carbide as wheel grinder but for aluminium oxide wheel grinder, thermal effect are very low when using variablesparameter...|$|E
3000|$|... 3 D-CT {{data were}} {{obtained}} from multislice CT images (SOMATOM Plus-S®; Siemens Japan, Tokyo, Japan) acquired immediately before surgery. The CT imaging conditions were as follows: 120  kV, 200  A, 15 – 20 -s exposure time, and 4  mm/s <b>table</b> <b>speed.</b> Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data from multislice CT images were reconstructed and analysed using SimPlant OMS® software (Materialise Dental Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The data were created with 0.5 -mm slice thicknesses. The segmentation level and segmentation width were 1285.5 and 1785.5  HU, respectively.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the impact of temporary speed humps and <b>speed</b> <b>tables</b> on vehicle <b>speeds,</b> vehicle speed profiles, and traffic volumes along local and/or collector streets in several rural Iowa cities. A 25 mile per hour (mph) temporary speed hump and a 30 mph temporary <b>speed</b> <b>table,</b> both made of recycled rubber, were purchased to test the impact of temporary devices. Two cities volunteered and the speed hump/table was installed on two test streets in the city of Atlantic (Roosevelt Drive and Redwood Drive) and one test street in the city of Le Claire (Canal Shore Drive). The speed hump was installed first and then converted to a <b>speed</b> <b>table.</b> Each device was installed for a period of at least two weeks at the same location. Speed, volume, and resident opinion data were then collected and evaluated...|$|R
