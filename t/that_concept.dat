40|$|In {{this paper}} I defend the claim <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> are not public. I argue {{that two of}} the main {{constraints}} for theories of <b>concepts,</b> namely (1) <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> are public and (2) that they serve to explain Frege Cases, are in tension. (1) requires concepts to be individuated coarsely, while (2) requires concepts to be individuated finely. Thus, no theory of concepts can accommodate both (1) and (2). I argue that (2) is a non-negotiable constraint for theories of concepts, while (1) is negotiable. Therefore, theories of concepts should individuate concepts finely enough to solve Frege Cases, and claim <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> are not public...|$|R

At the time, Eidos did {{not comment on the}} story. Eidos Montréal project manager Stéphane D'Astous confirmed the game's existence in November, stating <b>that</b> <b>concept</b> approval had only just been granted. An initial teaser trailer was released on November 26, 2007. The game's official title, first details, and original release window were announced at the 2010 Game Developers Conference. It was published worldwide by Square Enix. While originally scheduled for 2010, the game was shifted to beyond April the following year so the team could further polish the gameplay. It was released for PlayStation 3 (PS3), Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC). The gameplay was identical across all platforms barring control schemes. Originally Eidos had intended to make the PC retail version of the game region locked. The reason behind this was due to DVD limitations which meant the languages on the game had to be split. However, due to negative reaction from the public, this lock was not implemented.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{relationship}} between signs and concepts, this paper tackles head on some of the ongoing controversies over conceptual development and change – including the claim by some <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> are not open to revision at all – taking the position <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> pull apart from language and <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> can be discussed on at least four levels: that of individual agent, community, society, and language. More controversially, it claims <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> are not just inherently open to revision but that they, and the frameworks of which they form part, {{are in a state of}} continuous if generally incremental change: a position that derives directly from the enactive tradition in philosophy. Concepts, to be effective as concepts, must strike a careful balance between being stable enough to apply across suitably many contexts and flexible enough to adapt to each new context. The paper’s distinctive contribution is a comparison and contrast of conceptual development and change on four time scales: that of the day-to-day life of an individual conceptual agent, the day-to-day life of society, the lifetime of an individual agent, and the lifetime of society and the human species itself.

40|$|It {{certainly}} {{appears that}} there should be a relationship between concepts and meaning, but it is not entirely clear what this relation is. We shall assume <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> are people's psychological representations of categories (e. g., apple, chair); whereas meanings are people's understandings of words and other linguistic expressions (e. g., "apple", "large chair"). 1 Currently, many cognitive scientists, especially psychologists, believe <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> and meanings are at least roughly equivalent, with the meaning of an expression being its conceptual representation in human knowledge. From identifying the content of a concept, the meaning of the associated expression follows. Malt (1991) and Murphy (1991) review this position and various alternatives. In our paper, we shall argue <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> and meanings differ substantially. Although they are related in important ways, the relationship is one of complementarity, not equivalence.

40|$|What are Concepts? The {{discussion}} of conceptual change in part IV assumed <b>that</b> <b>concepts</b> {{are an important}} part of scientific knowledge, but largely ignored the crucial question of what concepts are. Previous chapters mentioned many important science concepts such as life, mind, and disease.

This chapter draws on ideas of Chris Eliasmith (forthcoming) to argue <b>that</b> <b>concepts,</b> including scientific ones, are semantic pointers- neural processes with powerful semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic capabilities. Most generally, concepts are representations corresponding to individual words that stand for classes of things; for example the concept car corresponding to the word “car ” that stands for the class of cars. The history of philosophy and cognitive science has witnessed many different interpretations of concepts, including: Concepts are abstract entities, for example the forms of Plato. • Concepts are copies of sense impressions, for example the ideas of Hume (1888). Concepts are data structures that depict prototypes, for example the frames o...|$|R

The trouble is, Psychological Essentialism lacks an account of how such essentialist concepts could be learned, and often adopt the unpalatable conclusion <b>that</b> such <b>concepts</b> are innate. Developmental roboticists have recently started implementing systems that employ learned hidden/latent variables.
