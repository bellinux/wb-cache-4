It is apparently the produce of granite and syenite, and it abounds in African Egypt. I was in hopes that tungsten and titaniferous iron would make it valuable for cutlery as the black sand of New Zealand. Experiments in the Citadel, Cairo, produced nothing save magnetic iron with a trace of lead. But according to Colonel Ross, the learned author of [...] "Pyrology, or Fire Chemistry,"[EN#24] it is iserine or magnetic ilmenite, titaniferous iron-sand, containing eighty-eight per cent. of iron (oxides and sesquioxides), with eleven per cent. of <b>titanic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

J. H. Teall, Director of the British Geological Survey in the early 1900s, Baddeleyite was discovered thanks {{to the discovery of}} Geikielite. Baddeley happened to send specimens of several pebbles to the Museum of Practical Geology in London, where Mr. Pringle examined them and attempted to classify them. According to Teall, the specimens were submitted to him by Pringle after he failed to assign them and compare them to other species, such as spinel, ilmenite, and so on. After analyzing the specimens, Teall concluded that the mineral was mainly composed of <b>titanic</b> <b>acid</b> and magnesia, with {{a very small percentage of}} protoxide of iron. Geikielite has the composition of MgTiO3. Concluding the various analyses, Teall and Pringle decided to name the new mineral Geikielite, taking the name after the Director General of the Geological Survey, Sir Archibald Geikie. Baddeley then decided to send more specimens to Teall in order to determine a proper specimen to be put in display at the Museum of Practical Geology. While trying to find the best specimen for display, as Teall relates, he noticed that one of the specimens was different from the rest. This new mineral as described was black in color, with a submetallic lustre and a hardness of 6.5. After analyzing the mineral, it was determined that its composition was not MgTiO3, as geikielite's, but it was ZrO2. Teall proposed that the new mineral should be named baddeleyite, after Joseph Baddeley to honor the man who brought two new minerals to notice.|$|E

Recently, theoretical calculations have reported that visible light activity of TiO 2 can be even further enhanced by a suitable combination of Zr and N co-doping [8]. The Zr/N co-doping of anatase TiO 2 could narrow bandgap by about 0.28  eV and enhance the lifetimes of photoexcited carriers. Previously, we had fabricated N-doped TiO 2 with visible light absorption and photocatalytic activity using precursor of nanotubular <b>titanic</b> <b>acid</b> (NTA, H 2 Ti 2 O 4 (OH) 2) [9]. The visible light sensitization of N-doped NTA sample was due to the formation of single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancies (SETOV) and N doping-induced bandgap narrowing. It was also found that the N-doped TiO 2 prepared by NTA showed the highest visible light photocatalytic activity compared with the TiO 2 prepared by different other precursors such as P 25 [10].

The results showed that Zr/N-doped TiO 2 nanostructures made by nanotubular NTA precursors show significantly enhanced visible light absorption and much higher photocatalytic performance than the Zr/N-doped P 25 TiO 2 nanoparticles.

It is proposed that the visible light response is attributed to the intra-band by the nitrogen doping and calcination-induced single electron-trapped oxygen vacancies (SETOV). Crystallization and growth of Zr/N-doped TiO 2 were also impacted by the addition of zirconium.

The TiO 2 /SrTiO 3 heterojunction obtained by 1  h showed the best activity for CO 2 photoreduction, where the mole ratio of TiO 2 and SrTiO 3 was 4 : 1. And the photo-conversion efficiency of CO 2 to CH 4 improved remarkably after the foreign electron traps of Pt and Pd nanoparticles were loaded. The highest photocatalytic production rate of CH 4 reached 20.83  ppm/h cm 2. In addition, the selectivity of photoreduction product of CO 2 was also increased apparently when Pd acted as the cocatalyst on TiO 2 /SrTiO 3 heterojunction film.|$|E
40|$|The microcapsules {{enclosing}} {{two kinds}} of functional materials, inorganic ion-exchangers and organic extractants, were prepared {{by taking advantage of}} the high immobilization ability of alginate gel polymer. The fine powders of inorganic ion-exchanger and oil drops of extractant were kneaded with sodium alginate (NaALG) solution and the kneaded sol readily gelled in a salt solution of CaCl 2, BaCl 2 or HCl to form spherical gel particles. The uptake properties of various nuclides, 137 Cs, 85 Sr, 60 Co, 88 Y, 152 Eu and 241 Am, for thirty-four specimens of microcapsules in the presence of 10 - 1 - 10 - 4 M HNO 3 were evaluated by the batch method. The distribution coefficient (Kd) of Cs+ above 103 cm 3 /g was obtained for the microcapsules enclosing CuFC or AMP. The Kd of Sr 2 + around 102 cm 3 /g was obtained for the microcapsules containing clinoptilolite, antimonic acid, zeolite A, zeolite X or <b>titanic</b> <b>acid.</b> The microcapsules enclosing DEHPA exhibited relatively large Kd values of trivalent metal ions above 103 cm 3 /g; for example, the Kd values of Cs+, Sr 2 +, Co 2 +, Y 3 +, Eu 3 + and Am 3 + for a favorable microcapsule (CuFC/clinoptilolite/DEHPA/CaALG) were 1. 1 x 104, 7. 5 x 10, 1. 1 x 10, 1. 0 x 104, 1. 4 x 104, 3. 4 x 103 cm 3 /g, respectively. The uptake rates of Cs+, Y 3 +, Eu 3 + and Am 3 + for this microcapsule were rather fast; the uptake percentage above 90 % was obtained after 19 h-shaking and the uptak...|$|E
