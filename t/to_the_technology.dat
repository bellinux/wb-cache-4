5|$|The Rolling Stones {{were the}} first major {{recording}} artists to broadcast a concert over the Internet; a 20-minute video was broadcast on 18 November 1994 using the Mbone at 10 frames per second. The broadcast, engineered by Thinking Pictures and financed by Sun Microsystems, {{was one of the}} first demonstrations of streaming video; while it was not a true webcast, it introduced many <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} further enhance the appeal of its new {{flagship}} product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed {{to tap into the}} commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. The Fax Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology.</b> This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E

25|$|In April 2001, Logistics Management Institute (LMI) {{completed}} their final {{report for the}} 'Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the USMC Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), concluding the best option was to rebuy a vehicle similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> demonstrator. Five alternative options had been considered, these were: Inspect and Replace Only As Necessary (IROAN) for the LVS; rebuild the LVS; re-manufacture the LVS to a higher standard; rebuy a vehicle similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> demonstrator; research and develop an entirely new vehicle. Around {{this time it was}} suggested that 2,000-3,000 vehicles might be required, although throughout the program numbers would fluctuate.|$|E

25|$|The first {{practical}} {{audio tape}} recorder was unveiled in 1935. Improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> were made using the AC biasing technique, which significantly improved recording fidelity. As early as 1942, test recordings {{were being made}} in stereo. Although these developments were initially confined to Germany, recorders and tapes {{were brought to the}} United States following the end of World War II. These were the basis for the first commercially produced tape recorder in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The UK became {{increasingly}} frustrated {{by a lack}} of U.S. commitment to grant access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> that would allow the UK to maintain and upgrade its F-35s without US involvement. For five years, British officials sought an ITAR waiver to secure greater technology transfer. Although this had the support of the Bush administration it was repeatedly blocked by U.S. Representative Henry Hyde, on the grounds that British laws were insufficient to prevent unauthorised transfer of U.S. technology to third parties.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, Raytheon {{invested}} heavily in a system called PRT 2000, based on technology developed by J. Edward Anderson at the University of Minnesota. Raytheon failed to install a contracted system in Rosemont, Illinois, near Chicago, when estimated costs escalated to US$50 million per mile, allegedly due to design changes that increased the weight and cost of the system relative to Anderson's original design. In 2000, rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> reverted to the University of Minnesota, and were subsequently purchased by Taxi2000.|$|E
25|$|Located in the Adelaide Park Lands at {{the eastern}} end of North Terrace, the Wine Centre offers some of the university's {{oenology}} courses.

It contains an interactive permanent exhibition of winemaking, introducing visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology,</b> varieties and styles of wine. It also has a wine tasting area, giving visitors the opportunity to taste and compare wines from different areas of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Biotechnology {{arose from}} the field of {{zymotechnology}} or zymurgy, which began as a search for a better understanding of industrial fermentation, particularly beer. Beer was an important industrial, and not just social, commodity. In late 19th-century Germany, brewing contributed as much to the gross national product as steel, and taxes on alcohol proved to be significant sources of revenue to the government. In the 1860s, institutes and remunerative consultancies were dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> of brewing. The most famous was the private Carlsberg Institute, founded in 1875, which employed Emil Christian Hansen, who pioneered the pure yeast process for the reliable production of consistent beer. Less well known were private consultancies that advised the brewing industry. One of these, the Zymotechnic Institute, was established in Chicago by the German-born chemist John Ewald Siebel.|$|E

25|$|Only {{recently}} {{also other}} extraction applications have been investigated, e.g. the large scale recovery of apolar organics on offshore oil platforms using the so-called Macro-Porous Polymer Extraction (MPPE) Technology. In such an application, where the SIR particles {{are contained in}} a packed bed, flow rates from 0.5 m3 h−1 upward without maximum flow restrictions can apparently be treated cost competitive to air stripping/activated carbon, steam stripping and bio treatment systems, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> developer. Additional investigations, mostly done in an academic environment, include polar organics like amino-alcohols, organic acids, amino acids, flavonoids, and aldehydes on a bench-scale or pilot-scale. Also, the application of SIRs for the separation of more polar solutes, such as for instance ethers and phenols, has been investigated {{in the group of}} A.B. de Haan.|$|E
25|$|The {{founding}} {{figure of}} the field in Israel, Josef Tal, was first exposed to electronic music in the late 1920s in Germany. The founding of the Israel Center for Electronic Music {{was the result of}} a six-month UNESCO research fellowship on which Tal toured major international electronic music studios, in 1958. It was a meeting with Milton Babbitt at The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center that pointed Josef Tal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> he needed to found the first electronic music studio in Israel. He learned from Vladimir Ussachevsky, about a new invention by Canadian inventor Hugh Le Caine, called the Multi-track. First built in 1955, this device could replay six independent magnetic tapes, with the speed and direction of each tape separately controllable. Le Caine's idea was to design an instrument to facilitate composition in the Parisian musique concrète tradition of Pierre Schaeffer. Following a successful fund-raising by Shalheveth Freier the Multi-track which was built for Tal's studio was completed and delivered to Jerusalem in 1961. It required a trip by Le Caine to set it up correctly.|$|E
25|$|Separation of {{isotopes}} by laser excitation is an Australian {{development that}} also uses UF6. After a protracted development process involving U.S. enrichment company USEC acquiring and then relinquishing commercialization rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology,</b> GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) signed a commercialization agreement with Silex Systems in 2006. GEH has since built a demonstration test loop and {{announced plans to}} build an initial commercial facility. Details of the process are classified and restricted by intergovernmental agreements between United States, Australia, and the commercial entities. SILEX has been projected to be {{an order of magnitude}} more efficient than existing production techniques but again, the exact figure is classified. In August, 2011 Global Laser Enrichment, a subsidiary of GEH, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a permit to build a commercial plant. In September 2012, the NRC issued a license for GEH to build and operate a commercial SILEX enrichment plant, although the company had not yet decided whether the project would be profitable enough to begin construction, and despite concerns that the technology could contribute to nuclear proliferation.|$|E
