5|$|During 2002, Prost {{spent time}} with his family and competed in eight bicycle races, {{finishing}} third in the Granite – Mont Lozère. <b>The</b> <b>Frenchman</b> raced in the Andros ice race series in 2003, finishing second in the championship behind Yvan Muller; he also became an Ambassador for Uniroyal, a position he would keep until May 2006.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after Adrienne's death, Lafayette mostly {{remained}} quietly at La Grange as Napoleon's power in Europe waxed, and then waned.

Commemorative stickers on helmets and cars were other tributes at that race. Race winner, Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, dedicated his maiden Hungarian win to Bianchi and his family, acknowledging that <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman</b> would have been part of the team in future. Daniil Kvyat too dedicated his maiden podium finish as did third-placed finisher, Daniel Ricciardo.|$|E

5|$|There {{was almost}} a return to F1 for Andretti at the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix when the Renault team put Mario on standby to replace regular driver Patrick Tambay if <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman</b> {{had been unable to}} race, as was the case at the {{previous}} race in Canada.

5|$|An hour later, having {{endured the}} fire of the guns on both shores, Aigle was in a {{position}} to attack the rear-most frigate of the pair as they emerged from the western side of the island. This frigate sought the shelter of Groix' batteries, so Aigle set off in pursuit of the other which was now making for Lorient. As it was now dark, Aigle displayed a blue light to indicate her position to the closing Impétueux, and at 21:00, coming within 50 yards, exchanged fire with <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman.</b> To prevent a boarding, which Wolfe was determined upon, the frigate came about and, shortly after the British had broken off their attack for lack of sea room, ran aground on the Pointe de Chats on the eastern edge of Groix.|$|E

He beat Christophe Lemaitre to win the 100m at the 2010 European Team Championships, helping Great Britain to second place in the tournament and {{recording}} 9.99seconds – the first sub-10 time by a European athlete in almost four years. Lemaitre and Chambers were seen as the only gold medal contenders for the 100 m final at the European Athletics Championships, but the event defied expectations in terms of times and placings. <b>The</b> <b>Frenchman</b> won in 10.11seconds into a headwind while a tight finish between the four following athletes (all 10.18) saw Chambers finish fifth.|$|E

5|$|Parkinson {{has been}} {{called one of the}} most eminent gardeners of his day. He {{maintained}} close relations with other important English and Continental botanists, herbalists and plantsmen such as William Coys, John Gerard, John Tradescant the elder (who was a close friend), Vespasian Robin, and <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman</b> Matthias de Lobel (also known as Matthias de L'Obel or Matthaeus Lobelius). Together, they belonged to the generation that began to see extraordinary new plants coming from the Levant and from Virginia, broadly speaking. In his writings, de Lobel frequently mentioned the Long Acre garden and praised Parkinson's abilities. Parkinson, on his part, edited and presented in Theatrum Botanicum the papers of de Lobel, who had spent the final years of his life in Highgate supervising the gardens of Edward la Zouche, the 11th Baron Zouche.|$|E
5|$|Prost went on {{a sabbatical}} year in 1992, which was {{dominated}} by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Renault. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team. After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in the CART series. <b>The</b> <b>Frenchman</b> had a clause in his contract which prevented rival Ayrton Senna from joining the team that year. Prost {{was part of a}} new-look driver line-up at Williams, with test driver Damon Hill coming in to replace Riccardo Patrese, who had left to join Benetton.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Patrick Vieira to Juventus, Fàbregas was given the Frenchman's number 4 shirt and featured regularly in the Arsenal central midfield alongside Gilberto Silva. He made 49 appearances in all competitions during the 2005–06 season. Despite his young age, his performances came under greater scrutiny due to his increased involvement in the first team. Further, as Fàbregas possessed a smaller frame and played with less aggression than Vieira, there were initially doubts over his ability {{to fill in the}} void left by <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman.</b> Nevertheless, Fàbregas asserted his own style of play and impressed pundits in the Champions League against Real Madrid and Juventus. In the latter, he scored Arsenal's first goal and set up Thierry Henry for the second, at the same time proving that he could compete against tough, hard-tackling midfielders like Vieira. He then played in the Final against his former club Barcelona, but Arsenal were defeated 2–1, completing a trophyless 2005–06 campaign for Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 2003–04 season, Arsenal were {{determined}} to reclaim the Premier League crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's exceptionally successful campaign; together {{with the likes of}} Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Robert Pirès, Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten, claiming the league title in the process. Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year, Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award. With 39 goals scored in all competitions, <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman</b> led the league in goals scored and won the European Golden Boot. However, {{as was the case in}} 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004.|$|E
5|$|Henry went on {{to surpass}} this tally in a more {{integrated}} 2008–09 campaign, winning the first trophy of his Barcelona career on 13 May 2009 when Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final. Barcelona won the Primera División and UEFA Champions League soon after, completing a treble for <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman,</b> who had combined with Messi and Samuel Eto'o to score 100 goals between them that season. The trio was also the most prolific trio in Spanish league history, scoring 72 goals and surpassing the 66 goals of Real Madrid's Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano and Luis del Sol of the 1960–61 season (this was later surpassed by Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuaín who scored 89 goals in 2011–12). Later in 2009, Henry helped Barcelona win an unprecedented sextuple, consisting of the aforementioned treble, the Supercopa de España, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Jarre's {{follow-up}} album, Équinoxe, {{was released}} in 1978. It was composed with sequencers, particularly on the bass, and features a more baroque and classical style than Oxygène, with more emphasis on melodic development. Though its sales were still very healthy, it had less of an impact than Oxygène, but the following year Jarre held a large open-air concert on Bastille Day, at the Place de la Concorde. The free outdoor event set a new world record for {{the largest number of}} spectators ever at an open-air concert, drawing more than 1million spectators. Although it {{was not the first time}} he had performed in concert (Jarre had already played at the Paris Opera Ballet), the 40minute-long event, which used projections of light, images and fireworks, served as a blueprint for Jarre's future concerts. Its popularity helped create a surge in sales—a further 800,000 records were sold between 14 July and 31 August 1979—and introduced <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman</b> to Francis Rimbert, who worked for Jarre during two decades on a full-time basis.|$|E

5|$|Manuel Belgrano was {{the main}} proponent of the Carlotist {{political}} movement in the Rio de la Plata, a response to recent developments in Europe, where Spain was at war with France. Through the abdications of Bayonne, the Spanish king Ferdinand VII was deposed and imprisoned and <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman</b> Joseph Bonaparte was appointed King of Spain by the French victors. This led to a partial power vacuum in the viceroyalty, as {{the legitimacy of the}} new king was rejected by all parties. The purpose of the Carlotist movement was to replace the authority of the deposed king with that of Carlota Joaquina, sister of Ferdinand, who was then living in Rio de Janeiro. The project was supported as a means to achieve more autonomy, and perhaps independence, for Spanish colonies in the New World. Belgrano kept a fluent mail communication with Carlota, and convinced many independentists to join him in the project, such as Castelli, Vieytes, Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, and Juan José Paso.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 2015, La Liga side Villarreal {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Areola on season-long loan {{as a replacement for}} regular 'keeper Sergio Asenjo who had suffered a long-term injury the season before. He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the season in a 1-1 draw with Real Betis. At Villarreal, Areola enhanced his burgeoning reputation by keeping 15 clean sheets in 37 matches and conceding only 26 goals as the club ended the season in fourth place in La Liga. His clean-sheet tally for the league season was bettered by only two goalkeepers, Jan Oblak of Atlético Madrid, and Claudio Bravo of Barcelona. Areola also broke the club record of 615 minutes of football played without conceding a goal which was previously held by Diego López, ultimately going 620 minutes unbeaten before conceding against Las Palmas. Outside of domestic football, <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman</b> featured in the Europa League {{for the first time in}} his career, making five appearances as El Submarino Amarillo reached the semi-finals where they lost out to eventual runners-up, Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Smith headed west, {{across the}} Ligurian Alps, towards {{southern}} France, which he knew {{had just been}} invaded by Allied troops, principally Americans, Free French and British. He and Bill were assisted along the way by Italian partisan groups and other locals. After 10 days on the road, three other Allied personnel—a Frenchman, an Austrian and a Pole—joined the trek, having met Smith and Bill at a partisan camp. The lingua franca of the group having changed to Italian, the five men hiked to the border, where they were taken in by an old farmer, Jean Batiste Chambrin, who gave them {{instructions on how to}} pass the German sentries guarding the border with France. The soldiers decided that because it would be too risky to try to cross all together, Smith and Bill would go first, with <b>the</b> <b>Frenchman,</b> Austrian and Pole following the next day.|$|E
