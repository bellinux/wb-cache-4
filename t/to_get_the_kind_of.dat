In the 1950 s, Harwood struggled <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> attention she sought from a number of influential poetry editors and reviewers, many of whom were also academics. Chief among them for her were A. D. Hope, Vincent Buckley and James McAuley.

They also gave literary expression to the debate between positivism and humanism that dominated some aspects of academic life in the 1950 s, and to the anger and frustration Harwood experienced at repeated rejections of her work...|$|E

Such a result confirms the abundance of cyanobacteria in the phosphatogenic milieu which had been already suggested by the coating of peloids. Phosphatogenesis took place in closed lagoons where important cyanobacterial biomasses accumulated phosphorus. Such environments are known in recent atolls, for example in Niau atoll (French Polynesia). The source of phosphorus can vary : sea water vary inputs, leaching of biogenic phosphorus from the aerial and sub-aerial parts of the reef, avian guano or endo-upwelling processes transfering deep (ca. 500 m) marine waters from outside the reef into the lagoon through the porous body of the reef.
