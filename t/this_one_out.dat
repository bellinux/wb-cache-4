When Marty observes Judd's out-of-season shooting of a deer, he uses the incident to blackmail him to sell Shiloh to him. However, this places deer in the future in danger of Judd's hunting. Marty sadly reflects: [...] "By lettin' him get away with this, I'm putting other deer in danger. He kill <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>out</b> of season, he'll figure maybe he can kill some more. To save Shiloh, I'm making it harder for deer". In essence, he selects the [...] "domestic love over the grander principle".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, {{television}} reviewer Hayden Childs {{commented that}} [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] was [...] "somewhat amusing {{and far more}} coherent than many recent episodes, but the satire is relatively mild. The episode curdles a bit while looking for a sweet ending, but it is otherwise solid enough." [...] Critics have praised the opening sequence that parodies Game of Thrones. Tim Surette of TV.com called it [...] "one minute of genius", and MTV's Brandon Freeberg wrote: [...] "Congratulations are in order for Matt Groening and his staff for really knocking <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>out</b> of the park." [...] Jenna Busch of Zap2it and Kelly West of Cinema Blend, both fans of Game of Thrones, named the opening {{the best in the}} history of the show. IGN's Eric Goldman commented: [...] "Ah, The Simpsons. Always there for us with clever/loving parody of something we all love. Such was the case last night, when the animated series opened with an epic opening credit sequence that gave us the Springfield-inspired version of the terrific Game of Thrones credits." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Record {{also said}} {{ever since the}} Buckton family arrived they [...] "created drama", noting it was Ruby and Charlie especially. All About Soap {{questioned}} whether [...] "poor Ruby" [...] would ever find a [...] "good bloke" [...] to pair up with. They also said {{it should not have}} been to hard for Ruby with all the [...] "surfer types". Holy Soap later said [...] "If there's one thing that Ruby seems to have inherited from Charlie, it's her sometimes questionable taste in men." [...] When Ruby impressed everyone with her singing voice, the Daily Record said [...] "there is actually a rather pleasant storyline involving Ruby". They described the week Ruby slept with Romeo as an eventful one for her and opined she was on [...] "cloud nine". Debbie Schipp writing for Adelaide's Sunday Mail brands Ruby [...] "a low-down boyfriend-stealer" [...] for her affair with Romeo. Caroline Fitton writing for Daily Mail observed Ruby as being [...] "self-absorbed". TV Week said the [...] "impulsive teen" [...] waited until Romeo dropped his guard and [...] "moved in for the kill", but had her [...] "head in the clouds". They correctly predicted it would end [...] "messy". They also showed Ruby little sympathy when she told Indigo about her affair and lost her friends. They said: [...] "The salient lesson here is: don't cop off with your best mate's boyfriend, so you're just gonna have to ride <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>out,</b> Rubes." [...] Peter Dyke writing for the Daily Star said Ruby is a [...] "randy schoolgirl" [...] and said that her romance with Casey was merely a [...] "passionate rebound romp". Whilst Erin Miller of TV Week said: [...] "Phew, it's hard to keep up with Ruby's romantic escapades lately!" [...] In April 2011, TV Week said Ruby had become [...] "increasingly trouble-prone" [...] and concluded that [...] "belle in blue Charlie is at her wits' end {{about what to do with}} her wayward daughter".|$|E

[...] It had such a high-stakes dilemma that soared the show to new heights, proving it could be exciting and emotional all at the same time. The actors delivered their best performances and the writing was just amazing. We have John Gray to thank for this wonderful show and for writing this wonderful episode." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{were just}} getting quite friendly, when several young men got in, {{one of whom}} stared at the pretty child till even she {{observed}} it, and showed that she did by the color that came and went in her cheeks.

60|$|On the whole, then, {{the coming}} of the kid, {{who turned out to be}} called Elspeth, did not ostracize Tommy, but he wished that he had let the other girl in, for he never doubted that her {{admittance}} would have kept <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>out.</b> He told neither his mother nor his friend of the other girl, fearing that his mother would be angry with him when she learned what she had missed, and that Shovel would crow over his blundering, but occasionally he took a side glance at the victorious infant, and a poorer affair, he thought, he had never set eyes on. Sometimes it was she who looked at him, and then her chuckle of triumph was hard to bear. As long as his mother was there, however, he endured in silence, but the first day she went out in a vain search for work (it is about as difficult to get washing as to get into the Cabinet), he gave the infant a piece of his mind, poking up her head with a stick so that she was bound to listen.|$|E
