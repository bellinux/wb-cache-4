5|$|Although {{historically}} unsubstantiated, {{the story}} of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to prosletyize, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall.|$|E

50|$|Certain Medieval Chronicles record {{events in}} Ireland during the 1st century AD, {{but it is}} {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> far <b>they</b> can be regarded as historical events, and should probably be regarded merely as legendary.|$|R
25|$|These {{first two}} records were {{produced}} by John Simon, who was practically a group member: he aided in arrangements and played occasional instruments (piano or tuba). Simon {{reported that he}} was often asked about the distinctive horn sections featured so effectively {{on the first two}} albums: people wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> had achieved such memorable sounds. Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively utilizing their limited technique.|$|E

500|$|At {{least three}} Beatles fans {{committed}} suicide after the murder, leading Ono {{to make a}} public appeal asking mourners not {{to give in to}} despair. On January 18, 1981, a full-page open letter from Ono appeared in the New York Times and the Washington Post.

500|$|Two new {{multiplayer}} modes {{are in the}} game. The {{first is}} a [...] "Party Play" [...] mode, which is immediately launched once the game is started. During [...] "Party Play", the game will automatically play randomly through the available songs. At any time, players can jump in with any instrument and start playing that song after selecting their difficulty and handedness; additional players can also jump in, drop out, or change their difficulty levels once someone is playing in this mode. The second feature is a [...] "RockFest" [...] mode, which can be played by four players locally or eight online, with several sub-modes that influence how {{the game is played}} and scored. In general, each song is divided into roughly 30-second long sections, and players earn points for their performance over that section based on the specific mode. These points are shown to all players <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are faring against the others. Players are able to create a playlist in Rockfest and assign a different mode to each song. The RockFest submodes include: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Danaids {{call the}} country the [...] "Apian hills" [...] and claim that it understands the karbana audan (accusative case, and in the Dorian dialect), which many {{translate}} as [...] "barbarian speech" [...] but Karba (where the Karbanoi live) {{is in fact a}} non-Greek word. They claim to descend from ancestors in ancient Argos even though they are of a [...] "dark race" [...] (melanthes... genos). Pelasgus admits that the land was once called Apia but compares them to the women of Libya and Egypt and wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> can be from Argos on which they cite descent from Io.|$|E
2500|$|A central {{reason for}} the {{utilization}} of performance appraisals (PAs) is performance improvement ("initially {{at the level of}} the individual employee, and ultimately {{at the level of the}} organization"). [...] Other fundamental reasons include [...] "as a basis for employment decisions (e.g. promotions, terminations, transfers), as criteria in research (e.g. test validation), to aid with communication (e.g. allowing employees <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> are doing and organizational expectations), to establish personal objectives for training" [...] programs, for transmission of objective feedback for personal development, [...] "as a means of documentation to aid in keeping track of decisions and legal requirements" [...] and in wage and salary administration. [...] Additionally, PAs can aid in the formulation of job criteria and selection of individuals [...] "who are best suited to perform the required organizational tasks". [...] A PA can be part of guiding and monitoring employee career development. [...] PAs can also be used to aid in work motivation through the use of reward systems.|$|E

2500|$|His ties to Churchill {{were also}} {{strengthened}} through [...] "The Other Club," [...] an informal dining club for politicians in London that Churchill had founded in 1911 and that Moyne later joined. A rule was that members had to freely express their opinions. Moyne {{was there on}} 29 September 1938 when the bad news came of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's capitulation to Hitler at Munich. Also present were Brendan Bracken, Lloyd George, Bob Boothby, Duff Cooper, J.L. Garvin, editor of The Observer, and Walter Elliot. [...] "Winston ranted and raved, venting his spleen on the two government ministers present and demanding <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> could support a policy that was 'sordid, squalid, sub-human and suicidal.'"
