Blake, seedlings inoculated with nine ectomycorrhizal fungi (seven isolates of Pisolithus spp., Scleroderma cepa and Laccaria laccata collected under eucalypt stands in Australia and the Philippines) were transplanted into pots containing a non-sterile acid (pH 4 · 6) sandy loam amended with four levels of CaCO 3 that raised the soil pH from 4 · 6 to 6 · 6 (5 mM CaCl 2). Pots were placed in temperature-controlled water baths (28 ± 2 °C) inside an evaporatively cooled glasshouse for 9 wk. Increase in soil pH from 4 · 6 to 6 · 6 significantly decreased plant d. wt and shoot nutrient content of uninoculated and inoculated seedlings. Inoculation with four Pisolithus spp. (H 445, H 2144, M 56 and H 4003) significantly increased the growth of E. urophylla seedlings at pH 4 · 6. At pH 6 · 6, eight ectomycorrhizal isolates significantly improved <b>total</b> d. <b>wt</b> compared with those of the uninoculated seedlings.

40|$|Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT 1) {{is highly}} {{expressed}} in acute leukemia and other hematological malignancies. It has been therefore suggested {{as a potential}} universal marker of minimal residual disease (MRD), particularly in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Due to controversial results {{of some of the}} studies, the role of WT 1 in MRD follow- up and WT 1 prognostic significance remain unclear. WT 1 protein is produced in more than 36 different isoforms. These variants have distinct, partially overlapping functions and their ratio is supposed to influence the final effect of WT 1. However, despite the increasing number of studies, the clinical impact of WT 1 and its isoforms in acute leukemia have not yet been elucidated. We established a unique qPCR method to assess the expression pattern of the main 4 WT 1 isoforms. Using this method, we determined the ratio of WT 1 variants in the samples of patients with AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and healthy controls. Our data showed that this pattern can distinguish among particular hematological malignancies, but lacks a prognostic significance. Within our international study group we determined the prognostic significance of <b>total</b> <b>WT</b> 1 expression in childhood AML.

40|$|Studies of the {{hydraulic}} loading {{conditions on the}} heart in humans, especially pulsatile load, have primarily been limited to the supine state. Therefore, we have chosen a nonhuman primate model, the baboon, to assess left ventricular/vascular coupling in both supine and upright positions. Primate subjects were studied by catheterization under sedation and then after surgical implantation of transducers. This allowed the evaluation of postural stress in the chronically instrumented conscious baboon and then after light dissociative doses of ketamine. Basic hemodynamic variables were evaluated for baboons in supine and upright positions. Fourier analysis was applied to aortic pressure and flow to obtain input and characteristic impedance and the ratio of pulsatile (Wp) to <b>total</b> (<b>Wt)</b> left ventricular power (Wp/Wt). The aortic reflected, or backward, pressure was also calculated. Peripheral resistance increased (P = 0. 01) and reflected pressure decreased (17. 74 +/- 1. 50 vs. 15. 21 +/- 2 mmHg; P < 0. 01) in upright subjects. Characteristic impedance and Wp/Wt were unchanged. Postoperatively, peripheral resistance increased (2, 651 +/- 311 vs. 3, 667 +/- 276; P < 0. 05) and mean power and Wt decreased (P < 0. 01) without changes in reflected pressure.

The effect of biofilm on susceptibility to staphylococcal infection of different implant materials in vivo is unclear. The interaction of ica-positive (wild type, [wt]) and ica-negative Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and S. epidermidis strains with titanium, smooth and rough stainless steel surfaces was studied by scanning electron microscopy in vitro and in a subcutaneous mouse tissue cage model during 2 weeks following peri- or post-operative inoculation in vivo. In vitro S. epidermidis wt adhered equally and more strongly than S. aureus wt to all materials. Wt but not ica- strains of both species showed multilayered biofilm. In vivo 300 cfu wt and ica- S. aureus led in all metal cages to an infection with high numbers of planktonic bacteria after 8 days; only 0. 89 % of <b>total</b> <b>wt</b> and ica- S. aureus were adherent. In contrast, for postoperative infection with S. epidermidis 106 cfu of the wt and ica- strain were required; in all metal types planktonic bacterial numbers dropped to < 100 cfu, adherent cfu were low in wt- and absent in ica [...] infected cages after 14 days. Perioperative inoculation resulted in slower clearance than postoperative inoculation and in titanium cages adherent wt bacteria survived in higher numbers than ica- bacteria. In conclusion, the metal played a minor role regarding susceptibility to and persistence of staphylococcal infection; the presence of ica genes had a strong effect on biofilm in vitro and a weak effect in vivo; and S. epidermidis was more pathogenic when introduced during than after implantation...|$|E

40|$|The {{epidemic}} of obesity affects over 2 / 3 {{of the population}} of the United States (National Institute of Health [NIH], 2012). Over the last few years, many initiatives have been developed to address the issue of childhood obesity, while adult obesity is continuing to increase. Initiating change and weight loss with the use of motivational interviewing can be an effective intervention in assisting participants to lose weight, waist circumference and body mass index. These changes enable participants to lead a healthier life. Advanced Practice Registered Nurses can build a stronger rapport with clients through the use of motivational interviewing and help clients lose weight, thereby decreasing the negative effects of obesity. Abstract Obesity is an epidemic in the United States affecting millions of adults with many considered overweight or obese. An evidence-based quality improvement project was conducted in a primary care office with 33 adult participants that were considered obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30. Participants were recruited through clinic flyers and were given a cover letter that outlined the project; if interested, verbal consent was obtained. Two Nurse Practitioners used motivational interviewing (MI) techniques to assess what stage of contemplation about weight (WT) loss the individual was currently in. Waist circumference (WC), WT, and BMI were recorded during an initial visit. Participants were provided with informational pamphlets as resources to take home regarding approaches for healthier eating and physical activities, along with proper goal setting for WT management. Telephone callbacks to discuss progress toward care goals and to record home WT with participants were made at weeks two and four in-between office visits. On the final 6 -week follow up visit, scripted MI techniques were used to assess if the patient’s state of contemplation had changed along with rechecking individual’s WC, WT, and BMI. As a group, the <b>total</b> <b>WT</b> loss was 170. 9 pounds, average WC reduction was 1. 4 inches with a decrease of 0. 89 in BMI.

The primary objective was to find rheological modifiers when blended with this clay slurry that would provide a vane yield stress of 300 Pa when the slurry was undisturbed for 24 hours. A secondary objective {{was to find a}} modifier that after shearing would produce a Bingham Plastic yield stress of 30 Pa and plastic viscosity of 30 mPa-sec. Two parallel paths were chosen with one examining a variety of organic/inorganic modifiers and another using just the inorganic modifier Laponite (R). The addition of organic modifiers hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and hydroxypropylcellulose at a target 0. 50 wt percent dramatically increased the vane yield stress over the range 311 - 724 Pa, and also increased the Bingham plastic yield stress and plastic viscosities over the range 33 - 112 Pa and 27 - 166 mPa-sec, respectively. The organic modifiers also showed elastic behavior, yielding a very unpredictable up flow curve. The 0. 50 wt percent addition of inorganic modifiers magnesium aluminum silicate and hydrate magnesium aluminum silicate only increased the vane yield stress to 36 - 46 Pa and had little impact on the Bingham Plastic parameters. A range of an inorganic (2 - 4 wt percent magnesium aluminum silicate) and combination of a range of an inorganic (2 - 3 wt percent magnesium aluminum silicate) and organic (0. 03 - 0. 05 wt percent sodium carboxymethylcellulose) modifiers were then tested. These results showed that the target vane yield stress could be obtained but the Bingham Plastic yield stress and plastic viscosity were 3 times too high. Reducing the organic modifier weight percent by a few hundredths, the Bingham Plastic yield stress could be obtained, but then the vane yield stress would be too low. The addition of Laponite (R) (synthetic lithium aluminum silicate) increased the vane yield stress of the clay slurry to values as high as 1500 Pa. However, the flow curve behavior for the laponite samples was not predictable and the secondary objective was dropped based on customer needs and time constraints. Ultimately a 3 -wt percent addition of Laponite (R) was chosen to produce a 600 Pa vane yield stress mixture...|$|E

A matéria seca alocada para o colmo + bainha e às panículas também foi maior em BRS Pelota. Porém, a porcentagem de Wt destinada às panículas aos 125 DAE foi semelhante entre as cultivares. Em BRS Firmeza, o aumento em Wt nas raízes pode ter influenciado o direcionamento de fotoassimilados para os grãos e contribuído para o atraso na senescência das plantas. A produtividade de BRS Pelota foi maior que a de BRS Firmeza (17, 4 contra 11, 8 g por vaso) e seu número de panículas por planta por vaso foi três vezes superior em relação à cultivar BRS Firmeza. O componente de produção de maior expressão no rendimento foi o número de panículas. A maior produtividade da cultivar BRS Pelota pode estar relacionada à maior área foliar e sua duração, o que permite o fornecimento de elevada quantidade de fotoassimilados por um período maior. The growth, assimilate partitioning {{and grain}} yield in BRS Pelota (high yield) and BRS Firmeza (low yield) rice cultivars were evaluated.

BRS Pelota rice cultivar exhibited higher accumulation of total dry matter (Wt), mainly {{at the end of}} life cicle, as well as higher leaf area (Af). The dry matter allocated toward culm + sheath and panicles was higher in BRS Pelota. However, the Wt percentage accumulated in panicles at 125 DAE was the same between cultivars.

Grain yield was higher in BRS Pelota than in BRS Firmeza (17. 4 versus 11. 8 g vaso), and also panicle number was three times greater in relation to BRS Firmeza. The yield component which exhibited higher relevance for productivity was the panicle number.

A distância média do último anel até a borda do esporão sugere que o período de menor crescimento ocorreu entre julho e setembro (seca). A equação de von Bertalaffy que descreve o crescimento do pintado é: Lt = 183 * [1 - exp - 0, 085 * (t + 3, 274) ]. A mortalidade total obtida foi Z = 0, 24 ano- 1 e a mortalidade natural M = 0, 20 ano- 1. Com o presente nível de explotação, F = Z - M = 0, 04 ano- 1, conclui-se que o estoque do pintado ainda não estava sobrexplotado na bacia do rio Cuiabá, Pantanal Matogrossense, na época em que foi realizado o estudo. The age {{and growth}} of the pintado Pseudoplatystoma corruscans were studied {{during the period from}} May 1994 to May 1995. The {{standard}} length ranged from 52 to 145 cm and the weight from 1. 3 to 41 kg. The biometric relationship between the standard length (Ls) and total length (Ltotal) and between the total weight (Wt) and the standard length (Ls) were obtained for the species, being respectively: Ltotal = 3. 296 + 1. 069 * Ls and Wt = 0. 00624 * Ls 3. 134. The condition factor calculated monthly suggests the spawning season to be between the months of February and March. The age was estimated by counting growth rings present in the spines of the pectoral fins, and 10 age classes were detected. The mean distance of the last ring until the border of the spine suggests that the period of least growth is between July and September (dry period). Von Bertalaffy's equation describing the growth of the pintado is: Lt = 183 * [1 - exp - 0. 085 * (t + 3. 274) ]. Total mortality was Z = 0. 24 year- 1 and natural mortality M = 0. 20 year- 1. As the present level of exploitation, F = Z - M = 0. 04 year- 1, we conclude that the pintado stock was still underexploited in the Pantanal in the sampled period...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the scaling {{effects of a}} number of gate_fingers (N) and gate_widths (w) on the high-frequency charac-teristics of 0. 1 -μm metamorphic high-electron-mobility transistors. Functional relationships of the extracted small-sig-nal parameters with <b>total</b> gate widths (<b>wt)</b> of different N were proposed. The cut-off frequency (fT) showed an almost independent relationship with wt; however, the maximum frequency of oscillation (fmax) exhibited a strong functional relationship of gate-resistance (Rg) influenced by both N and wt. A greater wt produced a higher fmax; but, to maximize fmax at a given wt, to increase N was more efficient than to increase the single gate_width...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{an excerpt}} of PhD {{dissertation}} by F. Goembira in Kyoto University who is presently affiliated to the Department of Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Andalas University, Indonesia. Supercritical methyl acetate has been proven to convert triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and triacetin. Due to the low reactivity of supercritical methyl acetate on triglycerides, reaction condition of 350 °C/ 20 MPa/ 45 min is needed to obtain the highest yield of 96. 7 wt. % FAME and 8. 8 <b>wt.</b> % triacetin (<b>total</b> 105. 5 <b>wt.</b> %). Yet, under such condition, thermal decomposition of products is inevitable, thus, further yield increments are hard to attain. This study was, therefore, done to know the possible use of additives in increasing the reaction rate of the supercritical process. Oleic acid, acetic acid, methanol and water were evaluated as additives. It was discovered that acetic acid and water additions improved the performance of supercritical methyl acetate method. Surprisingly, when both additives were used simultaneously as aqueous acetic acid, the higher yield was obtainable at a lower reaction temperature. The addition of 10 wt. % aqueous acetic acid (25 wt. % concentration) at 300 °C/ 20 MPa/ 45 min yielded 96. 8 wt. % FAME and 12. 9 <b>wt.</b> % triacetin (<b>total</b> 109. 7 <b>wt.</b> %), thus, it is considered as a potential additive in biodiesel production by supercritical methyl acetate method...|$|R
40|$|Nucleic acid {{extracted}} from purified particles of rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) {{was identified as}} double-stranded RNA because it (i) was susceptible to RNase A in 0. 1 x standard saline citrate (SSC) but not in 1 x SSC, (ii) was resistant to nuclease S 1, (iii) showed no hyperchromicity in u. v. absorption after treatment with formaldehyde at 37 °C, (iv) showed a sharp thermal transition in u. v. absorption in 0. 01 × SSC and (v) had a buoyant density of 1. 596 g/ml in Cs 2 SO 4. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide slab gel revealed that RGDV RNA was composed of 12 segments with a <b>total</b> mol. <b>wt.</b> of about 16. 9 x 106. Co-electrophoresis of RNA from RGDV and rice dwarf virus demonstrated that the electrophoretic mobilities of the seven larger segments from the two viruses were similar but that the five smaller segments differed in this respect.

40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} {{the growth and}} partitioning of assimilate in tomato plants cv. Micro-Tom subjected to nitrogen and pyraclostrobin. This substance favors the development of chloroplasts and the synthesis of chlorophyll. Tomato plants were submitted to the treatments: T 1, complete nutrient solution without pyraclostrobin, T 2, complete nutrient solution + pyraclostrobin, T 3, ½ strength nutrient solution without N pyraclostrobin and T 4, ½ strength nutrient solution N + pyraclostrobin. Plants were collected at regular intervals of seven days after transplantation throughout the crop cycle, with dry mass and leaf area being determined. From the primary data, growth analysis was carried out to calculate total dry matter (Wt), the instantaneous rates of dry matter production (Ct), relative growth (Rw) e net assimilation (Ea), leaf area (Af), production rates (Ca) and relative growth of leaf area index (Ra) and leaf weight (Fw) specific leaf area (Sa) the dry matter partitioning between organs and number (Nfr) and fresh fruit weight (Wfr). Plants of T 1 showed higher Wt, Ct and Wfr compared {{to those of other}} treatments. However, the T 2 plants exhibited similar Nfr to T 1 plants, being superior to others. Also allocated on the total dry matter {{and at the end of}} the cycle, a higher percentage of dry matter in the seafood compared to T 3 and T 4 plants. Also they allocated relative to the total dry matter and at the end of the cycle, a higher percentage in fruits of plants to T 3 and T 4. The association between nitrogen and pyraclostrobin changes the growth and assimilated partition on tomato plants cv. Micro – Tom, and those submitted to ½ dose of nitrogen have a higher total dry matter and less final percentage of total dry matter in fruits, comparatively to those submitted to the association ½ dose of nitrogen and pyraclostrobin. Este trabalho objetivou analisar comparativamente o crescimento e a partição de assimilados em plantas de tomateiro cv. Micro-Tom submetidas ao nitrogênio e piraclostrobina. Esta substância favorece o desenvolvimento de cloroplastos e a síntese de clorofila. Plantas de tomateiro foram submetidas aos tratamentos: T 1, solução nutritiva completa sem piraclostrobina; T 2, solução nutritiva completa + piraclostrobina; T 3, solução nutritiva ½ força de N sem piraclostrobina e T 4, solução nutritiva ½ força de N + piraclostrobina. As plantas foram coletadas a intervalos regulares de sete dias após o transplante ao longo do ciclo de cultivo, sendo determinados a massa seca e a área foliar. A partir dos dados primários, foi aplicada a análise de crescimento, sendo calculados a massa seca <b>total</b> (<b>Wt),</b> as taxas instantâneas de produção de matéria seca (Ct), crescimento relativo (Rw) e assimilatória líquida (Ea), a área foliar (Af), as taxas de produção (Ca) e de crescimento relativo de área foliar (Ra), as razões de área foliar (Fa) e de massa foliar (Fw), a área foliar específica (Sa), a partição de matéria seca entre órgãos e o número (Nfr) e massa fresca de frutos (Wfr). Plantas de T 1 apresentaram maior Wt, Ct e Wfr em relação àquelas dos demais tratamentos. Entretanto, plantas de T 2 apresentaram similar Nfr à plantas de T 1, sendo superiores às demais. Além disso, alocaram em relação à matéria seca total e ao final do ciclo, maior porcentagem de matéria seca nos frutos comparativamente a plantas de T 3 e T 4. A associação entre nitrogênio e piraclostrobina altera o crescimento e a partição de assimilados em plantas de tomateiro cv.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe fluid {{load support}} {{fraction}} (WF/WT) {{can be used}} to define the mechanical contribution of the interstitial fluid (WF) to the <b>total</b> force (<b>WT)</b> in the deformation of cartilage. Traditionally, WF/WT is calculated using complex experimental setups or time-consuming micromechanical poroelastic Finite Element (FE) simulations. AimTo define and validate a fast and efficient technique to predict WF/WT using an analytical approach that can be applied without micromechanical detail or experimental measurement. MethodologyPoroelastic FE simulations defined accurate values of WF/WT for a range of loading configurations and were used to validate subsequent predictions. The analytical prediction of WF/WT used elastic contact mechanics to calculate WF, and viscoelastic FE representation to calculate WT. Subsequently, these independent calculations of WF and WT provided values of WF/WT that were compared with the poroelastic FE calculations. Results and discussionThe analytical prediction of WF/WT proved effective and suitably accurate (mean difference S< 0. 05). This technique demonstrated how WF and WT can be determined independently, without a biphasic constitutive model. Here we used viscoelasticity to calculate WT as an example, however, WT could be measured experimentally or predicted computationally...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this task is to {{characterize}} the physical properties of kaolin/sand slurry {{used to test the}} performance of a new submersible mixer pump which is undergoing performance testing at the TNT Waste Tank mockup facility. Three different sample locations, the SMP cooling water exit, the SMP fluid flow field, and SMP effective cleaning radius were used for sampling over the seven day test. The physical properties determinations for the kaolin/sand slurry samples include rheology, weight percent <b>total</b> solids (<b>wt</b> TS), density, and particle size distribution were requested, though not all these determinations were performed on all the samples. The physical properties determinations are described in more detail in section 1. 0. Measurements were performed at Savannah River National Laboratory in accordance with the Technical Assistance Request (TAR) 1. The data, average of two measurements, is shown in the table below. This data clearly shows that the SMP-CWE samples contained more so lids than those at other sample locations for a given sample day. The SMP-FFF and SMP-ECR were similar in solids content. The rheology of the samples is dependent on the wt solids concentration and are all within the bounds stated in the TAR...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} how {{study design}} influences {{the probability of}} selecting a ‘true’ covariate from two competing covariate models. The probability of selecting the ‘True Model’ (lean body weight on clearance) over the ‘False Model’ (<b>total</b> body weight (<b>WT)</b> on clearance) was compared for designs where WT was either lognormally distributed (i. e. non-stratified), or stratified into 3 equal strata. The probability of selecting the ‘True Model’ increased as the WT inclusion criterion widened, and was always greater under the stratified design. Incorporating stratification into study designs, in combination with a wide covariate range, can aid identification of true parameter–covariate relationships. This has particular importance if the model is to be extrapolated beyond the studied population (e. g. dosing in obesity) ...|$|R
