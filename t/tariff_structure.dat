5|$|The Palmyrene council {{consisted}} {{of about six}} hundred {{members of the local}} elite (such as the elders or heads of wealthy families or clans), representing the city's four-quarters. The council, headed by a president, managed civic responsibilities; it supervised public works (including the construction of public buildings), approved expenditures, collected taxes, and appointed two archons (lords) each year. Palmyra's military was led by strategoi (generals) appointed by the council. Roman provincial authority set and approved Palmyra's <b>tariff</b> <b>structure,</b> but the provincial interference in local government was kept minimal as the empire sought to ensure the continuous success of Palmyrene trade most beneficial to Rome. An imposition of direct provincial administration would have jeopardized Palmyra's ability to conduct its trading activities in the East, especially in Parthia.|$|E
5|$|When Randall {{returned}} to Washington in 1881 {{to begin his}} term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the <b>tariff</b> <b>structure</b> and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had {{returned to}} his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support the it. The bill {{that emerged from the}} Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and his constituents at home, who wanted less.|$|E
5|$|With high revenue {{held over}} from wartime taxes, the federal {{government}} had collected more than it spent since 1866; by 1882 the surplus reached $145 million. Opinions varied on how to balance the budget; the Democrats wished to lower tariffs, in order to reduce revenues and the cost of imported goods, while Republicans believed that high tariffs ensured high wages in manufacturing and mining. They preferred the government spend more on internal improvements and reduce excise taxes. Arthur agreed with his party, and in 1882 called for the abolition of excise taxes on everything except liquor, as well as a simplification of the complex <b>tariff</b> <b>structure.</b> In May of that year, Representative William D. Kelley of Pennsylvania introduced a bill to establish a tariff commission; the bill passed and Arthur signed it into law but appointed mostly protectionists to the committee. Republicans were pleased with the committee's make-up but were surprised when, in December 1882, they submitted a report to Congress calling for tariff cuts averaging between 20 and 25%. The commission's recommendations were ignored, however, as the House Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided a 10% reduction. After conference with the Senate, the bill that emerged only reduced tariffs by an average of 1.47%. The bill passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law, with no effect on the surplus.|$|E

Contributing to the state of the art, the grid cost recovery problem is modelled as a non-cooperative game between consumers. In this game, the availability and costs of new technologies (such as PV and batteries) strategically interact with <b>tariff</b> <b>structures.</b> Four states of the world for user’s access to new technologies are distinguished and three <b>tariff</b> <b>structures</b> are evaluated.

50|$|Low water {{tariffs and}} {{inappropriate}} <b>tariff</b> <b>structures</b> do not encourage water conservation. For example, decreasing-block rates, {{under which the}} unit rate decreases with consumption, offer hardly any incentive for water conservation. In 2000 about 51% of water tariffs in the U.S.were uniform (i.e. the unit tariff is independent {{of the level of}} consumption), 12% were increasing-block tariffs (the unit rate increases with consumption) and 19% were decreasing-block tariffs. The use of decreasing-block tariffs declined sharply from 45% of all <b>tariff</b> <b>structures</b> in 1992. Sewer rates are often flat rates that are not linked to consumption, thus offering no incentive to conserve water.|$|R
25|$|Retail water tariffs. The same retail <b>tariff</b> <b>structure</b> {{applies to}} the entire country. Water and sewer tariffs in Morocco follow an increasing-block <b>tariff</b> <b>structure,</b> under which the tariff per cubic meter rises as {{consumption}} increases. The residential tariff has four blocks, the lowest applying to consumption of less than 6 m³ per month and the highest to consumption above 40 m³ per month. However, the level of retail tariffs varies from one locality to another. Standpipe services, which are common for the urban poor, are typically free. Utilities send bills to local governments. In a few cases, standpipe management has been entrusted to a gardien/gérant, who operates the faucet and charges users. According to a World Bank report, free standpipe services are pro-poor. But they are also increasingly unsustainable for operators, {{both in terms of}} wasted water (up to 40 percent) and in terms of lack of revenues. Operators are in favor of promoting individual connections in order to strengthen their revenue base.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} cross-subsidies in the <b>tariff</b> <b>structure.</b> Medium voltage {{consumers}} pay higher tariffs that serve to subsidize lower tariffs for low voltage consumers.

The lowest-consumption users (0-50kWh/month) benefit from reductions between 45% and 63% in their average tariff. Consumers above the 50kWh limit also benefit from the subsidy scheme to a smaller extent.|$|E

So reform of protection systems in both groups of countries is important to the success of industrialisation in LDCs. The terms of trade implications are noted as a possible explanation of the UNCTAD emphasis on trade preferences in MDC markets rather than on LDC tariff-reform. However, it is noted that LDC tariff reform would tend to remove a bias against trade among LDCs and that this mitigates the terms of trade argument.

40|$|Distributed {{generation}} (DG) {{may play}} a key role in a modern energy system because it can improve energy efficiency. Reductions in the energy bill, and therefore DG attractiveness, depend on the electricity tariff structure; a system created before widespread adoption of distributed generation. Tariffs have been designed to recover costs equitably amongst customers with similar consumption patterns. Recently, electric utilities began to question the equity of this electricity pricing structure for standby service. In particular, the utilities do not feel that DG customers are paying their fair share of transmission and distribution costs - traditionally recovered through a volumetric ($/kWh) mechanism - under existing <b>tariff</b> <b>structures.</b> In response, new <b>tariff</b> <b>structures</b> with higher fixed costs for DG have been implemented in New York and in California. This work analyzes the effects of different electricity <b>tariff</b> <b>structures</b> on DG adoption. First, the effects of the new standby tariffs in New York are analyzed in different regions. Next generalized tariffs are constructed, and the sensitivity to varying levels of the volumetric and the demand ($/kW, i. e. maximum rate) charge component are analyzed on New York s standard and standby tariff as well as California's standby tariff. As expected, DG profitability is reduced with standby tariffs, but often marginally. The new standby structures tend to promote smaller base load systems. The amount of time-of-day variability of volumetric pricing seems to have little effect on DG economics...|$|R

Although the current <b>tariff</b> <b>structure</b> does recover operation and maintenance costs, the tariffs are not high enough to finance system expansion, leaving system improvement and extension investments to the national government and international donors. According to UN-Water, full cost recovery tariffs including investments would require a significant rise of tariffs. William T.
