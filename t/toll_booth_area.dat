50|$|In the 1970s, after SR 524 and SR 104 {{already had}} their routing through Edmonds in place, the Washington State Ferries moved the <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> and holding <b>area</b> for the Edmonds ferry {{terminal}} off the pier and along SR 104. This made the ferry terminal inaccessible from westbound SR 524. Thus, a spur route was signed south along Third Avenue and Pine Street {{to connect with}} SR 104 and the ferry terminal.|$|R
50|$|There are 3 <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> {{along the}} highway, and each <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> charges regular {{automobiles}} 31 pesos to pass. The northernmost <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> {{is located at}} km 5, within the city of Tijuana. The second <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> is located in Rosarito Beach, and {{the third and final}} <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> is located just a few kilometers north of Ensenada.|$|R

The <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> were completely demolished in August 2017.|$|R

The money is {{automatically}} paid from the user’s bank {{as soon as the}} vehicle approaches the toll. For this the user bank PC is been connected with <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> server via local area network(LAN). The main concept of the project is to enable the <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> user to pay his prepaid either from the users bank or the <b>toll</b> <b>booth...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) algorithm using image processing in <b>toll</b> <b>booths.</b> On any <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> the vehicle has to stop for paying the toll. We are {{trying to develop a}} system that would pay the toll automatically and reduce the queue at the <b>toll</b> <b>booths.</b> In this system camera is used for capturing the image of the vehicle number plate. The captured image would be converted into text using ANPR algorithm. <b>Toll</b> <b>booth</b> passes the vehicle plate number to the central server which holds the information about registered users. Server then uses this vehicle number to verify whether the user is registered account holder or not. If the user is registered account holder then server transmits the information about vehicle type, account balance to the <b>toll</b> <b>booth.</b> Based on the vehicle type, toll is deducted from the customer’s account and then the toll gate is opened. Central server is updated with user’s account balance using internet protocols by the <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> the vehicle passes through. The user is updated about his account status via SMS...|$|R
50|$|Highway 43D {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with Mexican Federal Highway 15D and Highway 43 at Cuitzeo, north of Morelia. The toll road immediately crosses Lake Cuitzeo, {{and on the}} north side is an exit to the town of Cuitzeo and the first <b>toll</b> <b>booth.</b> Before entering the road crosses over Highway 43, partially crossing over the lake again, before continuing past a second <b>toll</b> <b>booth,</b> known as La Cinta, and toward its next interchange and <b>toll</b> <b>booth,</b> offering access to Uriangato via Highway 43. Highway 43D turns northwest after this interchange, skirting Lake Yuriria, before adjusting north. The next interchange and <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> serve the community of Valle de Santiago.|$|R
2500|$|The {{indirect}} interchange between SH 360 and Interstate 30 is a holdover {{from when}} that freeway was tolled. In order to direct traffic through <b>toll</b> <b>booths,</b> the interchange was {{designed so that}} any traffic moving from one freeway to the other was routed through one common, bi-directional ramp. [...] This was a cost-saving measure as it required fewer <b>toll</b> <b>booths.</b> [...] The <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> were removed in 1977, but the complex access road system remained.|$|R
50|$|This {{section of}} {{expressway}} is toll-free. Just {{south of the}} Gaoling interchange, all motorists must stop at a <b>toll</b> <b>booth.</b> Immediately after the <b>toll</b> <b>booth,</b> the Nahong exit provides access {{to and from the}} city centre of Nanning from the south.|$|R
50|$|More {{than twenty}} <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> were built, closing off all {{approaches}} to the city. It was impossible for anybody driving a car to get in for free weekdays between 6am and 6pm. The charge was NOK 15 for cars and 30 for trucks. The systems {{has been designed to}} be user friendly through AutoPASS technology developed by the local company Q-Free, involving a radio-transmitted registration of passing cars, allowing cars to pass the <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> at 60 km/h (but at most <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> the speed limit was 50 km/h). All the driver need to do is fit a little plastic device to the windscreen of the car. This communicates with the <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> when the car passes through, deducting money from the user's account. Those who (intentionally or by negligence) passes a <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> without an operating toll device (or paying manually where possible) are subject to a fine. Motorists using a toll device are eligible to a toll discount.|$|R
50|$|Consider a {{road between}} two towns where {{half of the}} road is owned by two agents. A {{customer}} must pass two <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> in order to pass from one town to the other. Each agent sets the price of his <b>toll</b> <b>booth.</b>|$|R
50|$|In October 2015, the {{expressway}} {{experienced a}} serious traffic jam {{at the end}} of the Golden Week holiday caused in the main part by the introduction of a new <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> near Beijing. The <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> forced cars exiting from 50 lanes into just 20.|$|R
5000|$|US 127 has {{a second}} B4 {{interchange}} at the Bluegrass Parkway near Lawrenceburg, about 15 miles (24 km) {{south of the}} I-64 crossing. This particular interchange is a conversion from a four-loop design {{at the location of}} one of the <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> on the Bluegrass Parkway before its conversion into a freeway. <b>Toll</b> <b>booths</b> were located directly below US 127; through traffic used the through lanes, while both entering and exiting traffic shared a lane directly {{to the right of the}} through lanes. The old design was standard for interchanges at <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> in Kentucky's parkway system of controlled-access toll roads; even though tolls have been removed from all of the roads, many of the old designs still exist at former <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> sites.|$|R
2500|$|Trumpet {{interchange}} [...] It {{is usually}} found in every closed toll system expressway like the North–South Expressway and East Coast Expressway. The trumpet design is popular as a highway exit with <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> for the closed toll system {{because of the}} minimum construction cost of its <b>toll</b> <b>booths.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{citizens}} {{revolt against}} toll plazas, {{as was the}} case in Jacksonville, Florida. Tolls were in place on four bridges crossing the St. Johns River, including I-95. These tolls paid for the respective bridges as well as many other highway projects. As Jacksonville continued to grow, the tolls created bottlenecks on the roadway. In 1988, Jacksonville voters chose to eliminate all the <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> and replace the revenue with a ½ cent sales tax increase. In 1989, the <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> were removed, 36 years after the first <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> went up.|$|R

The draft-free design includes a "diffusor", which blows clean air out the <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> doorway, thus retarding the infiltration of contaminated air. The net effect is a decrease in the toll collector's inhalation of exhaust fumes. The Washington Department of Highways installed the prototype system in a <b>toll</b> <b>booth</b> at the Evergreen Point Bridge near Seattle.

50|$|In 2014 the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development has {{uncovered}} the plans to imply the Electronical Toll Collection System. The new plans were made {{because of the}} big problems concerning the Manual Toll Collection System. At the time {{while there is a}} huge flow of traffic(especially in the holiday period), there are long queues to the <b>toll</b> <b>booths,</b> which, according to some reports, reached up to 10 km. Drivers in these cases are forced to wait 2 hours to pay the toll at the <b>toll</b> <b>booths.</b> That was the reason the works to construct the <b>toll</b> <b>booths</b> on A4 were suspended, even though there were some stages of construction in progress.|$|R
