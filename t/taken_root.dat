25|$|Some Irish legends {{involve the}} Oilliphéist, the Caoránach, and the Copóg Phádraig. During his evangelising journey back to Ireland from his parent's home at (perhaps) Birdoswald, he is {{understood}} to have carried with him an ash wood walking stick or staff.

25|$|In parallel, the {{development}} of Darwinian evolution, and the discoveries of Archaeopteryx and Compsognathus, led Thomas Henry Huxley to propose that dinosaurs were closely related to birds.

Beginning in the 1960s and with the advent of the Dinosaur Renaissance, views of dinosaurs and their physiology have changed dramatically, including the discovery of feathered dinosaurs in Early Cretaceous age deposits in China, indicating that birds evolved from highly agile maniraptoran dinosaurs.|$|E

25|$|In Svithjod {{it was the}} old custom, as long as heathenism prevailed, {{that the}} chief {{sacrifice}} took place in Goe month at Upsala.

All the Things of the Swedes, also, were held there, and markets, and meetings for buying, which continued for a week: and after Christianity was introduced into Svithjod, the Things and fairs were held there as before. After Christianity had <b>taken</b> <b>root</b> in Svithjod, and the kings would no longer dwell in Upsala, the market-time was moved to Candlemas, and it has since continued so, and it lasts only three days.|$|E
25|$|Tocqueville's {{penetrating}} analysis {{sought to}} understand the peculiar nature of US political life. In describing the US, he agreed with thinkers such as Aristotle and Montesquieu that the balance of property determined the balance of political power, but his conclusions after that differed radically from those of his predecessors. Tocqueville tried {{to understand why the}} US was so different from Europe in the last throes of aristocracy. The US, in contrast to the aristocratic ethic, was a society where hard work and money-making was the dominant ethic, where the common man enjoyed a level of dignity which was unprecedented, where commoners never deferred to elites, and where what he described as crass individualism and market capitalism had <b>taken</b> <b>root</b> to an extraordinary degree.|$|E
25|$|The Niño Dios (literally Child God) of Mexico is a {{tradition}} of venerating the Child Jesus in Mexico which has <b>taken</b> <b>root</b> from {{the time it was}} introduced in the 16th century and then syncretized with pre-Hispanic elements to form some unique traditions. Mexican Catholics have their own images of the Child Jesus, which is honored and celebrated during the Christmas season, especially on Christmas Eve and on Candlemas (2 February). One tradition unique to Mexico is to dress the image in new clothing each year for presentation at Mass on Candlemas. This dress can vary from representations of the saints, Aztec dress, football/soccer players and more. Also, there are Niño Dios images which are locally famous and honored year-round.|$|E

25|$|LaHarpe, in {{addition}} to supporting the independence of subject states in Switzerland, also played a large part in shaping the French Revolutionary period. Republican government, having only recently <b>taken</b> <b>root</b> in France, was a very new part of the European political sphere, {{and the creation of}} the Helvetic Republic marked a continued spread of republican ideas in practice. While short lived, the work of LaHarpe contrasted the situations in the German states, and of the Austrian Hapsburg regime at the time. While this republic was met with poor response by the Swiss people, the ideas and structure of its government contributed to the shaping of the political conditions and respective governments of the nation-states of the 1800s, especially Germany and Italy.|$|E
25|$|Jewish {{immigrants}} from Arab and Muslim countries left for numerous reasons. The war's outcome had exacerbated Arab hostilities to local Jewish communities. News of the victory aroused messianic expectations in Libya and Yemen; Zionism had <b>taken</b> <b>root</b> in many countries; active incentives for making aliyah formed {{a key part}} of Israeli policy; and better economic prospects and security were to be expected from a Jewish state. Some Arab governments, Egypt, for example, held their Jewish communities hostage at times. Persecution, political instability, and news of a number of violent pogroms also played a role. Some 800,000–1,000,000 Jews eventually left the Arab world over the next three decades {{as a result of these}} various factors. Approximately 680,000 of them immigrated to Israel; the rest mostly settled in Europe (mainly France) or the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Human {{rights in}} Somalia {{throughout}} the late 20th-century and early 21st-century were considered dire, but have gradually improved {{over the following}} years. Human rights are guaranteed in the Federal Constitution, which was adopted in August 2012. They fall under the Ministry of Human Rights established in August 2013. The central authorities concurrently inaugurated a National Human Rights Day, endorsed an official Human Rights Roadmap, and completed Somalia's first National Gender Policy. A Human Rights Task Force was also established in February 2013 to firm up on the protection of individual rights. Additionally, {{the federal government in}} December 2014 organized a public awareness campaign, passed a new 54-point national Child Protection Act, and finished legislation on a Human Rights Commission bill.
