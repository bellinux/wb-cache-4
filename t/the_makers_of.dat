5|$|<b>The</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> {{the film}} {{acknowledged}} {{the responsibility of}} portraying the story. One challenge faced was acquiring a real plane for shooting; director Ram Madhvani and Rucha Pathak decided to re-create the plane because {{a major part of}} the film required shooting against the plane back-drop. It took them 48 days to build the plane, which closely resembled the original one.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{high demand}} for tickets, which RTÉ {{described}} as phenomenal. 4,000 applications were received for a capacity of 120 seats (originally 60 for Questions and Answers, which was subsequently doubled).

5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1980s, several studies {{suggested}} a link between children's consumption of aspirin and Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal disease. By 1986, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required warning labels on all aspirin, further suppressing sales. <b>The</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> Tylenol also {{filed a lawsuit against}} Anacin aspirin maker American Home Products, claiming that the failure to add warning labels before 1986 had unfairly held back Tylenol sales, though this suit was eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|By 11,000 BC, <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> {{the long}} blades had gone. Two timber {{platforms}} {{have been identified}} within the peat at Titchwell, and may possibly be rare Bronze Age (2,500–800BCE) survivals. Seahenge is another early Bronze Age site found on the coast at Holme in 1998. It consists of a ring of 55 oak posts and was built in 2049BC; a similar nearby structure, Holme II, may be almost two centuries older. A large Iron Age fort at Holkham enclosed 2.5ha (6.1acres) {{at the end of}} a sandy spit in what was then salt marsh, and remained in use until the defeat of the Iceni in 47AD.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> Dallas Buyers Club {{successfully}} {{obtained a}} court order against two major ISPs Starhub and M1 to reveal customers who have allegedly downloaded illegal copies of the movie.

This is the second reported instance of a major legal action taken by a media company against individuals in Singapore for alleged illegal downloading since Odex.|$|E

5|$|In August 2014, film {{director}} Sathish Paul filed a copyright infringement {{suit against the}} makers, saying that it had similarities to his script titled Oru Mazhakkalathu, written in 2013. The court passed an order saying that the movie had prima facie similarities to Sathish' script, but allowed {{the making of the}} Tamil version Papanasam to proceed, on the condition that <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> Drishyam produce a 10 lakh bank guarantee before the court to ensure the compensation. The case was dismissed in March 2015 as it was proved that Jeethu had written the script in 2011.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears a {{striking}} resemblance to that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic accident in a small town, is sentenced to work at the town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone so far as to say that <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> the sculpture, {{with the aim of}} completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November 2008 this culminated in an out-of-court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project's designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd, Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd. The agreement was to pay the council £1.7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence.|$|E

5|$|Some 5,000,000 half dollars were struck, {{far beyond}} the actual demand, and half of them were melted. The {{appropriation}} did not cure the fair's financial woes, as fewer than 400,000 were sold at the premium price, and some 2,000,000 were released into circulation, where they remained {{as late as the}} 1950s. The pieces can be purchased in circulated condition for less than $20; coins in near-pristine state sell for about $1,000, far less than the $10,000 <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> the Remington Typewriter paid as a publicity stunt in 1892 for the first specimen struck.|$|E
5|$|The makers {{confirmed}} that the film's first trailer would be released on 22 June, coinciding with Vijay's birthday. However, Murugadoss announced that the teaser was to be released on 1 July, ten days later. Upon progression, the teaser and poster launch event was delayed, following an injunction order from the court, which had directed <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> the film {{not to use the}} Thuppakki title in any form. With the court case ending on 5 October, the first teaser was released in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand—especially with phenol supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any company could use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive right to the aspirin name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control—though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters—but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle, and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E

5|$|IndiaGlitz called Manam, {{along with}} 1:Nenokkadine and Drushyam, the best {{experimental}} films in recent times. Manam, along with Minugurulu (2014), was nominated by the Telugu Film Producers Council to the Film Federation of India {{to be included}} {{on the list of}} 30 Indian films for the 87th Academy Awards, in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. In late September 2014, the United States postal department released a stamp in honour of Nageswara Rao, making him the first Indian actor in whose name a postal stamp had been released. That stamp featured a still of Nageswara Rao from the film. The film was screened at the 45th International Film Festival of India on 29 November 2014, as a Homage to Nageswara Rao. In February 2015, <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> Bandipotu (2015) released a poster featuring Sampoornesh Babu, Allari Naresh and Saptagiri, whose theme resembled the first look of Manam.|$|E
5|$|Paradoxically, {{since the}} first decade of the 21st century, New World Order conspiracism is {{increasingly}} being embraced and propagandized by New Age occultists, who are people bored by rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge—such as alternative medicine, astrology, quantum mysticism, spiritualism, and theosophy. Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as <b>the</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> documentary films like Esoteric Agenda, claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New World Order are simply misusing occultism for Machiavellian ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New World Order for the purpose of taking advantage of the growing 2012 phenomenon, which has its origins in the fringe Mayanist theories of New Age writers José Argüelles, Terence McKenna, and Daniel Pinchbeck.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most Bollywood films which {{indulge in}} months of {{promotion}} before the release, Aashiqui 2 {{had less than}} three weeks for promotion before its release. A music concert where singers (who sang songs in the soundtrack album) performed to their respective songs was organised to promote the film. <b>The</b> <b>makers</b> <b>of</b> the film launched the Aashiqui 2 jackets, as seen in the film's poster. Statues resembling the signature image of the couple hiding under the jacket were placed inside various theatres. Due to the romantic theme of the film, it was originally planned for a Valentine's day release on 14 February 2013, but this was postponed because of production delays. The film's new release date was 10 May 2013, but it was released a fortnight early on 26 April 2013 in over 2800 screens across India. The film was not released in key markets such as UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
