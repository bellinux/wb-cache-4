5|$|Although {{there were}} only a handful of {{consistent}} superstring theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation. However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways.|$|E

5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} companies do send scientists {{all over the}} world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E

5|$|The {{defining}} {{mission of}} the Marine Corps has been to perform an amphibious landing, and they were {{particularly interested in the}} JVX program. <b>They</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> a concentrated strike force was vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon, airborne solutions with good speed and range allowed for significant dispersal; and their CH-46s were wearing out; without replacement, the threat of a merger between the Marine Corps and the Army lingered, similar to President Truman's proposal following World War II. The OSD and Navy administration were against the tiltrotor project, but congressional pressure eventually proved persuasive.|$|E
5|$|The {{same day}} as the MPC publication, Brown's group {{announced}} the discovery of another Kuiper belt object, , more distant and brighter (and apparently larger) than Pluto, as the tenth planet. The announcement was made earlier than planned to forestall the possibility of similar events with that discovery, when the MPC told them that their observational data was publicly accessible, and <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> not only Haumea data {{but by that time}} their Eris data had been publicly accessed. The same day Ortiz announced the discovery of Haumea, Brown submitted his own draft with the data on the first of its moons that he had discovered on January 26, 2005, to The Astrophysical Journal.|$|E
5|$|When the Negev forces {{reached the}} coastal road, <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{they could not}} {{continue}} on their vehicles, which could not travel in the sand dunes {{to the west of}} the road. The vehicles were therefore left with a platoon to the south of Isdud to block a possible Egyptian retreat. The other soldiers continued on foot into the sand dunes in an attempt to flank the Egyptian positions. On the second try, the Negev forces successfully captured several key points in the village, and destroyed a cannon. Nahum Sarig, the Negev Brigade commander, later wrote that the lack of intelligence on the enemy prevented the Israeli force from continuing its assault, while the Egyptians had time to regroup.|$|E

5|$|On , the Mongol leader Hulagu sent through John the Hungarian a new {{letter to}} King Louis IX of France, again {{offering}} an alliance. The letter explained that previously, the Mongols {{had been under}} the impression that the pope was the leader of the Christians, but now <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the true power rested with the French monarchy. The letter mentioned Hulagu's intention to capture Jerusalem {{for the benefit of the}} pope, and asked for Louis to send a fleet against Egypt. Hulagu promised the restoration of Jerusalem to the Christians, but also still insisted on Mongol sovereignty, in the Mongols' quest for conquering the world. It is unclear whether or not King Louis actually received the letter, but at some point it was transmitted to Pope Urban, who answered in a similar way as his predecessors. In his papal bull Exultavit cor nostrum, Urban congratulated Hulagu on his expression of goodwill towards the Christian faith, and encouraged him to convert to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|The Blitz game mode was {{the result}} of experimenting with ideas for a fast-paced and {{accessible}} variation of RTS gameplay. The development team wanted to streamline mechanics, such as base building and resource management, that players typically viewed as being complex and intimidating. The initial design of Blitz involved players having an army roster, like in tabletop war games. After playtesting this version, <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the scale of battles would shrink and become less appealing {{over the course of the}} match. They revised the mode by implementing a card-and-deck system for unit deployment and introducing randomly spawning resources on the maps. Blitz was influenced by the Warzone game mode from Halo 5: Guardians and Blizzard Entertainment's collectible card game Hearthstone, taking design cues from the card collecting and deck building systems. 343 Industries' head of strategy games Dan Ayoub cited the multiplayer online battle arena genre as impactful on the design of Blitz, since games in the genre replaced resource management with individual unit combat.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} the game's fictional locations, the team tried to represent iconic {{features of the}} American frontier; New Austin features small towns and outposts, Nuevo Paraíso includes rebel outposts and Mexican army forts, and West Elizabeth represents the civilized areas of the world. These three locations represent a developing nation, a province {{on the brink of}} war, and an advanced nation, respectively. The American frontier was extensively researched for the game. The team organized field trips to Washington, visited the Library of Congress, captured a multitude of photographs, and analyzed various classic Western films. A challenge that the team faced {{as a direct result of}} the world's size was to include enough content to interest players. Using this challenge as a strength and a major part of the design process, the team tried to make the countryside wild, with a variety of potential events to occur. They initially believed that it was possible to use the formula of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008)—a large variety of mission styles with different activities and objectives—in Red Dead Redemption; as development continued, <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the emptiness of the world resulted in the inability to use this formula.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, two battalions {{of volunteers}} from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, led by Generals Oswald H. Ernst and James H. Wilson, settled on {{opposite}} sides of the road to Coamo. On August 9, 1898, the Americans began their offensive, opening cannon fire against the city and completing their attack with artillery fire, the 3rd and 4th Regular Pennsylvania Artillery to provide artillery support for the frontal assault on the Baños, damaging the resort. The Americans intended to encircle and defeat the defenses in the city. A group of soldiers entered the city from the backside, having advanced through a river nearby. The rear assault was reinforced by Wilson's army under General Ernst, attempting to trap the allied soldiers in a crossfire, employing a tactic known as the pincer movement. Martínez Illescas was surprised by the attack and led an improvised attack, but he was killed in the crossfire along with his second-in-command, leaving Captain Hita in charge; he ordered his men to surrender. Half of the allied troops ignored the order, and continued the attack, Troop C galloped at top speed north from the Baños de Coamo, after finding the resort abandoned by the Spanish. Hita's men were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp located at Río Descalabrado, while the men who continued to attack retreated to Aibonito when <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the Americans were using a pincer movement.|$|E
25|$|The censors {{at first}} {{automatically}} deleted a reference {{in the script}} to the Hollywood star Gary Cooper, but then reinstated it when <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the comparison was to Noriko’s (unseen) suitor Satake, who is described by the female characters as attractive, and was thus flattering to the American actor.|$|E

25|$|Tearaway Unfolded was {{initially}} {{a project that}} allowed Media Molecule to properly experiment with the DualShock 4 and the PlayStation 4's technology for the first time.

They told a story about escaping from the British who wanted their vessel. The story was believed, and all were sent to an ordinary POW camp. If not, they surely would have been executed. By coincidence they met the crew from the Frøya raft in the camp, and joined them until the war ended.|$|E
25|$|The {{band was}} {{required}} {{to create a new}} name to sign up to Spinefarm Records. The contract with Shiver records had already been signed under the name of Inearthed. The answer to that problem came as the members looked for good names in their local phone book. When they stumbled upon Lake Bodom, <b>they</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> it was a name with impact and one which had an interesting story behind it. A long list of possible names involving the word Bodom was then made, and they settled with Children of Bodom. The band's name is derived from the Lake Bodom murders.|$|E

In the same evening the brothers were called to the nearby moor, which was covered in snow and ice at the time.
