Chemical engineer Herman Frasch was hard at work on a process to remove sulfur from sour crude oil. Solar Refining Co. was founded to utilize the process Frasch developed, which led to Squire's directorship with Solar. Frasch become Standard Oil's first director of research and development in 1888. Frasch next began work on a process to cheaply manufacture soda ash. The petroleum industry consumed large amounts of soda ash, which was used <b>to</b> <b>decalcify</b> drilling fluids. In 1892, Frasch established the Frasch Process Soda Company, with Squire as vice president. Salt was a major component of soda ash production, and in 1882 and 1883 Frash had secured patents on new methods to crystallize and grain salt from a brine solution. Frasch, Frank Rockefeller, and Squire formed the United Salt Company in 1892 as well, but a bad fire in 1894 and financial losses led to the sale of the firm to the National Salt Company in 1899. He became a director of National Salt in 1900.|$|E

One of the possibilities to improve patient's treatment is the application of nano-therapeutic approaches, based on shear stress sensitive nano-containers. In order to tailor the chemical composition and subsequent physical properties of such liposomes, one has to know precisely the morphology of critically stenosed arteries at micrometre resolution.

The X-ray diffraction results agree very well with the data previously obtained on calcified turkey tendon indicating that the method used <b>to</b> <b>decalcify</b> tendons provides good correspondence {{with the process of}} calcification. Up to five thermal processes can be detected in the thermogravimetric scans: (1) water release; (2) collagen decomposition; (3 and 4) combustion of the residual organic components; (5) carbonate removal from the apatitic phase. The temperature of collagen decomposition decreases at lower inorganic phase content in agreement with the higher thermal stability of calcified collagen fibrils compared with uncalcified ones. The decrease of collagen thermal stability upon decalcification is paralleled by a decrease of the structural order of the collagen fibrils as indicated by small angle X-ray diffraction data. Decalcification down to about 40 % wt of inorganic phase does not significantly alter the inorganic blocks that are regularly arranged inside the gap zone of the collagen. Further removal of inorganic phase down to about 15 % wt provokes a variation of the intensity distribution of the small angle meridional reflections that can be ascribed to a reduction of the mean height of the inorganic blocks. At inorganic phase contents below 15 % wt the gap region is more free to contract upon air drying {{as a result of the}} reduction of the mean length of the inorganic blocks...|$|E

Regardless of which {{decalcification}} procedure is used, this introduces a vast breakdown of DNA that precludes the possibility of further molecular genetic testing. We set out to establish a robust protocol that would overcome these intrinsic hurdles for bone tumour research. Findings The goal of our study was to establish a protocol, using a modified DNA isolation procedure and quality controls, <b>to</b> select <b>decalcified</b> samples suitable for array-CGH testing. Archival paraffin blocks were obtained from 9 different pathology departments throughout Europe, using different fixation, embedding and decalcification procedures, in order to preclude a bias for certain lab protocols. Isolated DNA samples were subjected to direct chemical labelling and enzymatic labelling systems and were hybridised on a high resolution oligonucleotide chip containing 44, 000 reporter elements. Genomic alterations (gains and losses) were readily detected in most of the samples analysed. For example, both homozygous deletions of 0. 6 Mb and high level of amplifications of 0. 7 Mb were identified. Conclusions We established a robust protocol for molecular genetic testing of dFFPE derived DNA, irrespective of fixation, decalcification or sample type used.

Control Groups A and B received diets with {{the same amount of}} calories consumed by Test Groups A and B, respectively, with ethanol replaced by isocaloric amounts of carbohydrate. Four weeks prior {{to the end of the}} experimental period, half of the rats in each group were randomly assigned to receive a ligature on mandibular molar, whereas the other half of group was left unligated.

Methods: Twenty-four human molars were used in this study. Subsequent to teeth sectioning in the mesio-distal direction and creation of the smear layer, the teeth were divided into six groups with and without the pre-conditioning step. Dentin surfaces were restored with RMGI cylinders and the specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 ºC for 24 hours. SBS test were performed using a Universal Testing Machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/minute. Statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA followed by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. RMGI/dentin interface was evaluated using SEM operated at 12 Kv at 2000 X magnification. Results: 35 % phosphoric acid and EDTA yielded significantly higher SBS (12. 0 ± 1. 8 and 11. 9 ± 4. 4 MPa, respectively), compared to all tested groups. In addition, 25 % polyacrylic acid (8. 6 ± 3. 1 MPa) reported significantly higher SBS than the nano-filled RMGI when applied according to manufacturer instructions (5. 5 ± 2. 2 MPa). When nano-filled RMGI was applied without its nano-primer, or directly over 25 % polyacrylic acid conditioned dentin exhibited 100 % pre-test failure, and their SBS were expressed as 0. 0 ± 0. 0 MPa.

40|$|Important pedogenic {{processes}} of soils formed on dolomitic limestones {{are affected by}} the degree of in-situ weathering of the underlying bedrock. Decalcification and silicate clay illuviation of Haplustalfs and Calciustolls of the Colorado Plateau in northwestern Arizona results from the establishment of effective porosity in the parent rock. The underlying carbonate strata, the Kaibab Formation, are a complex limestone-dolomite-chert marine sediment of Permian age. Diagenetic processes have modified the initial porosity present at the time the sediment was deposited. Pleistocene meteoric waters, percolating downward, have resulted in the solutioning and partial removal of the calcium carbonate and the establishment of a porous dolomitic framework. Under these conditions, soils forming in residuum are able <b>to</b> <b>decalcify</b> and to form argillic horizons. However, in more resistant limestones, compaction during burial has resulted in a nonporous micrite which retards calcite removal by meteoric waters. Under these conditions, soil profiles maintain a high CaCO₃ content and silicate clay illuviation does not occur. Micaceous clay minerals of residual origin are converted to montmorillonite in the Alfisols. A probable sequence of events for this transformation to occur is: (1) the removal of calcite from the dolomitic limestone bedrock and the formation of a dolomitic framework, (2) the slow dissolution of dolomite and release of Mg⁺⁺ into solution, (3) the incorporation of Mg⁺⁺ into the octahedral layer of the mica and the release of K⁺ from the mica interlayer position, and (4) the illuviation of montmorillonite to form the argillic horizon. Eolian dust is also important to soil genesis on the Colorado Plateau. In particular, quartz in the coarse silt fraction (31 - 44 um) and quartz and biotite in the very fine and fine silt fractions (2. 0 - 16 um). Two alluvial soils of Pleistocene age shows important morphological differences. Thick carbonate accumulations of ground water origin are present in the older soil.

40|$|The {{microgravity}} {{conditions of}} space travel result in unique physiological {{demands on the}} human body. In particular, {{the absence of the}} continual mechanical stresses on the skeletal system that are present on Earth cause the bones <b>to</b> <b>decalcify.</b> Trabecular structure decreases in thickness and increases in spacing, resulting in decreased bone strength and increased risk of injury. Thus, monitoring bone health is a high priority for long-term space travel. A single probe covering all frequency bands of interest would be ideal for such measurements, and this would also minimize storage space and eliminate the complexity of integrating multiple probes. This invention is an ultrasound transducer for the structural characterization of bone. Such characterization measures features of reflected and transmitted ultrasound signals, and correlates these signals with bone structure metrics such as bone mineral density, trabecular spacing, and thickness, etc. The techniques used to determine these various metrics require measurements over a broad range of ultrasound frequencies, and therefore, complete characterization requires the use of several narrowband transducers. This is a single transducer capable of making these measurements in all the required frequency bands. The device achieves this capability through a unique combination of a broadband piezoelectric material; a design incorporating multiple resonator sizes with distinct, overlapping frequency spectra; and a micromachining process for producing the multiple-resonator pattern with common electrode surfaces between the resonators. This device consists of a pattern of resonator bars with common electrodes that is wrapped around a central mandrel such that the radiating faces of the resonators are coplanar and can be simultaneously applied to the sample to be measured. The device operates as both a source and receiver of acoustic energy. It is operated by connection to an electronic system capable of both providing an excitation signal to the transducer and amplifying the signal received from the transducer. The excitation signal may be either a wide-bandwidth signal to excite the transducer across its entire operational spectrum, or a narrow-bandwidth signal optimized for a particular measurement technique. The transducer face is applied to the skin covering the bone to be characterized, and may be operated in through transmission mode using two transducers, or in pulse-echo mode...|$|E

Subsequently, they were divided in four groups, according to the treatment performed: (a) alveolar socket irrigation with copaiba oil; (b) alveolar socket irrigation with physiological serum; (c) daily gavage with copaiba oil or (d) daily gavage with physiological serum. After the sacrifice, the mandibles were removed and processed in order <b>to</b> obtain <b>decalcified</b> histological sections. The results demonstrated high level of epithelial migration, small number of inflammatory cells and vascular enhancement in the animals which received systemic administration of copaiba oil. The rats treated with topic administration of copaiba oil presented ulcerations and large number of inflammatory cells. An increased bone neoformation was observed in both groups treated with copaiba oil when compared with placebo group. It could be concluded that topic or systemic administration of copaiba oil leads to a better alveolar bone healing, however the topic application on connective tissue should be carefully considered, regarding the whole socket wound healing. © Medicina Oral S.

40|$|Despite {{intensive}} research efforts, {{there remains}} a need for novel methods to improve the ossification of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. Based on a common phenomenon and known pathological conditions of peritoneal membrane ossification following peritoneal dialysis, we have explored the possibility of regenerating ossified tissue in the peritoneum. Interestingly, in addition to inflammatory cells, we discovered {{a large number of}} multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the peritoneal lavage fluid from mice with peritoneal catheter implants. The osteogenic potential of these peritoneal progenitor cells was demonstrated by their ability <b>to</b> easily infiltrate <b>decalcified</b> bone implants, produce osteocalcin and form mineralized bone in 8 weeks. Additionally, when poly(l-lactic acid) scaffolds loaded with bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (a known osteogenic differentiation agent) were implanted into the peritoneum, signs of osteogenesis were seen within 8 weeks of implantation. The results of this investigation support the concept that scaffolds containing BMP- 2 can stimulate the formation of bone in the peritoneum via directed autologous stem and progenitor cel...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{mineralization}} was {{studied in}} an experimental model of osteoinduction {{consisting of the}} implant of decalcified bone matrix in the rat muscle. After vascular connective tissue invasion of the matrix, the first phenomena is the appearance of hydroxyapatite crystals {{in the area of}} chondroid metaplasia from where the deposit of calcium-phosphate is extended <b>to</b> the surrounding <b>decalcified</b> matrix. The recalcified areas act as a substratum for the neo-osteogenesis. The appearances observed reproduced those of enchondral ossification, where the first osteoblasts differentiated on the calcified cartilaginous matrix and began to supply new bone matrix. Non-decalcified bone matrix implants were surrounded by a connective tissue capsule with features identical to those of a foreign body reaction and with total absence of vascular invasion. The absence of induction in this type of implant may be related either to masking of the osteoinducing protein in the calcified matrix, or to the absence of cells with osteogenic differentiation potential {{due to the lack of}} cellular invasion of the implant...|$|R
40|$|A central {{question}} in biology is how different cell types {{interact with each}} other and their native environment to form complex functional systems and networks. Although our ability to investigate this question has considerably expanded from the development of genetically encoded tools, some limitations still persist. For instance, we are limited in our ability to visualize the native three dimensional environments of whole organs. Additionally, it is challenging to efficiently deliver transgenes into difficult-to-target areas through direct-injections, such as the cardiac ganglia, or broadly distributed networks, such as the myenteric nervous system, which limits our ability to extensively study these areas. Therefore, tools and methods that overcome these limitations are needed. Towards this end, my thesis work has been focused on developing tools for single-cell resolution phenotyping in whole organs. I have been developing tissue clearing technologies to render whole organs transparent for optical interrogation and characterizing viral capsids and engineering viral vectors for noninvasive widespread gene delivery to the central and peripheral nervous system. Tissue clearing techniques for three dimensional optical interrogation were invented over a century ago. However, these earlier methods used harsh organic chemicals and failed to retain the tissue’s native fluorescence or epitopes. These earlier methods eventually became incompatible to the hundreds of newly generated transgenic mouse lines that allowed for cell type-specific expression of fluorescent transgenes or to fluorescent labeling techniques, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC). The first part of my dissertation is aimed at addressing these limitations by further developing and standardizing a tissue clearing method that utilizes the vasculature to perfuse clearing reagents. This technique, called perfusion assisted agent release in situ (PARS) enables (i) whole organ clearing of soft tissue, (ii) preservation of native fluorescence, and (iii) preservation of epitopes compatible with IHC. Although PARS allows us to optically investigate whole soft tissue organs, it is unsuitable for clearing bone tissue. The clearing of bone is important as it may provide optical access to delicate environments, such as the lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses beneath the skull that would otherwise be damaged through traditional methods. However, clearing bone tissue is challenging since it is composed of both soft (bone marrow) and hard (mineral) tissue. To overcome this challenge, I developed a clearing method that rendered intact bone tissue transparent by using EDTA <b>to</b> <b>decalcify</b> bones and by constructing a convective flow chamber to efficiently clear bones. This method, called Bone CLARITY, is able to preserve native fluorescence and epitopes. In order to demonstrate the utility of Bone CLARITY, I collaborated with colleagues to quantitatively access a rare and non-uniformly distributed population of osteoprogenitor cells in their native three dimensional environment. Bone CLARITY in conjunction with light-sheet microscope enabled the early detection of an increase to this osteoprogenitor population after administration of a novel anabolic drug, which may have been undetected with traditional techniques. Towards my second goal, I have been working on characterizing adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) for non-invasive widespread gene delivery across the central or peripheral nervous system. Through systemic delivery, these novel AAVs are able to efficiently deliver transgenes to (i) difficult-to-target areas, such as the dorsal root ganglia; (ii) cellular populations that are widely distributed across the mouse body, such as neurons in the myenteric nervous system, and (iii) through highly selective barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier. These viruses enable rapid expression of transgenes for perturbing and monitoring cellular circuits, or for potentially treating neurological diseases. In addition, I worked on engineering or validating several different gene regulatory elements to achieve cell type restricted expression in transgenic and non-transgenic animals with AAVs. These viral vectors may prove useful in rapidly testing newly developed genetic tools. Finally, I developed and characterized two different two-component viral vector systems to control the density of labeling when systemically delivering genes with our novel engineered viruses. I utilized this two-component system to perform single-cell morphology studies in the CNS and PNS. Collectively, these capsids and vectors expand the AAV toolbox and enable efficient and versatile gene delivery into the CNS and PNS of transgenic and non-transgenic animals. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study adhesion/decalcification {{mechanisms}} of acid interactions with human hard tissues such as bones and teeth, the chemical interaction of five carboxylic acids (acetic, citric, lactic, maleic, and oxalic) and two inorganic acids (hydrochloric and nitric) with enamel and two synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAp) powders with, respectively, a high {{and a low}} crystallinity were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), and spectrophotometry (S). X-ray diffraction revealed that the crystallinity of the highly crystallized HAp was considerably {{higher than that of}} enamel while the crystallinity of the poorly crystallized HAp was similar to that of dentin and bone. XPS of acid-treated enamel demonstrated for all carboxylic acids ionic bonding to calcium of HAp. AAS and S showed for both HAps that all carboxylic and inorganic acids except oxalic acid extracted Ca significantly more than P, leading to a Ca/P ratio close to that of synthetic HAp (2. 16 w/w). Oxalic acid extracted hardly any Ca, but substantially more P, leading to a significantly smaller Ca/P ratio than that of HAp. AAS showed that the calcium salt of oxalic acid hardly could be dissolved, whereas the calcium salts of all the other acids were very soluble in their respective acid solution. These results confirm the adhesion/decalcification concept (AD-concept) previously advanced. Depending on the dissolution rate of the respective calcium salts, acids either adhere <b>to</b> or <b>decalcify</b> apatitic substrates. It is concluded that the AD-concept that originally dictated the interaction of carboxylic acids with human hard tissues can be extended to inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric and nitric acid. Furthermore, HAp crystallinity was found not to affect the adhesion/decalcification behavior of acids when interacting with apatitic substrates, so that the AD-concept can be applied to all human hard tissues with varying HAp crystallinity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chelating {{agents are}} {{believed}} to aid root canal irrigation {{and to be able}} to remove the inorganic smear layer. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and <b>to</b> compare the <b>decalcifying</b> capability of different irrigating solutions (Tubuliclean, Largal Ultra, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 17 %, Tetraclean, Tetraclean NA). Materials and Methods: Sixty maxillary central incisors were used. Root canals were instrumented and irrigated. From each root, four comparable slices of cervical dentin were obtained. At three successive 5 -min interval immersion times, the concentration of calcium extracted from root canal dentin was assessed with an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer. Statistical Analysis Used: Data were analyzed by means of Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Significance was predetermined at P < 0. 05. Results and Conclusions: For all irrigating solutions, the maximum amount of Ca 2 + extracted from root canal dentin samples was reached after 10 min contact time except for citric acid-based agents (Tetraclean and Tetraclean NA) which induced a higher and still increasing calcium release even after 10 min contact time. In order to obtain an efficient decalcifying action on dentin and to facilitate the biomechanical procedures, citric acid-based irrigants can be applied...|$|R
40|$|CE-MS and HPLC-MS {{methods were}} {{developed}} and compared {{for the analysis}} of insoluble proteins in an avian eggshell matrix. The eggshell was gradually <b>decalcified</b> <b>to</b> obtain four distinct layers (cuticle, two palisade and a mammillary layer). The insoluble proteinaceous films from these layers were chemically and/or enzymatically splitted with CNBr/trypsin and proteinase K. The generated peptides were separated by CE and HPLC on-line coupled to MS detection. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was coupled to an ion-trap electrospray ionization mass spectrometer (Agilent LC-MSD Trap XCT-Ultra) using a grounded needle carrying a flow of sheath liquid (5 mM ammonium acetate/ 2 -propanol, 1 : 1, at flow-rate 3 lL min 1). Five main proteins were identified: ovocleidin- 116, ovocalyxin- 32, ovocalyxin- 36, ovoclei-din- 17 and ovalbumin. The distribution of these proteins in the eggshell was found to be dependent on the location/layer. In the outermost layer (the cuticle layer) the dominant protein is ovocalyxin- 32; ovocleidin- 116 is distributed throughout all layers while ovalbumin is present only in the internal mammillary layer. The CE-MS peptide maps of eggshell pro-teins were compared to the HPLC-MS ones, and a different mechanism of separation (migration/elution order) was demonstrated for both methods...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was <b>to</b> {{determine}} the <b>decalcifying</b> efficacy of 7 % maleic acid (MA), 2 % chlorhexidine (CHX), and combinations of 7 % MA + 0. 2 % cetrimide (CTR) and 2 % CHX + 0. 2 % CTR, in four time periods. Study Design: Four specimens per tooth were obtained from a 2 -mm thick slice of the cervical third of the root of ten human incisors. At 1, 2, 3 and 5 minutes of immersion, the concentrations of Ca 2 + were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: Statistically significant differences were seen for the extracted calcium in all time periods. The amount of calcium extracted by 7 % MA was the highest at all four immersion times, followed by 7 % MA + 0. 2 % CTR. Two percent CHX and its combination with 0. 2 % CTR extracted virtually no calcium. Conclusions: The decalcifying capacity of 7 % MA and 2 % CHX diminished when combined with 0. 2 % CTR.

40|$|A five-year {{monitoring}} {{study has}} been carried out to examine the combined effects of grazing and atmospheric nitrogen deposition on water and solute fluxes in dry coastal dune grasslands. Two vegetation types were studied: (a) a short, species-rich stand on calcareous sand (foredune site) and (b) a short, species-poor stand on partly decalcified soil on calcareous sand (innerdune site). In each stand four experimental plots were created: (1) control, (2) fertilized with nitrogen, (3) excluded from grazing by rabbits and (4) combination of fertilization and exclusion of grazing by rabbits. Due to the large spatial variability of the soil water content, no differences between the treatments could be measured. Average soil water content at 10 cm depth is very small (3 - 5 %) from May until October and does not increase after rainfall. However, measured soil water content at 20 cm and 50 cm depth increased after rainfall. In winter, nearly all measured soil water contents increase upon rainfall, although sometimes one soil water content remained dry till the end of the next summer. In summer it was impossible to sample soil water for the estimation of the solute concentrations due to the very small soil water content. Therefore, only solute concentrations of the winter period could be evaluated. Without fertilization, fluxes of nitrogen out of the soil system are below the incoming flux, due to storage in the biomass and in the soil compartment. When fertilized, 70 % of the added NH 4 +-N was leached from the foredune soil profile as NO 3 [...] N, due to nitrification. Conversely, at the grazed innerdune site most of the added nitrogen remained in the system. Here, nitrification rates will be small due <b>to</b> the <b>decalcified</b> topsoil and NH 4 +-N is not easily leached out of the soil compartment. At the exclosures of the innerdune site, about 15 % of the amount of the added fertilizer N was leached, after added NH 4 + is taken up by the plants and partly washed out as nitrate after mineralization and nitrification of dead biomass...|$|R
