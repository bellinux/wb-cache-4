When {{questioned}} by Scully, X tells her to analyze her implant, saying that it will give her answers about the train and her sister Melissa's murder. Meanwhile, Mulder enters the train and finds that the secret railcar is quarantined and protected by a security system. He searches for Zama, enlisting the <b>train</b> <b>conductor</b> for help. In Zama's compartment, they find hand-written journals in Japanese. However, elsewhere on the train, the Red-Haired Man intercepts and strangles Zama.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of Tehcir Law on 29 May 1915, Armenians left at the two holding centers were {{deported}} to Ottoman Syria. Most of the arrested were transferred from Central Prison over Saray Burnu by steamer No. 67 of the Şirket company to the Haydarpaşa train station. After waiting for ten hours, they were sent by special train {{in the direction of}} Ankara the next day. The entire convoy consisted of 220 Armenians. An Armenian <b>train</b> <b>conductor</b> got a list of names of the deportees. It was handed over to the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Zaven Der Yeghiayan, who immediately tried in vain to save as many deportees as possible. The only foreign ambassador to help him in his efforts was US ambassador Henry Morgenthau. After a train journey of 20 hours, the deportees got off in Sincanköy (near Ankara) Tuesday noon. At the station Ibrahim, the director of the Central Prison of Constantinople, did the triage. The deportees were divided into two groups.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to assess the exposure to physical work demands of <b>train</b> <b>conductors</b> and service electricians at a railway company in the Netherlands. On-site observations were performed using the Task Recording and Analysis on Computer observation system to identify the mean duration and frequency of tasks, activities and body postures. In total, 36 <b>train</b> <b>conductors</b> and 41 service electricians were observed for a net working day of 7 h. Results showed that <b>train</b> <b>conductors</b> and service electricians climbed a flight of stairs on average 249 and 258 times, respectively, and that service electricians worked above shoulder height for 65 min on average. In both jobs, guidelines were exceeded, e. g. duration of standing, the number of times climbing a flight of stairs, kneeling and squatting or working in awkward postures, which are risk factors for developing musculoskeletal complaints. Suggestions are made concerning how to reduce these risk factors. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: Understanding physical work demands is essential for recognising risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders. Since <b>train</b> <b>conductors</b> and service electricians in the Netherlands reported work-related complaints, on-site observations were performed to determine the duration and frequency of physical work demands. Risk factors were identified in both professions, providing insights concerning preventative measure...|$|R

25|$|This {{station was}} built in 1926 for the {{residents}} of the moshav Kfar Baruch, {{to the north of the}} village. It was a simple shack for awaiting passengers and had neither a ticket booth, nor tickets printed for the station. Therefore, the residents had to haggle with the <b>train</b> <b>conductor</b> on the train in hopes of being let in. Today, there are no remnants left of the station.|$|E
25|$|Two chance events helped spark Johnson's {{interest}} {{in politics and}} social questions, and convert him from a conventional business tycoon to a radical reformer. The first was reading, on {{the suggestion of a}} <b>train</b> <b>conductor,</b> Henry George's Social Problems, in which the political philosopher expounded his belief that poverty and misery were a result of society's newly created wealth becoming locked up in increasing land values, and advocating a Single Tax on land in place of wastefully taxing the productive activity of capital and labor.|$|E
50|$|In Belgium and The Netherlands, <b>train</b> <b>conductors</b> have {{multiple}} tasks involving train safety and customer services. Belgian/Dutch <b>train</b> <b>conductors</b> {{are responsible for}} the departure of the train. In each station they give the permission to move on by giving a ready signal to the train driver. Therefore, <b>train</b> <b>conductors</b> in Belgium and The Netherlands always close (and in some scenarios also open) the doors. They are also responsible for performing safety tasks {{in case of an emergency}} or accident, such as fire, evacuation, etc. Because of these tasks, there has to be at least one conductor on each passenger train; a <b>train</b> without a <b>conductor</b> is uncommon, but still appears on some regional Dutch trains. The departure trains always have one conductor who is conductor-in-chief. He is responsible for the entire train, the on-board crew and the passengers. Some longer trains may have additional conductors who are under command of the conductor-in-chief. Besides the safety tasks, conductors also collect and punch tickets, fine people for not having a valid fare and make announcements to the passengers.|$|R

He has a brother, Edward V. Stack. At {{a young age}} the Stack family moved to Union City, living in an apartment building at 518 9th Street, on the city's east side. They subsequently moved to 713 Palisade Avenue, where for over twenty years Margaret worked as the superintendent of that building and the other adjoining buildings. They later moved to 1104 Palisade Avenue, which remained their residence until Edward and Margaret's deaths in 2003 and 2015, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Edison {{developed}} hearing {{problems at}} an early age. The cause of his deafness {{has been attributed to}} a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. Around the middle of his career, Edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a <b>train</b> <b>conductor</b> when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in Smiths Creek, Michigan, along with his apparatus and chemicals. In his later years, he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor, in helping him onto a moving train, lifted him by the ears.|$|E
500|$|The {{heaviest}} rains outside New England fell in Bridgehampton, New York, where [...] fell {{during the}} passage of the storm. Two reported tornadoes struck Long Island. High winds destroyed apple, corn, and peach fields along Long Island. After a dry summer, the sudden deluge wrecked potato crops, resulting in $20million in crop damage;, about one-sixth of the agricultural output of the region. High winds caused power outages for 477,765 Long Island Lighting Company customers for a period of nearly five days. Most power outages occurred in the East End. One person died in a car accident while a traffic light was offline, and another person died when a falling tree struck a <b>train</b> <b>conductor.</b> The high waves destroyed fish nets offshore [...] and caused beach erosion and the widespread destruction of boats along the coast. Statewide damage totaled over $75million.|$|E

500|$|When the {{westbound}} {{troop train}} stopped at Red Pass Junction, Atherton gave the incorrect written order to <b>train</b> <b>conductor</b> John A. Mainprize. As the full order {{had been passed}} to the eastbound Continental, its crew expected to meet the troop train at Cedarside, [...] eastbound from Blue River; the crew aboard the troop train expected to meet the Continental and another train at Gosnell [...] westbound from Cedarside. With neither train crew aware of anything wrong, the troop train passed Cedarside and the Continental passed Gosnell. Both trains were travelling at moderate speeds, and attempted to negotiate a sharp curve from opposite ends. Thomas W. Tindall, a forestry employee, saw the two trains approaching each other from an embankment; he tried to signal the Continental crew, who responded to his frantic signals with a friendly wave. The two crews did not realise that a collision was imminent until the last moment, and the trains struck head-on at 10:35a.m.|$|E

In an attempt to resolve the situation, Luck Gandor asks his adoptive brother Claire Stanfield, a psychopathic assassin and <b>train</b> <b>conductor,</b> to travel to New York. Claire agrees to, and as a conductor, boards the transcontinental train the Flying Pussyfoot. The train is hijacked by the Russo and Lemure gangs, who are trying to kidnap a senator's family, and a battle ensues between the two gangs. Jacuzzi Splot, Nice Holystone and their gang attempt to protect the {{passengers}} and fight the hijackers, while Claire assumes the identity of the Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, and slaughters much of the Russo and the Lemure. [...] During a confrontation between Ladd Russo and Chane Laforet and the Lemure, Claire interrupts and proposes to Chane Laforet, who is the daughter of Huey Laforet, one of the original immortals aboard the Advenna Avis. A serial stowaway and newspaper field agent named Rachel flees Claire and ends up helping in the rescue of the hostages. The last remaining members of the Lemure are eventually defeated by Jacuzzi's gang, while sadistic murderer Ladd Russo is incarcerated and loses his arm to Claire. At the same time, Ennis writes to Isaac and Miria, inviting them to Manhattan. The duo boards the same train and meets Jacuzzi, and unwittingly sway immortal Czeslaw Meyer from enacting malevolent acts via bombs {{to be used in the}} New York Drug War.|$|E
