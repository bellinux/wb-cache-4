40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the nature of the tissue fluid in the oedema <b>of</b> preg-nancy <b>toxaemia.</b> Most {{investigators}} (Dieckmann, 1942; Taylor, Warner, and Welsh, 1939; Chesley and Chesley, 1943) believe that the abnormal water balance in this condition is caused by a combination of several factors, both mechanical and physico-chemical in nature. There is general acceptance of the fact that the oedema in <b>toxaemias</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> is brought about by a retention of sodium chloride in the tissues, and some observers (Taylor et al., 1939) suggest that this is connected with an oestrogen excess which accompanies pregnancy.

DESIGN [...] 27 Year follow up of patients with non-obstructive focal scarring identified from a retrospective review of intravenous urograms performed in childhood between 1951 and 1967. SETTING [...] Paediatric primary referral centre and urological clinic in tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS [...] 30 Patients (mean age 33 (range 22 - 41] with non-obstructive focal renal scarring first detected between 1951 and 1967 {{and a history of}} febrile urinary tract infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Hypertension and complications of renal damage. RESULTS [...] Three patients had developed end stage renal disease, seven had developed hypertension, two of 16 women had a history <b>of</b> <b>toxaemia</b> during <b>pregnancy,</b> and seven patients had undergone renal surgery during follow up. Of the 20 patients who had neither had renal surgery nor had end stage renal disease, all had a significantly lower glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow and higher diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and serum beta 2 microglobulin concentration than 13 healthy age matched controls. Diastolic blood pressure and plasma renin activity were positively correlated (r = 0. 50, p less than 0. 05) and so were fractional sodium excretion and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (r = 0. 54, p less than 0. 01, r = 0. 51, p less than 0. 01 respectively). The progress of renal damage was unrelated to the incidence of recurrent infections.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the rate of cardiovascular disease is different among parous women with a general practitioner reported history of <b>toxaemia</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> than among those not reported to have experienced toxaemia, or among nulliparous women. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: 1400 general practitioners throughout the United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: Women who had never used oral contraceptives who were recruited to the Royal College of General Practitioners' oral contraception study (original cohort about 23000). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age, social class, and smoking standardised incidence rates for hypertensive disease, acute myocardial infarction, other acute ischaemic heart disease, other chronic ischaemic heart disease, angina pectoris, total ischaemic heart disease, total cerebrovascular disease, and total venous thromboembolic disease in the three groups. RESULTS: Compared with parous women with no history of toxaemia, those who had experienced toxaemia had a significantly increased risk of hypertensive disease (relative risk (RR) 2. 35), acute myocardial infarction (RR 2. 24), chronic ischaemic heart disease (RR 1. 74), angina pectoris (RR 1. 53), all ischaemic heart disease (RR 1. 65), and venous thromboembolism (RR 1. 62). The rates for all cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease were also increased but not significantly. Nulliparous {{women were more likely}} to develop hypertension or all cerebrovascular disease later in life than parous women without a history of toxaemia. CONCLUSIONS: A history of <b>toxaemia</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> increases the risk of several distinct cardiovascular conditions later in life. Although causality cannot be inferred (other characteristics of the women may account for both an increased risk of toxaemia and a risk of subsequent vascular disease), the findings merit further research because of their potential importance...|$|E

40|$|THE {{fact that}} {{permanent}} blindness {{is such a}} rare complication in the <b>toxaemia</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> has prompted me to set the following casq on record. I can find no account of permanent blindness resulting from pregnancy in {{the records of the}} Rotunda Hospital, Dublin. Certainly no case has occurred in the last 73, 572 pregnancies covered by the hospital (1935 - 4 &), and three Masters who held office before 1935 (Dr. Fitzgibbon, 1919 - 26; Dr. Bethel Solomons, 1926 - 33, and Dr. Davidson, 1932) have kindly allowed me to state that during. their periods of mastership no case of permanent blind-ness occurred. Thus, this case appears to be the first in over 150, 000 births. Since the classification of what constitutes " <b>toxaemia</b> <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> " has undergone modification during the last 30 years, it would be valueless to give statistics. Any marked degree of permanent reduction in sight after toxaemia of preg-nancy has been an unusual occurrence in the Rotunda Hospital. No mother in these last 73, 572 births has required blind assistance {{as a result of her}} pregnancy. An investigation of the literature has produced only one case of permanent blindpess due to pregnancy toxaemia. A 30 -year-old woman had a transient loss of sight on her third pregnancy, lost the sight of one eye (with marked diminution in the other) on her fourth pregnancy, and went totally and permanently blind on the fourth day after the birth of her fifth child. Six years later she developed presenile dementia. She was examined generally and ophthalmologically seven weeks after the birth of her fourth child, and again two years after going blind following her fifth pregnancy. On both occasions the urine showed no albumen and exhaustive examination of the central nervous system revealed no abnormality. There is no record of urine analysis or blood pressure. Her blindness was caused by post-neuritic atrophy. Case Report History. -The patient, 26 years of age, was admitted (January, 1949) to the Rotunda Hospital in the 35 th week of her sixth pregnancy.

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{reclassification}} <b>of</b> dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> includes polymorphic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> atopic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> and pemphigoid gestationis; intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> strictly not a dermatosis, {{was included in}} specific dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> for working purposes. Another dermatosis, pustular psoriasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> could be included for similar reasons. The nomenclature of these pregnancy-specific eruptions has been revised several times, generating potential confusion among practitioners. Clouding the picture further are misnomers {{that have been used}} to describe dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> In addition, several cutaneous conditions that are associated with, but not specific to, pregnancy, have been misunderstood, which has resulted in certain myths among patients and physicians. In this contribution, we describe how the nomenclature of each dermatosis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> has evolved to fit the current classification scheme. We then identify several misnomers that have generated confusion within the scheme. Finally, we debunk several myths that have developed around cutaneous conditions outside of this scheme, in both mother and newborn...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{represent a}} heterogeneous group of pruritic skin diseases {{that have been}} recently reclassified and include pemphigoid (herpes) gestationis, polymorphic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (syn. pruritic urticarial papules and plaques <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy),</b> intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> and atopic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> They are associated with severe pruritus that should never be neglected in pregnancy but always lead to an exact work-up of the patient. Clinical characteristics, in particular timing of onset, morphology and localization of skin lesions are crucial for diagnosis which, in case of pemphigoid gestationis and intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> will be confirmed by specific immunofluorescence and laboratory findings. While polymorphic and atopic eruptions <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> are distressing only to the mother because of pruritus, pemphigoid gestationis {{may be associated with}} prematurity and small-for-date babies and intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> poses an increased risk for fetal distress, prematurity, and stillbirth. Corticosteroids and antihistamines control pemphigoid gestationis, polymorphic and atopic eruptions of pregnancy; intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> in contrast, should be treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. This review will focus on the new classification <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> dermatoses, discuss them in detail, and present a practical algorithm to facilitate the management of the pregnant patient with skin lesions.
