She is reluctant to discuss her romantic life: [...] "I have always believed that there is life before marriage and after marriage. Before marriage... you are termed a single woman and I choose to conduct <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life with absolute dignity and discretion". Although rumours of a relationship with Salman Khan first emerged in 2003, it was not until after their 2010 breakup that Kaif spoke of the affair, calling it her first serious relationship. They have remained friends, and the actress credits Khan with giving her confidence and guidance: ...|$|E
500|$|The biographer Richard D. E. Burton {{comments}} that, in {{the late}} 1920s, Poulenc might have {{seemed to be in}} an enviable position: professionally successful and independently well-off, having inherited a substantial fortune from his father. He bought a large country house, Le Grande Coteau, at Noizay, Indre-et-Loire, [...] south-west of Paris, where he retreated to compose in peaceful surroundings. Yet he was troubled, struggling {{to come to terms with}} his sexuality, which was predominantly homosexual. His first serious affair was with the painter Richard Chanlaire, to whom he sent a copy of the Concert champêtre score inscribed, [...] "You have changed my life, you are the sunshine of my thirty years, a reason for living and working". Nevertheless, while this affair was in progress Poulenc proposed marriage to his friend Raymonde Linossier. As she was not only well aware of his homosexuality but was also romantically attached elsewhere, she refused him, and their relationship became strained. He suffered the first of many periods of depression, which affected his ability to compose, and he was devastated in January 1930 when Linossier died suddenly at the age of 32. On her death he wrote, [...] "All my youth departs with her, all <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life that belonged only to her. I sob... I am now twenty years older". His affair with Chanlaire petered out in 1931, though they remained lifelong friends.|$|E
500|$|Location {{scouting}} {{revealed a}} former Wall Street bank {{that had been}} closed down and repurposed as a cigar bar. [...] The building stood in for the fictional Manhattan Trust Bank branch, where the bank heist occurs. [...] "Without a bank, we didn’t have a movie," [...] Lee explained. [...] "But everything ended up going very smoothly. We shot {{in the heart of}} Wall Street in a bank that had been closed down. It was like having a back lot in the middle of Wall Street." [...] An office at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House doubled as the office of Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Plummer believed that the office's design was essential to his character: [...] "The space literally presents Case’s power, so I found <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> character was to simply play very cool about everything. You don’t have to push the power, because it’s all around you." [...] The location was also used to film a scene where Frazier confronts Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). The American Tract Society building, located at 150 Nassau Street and Spruce Street, Manhattan, doubled as White's office. Cafe Bravo, a coffee shop located at 76 Beaver Street and Hanover Street, was also used for filming. Other filming locations included Battery Park and the New York Supreme Court House's Appellate Division located at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue, Manhattan.|$|E

Rihanna stated, [...] "Hair, makeup, and styling {{play an important role in}} creativity, I am very involved with <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> process, so this agency was an organic thing for me to do." [...] The roster includes Rihanna’s makeup artist Mylah Morales, wardrobe stylist Jason Bolden, hairstylist Patricia Morales, and Marcia Hamilton. In addition to Fr8me, Rihanna opened a photo agency called [...] "A Dog Ate My Homework", which represents photographers Erik Asla and Deborah Anderson.|$|E
2500|$|His {{original}} {{portrayal of}} the character in The Silence of the Lambs has been labelled by the AFI as the number-one film villain. At {{the time he was}} offered the role, Hopkins was making a return to the London stage, performing in M. Butterfly. He had come back to Britain after living {{for a number of years}} in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, [...] "Well <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life." [...] Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by Thomas Harris. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that Red Dragon would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, Hannibal Rising.|$|E

I've been shaped by all these people and cultures and I feel quite comfortable among all of them." [...] Zadeh also notes in the same interview: [...] "Obstinacy and tenacity.
