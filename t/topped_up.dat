5|$|Towards {{the start}} of the 11th century, Welsh society started to build settlements. Food would be cooked in a single {{cauldron}} over an open fire on the floor, it would likely be reheated and <b>topped</b> <b>up</b> with fresh ingredients over a number of days. Some dishes could be cooked on a bakestone, a flat stone which could be placed above a fire to heat it evenly.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin has {{traditionally}} been used to kill rodents, but many populations have developed resistance to this anticoagulant, and difenacoum is often substituted. These are cumulative poisons, requiring bait stations to be <b>topped</b> <b>up</b> regularly. Poisoned meat {{has been used for}} centuries to kill animals such as wolves and birds of prey. Poisoned carcasses however kill a wide range of carrion feeders, not only the targeted species. Raptors in Israel were nearly wiped out following a period of intense poisoning of rats and other crop pests.|$|E

All <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV set-top boxes and CAM's allowed access to ESPN whilst the CI+ CAM and approved set-top boxes allowed viewers to subscribe to Sky Sports and ESPN. A viewing smartcard (viewing card) is used to unlock customers services. <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV uses the Nagravision Merlin (NagraVision 3) encryption since a card swap in 2008. Previously programmes were encrypted by MediaGuard SECA2, a more secure version of the encryption system of previous digital terrestrial incumbent ITV Digital. All <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV set <b>top</b> boxes and DTR's are required {{to have at least}} an 8-day EPG, similar to the requirement for normal Freeview boxes.|$|R
2500|$|In October 2006, Channel 5 {{launched}} two new free-to-air digital channels, Five Life and Five US, using capacity formerly leased out to <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV. This left <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV with {{a reduced}} number of video streams. In November 2006, the company launched <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV Anytime, a service which broadcasts overnight [...] "downloads" [...] which are recorded by a proprietary <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV Anytime personal video recorder (PVR). At the same time, they started reducing the linear service.|$|R
5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) <b>topped</b> <b>up</b> with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{had been}} working with the German engine {{manufacturer}} BMW since 1980 on the development of a turbocharged engine for Formula One. The BMW-powered BT50 made its debut {{at the start of the}} 1982 season, taking advantage of the high-altitude Kyalami circuit in South Africa, which favoured turbocharged cars. However, the as yet unreliable BMW-powered cars were dropped for the next two races. Piquet finished first at the Brazilian Grand Prix in a BT49D, but was disqualified after a protest from Renault and Ferrari on the grounds that the car had raced underweight due to its water-cooled brakes. FISA ruled that in future all cars must be weighed before coolants were <b>topped</b> <b>up,</b> resulting in a boycott of the fourth race of the season by most of the DFV-powered teams, including Brabham. Under threat from BMW, Brabham did not use its Ford-powered BT49s again until the sixth race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix, where one was entered for Riccardo Patrese alongside Piquet in a BT50. Patrese won the race after a chaotic final lap on which several other cars stopped. Patrese used the BT49 for the next two races, taking a second place behind Piquet's BMW-powered car in the BT49's final Formula One race, the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always <b>topped</b> <b>up</b> or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E

In 2009, <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV Anytime was rebranded as TV Favourites, as <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV no longer needed the Anytime brand to {{differentiate}} its on-demand service from its previous linear service. The service was only accessible through a <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV DVB-T DVR set top box. Content was available by pressing the <b>Top</b> <b>Up</b> TV button on the remote whilst watching a TV channel or perusing the EPG. Over time, channels like Living and Home were phased out, replaced by programmes from the BBC, Warner Bros. Television and The Walt Disney Company.
