25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the liposuction-only technique usually applies to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> oversized breasts require the removal of a medium volume of internal tissue; and to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> health precludes her being under the extended anaesthesia usual to surgical breast-reduction operations. The ideal lipectomy candidate is <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> low-density breasts are principally composed of adipose tissue, have a relatively elastic skin envelope, and manifest mild ptosis. The therapeutic advantages of the liposuction-only technique are the small incision-scars required {{for access to the}} breast interior, hence, a shorter post-operative healing period for the incision scars; the therapeutic disadvantage is limited breast-reduction volumes.|$|E
25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the free nipple-graft technique transposes the nipple-areola complex (NAC) as a tissue graft without a blood supply, without a skin and glandular pedicle. The therapeutic advantage is the greater volume of breast tissues (glandular, adipose, skin) that can be resected to produce a proportionate breast. The therapeutic disadvantage is a breast without a sensitive nipple-areola complex, and without lactational capability. The medically indicated candidates are: <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> health presents {{a high risk of}} ischemia (localized tissue anemia) of the nipple-areola complex, which might cause tissue necrosis; the diabetic woman; the woman who is a tobacco smoker; <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> oversized breasts have an approximate NAC-to-IMF measure of 20cm; and the woman who has macromastia, requiring much resecting of the breast tissues.|$|E

25|$|The {{relative}} pronoun is that (at is {{an alternative}} form borrowed from Norse but can also be arrived at by contraction) for all persons and numbers, but may be left out Thare's no mony fowk (that) bides in that glen (There aren't many {{people who live in}} that glen). The anglicised forms wha, wham, whase 'who, whom, whose', and the older whilk 'which' are literary affectations; whilk is only used after a statement He said he'd tint it, whilk wis no whit we wantit tae hear (he said he'd lost it, which is not what we wanted to hear". The possessive is formed by adding s or by using an appropriate pronoun The wifie that's hoose gat burnt (<b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> house was burnt), the wumman that her dochter gat mairit (<b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> daughter got married); the men that thair boat wis tint (the men whose boat was lost).|$|E

25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the horizontal-scar technique features a horizontal incision along the inframammary fold (IMF) and a nipple-areola complex (NAC) pedicle. To elevate the NAC, the technique usually employs either an inferior pedicle or an inferior-lateral pedicle, and features no vertical incision (like the Anchor pattern). The horizontal-scar technique best applies to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> oversized breasts are too large for a vertical-incision technique (e.g. the lollipop pattern); and it has two therapeutic advantages: no vertical incision-scar to the breast hemisphere, and better healing of the periareolar scar of the transposed NAC. The potential disadvantages are box-shaped breasts with thick (hypertrophied) incision scars, especially at the inframammary fold.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the effects of the}} 1909 Trade Boards Act on women's wage rates and income contributions to poor households. The Act established boards charged with setting minimum hourly wages in selected low-paid trades, and the majority of workers affected before the First World War were <b>women.</b> Many of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>whose</b> wages were raised by the Act were the wives and daughters of low-skilled workers, while many others were sole earners who supported children or elderly parents.

25|$|In 1991, Manitoba Justice Minister James McCrae {{appointed}} Hughes to lead {{an investigation}} into the unusual circumstances which led to lawyer Harvey Pollock being arrested on a dubious sexual assault charge. Pollock had previously acted as the lawyer for the family of J.J. Harper, an indigenous leader who had been killed in a confrontation with Winnipeg police. The case against Pollock quickly fell apart in court, and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> statements led to the charge later clarified that she had never accused Pollock of sexual assault during her discussions with police. Pollock believed that he was the target of a police vendetta. Hughes' report completely vindicated Pollock and led to the resignation of police chief Herb Stephen.|$|E
25|$|Vermeer {{is known}} to have {{incorporated}} other artists' ideas, techniques and the poses in which they depict subjects. Some features of Diana share the effects and techniques of Rembrandt. Diana's stout figure is much like those in Rembrandt's work, and Vermeer used thick impasto brushwork following the lines of the folds of her clothing, as Rembrandt did. Also like Rembrandt, Vermeer cast the faces of the group in shadows, which gives a more expressive, moodier cast to the scene. Vermeer's painting is very similar in feeling to Rembrandt's Bathsheba, painted in 1654, a work Vermeer very likely saw firsthand, according to Wheelock. The poses of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> feet is washed and the one doing the washing are similar. It is possible that Rembrandt's former pupil, Carel Fabritius (in Delft from 1650 until his death in late 1654), may have made Vermeer familiar with Rembrandt's work.|$|E

500|$|The mystery {{surrounding}} Mary Alice and {{her family}} was the main storyline in the first season of the series, and it is resolved in the first season finale. Cherry had wanted {{there to be a}} [...] "definite end" [...] to the mystery, hoping to avoid similar viewer fatigue that Twin Peaks suffered after drawing out its central mystery past its first season. ABC executives initially protested the writers' decision to have Mary Alice purposefully kill [...] Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>whose</b> child she had illegally purchased, prompting the writers to make Deirdre violent in order to justify Mary Alice's actions. Although Mary Alice {{and her family}} do not have much of a leading storyline thereafter, the mystery surrounding the character's suicide in the inaugural season is said to have informed and influenced every other season of the series. In 2006, when asked during an interview what viewers could expect from Mary Alice for the series' third season, Strong said that the character was [...] "going to be back with an attitude", stating: [...] "She will be a little less surreal, ethereal and a little more sassy, which means the show is going to be sassier." [...] During the series' final season in 2011, the actress appears as Mary Alice's ghost to her suicidal friend Bree (Marcia Cross). Strong enjoyed filming that particular scene, as it was the only scene during the entire series that featured solely Mary Alice and Bree. She described the scene as one of her personal favorites and called it an [...] "extraordinary opportunity", saying: [...] "In a way, Mary Alice becomes [...] conscious and her guide and her muse in knowing what to do with her life. And it was an exquisitely written scene and it was really, I think in my experience on the show, one of my favorite scenes I have ever shot." ...|$|E

[...] In a few weeks, von Glenn found herself won over by Creighton's charm, and before she left Oxford {{at the end of the}} month, the two were engaged. [...] They had agreed to be married the following winter; however, as Christmas approached, it was still not certain whether Merton College would waive its requirement of celibacy for its teaching fellows. [...] On Christmas Eve, the college finally relented and elected four married fellows, one of whom was Creighton.
