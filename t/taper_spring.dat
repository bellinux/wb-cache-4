50|$|The RV-3 uses a NACA 23012 airfoil on a {{constant}} chord wing. Construction is semi-monocoque of predominantly 2024-T3 aluminum sheet. The wings are built around an aluminum I-beam spar with a lighter rear spar. The aircraft has plain flaps {{operated by a}} handle. The main landing gear is attached directly to the welded steel engine mount and consists of <b>tapered,</b> <b>sprung</b> steel tubes. Construction time for the RV-3 {{is reported to be}} 1300 hours for a first time builder.|$|R
5000|$|All FMTV {{models are}} fitted with Meritor beam axles, the ratings and {{specifications}} {{of which have}} also evolved as the FMTV has developed.

50|$|It is {{just over}} 810 ft long {{including}} the tapered {{part of the}} canal at each end, and 86 ft high above {{the surface of the}} river. The aqueduct is carried on twelve segmental arches, each of 50 ft span. The piers, which are slightly <b>tapered,</b> <b>spring</b> into the arches at a height of 50 ft above the river level, and the tops of the arches are 50 ft above that point. The piers are hollow, and access {{to the inside of the}} structure underneath the trough is gained by a small door 3 ft high by 2 ft wide. The structure is 23 ft wide at the top, and the canal is 13 ft wide and around 6 ft deep due to silting. There are stone towpaths 4 ft wide along each side.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nunmerical {{analysis}} method {{was used to}} analyze multi-chip <b>tapered</b> leaf <b>spring</b> with the same area under vertical loads, in which the brick element of twenty nodes was used to model the spring leaves and the solid modeling using in ansys was modeled in 3 D softwar. Each piece of nodes were coupled in order to simulate the leaf spring assembly process. The results of six modes analysis and static analysis could be the research basis for the further study of leaf spring...|$|R
50|$|Alberta's {{electrical}} demand varies {{throughout the}} day and across the seasons. When individuals are fixing supper and using home appliances, demand for power goes up, as it does during heat waves and cold snaps. It <b>tapers</b> off during <b>spring</b> and fall. Like other mechanical devices, generators fail from time to time. If they are wind-powered, their output varies with the wind.|$|R
5000|$|The Mack F series truck uses taper-leaf front springs, {{which helps}} {{to provide a}} {{smoother}} ride. Taper-lead springs practically eliminate the inter-leaf friction, which is common with multi-leaf <b>spring</b> systems. The <b>taper</b> concept uses <b>springs</b> of equal length and different contour, to assure the springs do not slide against one another while in normal operation. This arrangement, accompanied by forged aluminum rear brackets and shackles equate to a comfortable ride.|$|R
2500|$|On the A0 {{model the}} front Rockwell steer-drive axle has Hendrickson {{parabolic}} <b>taper</b> leaf <b>springs.</b> The rear tridem unit is sprung by Hendrickson-Turner air suspension. The rearmost axle is a steer-drive unit. All axles are Rockwell SVI 5MR hub-reduction with differential locks. Steering is power-assisted, {{and has an}} auxiliary pump should the main pump fail. Mechanical linkage also provides operator control in event of hydraulic oil pressure loss. [...] Rockwell (now AxleTech) S-cam drum brakes are fitted. A CM Automotive central tire inflation system (CTIS) is fitted, this having four predetermined terrain settings (Highway, Cross-Country, Mud & Snow, Emergency) that enable the operator to adjust tire pressure and lock-up to suit the terrain being crossed. A Run Flat mode checks tire pressures regularly and inflates as needed to compensate for leak(s).|$|R
50|$|Stripers are migratory, {{and will}} {{move up and}} down the coasts and into river systems to spawn, and back out to sea {{throughout}} the year. But close in to the shoreline, the bite begins when the water reaches 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the <b>spring,</b> <b>tapers</b> off as the hot summer approaches, and returns in force in the fall. The bite activity then dies down again as water temperatures drift back down to the forties in late fall and early winter.|$|R
40|$|A {{leaf spring}} is simple form of spring, {{generally}} {{used for the}} suspension in automotives. Earlier {{it was like a}} slender arc-shaped having length of a spring steel of rectangular cross-section. In this paper analysis is done for leaf spring whose thickness varies from the center to the outer side following a parabolic pattern. The development of a parabolic <b>tapered</b> leaf <b>spring</b> enabled the springs to become lighter, but also provided a much improved ride to the vehicle through a reduction on interleaf friction. To move further, authors take an opportunity to perform a Finite element analysis (FEA) on the spring model so that stress and damage distribution can be observed. In this paper, we describe its basic structure, stress characteristics, engineering finite element modeling for analyzing & high stress zones. The equivalent von-misses stresses are plotted...|$|R
5000|$|The chassis was {{as for the}} TL, {{with some}} minor {{alterations}} at the front to accommodate the new flat-floor cab. The front suspension, now <b>taper</b> leaf <b>sprung,</b> was also new. The TL was designed mainly for short hauls, but comfort was a bigger priority than for the TK. While an ample number of combinations were available, power outputs were higher than for the TK. From launch, the TL was powered by petrol and diesel engines. The six-cylinder petrol power units were the 214P 3.5-litre and the 300P 4.9-litre. The diesel units were the updated versions of the TK's 3.6-litre four-cylinder 220D and the 5.4-litre six-cylinder 330D, with the option for heavier models of the 8.2-litre Blue Series. Power outputs are [...] for the petrols, while the diesels offer [...] for the 220D and the 330D. The Blue Series offered either [...] depending on the model.|$|R
50|$|The band {{returned}} to regular touring {{in the spring}} of 2013 with a run of Mid-West and Southern shows beginning in April. During these shows, the band introduced new innovations in the audio broadcast of their live performance. Previously, Panic had allowed tapers to use audience recording devices to simulcast live shows to fans via the internet. The first live taper stream was at the Dodge Theater in Phoenix, AZ on 11/04/2009 by Coloartist and was continued by all the WP <b>tapers</b> through the <b>Spring</b> 2013 tour when the band took over streaming duties and started broadcasting live soundboard recordings of the show via Mixlr.com and the Mixlr smartphone app. On December 31, 2013 the band {{returned to}} Philips Arena in Atlanta.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} electrode {{mounting structure}} for a {{gas tungsten arc welding}} torch having a coaxial imaging system. The electrode mounting structure includes a support having a central hub and {{a plurality of}} spokes which extend from the hub generally radially with respect to the axis of the torch into supporting engagement with the interior walls of the torch. The spaces between the spokes are optical passages for transmission of light to form the image. A tubular collet holder is threadedly engaged at its upper end to the hub and extends downwardly toward the open end of the torch. The collet holder has an inwardly tapering constriction near its lower end. An electrode-retaining, tubular collet is mounted within the collet holder and has a longitudinally split and tapered end seating against the <b>tapered</b> constriction. A <b>spring</b> seats against {{the upper end of the}} collet and forces the split end against the tapered constriction to wedge the split end radially inwardly to grip the electrode within the collet...|$|R
40|$|Seidel and Booth (1960) {{wrote that}} the 2 ̆ 2 life {{histories}} of the genus Microtus are not numerous in the literature. 2 ̆ 2 In support of his observation he cited 6 publications, all dated between 1891 and 1953. Since then the literature has exploded with a proliferation of publications. An international literature review recently revealed over 3, 500 citations for the genus. When Pitymys and Clethrionomys are included another 350 and 1, 880, respectively, were found. Over the last 10 years approximately 3 new publications on voles appeared every 4 days; a significant output for what some would consider such an insignificant species. Most of the publications {{were the result of}} graduate research projects on population dynamics and species ecology. As such, many do not explore more than the rudimentary ecological relationships between the animal and their environments. Unfortunate, as well, is that all but one confined their observations to {{only a small part of}} their total environment. For many of these animals, their life underground may be more important for their survival than that above ground. Trapping studies conducted by Godfrey and Askham (1988) with permanently placed pitfall live traps in orchards revealed a significant inverse population fluctuation during the year. During the winter, when populations are expected to decrease, as many as 6 to 8 mature Microtus montanus were collected at any 1 time in the traps after several centimeters of snow accumulation. During the summer, when populations are expected to increase, virtually no animals were collected in the traps. According to current population dynamics theory, greater numbers of animals, including increasingly larger numbers of immature members of the community, should appear in any sample between the onset of the breeding period, generally in the <b>spring,</b> <b>taper</b> off during the latter part of the production season, usually late summer, and then decline as the limiting factors begin to take effect. For us, we trapped more animals in the fall and early winter than we did during the spring and summer. A review of the above literature did little to answer our question. Where are the animals going during the summer and why...|$|R
