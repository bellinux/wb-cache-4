40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} {{development}} of an autonomous docking feature for a marine vessel in a small-scale, sheltered, environment. <b>Proximity</b> <b>sensors</b> are added to aid the autonomous exploration by detecting obstacles outside the lidars scan-plane, an assessment of different thrust allocations to emulate leisure boats are addressed. The Cyber Ship Saucer, a model-scale vessel built for testing in the Marine Cybernetics Laboratory at NTNU, have been serving the platform for testing the docking scheme. The model and the lab, together with autonomous systems, optimal thrust allocation, sensors and SLAM is presented as a background for the experimental work performed in this thesis. In addition to the fixed thrusters, four new configurations which considering rotation, emulating a leisure boat, have been studied. The ''constrained control allocation for azimuth thruster'' were applied to find an optimal solution for each of the modes. The online visualization process has been altered such that obstacles detected by <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensors</b> become apparent for the operator, along with the heading of the vessel. Through modifying the existing system, influencing both the path planning strategy and operator interaction, autonomous docking and take-off arose. Simulations, and later experiments, verified the autonomous docking by utilizing <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensors</b> using a fixed thruster configuration. Through the user interface, the user is able to select a spot and then inputting the desired heading there. The results are presented, and discussed, in a separate chapter.

40|$|Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB) are contact free {{bearings}} {{that support}} loads by magnetic levitation. This {{is accomplished by}} generating magnetic forces with electric current {{through a series of}} electromagnets surrounding a suspended rotor mass. Along with a set of electromagnets, an AMB assembly also consists of power amplifiers for each electromagnet, a controller, and <b>proximity</b> <b>sensors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensors</b> provide rotor position feedback to the control system, which modulates power to the amplifiers [4]. Magnetic bearings are used in several industrial applications today, including but not limited to compressors, turbines, pumps, motors, and generators. Advantages of their utility include very low to no friction, longer life than bearings with lubrication (no wear), high operation speeds, environmental friendliness (oil and contamination free), and the ability to accommodate irregularities in the mass distribution automatically. Disadvantages include complexity, little to no damping, difficulty to control, and high cost. Magnetic bearings are finding increasing use as the technology progresses and components becomes less expensive...|$|R
40|$|Piloting AGVs in an unstructured, {{dynamic and}} complex outdoor {{environment}} {{has become an}} emerging area of research. In this paper we describe {{the development of a}} fuzzy na tor to perform the local navigation and obstacle avoidance tasks for an outdoor AGV which is realised from a golf cart. The hybrid architecture incorporates a high level 'modeland-plan' and a low-level 'sense-and-execute' layer. Each of the complex local navigational tasks that need to be carried out is analyzed in terms of primitive behaviours and expressed as an aggregation of such behaviours. The fuzzy behaviours are synthesized based on appropriately fused sensory data received from the complementary <b>sensor</b> devices, especially, <b>proximity</b> <b>sensors</b> and a laser scanner. A fuzzy simulator developed using Matlab is introduced which is ca able of monitoring the vehicle performance gh travelling profile, heading angles, change in steering commands, as well as the logic patterns of <b>the</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensors.</b> A method to associate these logic patterns to linguistic variables is discussed. Lastly, enhancements to the simulator are presented. ...|$|R
