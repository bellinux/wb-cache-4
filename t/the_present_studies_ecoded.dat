Although the Rayleigh wave tomography employed by Suetsugu et al. (2009) {{is not exactly}} identical to that of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study,</b> differences between <b>the</b> two studies are caused mainly by the better path coverage of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study.</b> Compared with Suetsugu et al. (2009), a substantial improvement in lateral resolution is achieved with data from the TIARES experiment. As the figures show, the slow velocity anomalies are more localized in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study.</b> <b>The</b> large-scale anomaly patterns found by Suetsugu et al. (2009) (e.g., slow anomalies beneath Tahiti island and the Society hotspot, and those east of the Society hotspot) are preserved in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study.</b> More localized slow anomalies, such as that located at 400  km south of the Society hotspot, were not detected by Suetsugu et al. (2009). The amplitudes of the velocity variations in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> are 2 – 3 times as large as those in Suetsugu et al.

Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of this model. Post hoc modifications to this model were conducted in order to achieve an adequate fitting model. The results of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> did not support the hypothesis that the direct relationship between gender role conflict and attitudes towards help-seeking was negative in nature. The hypothesis that maladaptive coping behaviors would lead to negative attitudes towards help-seeking was supported. The results of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> found a covariant relationship between gender role conflict and coping behaviors. The results of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> suggest that <b>the</b> coping behaviors identified as maladaptive may serve as adaptive, self-regulatory behaviors that do not adversely impact attitudes towards help-seeking.

30|$|From the above, we can {{conclude}} the following: (1) in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study,</b> {{we found no}} false negatives.

(2) PRMC has the ability to find candidates for further work up. In <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study,</b> 40  % of patients with an abnormal PRMC test ended up having PCD as final clinical diagnosis. This number will of course depend greatly upon the group of patients being investigated. (3) PRMC has a high rate of conclusive results (90  % in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study).</b> (4) In addition, our results indicate {{that there might be a}} need for reference material for children.|$|R

40|$|Aim of Study: <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> {{was planned}} {{to analyze the}} status of serum {{homocysteine}} (hcy), folate, and Vitamin B 12 in patients with osteosarcoma.

Results: <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> indicated that serum folate and hcy levels were increased in osteosarcoma patients and decreased Vitamin B 12 in osteosarcoma patients when compared to controls. Conclusion: Lowered serum Vitamin B 12 levels are possibly due to increased metabolic demand of the tumor. Raised hcy levels could be due to the contribution from rapidly proliferating cells. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>study</b> suggests that these parameters can serve as useful markers for diagnosis and follow-up of disease...|$|R
