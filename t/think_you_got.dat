2500|$|Young Buck {{released}} a song featuring Tony Yayo called [...] "Off Parole" [...] which insulted Lil Wayne. Young Buck said that Lil Wayne {{could not be}} angry, because Young Buck spoke the truth. Young Buck also said [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> a problem with Juve and B.G.; you'll have a true problem with me", referring to the Cash Money-Juvenile/B.G feud. One of the reasons 50 Cent stated he was dismissing Young Buck was what he called [...] "inconsistent behavior" [...] which included appearing on stage with Lil Wayne, then seemingly dissing him on records with G-Unit. After he was dismissed, Young Buck appeared in the music video [...] "My Life" [...] by The Game, which featured Lil Wayne in the vocals. As of 2009 Buck and Wayne have squashed their beef and also linked up to record a track [...] "Up's and Down's" [...] for Young Buck's Back On My Buck Shit mixtape.|$|E

Now you take here just th' other day: I got a new top for my old boat and some upholstery, and I paid out a hundred and twenty-six fifty, and of course a lot of fellows would say that was too much--Lord, if the Old Folks--they live in one of these hick towns up-state and they simply can't get onto the way a city fellow's mind works, and then, of course, they're Jews, and they'd lie right down and die if they knew Sid had anted up a hundred and twenty-six bones. But I don't figure I was stuck, George, not a bit. Machine looks brand new now--not that it's so darned old, of course; had it less 'n three years, but I give it hard service; never drive less 'n a hundred miles on Sunday and, uh--Oh, I don't really <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> stuck, George.
