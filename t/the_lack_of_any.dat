5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> form of {{mass transit}} besides bus prior to 2008, the Phoenix Metropolitan Area has {{remained}} a very automobile-dependent city, with its first freeway opening in 1958—a year preceding most cities' first freeway openings. Coupled with the explosive growth {{of the region and}} adequate funding, the result is one of the nation's most expansive freeway networks.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{tried to}} learn {{the lessons of the}} First World War, and adopt them into its pre-war doctrine. In the 1920s, and much of the 1930s, the General Staff tried to {{establish}} a small, mechanised, professional army and formed the Experimental Mechanized Force but, with <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> identified threat, its main function reverted to garrison duties around the British Empire.|$|E

5|$|The Churches of Christ {{generally}} combine <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{historical evidence}} that the early church used musical instruments in worship {{and the belief that}} there is no scriptural support for using instruments in the church's worship service to decide that instruments should not be used today in worship. Churches of Christ have historically practiced a cappella music in worship services.|$|E
5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> reserves {{to the rear of the}} border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E
5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered his chances for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received {{less than one}} percent support. Following a last place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> invitation to presidential debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, the United Nations {{deployed}} {{field assessment}} teams {{to survey the}} damage caused by Katrina. The International Organization for Migration helped relocate affected families and construct at least 300 new residences for victims of Katrina and Hurricane Mitch the year prior. The Pan American Health Organization also deployed assessment teams to survey the area for the possibility of post-storm diseases. Due to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> significant damage, the name Katrina was not retired and was re-used in the 2005 season; however, due to the catastrophic damage caused by the storm, it was retired in 2006 and was replaced with the name Katia.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the same}} genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was {{inhabited}} by Velociraptor mongoliensis, Protoceratops andrewsi, and Pinacosaurus grangeri, while the Bayan Mandahu was home to Velociraptor osmolskae, Protoceratops hellenikorhinus, and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively {{close to each other}} geographically. However, given <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, {{it is more likely that}} those differences indicate a slight time difference.|$|E
50|$|The Council {{called again}} on {{both parties to}} take {{measures}} to identify {{those responsible for the}} shooting down of an UNOMIG helicopter in October 2001, and welcomed safeguards put in place since the downing of the helicopter. Both parties were also asked to dissociate themselves from military rhetoric and illegal armed groups. Additionally, it condemned the abduction and hostage-taking of four UNOMIG personnel-the sixth such incident-and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>any</b> suspects.|$|R

Alan Timothy's review focuses on <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> coverage <b>of</b> <b>any</b> downsides to the Semco way of working, and others have highlighted the gimmickry of making people work harder by providing rest hammocks, and attempting to beat recession through ultra-liberalism.|$|R
5|$|On 25 April, at {{the start}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) landed at what later became known as Anzac Cove. Included in the {{landings}} was the New Zealand and Australian Division, but the division had been forced to leave part of its strength, including the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, behind in Egypt. The commanders believed there would be no requirement or opportunities for mounted troops on the peninsula. However, heavy casualties, and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other reinforcements, forced them to reconsider the decision, and the mounted troops were later dispatched to Gallipoli to serve in a dismounted role.|$|E
5|$|Other {{peculiar}} calendars include ancient Greek calendars. These were nominally lunar, {{starting with}} the New Moon. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ton theoi, by the moon. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as games or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism {{may have been used}} as a politically neutral form of timekeeping. Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.|$|E
5|$|Our World {{producers}} selected each episode's subject {{time period}} {{with the help}} of consultants from the Smithsonian Institution and Columbia University. The show was limited in its choices by the available footage for the given time period. Ellerbee recalled a viewer-submitted proposal for an episode on the American Civil War, which could not be made because of the non-existence of archive footage from the 1860s and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> living eyewitnesses.|$|E

25|$|Lightning was {{released}} on October 2, 2012, and was promoted with an autumn tour, a giveaway, and a 2013 remix album. Although Lightning sold well enough to reach number 50 on the Billboard 200 among a few other US Billboard charts, it was met with a varied critical reception, holding an aggregate score of 59 out of 100 from Metacritic as of March 2014. Some reviewers criticized <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>any</b> new type <b>of</b> music, unlike Sidewalks, while other's thought the album was an improvement from the previous album.|$|R
5|$|The Air Ministry was unsympathetic to Coastal Command and <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{suitable}} {{place for}} aerodromes made improvements difficult to implement. OTU airfields required {{a number of}} features not available in all locations. The main requirement was a quiet area so that OTU flights would not interfere with stations that were already operational. To prevent losses to enemy air attacks, it was also necessary to keep OTUs {{as far away from}} enemy airspace as possible, while the sensitive airspace over convoy routes and near Scapa Flow were also inappropriate places to launch OTUs.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine territories, {{held back}} by their closed economies, <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> {{activity}} closely linked to foreign trade, and the scant amounts of labour and capital they consequently received, fell far behind those of {{other areas of the}} colonial world that participated in foreign trade. Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity, as occurred in Tucuman, where cloth was manufactured, and in Córdoba and the Litoral, where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{initially}} became {{established in}} Lower Silesia, Greater Poland, central Poland, and western Masovia and Lesser Poland, gradually replacing, moving eastbound, the Pomeranian {{culture and the}} Cloche Grave culture, coexisting with the older cultures for a while (in some cases well into the younger pre-Roman period, 200 to 0 BC) and assimilating in process some of their characteristics, for example the Cloche Grave funerary practice and ceramics. The Przeworsk people must have originated from the above two local cultures, because of <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other archeologically viable possibility, but in respect to their predecessors they represent a striking cultural discontinuity (different cremation rite and pottery).|$|E

[...] In both later cases, however, there is a distinct preference for ancohemitonia, as <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> adjacency <b>of</b> <b>any</b> two semitones goes a long way towards softening the increasing dissonance.|$|R
25|$|Xenoarchaeology, {{branch of}} xenology dealing with {{extraterrestrial}} cultures, is a hypothetical form of archaeology that exists mainly in works of science fiction.

50|$|According to Rezepkin, Central Europe {{must have}} been the {{homeland}} of the Indo-Europeans. Accordingly, Indo-Europeans were behind the successive Linear Pottery culture, the Funnelbeaker culture, the Globular Amphora culture, and the Corded Ware culture. In favor of this view is <b>the</b> apparent <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> abrupt change in European populations since the Neolithic, and until the first written sources appear.|$|R
5|$|The Sedan bridgeheads {{were still}} not safe. French forces were massing to the south. Guderian {{decided it was}} better to mount an {{aggressive}} defence given <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> suitable anti-tank weapons for a defensive battle. The better option would be to attack rather than defend. The advance of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had assisted his progress. They ran into and defeated elements of X Corps near Chemery. The French Corps was heading towards Sedan, but withdrew southward after the engagement. Any potential threat on the German western flank had been removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{speculates that}} Gregory had {{originally intended to}} send the British slave boys as missionaries, until in 596 he received news that Liudhard had died, thus opening the way for more serious missionary activity. Higham argues that it was <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> bishop in Britain which allowed Gregory to send Augustine, with orders to be consecrated as a bishop if needed. Another consideration was that cooperation would be more easily obtained from the Frankish royal courts if they no longer had their own bishop and agent in place.|$|E
5|$|A voltage {{applied to}} a human body causes an {{electric}} current through the tissues, and although the relationship is non-linear, the greater the voltage, the greater the current. The threshold for perception varies with the supply frequency and with {{the path of the}} current, but is about 0.1mA to 1mA for mains-frequency electricity, though a current as low as a microamp can be detected as an electrovibration effect under certain conditions. If the current is sufficiently high, it will cause muscle contraction, fibrillation of the heart, and tissue burns. <b>The</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> visible sign that a conductor is electrified makes electricity a particular hazard. The pain caused by an electric shock can be intense, leading electricity at times to be employed as a method of torture. Death caused by an electric shock is referred to as electrocution. Electrocution is still the means of judicial execution in some jurisdictions, though its use has become rarer in recent times.|$|E
