25|$|Under certain {{combinations}} of physical circumstances in the UK, scattered trees can occur {{across the surface}} of a bog in a relatively stable ecological relationship as open woodland, without the loss of bog species. <b>This</b> <b>true</b> Bog woodland is a much rarer condition than the progressive invasion of bogs by trees, through natural colonisation or afforestation following changes in the drainage pattern which leads eventually to the loss of the bog community. The habitat type has not previously been well described in the UK, and consequently knowledge of its ecological characteristics is limited.|$|E
25|$|Seed {{dormancy}} has {{two main}} functions: {{the first is}} synchronizing germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, herbivory) does not result {{in the death of}} all offspring of a plant (bet-hedging). Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination, normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. <b>This</b> <b>true</b> dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination. Thus dormancy is a state of the seed, not of the environment. Induced dormancy, enforced dormancy or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination, mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.|$|E

60|$|Now such an {{argument}} {{is not hard}} to follow; and if it is granted that its premisses are true in fact, no one will deny that the conclusion must also be true. But it depends for its truth upon an instance of a general logical principle. The logical principle is as follows: 'Suppose it known that if <b>this</b> is <b>true,</b> then that is true. Suppose it also known that <b>this</b> is <b>true,</b> then it follows that that is true.' When it is the case that if <b>this</b> is <b>true,</b> that is true, we shall say that this 'implies' that, and that that 'follows from' this. Thus our principle states that if this implies that, and <b>this</b> is <b>true,</b> then that is true. In other words, 'anything implied by a true proposition is true', or 'whatever follows from a true proposition is true'.|$|R

The traditional media, he notes, are close to the public sphere in <b>this</b> <b>true</b> sense. Nevertheless, limitations are imposed by the market and concentration of ownership. At present, the global media fail to constitute the basis of a public sphere for at least three reasons.

2500|$|By 1937, in {{tune with}} the National Christian Party regime, Cantacuzino had embraced eugenics, racism, and antisemitism. At a meeting in Cluj, she {{proposed}} the introduction of legislation banning all [...] "foreigners" [...] and minorities from marrying Romanian state employees, as well as 10-year reviews for all Romanian citizenship applications. Additionally, she and the GFR envisaged state bonuses for [...] "eugenic" [...] marriages between full-blooded Romanian youths. Meanwhile, her connections in the international feminist movement became alarmed by the growth of antisemitic violence. In a December 1933 letter to Cantacuzino, Cécile Brunschvicg inquired: [...] "there is talk of terrible antisemitic campaigns in Romania, and of the development of a Nazi spirit in your country.

2500|$|Francesco Maria Piave was to {{be engaged}} to write the new {{libretto}} {{and the two men}} tried {{to come up with a}} suitable subject, but the composer complained that his librettist [...] "had not yet offered him an 'original' or 'provocative' idea". Writing to Piave, he added that [...] "I don't want any of those everyday subjects that one can find by the hundreds." [...] But at the same time, the composer expressed concern about censorship in Venice, something with which he was very familiar after his dealings with the censors concerning Rigoletto. As the months dragged on into October, it was agreed that Piave would come to Sant'Agata and work with the composer. One subject was chosen, Piave set to work, and then Verdi threw in another idea, which may have been La traviata. However, within a short time, a synopsis was dispatched to Venice under the title of Amore e morte (Love and Death). However, as Budden reveals, Verdi writes to his friend De Sanctis telling him that [...] "for Venice I'm doing La Dame aux camélias which will probably be called La traviata. A subject for our own age." [...] Although still bogged down at Sant'Agata, Piave was sanguine: [...] "Everything will turn out fine, and we'll have a new masterpiece from <b>this</b> <b>true</b> wizard of modern harmonies".|$|E
