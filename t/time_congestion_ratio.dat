First, the real-time traffic congestion information is obtained from the online map of AutoNavi in a 15 -minute interval. Next, a new measuring index is introduced to describe the overall characterization of congestion patterns in each city based on online map data, which is named as the <b>congestion</b> <b>ratio.</b> The next analysis is the cluster analysis based on the temporal distribution of the <b>congestion</b> <b>ratio,</b> which helps to identify groups of the selected cities with similar traffic congestion states. These cities are categorized as four groups according to the severity of traffic congestion: severely congested, less severely congested, amble, and smooth cities. Lastly, multiple linear regression models are developed to identify the primary factors that affect the <b>congestion</b> <b>ratio.</b> The result shows that the influences of per capita road area, car ownership, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on the <b>congestion</b> <b>ratio</b> are significant. Sensitivity analyses are also implemented in order to reveal more effective policy measures in mitigating traffic congestion in urban areas...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study is to apply the multiserver loss queuing model recently developed by Peake and Pearce (that extends the classical Poisson model to general arrival time distributions) in deriving bounds on traffic service in the Modernised High Frequency Communication System (MHFCS) being built for the Australian Defence Force. The MHFCS is a four-node virtual high frequency (HF) network that interconnects land-based users with mobile land, sea and air platforms. The problem of maximal <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> is considered for this system, where general arrival-time distributions can be used to model different traffic classes, where individual voice call and data traffic iteminter-arrival times are identically and independently distributed. The service facility (viz Network Management Node) consists of a fixed number of homogeneous servers (channels) in parallel, each characterized by independent exponential service times. An arrival finding no server available is lost. The <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> is the equilibrium proportion of the time that all the servers are busy. Of additional interest are the associated optimisation problems of finding the arrival time distribution functions that maximise and minimise the <b>time</b> <b>congestion,</b> and the corresponding minimal and maximal congestion values. 1.

40|$|Abstract — The Engset {{model has}} been {{extensively}} studied and widely used for blocking probability evaluation in telecom-munications networks. In 1957, J. W. Cohen considered two generalizations of the Engset model: 1) Permitting the distributions of the holding time and inter-arrival time to differ from source to source; 2) Permitting the idle time distribution to depend {{on whether or not}} the previous call was successful. He derived the call and <b>time</b> <b>congestions</b> for the first general-ization, however, he simply posed the second generalization as a problem. In a leading teletraffic text by Syski, the call and <b>time</b> <b>congestions</b> are approximated for the second generalization, though it appears that Syski has overlooked that his results are in fact an approximation. In this paper, we point out Syski’s apparent oversight, we improve the accuracy of his approximation, and we provide an efficient algorithm for its numerical computation and prove its convergence.

40|$|Abstract — We design network topologies and routing {{strategies}} which optimize several measures simultaneously: low cost, small routing diameter, bounded {{degree and}} low congestion. This set of design issues is broader than traditional network design and hence, {{our work is}} useful and relevant {{to a set of}} traditional and emerging design problems. Surprisingly, a simple idea from the research on small-world models, inspires a fruitful approach and useful techniques here. Starting with a simple model we consider adding long links to an n×n grid graph. Ideally, for a given budget to buy additional long links, we consider mechanisms for choosing links such that the routing diameter is small enough (poly-log of n) while the <b>congestion</b> <b>ratio</b> (between the most used link and the average one) is minimized, assuming uniform traffic between any two of the n 2 nodes. We show that by adding O(1) long links to each node we achieve an almost logarithmic routing diameter and maintain a near optimal trade-off between <b>congestion</b> <b>ratio</b> and average weight (of long links) : W eight×CongestionRatio = O(n). Our results are comparable to the best similar network structures when the trade-off space we consider is reduced to those in the compared designs (with fewer trade-off factors). We also consider extensions of our results to more general settings. We propose two construction schemes: 1) a static (fixed link) design and 2) a dynamic (random link) design. While the former provides our best trade-off results, the later is more scalable, better suited for dynamic and fault-tolerance issues, and can be useful for wireless ad-hoc networks. I...|$|R

Network congestion is primarily caused by many users accessing the Internet at the same time (after school/work, 5pm-10pm) and not by heavy users alone.

40|$|In this lesson, {{we learn}} about models used for {{circuit-switched}} networks. We start with an M/M/m/ m model, also called the m-server loss system [1]. We note here that [2], page 379 states that a system with a finite customer population will always be stable, no matter what value of ρ. This statement is made for any finite state space MC. Does this explain why in M/M/m/m model we often talk about ρ being 1, 10, 100 - see [3], pg. 235. Unlike in the M/M/m case, here ρ or offered load is defined to be λ ⁄ µ. In the M/M/m case, recall, we defined ρ to be λ ⁄ (mµ). In Section 1, we derive the Erlang-B formula for an infinite population. In Section 2, we derive the simple <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> or blocking probability for a finite population model, called the Engset for-mula. In Section 3, we show the difference between call congestion or call loss probability and <b>time</b> <b>congestion.</b> For these two sections, refer to [6], page 518 - 521. Both [4] and [6] refer to [5] for the dif-ference between <b>time</b> <b>congestion</b> and call congestion. Section 4 describes the recursion formulation for numerically computing the Engset call loss probabilities from [4]. Section 5 derives the Blocked Call Queueing (BCQ) equations. Only the system in Section 1 is characterized using the queueing theory notation. In Sections 2 - 5, we are modeling {{a system in which}} the number of sources is limited. There is no place to indicate the number of sources from which jobs arrive in the Kendall notation. The last two numbers are for num-ber of servers, and number of jobs in the system. Thus the BCQ derivation for mean waiting delay is different from the mean delay derivations for M/M/ 1, M/M/m type queues that we learned in an ear-lier lesson. This lesson is entirely on the single-link case and is hence more about TDM/FDM sharing on a single link rather than circuit-switched networks...|$|R

40|$|There are {{constraints}} on pricing congestible facilities. First, if heterogeneous users are observationally indistinguishable, then congestion charges must be anonymous.

If, however, the <b>time</b> variation of <b>congestion</b> charges is constrained, optimal pricing with anonymous congestion charges entails Ramsey pricing. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} the potentially negative impacts of an increasing deployment of non-congestion-controlled besteffort {{traffic on the}} Internet. 1 These negative impacts range from extreme unfairness against competing TCP traffic to the potential for congestion collapse. To promote the inclusion of end-to-end congestion control {{in the design of}} future protocols using besteffort traffic, we argue that router mechanisms are needed to identify and restrict the bandwidth of selected high-bandwidth best-effort flows in <b>times</b> of <b>congestion.</b> The paper discusses several general approaches for identifying those flows suitable for bandwidth regulation. These approaches are to identify a highbandwidth flow in <b>times</b> of <b>congestion</b> as unresponsive, “not TCPfriendly,” or simply using disproportionate bandwidth. A flow that is not “TCP-friendly ” is one whose long-term arrival rate exceeds that of any conformant TCP in the same circumstances. An unresponsive flow is one failing to reduce its offered load at a router in response to an increased packet drop rate, and a disproportionate-bandwidth flow is one that uses considerably more bandwidth than other flows in a <b>time</b> of <b>congestion.</b> I...|$|R
