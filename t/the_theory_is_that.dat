25|$|Another {{factor that}} {{contributes}} to the immigration question is Canada's low birth rate (see List of countries by birth rate). <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> new residents can assist in meeting future government obligations relating to pay-as-you-go liabilities.|$|E
25|$|Peer review records, {{and other}} {{hospital}} documents of quality control committee meetings {{are generally not}} subject to subpoena duces tecum, since these have statutory immunity. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the frankness of peer review would be chilled if these records could be routinely compelled.|$|E
25|$|Pullapilly has {{suggested}} that the Nairs may share a common heritage with the Ezhava caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.|$|E

25|$|Each MC firm {{independently}} {{sets the}} terms of exchange for its product. The firm gives no consideration to what effect its decision may have on competitors. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> any action will have such a negligible effect on the overall market demand that an MC firm can act without fear of prompting heightened competition. In other words, each firm feels free to set prices {{as if it were}} a monopoly rather than an oligopoly.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{retirement}} involves retiring allowances from emission trading schemes as {{a method}} for offsetting carbon emissions. Under schemes such as the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, EU Emission Allowances (EUAs), which represent the right to release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, are issued to all the largest polluters. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> by buying these allowances and permanently removing them, the price of EUAs increases and provides an incentive for industrial companies to reduce their emissions.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{motivation}} of <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> projective modules (at least over certain commutative rings) are analogues of vector bundles.

50|$|Lord Ripon's Hunter Commission of 1882 {{somewhat}} belatedly advocated <b>that</b> {{there should}} <b>be</b> increased provision {{of education at}} primary level and for women. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there would <b>be</b> a subsequent rise in the calibre of applicants for third level entry.|$|R
50|$|This {{provision}} {{was used to}} justify the banning of opposition parties, as well as harsh measures against opposition of any sort. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> since <b>the</b> CPSU was {{the vanguard of the}} state, its right to rule could not be legitimately questioned.|$|R
25|$|A {{majority}} of state courts, {{including those of}} Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Wisconsin, have ruled that the finder of treasure trove is entitled to it. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the English monarch's claim to treasure trove {{was based on a}} statutory enactment which replaced the finder's original right. When this statute was not re-enacted in the United States after its independence, the right to treasure trove reverted to the finder.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen: There {{have been}} anecdotal reports from those {{with easy access}} to a {{breathing}} oxygen supply– medical staff, and military pilots— that oxygen can also reduce the symptoms of hangovers sometimes caused by alcohol consumption. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the increased oxygen flow resulting from oxygen therapy improves the metabolic rate, and thus increases {{the speed at which}} toxins are broken down. However, one source states that (in an aviation context) oxygen has no effect on physical impairment caused by hangover.|$|E
25|$|Central to <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Akhenaten {{was being}} driven {{to produce a}} male heir which results in {{attempts}} to father his own grandchildren. If the grandchildren are not his or are indeed fictitious, with no progression through his daughters to arrive at Neferneferuaten-tasherit, his choice of her as coregent at least remains a mystery, if not less likely. Without grandchildren, there is less to support the older age estimates. Her age alone need not disqualify her since is the same age at which Tutankhaten ascended the throne, but a 10-year-old girl seems unlikely to many.|$|E

50|$|One {{immediate}} {{objection to}} <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> total insolation during a year does not vary at {{all during the}} precessional cycle, only its seasonal distribution.

25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the extreme offer makes the other party reevaluate their own opening offer and move close to the {{resistance}} point (as far as {{you are willing to}} go to reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible when they make concessions toward a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party may think negotiating is a waste of time.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem with}} <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the astronomical cycles {{have been in}} {{existence}} for billions of years, but glaciation is a rare occurrence. Astronomical cycles correlate perfectly with glacial and interglacial periods, and their transitions, inside an ice age. Other {{factors such as the}} position of continents and the effects this has on Earth's oceanic currents, or long-term fluctuations inside the core of the Sun that caused Earth's temperature to drop below a critical threshold and thus initiate the ice age in the first place must also be involved. Once that occurs, Milankovitch cycles could act to force the planet in and out of glacial periods.|$|E
25|$|The Archeological-Mining of the Sierra Gorda Project {{was begun}} in the 1970s, based on an earlier {{interdisciplinary}} study carried out at the Sierra de Querétaro. The project {{was supported by the}} federal and state governments as well as UNAM. The project further mapped the cities of Las Ranas and Toluqillo. Further studies in the 1980s consolidated earlier findings and worked out settlement patterns in the wider area. Continued work at that time classified the ancient cultures and register more than 500 sites, encompassing all of northern Querétaro and into San Luis Potosí. The effect of mercury poisoning is not only an ancient problem but a modern one as well.

Currently, <b>the</b> most accepted <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name has Celtic roots, from the root red that originated the name redis (or reddis), that would approximately mean place in the way / place in the roads, or said alternatively, an inhabited place in a cross-road.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, Latin America {{had several}} urban guerrilla {{movements}} whose {{strategy was to}} destabilize regimes and provoke a counter-reaction by <b>the</b> military. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a harsh military regime would oppress the middle classes who would then support the guerrillas and create a popular uprising.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the theories that people connected to the revisionist movement are the perpetrators of murder {{and that it was}} an intended sexual attack by two Arabs there are theories connecting it to the Soviet and Nazi regimes. One involves the Nazi leader Joseph Goebbels: During the first world war, Magda Behrend, who later became the wife of Joseph Goebbels, met and became close friends with Lisa Arlosoroff, Haim Arlosoroff's sister. The nature of her relationship with Haim Arlosoroff is unknown. Magda married Goebbels on 19 December 1931, with Adolf Hitler as a witness. A year and a half later, Arlosoroff went to Germany to negotiate the Ha'avarah (transfer) agreement with high Nazi officials. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with Haim Arlosoroff's personal involvement in the negotiations, Goebbels took notice of his wife's former Jewish friend and sought to erase what might have been an embarrassment for the Goebbelses. Magda's former Jewish stepfather, Richard Friedländer, was arrested on Goebbels orders and died in the concentration camp in 1938. The Soviet connection was promoted by Shmuel Dothan in 1991 to counter what the Soviet considered as a global military plot against them.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory is}} that these {{problems}} are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, <b>the</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, {{but they do not}} have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries {{may not be able to}} or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as it would be hard for the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Section 1983 was {{of limited}} {{use for a}} state {{prisoner}} under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 {{as a vehicle for}} challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> poorly {{achieving}} {{students would}} perform better if not segregated, but rather immersed in an equal learning environment.

30|$|The {{creation}} of a full-blown market for higher education with its own regulator—the Office for Students—heralded by the recent Higher Education and Research Act, is now nearly complete. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> competition amongst <b>the</b> hundred or more existing universities, and a raft of new commercial providers, would hone the system to perfection.

50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>theories</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name of {{the village}} comes from the {{specific}} stones - liska (лиска) - which could only be found in this area.

The Bulgarian word dol is translated in English as small valley. There are two ways of writing the village's name - Leskov dol or Leskovdol, although nowadays many people have adopted the merged version. Also on most of the maps and in official documents the name is written Leskovdol.|$|R
500|$|Skeat derived {{the name}} Ely {{from what he}} called [...] "O Northumbrian" [...] ēlġē, meaning [...] "district of eels".

500|$|Scientists study photon {{diffusion}} damping (and CMB anisotropies in general) {{because of}} the insight the subject provides into the question, [...] "How did the universe come to be?". Specifically, primordial anisotropies in the temperature and density of the universe {{are supposed to be}} the causes of later large-scale structure formation. Thus it was the amplification of small perturbations in the pre-recombination universe that grew into the galaxies and galaxy clusters of the present era. Diffusion damping made the universe isotropic within distances on the order of the Silk Scale. That this scale corresponds to the size of observed galaxies (when the passage of time is taken into account) implies that diffusion damping is responsible for limiting the size of these galaxies. <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> clumps of matter in the early universe became the galaxies that we see today, and the size of these galaxies is related to the temperature and density of the clumps.|$|E
500|$|A {{specialized}} type of [...] {{located on}} the distal part of inner [...] of [...] {{on the wings of}} most flighted birds. Friction barbules support lobe-shaped ("lobular") [...] that are broader than the typical barbicel hosted by other vaned feathers, and which in turn support more [...] <b>The</b> <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the augmented surface area and other adaptations significantly increases grip through friction when the outer web of barbs of one primary feather come into contact and rub against the inner web of barbs of another primary feather it overlays, thereby preventing slippage during the rigors of flight. Friction barbules are found only on those parts of primary feathers that are in [...] "zones of overlap" [...] with neighboring primaries. The theory (and the use of [...] "friction" [...] in the title of the defined phrase) has been criticized. In Avian Flight (2005), the author notes that [...] "most birds open and close their wings during every wing beat cycle", and proposes that the energetic cost to overcome friction during the [...] "wing extension and flexion" [...] of each beat cycle would be prohibitive. Offered instead is the theory that the function of these specialized barbules is to lock the primary feathers together on the wings' downstroke, during which high pressure from below the wings' surface would otherwise tend to cause the feathers to spread.|$|E
