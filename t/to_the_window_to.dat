25|$|Ireland, angered {{that he had}} {{received}} no publicity even after three murders, killed again within three days. He met and courted 33-year-old Andrew Collier, a housing warden, and the pair went to Collier's home in Dalston. After entering the flat there was a disturbance outside and both men went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> investigate. Ireland gripped a horizontal metal bar that ran across the window. He later forgot to wipe the bar for fingerprints during his usual cleanup phase. The police found these prints.|$|E
25|$|In the end, {{the pair}} condemn Croker to jump. When A goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> inspect Croker, however, he is {{surprised}} by something inexplicable that causes him {{to remove his}} handkerchief and bring it timidly to the would-be jumper’s face. Although critics Ackerley and Gontarski assert that A’s discovery is an “enigmatic smile” on Croker’s face, Beckett {{makes no mention of}} this in the ending, leaving it open to various interpretations such as Croker may be crying (justifying the handkerchief), smiling, was dead prior to A and B’s arrival or else died during the process.|$|E
2500|$|Bader {{escaped from}} the {{hospital}} where he was recovering by tying together a number of sheets. Initially the [...] "rope" [...] did not reach the ground; {{with the help of}} another patient, he slid the sheet from under the comatose New Zealand pilot, Bill Russell of No. 485 Squadron, who had had his arm amputated the day before. Russell's bed was then moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>to</b> act as an anchor. A French maid at the St. Omer hospital attempted {{to get in touch with}} British agents to enable Douglas to escape back to Britain. She later brought a letter from a peasant couple (a Mr. and Mrs. Hiecques), who promised to shelter him outside St. Omer until he could be passed further down the line. Until then, their son would wait outside the hospital every night until there was a chance of escape. Eventually, he escaped out of a window. The plan worked initially. Bader completed the long walk to the safe house despite wearing a British uniform. Unfortunately for him, the plan was betrayed by another woman at the hospital. He hid in the garden when a German staff car arrived at the house, but was found later. Bader denied that the couple had known he was there. They, along with the French woman at the hospital, were sent for forced labour in Germany. The couple survived. After the war, French authorities sentenced the woman informer to 20 years in prison.|$|E

6000|$|Suddenly he saw lights {{appear at}} {{five or six}} points in the distance, and, putting his head out, {{he thought he could}} hear distant cries and shouts.
