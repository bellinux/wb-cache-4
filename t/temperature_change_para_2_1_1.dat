40|$|Monitoring {{systems can}} already {{be found in}} common applications, from {{automotive}} to aeronautics or biomedical. However, the application of these monitoring systems {{has not yet been}} a very easy task, especially, at the sensor application step. A smart structure with sensing capabilities would allow to overcome the existing issues in the installation of sensor networks. As the size of this type of systems and the market requirements are significant, an industrial manufacturing process needed to be considered. An integrated solution based in Fiber Bragg Grating sensors embedded in PVC laminates was manufactured by industrial spread-coating process. The resultant structure is a temperature and strain sensitive foil that was characterized in terms of surface structure, optical response and overall performance. The integrated solution behavior had a slope of 0. 8 pm by microstrain with a measurement range of 1. 2 mm when the fiber was straight in the foil. Different fiber layouts were also tested and defined the minimum curve radius in 10 mm. The foil also presented a dimensional stability above 99 %, ensuring the capability to sustain molding process. A mechanical analysis to evaluate the elongation capabilities and optical response was conducted. Three samples with different sensor positioning were subjected to the test. In the end, a sample, with the sensor in a 45 Ã Â° angle regarding the displacement axis, achieved the best compromise between maximum elongation range (25 %) and optical response linearity. For the temperature response, a wavelength deviation of 1. 7 nm was obtained for a 100 ºC <b>temperature</b> <b>change.</b> Fundação <b>para</b> a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT...|$|R

40|$|Most {{bacterial}} chromosomes contain homologs of plasmid partitioning (par) loci. These loci encode ATPases called ParA {{that are}} thought {{to contribute to the}} mechanical force required for chromosome and plasmid segregation. In Vibrio cholerae, the chromosome II (chrII) par locus is essential for chrII segregation. Here, we found that purified <b>ParA</b> <b>2</b> had ATPase activities comparable to other ParA homologs, but, unlike many other ParA homologs, did not form high molecular weight complexes in the presence of ATP alone. Instead, formation of high molecular weight <b>ParA</b> <b>2</b> polymers required DNA. Electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction revealed that <b>ParA</b> <b>2</b> formed bipolar helical filaments on double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner. These filaments had a distinct change in pitch when <b>ParA</b> <b>2</b> was polymerized in the presence of ATP versus {{in the absence of a}} nucleotide cofactor. Fitting a crystal structure of a ParA protein into our filament reconstruction showed how a dimer of <b>ParA</b> <b>2</b> binds the DNA. The filaments formed with ATP are left-handed, but surprisingly these filaments exert no topological changes on the right-handed B-DNA to which they are bound. The stoichiometry of binding is one dimer for every eight base pairs, and this determines the geometry of the <b>ParA</b> <b>2</b> filaments with 4. 4 dimers per 120  Å pitch left-handed turn. Our findings will be critical for understanding how ParA proteins function in plasmid and chromosome segregation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{studies have}} shown that high {{temperatures}} or heat waves were associated with mortality and morbidity. However, few studies have examined whether <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> between neighboring days have any significant impact on human health. Method: A distributed lag non-linear model was employed to investigate the effect of <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> on mortality in summer during 2006 – 2010 in two subtropical Chinese cities. The <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> was defined as the difference of the current day’s and the previous day’s mean temperature. Results: We found non-linear effects of <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> between neighboring days in summer on mortality in both cities. Temperature increase was associated with increased mortality from non-accidental diseases and cardiovascular diseases, while temperature decrease had a protective effect on non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality in both cities. Significant association between <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> and respiratory mortality was only found in Guangzhou. Conclusion: This study suggests that <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> between neighboring days might be an alternative temperature indicator for studying temperature-mortality relationship...|$|R

40|$|Background Aim. In case of {{high-dose}} acetaminophen intake, {{the active}} metabolite can not bind to the glutathione, thereby inducing cellular necrosis through binding to the cytosol proteins. This trial {{was performed to}} histologically and biochemically investigate whether leptin was protective against liver damage induced by paracetamol at toxic doses. Material and Method. In our trial, 30 female rats, divided into 5 groups, were used. IP leptin administration was performed after {{an hour in the}} group of rats, in which paracetamol poisoning was induced. The groups were as follows: Group 1 : the control group, Group 2 : 20 [*]µg/kg leptin, Group 3 : 2 [*]g/kg paracetamol, Group 4 : 2 [*]g/kg paracetamol + 10 [*]µg/kg leptin, and Group 5 : 2 [*]g/kg paracetamol + 20 [*]µg/kg leptin. Results. The most significant increase was observed in the <b>PARA</b> <b>2</b> [*]g/kg group, while the best improvement among the treatment groups occurred in the <b>PARA</b> <b>2</b> [*]g/kg + LEP 10 [*]µg/kg group (p < 0. 05).

30|$|Hayashi et al. (2009) {{reported}} that the <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> of the fluid mud under vent C (Figure  2) is unrelated to atmospheric <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> and that periodic <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> of {{a few days to}} several weeks were also observed. From these observations, Hayashi et al. (2009) suggested that the <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> may be caused by a change of flux and path of subsurface fluid flow. Since the <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> of fluid mud reflects water flow, as shown by Deville and Guerlais (2009), and although there are cases where the <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> are not seen (e.g., Rudolph and Manga 2010), it is suspected that fluid mud flow can occur even during a quiescence period. Therefore, we suggest that overpressure due to fluid mud flow acts on the shallow soft clay layer and that its change deforms the surface. Since low-resistivity areas imply that fluid mud exists at depths in this area, as shown in Suzuki et al. (2009), we will need to extend the observation area in order to detect the signal caused by whole fluid flow.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this study, we use net {{ecosystem}} productivity (NEP) measurement data {{across several}} forest sites {{and a simple}} conceptual model to investigate the linkage between temperature and NEP by considering either <b>temperature</b> <b>change</b> {{in the recent past}} or current mean annual temperature (MAT) as a forcing. After removing the effect of stand age, forest NEP is only weakly correlated with MAT. However, <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> during the period of 1980 - 2002 do explain a very significant fraction of the current spatial patterns of NEP, although the response of the terrestrial carbon balance to <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> varies with season. <b>Changes</b> in spring <b>temperature</b> having the highest correlation with annual NEP. We also show that <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> before the 1970 s had a limited influence on the current NEP, and that the impact of recent <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> within the last decade on NEP are not strong enough to be observable. Overall, our analysis indicates not only that <b>temperature</b> <b>changes</b> in the recent past is one of the important drivers of today's forest carbon balance in the Northern Hemisphere, but also that the ongoing global warming will contribute significantly to the near-future evolution of the Northern Hemisphere carbon sink.
