5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka. Its western subspecies D.u.urbicum winters in tropical Africa, and eastern D.u.lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia. The Asian house martin breeds further south than common house martin in <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> central and eastern Asia; its nominate subspecies winters in Southeast Asia, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may just move from the high mountains to lower altitudes. The Nepal house martin is resident in <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|P. c. griseus occurs from southwestern British Columbia and Vancouver Island south through central Washington {{and central}} Oregon to <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> north-central and northeastern California. It was {{described}} by Robert Ridgway in 1899.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} {{developed}} {{very close to}} shore, it only briefly traveled west-northwest before making landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico early on June 29 as a weak tropical storm. It continued inland, producing heavy rain over the state of Veracruz until dissipating over <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> San Luis Potosí late on June 29. Hundreds of homes were damaged, and several towns, including Naranjos and Chinampa, about 60miles (95km) south of Tampico, were severely flooded, but the only reported fatalities were the two occupants of a car that was swept away by floodwaters in Naranjos.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around September10, heavy {{rainfall}} occurred sporadically in southern Mexico and into Central America, {{influenced by a}} broader storm system related to Hurricane Floyd. Toward the end of September, {{heavy rainfall}} occurred in <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> northeastern Mexico, which prompted officials to open flood gates. The rains occurred throughout Mexico {{for about two weeks}} before the worst of the precipitation began, and saturated soils before the heaviest rainfall in October.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species were found in <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands {{may have been due}} to climate change or human activity.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s the Pennsylvania Turnpike was {{designed}} to improve automobile transportation across <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> Pennsylvania, using seven tunnels built for the abandoned South Pennsylvania Railroad in the 1880s. The road opened on October 1, 1940 between Irwin and Carlisle as the first long-distance limited-access highway in the United States, leading {{to the construction of}} other limited-access toll roads and the Interstate Highway System.|$|E
5|$|Granite {{intrusions}} {{are found}} in the parish of Barvas in west Lewis, and another forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively. The sandstone at Broad Bay was once thought to be Torridonian or Old Red Sandstone.|$|E
