5|$|On 8 January 2010, CBC News Network's The Fifth Estate {{broadcast}} {{a documentary about}} the case titled Out of Control. In the documentary, reporter Hana Gartner describes Smith as a fourteen-year-old placed in a youth facility for one month in 2003 after throwing crabapples at <b>the</b> <b>mailman.</b> Smith was placed in solitary confinement after disruptive behaviour on her first day. Her initial one-month sentence would last almost four years, entirely in isolation, until her death in 2007. Often violent and unpredictable, her behaviours and the force required to intervene were always filmed and recorded, then listed on daily logs. Behaviour that Smith exhibited included many attempts at choking herself into unconsciousness; guards responding were often attacked by Smith, sometimes with weapons she had manufactured and concealed.|$|E

2500|$|Gags in {{the strips}} {{commonly}} deal with Garfield's obesity (in one strip, Jon jokes, [...] "I wouldn't say Garfield is fat, {{but the last}} time he got on a Ferris wheel, the two guys on top starved to death"), and his disdain of any form of exertion or work. He is known for saying [...] "breathing is exercise". In addition to being portrayed as lazy and fat, Garfield is also pessimistic, narcissistic, sadistic, cynical, sarcastic, sardonic, negative and smug. He enjoys destroying things, mauling <b>the</b> <b>mailman,</b> tormenting Odie, and kicking Odie off the table; he also makes snide comments, usually about Jon's inability to get a date (in one strip, when Jon bemoans the fact that no one will go out with him on New Year's Eve, Garfield replies, [...] "Don't feel bad Jon. They wouldn't go out with you even if it weren't New Year's").|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{injuring}} {{his foot}} in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat, Pippen helped the Bulls to an 84–82 victory over the Utah Jazz in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. One {{of the highlights of}} the game was when Karl Malone was fouled by Dennis Rodman with 9.2 seconds left and had a chance to give Utah the lead and Scottie famously psyched him out by saying: [...] "Just remember, <b>the</b> <b>mailman</b> doesn't deliver on Sundays, Karl", before he stepped up to the line. He missed both free throws. Jordan got the rebound and quickly called a time-out with 7.5 seconds left. With the game on the line, the Bulls put the ball in Jordan's hands. He dribbled out most of the waning seconds, then launched a 20-footer that went in at the buzzer to give Chicago a 1–0 series lead. In Game 3 of the series, Pippen tied a then finals record of seven 3-pointers, they still lost 104–93. [...] Perhaps the most iconic moment of the series happened in Game 5, which is also known as [...] "The Flu Game". Jordan was battling illness but still managed to dominate the game as the Bulls won 90–88, and with only a few seconds remaining and the game's result safely in Chicago's favor, Jordan collapsed into Pippen's arms, creating an iconic image that has come to symbolize [...] "The Flu Game". During Game 6, Pippen made one of the greatest plays of his career. Trailing by two, the Jazz looked for a final shot to stay alive, but Pippen knocked away Bryon Russell's inbounds pass intended for Shandon Anderson and rolled the ball over to Toni Kukoč, who dunked the final 2 points of the game to give the Bulls a 90–86 lead, clinching their fifth championship. Afterwards, Jordan was named Finals MVP for the fifth time.|$|E
