5|$|As a builder, Hugh {{built the}} New Bridge, now Elvet Bridge, in Durham, the second stone {{bridge in the}} town. Hugh also oversaw work on Durham Cathedral, decorating the inside with marble, {{installing}} stained glass windows, putting in a shrine for the bones of Bede, and building the Galilee Chapel on {{the west end of}} the cathedral. Originally, Puiset had planned <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Lady Chapel {{on the east side of}} the cathedral, but the ground was unsuitable, and instead work began on the Galilee Chapel on the west side of the cathedral. The Galilee Chapel is unusual in that it has five aisles, and quatrefoil, or four lobed, piers. A model for the chapel may have been the work being done on York Minster in rebuilding the choir. The current Norman doorway and the gallery that is above the doorway in Durham Castle were also the work of Hugh, which was part of a hall built in the bailey of the castle. Along with the king of Scots, he built the first bridge over the River Tweed at Berwick. He also rebuilt Norham Castle, replacing the previous buildings built by Ranulf Flambard, an earlier bishop, with a stone castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Copeland {{initially}} made $210 {{per week}} {{while working for}} WWF without an official contract. The company also paid for his outstanding college debt, which was around $40,000. After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour {{in the summer of}} 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary, where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket and landed with no money or place to stay. He called Johnny Smith, whom he would met twice, and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter. Smith also drove Copeland to and from the gym and Hart's house, where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock, Test, Mark Henry and Kurrgan. Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart's house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed enough <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good word for both men at the WWF.|$|E
25|$|McLaren {{brought in}} both Hamilton and Heikki Kovalainen for their second stops, and Timo Glock also pitted. The Safety Car was not deemed {{necessary}} to clear Webber's car, giving Jenson Button, {{who had been}} following Kovalainen, the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of fast laps before his pit stop. With Barrichello running in seventh after a small problem at his second pit stop, Button {{had an opportunity to}} stay ahead of his teammate and extend his Championship lead. He pitted on lap 51, emerging in a net fifth position behind the impressively recovering Vettel and ahead of Barrichello.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} before the tournament started, Australia were in further turmoil, when leading bowler Shane Warne was sent home after failing a drugs test, and a {{replacement}} could not be flown in until after the first match. With Bevan and Lehmann still sidelined, Australia went into their opening match with little choice over their line-up, and Symonds having to play. However, Symonds repaid Ponting's faith with an unbeaten 140 after Australia lost three quick wickets to be in early trouble. Australia beat Pakistan, and gained further momentum by defeating India by nine wickets in less than half their allotted overs in the next match. Symonds continued <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of match-winning performances and continued to be strongly backed by Ponting from then on. Ponting himself performed solidly with 53 against Pakistan and 24 not out, hitting the winning runs to guide Australia home.|$|E
25|$|The task of {{clearing}} lanes through the minefields went according to plan, though delayed by {{the scale of}} the minefields and the presence of pockets of enemy resistance that had not been cleared out by the attacking infantry. The southern corridor was under enemy artillery and small-arms fire, and when a truck was set on fire the illumination meant that the sappers were exposed to even more accurate fire. However, the gap was cleared by 06.30 on 24 October, and 10th Armoured passed through. Progress was slower in the northern corridor and 51st (Highland) Division had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fresh attack with massed artillery support at 15.00, after which the sappers were able to clear the way for 1st Armoured to deploy during the second night. The regimental history attributes the relatively light casualties among the mine clearance parties, despite the firefights going on around them, 'to the excellence of the mine-lifting drill and the accuracy with which it was carried out'. By 4 November the German and Italian troops were in full retreat across the desert.|$|E
25|$|As a result, the Allied commanders {{were forced}} to pursue more direct means of taking Mubo, and {{consequently}} the 17th Brigade was forced <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> further assault on Mubo. For the attack, the 2/6th Infantry Battalion pushed forward from Wau, and provided two companies– 'A' and 'B'– to the initial phase, attacking Observation Hill along with the 2/5th Infantry Battalion's 'C' Company. Commencing on 7 July, the attack on Observation Hill was followed up by actions around several other features, including the Pimple and Green Hill, and by 12 July the Japanese {{were forced to}} withdraw from the area. This allowed the town of Mubo to be secured. In order to cut off the retreating Japanese, a company of Australians from the 2/6th was dispatched to join up with a US force in an effort to establish a blocking position; arriving on the night of 12/13 July, they arrived too late, and consequently the Japanese were able to move back to Mount Tambu, where they established themselves in strong entrenchments. Early in the final phase, the Japanese divisional commander, Nakano, had determined to concentrate his forces in the Komiatum area– an area of high ground to the south of Salamaua– and he had subsequently passed the order for the withdrawal of his troops around Mubo on 10 July.|$|E
60|$|After {{a slight}} contest the skipper gave way, and the mate, after an {{elaborate}} toilette, went on deck {{and began to}} make himself agreeable, while his chief skulked below trying to muster up courage <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> appearance.|$|R

500|$|Having earned {{eight points}} during the 2006 World Cup {{qualification}} games, Burgmeier said the {{target in the}} 2010 campaign was to pick up [...] "as many points as possible", adding, [...] "For us, the target is not to qualify but to just take each game as it comes, enjoy the matches, and try and {{do as well as}} possible." [...] He won his 50thcap in a 4–0 friendly defeat to Slovakia on 19 November 2008. Burgmeier has scored seven goals and picked up a number of opposition shirts which he plans <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hall of fame.|$|E
500|$|Candice Barnes from The Sydney Morning Herald {{gave the}} show {{positive}} review, saying that Gaga [...] "delivered a show {{fit for a}} queen" [...] at Perth Arena. [...] "Plugged as an 'art rave', {{it was hard to}} distinguish where the art finished and the music began", she concluded. Conversely, Ross McCrae from The West Australian panned the show calling it [...] "middle of the road arena rock show", and noticed the public's lack of interest in the performances. The lack of ticket sales was also noted by a reviewer for News.com.au, who went on to add that [...] "one could never accuse Lady Gaga of lacking attention to detail in her live productions or failing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wholehearted and energetic performance." [...] Jenny Valentish from Time Out awarded the show in Melbourne five stars, calling Gaga [...] "a phenomenal singer with an immense voice (...) who could try her hand at any genre", also praising her live band and the costume changes.|$|E
500|$|James {{noted that}} Stengel {{was not only}} the most {{successful}} manager of the 1950s, he was the most dominant manager of any single decade in baseball history. Stengel used his entire squad as Yankee manager, in contrast to other teams when he began his tenure, on which substitutes tended to get little playing time. Stengel's use of platooning meant more players saw more use, and he was generally more prone <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pinch hitter or replace his pitcher than other managers. Although only once in Stengel's time (1954) did the Yankees lead the league in number of pinch hitters, Stengel was known for using them in odd situations, once pinch-hitting for Moose Skowron in the first inning after a change of pitcher. Additionally, according to James, Stengel [...] "rotated lineups with mad abandon, using perhaps 70 to 100 different lineups in a 154 game season". Although Stengel was not the first Yankee manager to use a regular relief pitcher—Harris had seen success with Joe Page in 1947—his adoption of the concept did much to promote it.|$|E

50|$|The show {{is based}} on the concept of housing {{programmes}} such as Location, Location, Location. The idea is {{to try to find a}} house for the participants and allow them to test it out before deciding if they want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> offer for the house.|$|R
500|$|The son of Bill and Gail Hughes, {{older brother}} to Clint and Brett, Hughes worked {{with his father}} as a roofer in his home-town of Smethwick before turning professional. In 1999, Sharlene Gillies claimed that she and Hughes had a child together. DNA tests later proved {{that he was not}} the father, though by this time his {{engagement}} to lap dancer Donna Nisbet was called off. Hughes stated that [...] "I don't think Donna was particularly happy with all the limelight that comes with football", though insisted that barracking from opposition fans only made him more determined <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good performance on the pitch. Hughes and Jason Roberts were questioned by police over allegations that they assaulted a man outside a pub in Brierley Hill; the case was dropped in September 2000. It was reported that he had converted to Islam during his time in prison, due in part to his friendship with Muslim prisoners and the fact that abuse of alcohol had helped to bring about his downfall– his father said that [...] "this story is not true." [...] In 2005 Hughes was reported to be on suicide watch after learning that his wife had reportedly been seeing a younger man.|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Mark Ruffalo, {{who plays}} Bruce Banner / Hulk in the MCU films, stated that his {{character}} was originally in the Civil War script, but was removed {{due to the}} end of Age of Ultron, as Marvel did not [...] "want to reveal where [...] and why" [...] in this film. Markus added that as soon as the Hulk joined a side, the fight would be quickly over, saying, [...] "You've got to kind of choose your roster [...] depending on what kind of fight you want to have." [...] He later explained that he contemplated having the Hulk appear {{at the very end of}} the film, but decided against it, feeling that he was over-stuffing the film with characters, adding, [...] " [...] has clearly gone somewhere at the end of [...] Ultron, and that's a story. Don't blow it off and put it in a little tiny chunk just <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little extra filigree on our movie." [...] Additionally, Ross' alter ego, Red Hulk, was also considered for inclusion, but the Russos felt that part of the character would need a proper backstory which they could not afford to give in the already crowded film. They felt that Ross [...] "was there sort of as the government's agenda and not to add another complicated super powered character to the mix." [...] Spider-Man's Iron Spider suit was also considered.|$|E
500|$|Charlton caused {{controversy}} {{early in}} the 1970–71 season as in an October appearance on the Tyne Tees football programme, he said he'd once had a [...] "little black book" [...] of names of players whom he intended to hurt or exact some form of revenge upon during his playing days. He was tried by the Football Association and {{was found not guilty}} of any wrongdoing after arguing that the press had misquoted him. He admitted that though he never actually had a book of names he had a short list of names in his head of players who had made nasty tackles on him and that he intended <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hard but fair challenge on those players if he got the opportunity {{in the course of a}} game. Leeds ended the season in second place yet again, as Arsenal overtook them with a late series of 1–0 wins despite Leeds beating Arsenal in the penultimate game of the season after Charlton scored the winning goal. The final tally of 64 points was a record high for a second-placed team. In the last ever season of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup they beat Sarpsborg FK (Norway), Dynamo Dresden (Germany), Sparta Prague (Czechoslovakia), Vitória (Portugal) and Liverpool to secure a place in the final against Italian club Juventus. They drew 2–2 at the Stadio Olimpico and 1–1 at Elland Road to win the cup on the away goals rule. They had the opportunity to win the cup permanently, but lost 2–1 to Barcelona at Camp Nou in the trophy play-off game.|$|E

2500|$|A {{woman on}} the board of his {{non-profit}} organization asked Chandler <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> résumé at Highland Village First Baptist Church. Chandler claims he did not expect to get the job due to conflicts in beliefs. Despite this, he was offered the job, and in 2002 he accepted the position. The church at that point had an attendance of 160 people. [...] Now known as The Village Church, it has since grown to over 14,000 attendees. Chandler says his character was partially shaped by John Piper.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, while he's {{been putting}} out the {{releases}} of his mixtape, he released his debut single, titled [...] "Toot It and Boot It", a collaboration with Ty Dolla Sign. In 2011, YG met a fellow Def Jam artist Jeezy. They formed a relationship and began working together later, as Jeezy used his notoriety <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good word for YG at Def Jam. During 2012, YG have been doing some recording in Miami, Florida. The majority of the album was recorded in Los Angeles, California and Atlanta, Georgia. On January 27, 2014, YG told MTV, that the album was 90% finished and he only had one record left, until the album is officially completed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, {{plans to}} dig up the garden to build an {{underground}} parking garage led to protests in the media. The Los Angeles Times ran an editorial opposing the plan: [...] "There are times when the leaders of Los Angeles seem perversely intent on living up to the image that many outsiders have of them—insensitive and uncouth rabbits who would, say, dig up a garden <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parking lot." [...] The garden had also been threatened by an earlier proposal by the Los Angeles Raiders football team to convert the garden into a practice field for the team. In {{order to protect the}} garden from such threats, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose for}} {{creating}} the gang initially was to eliminate all street gangs and create a [...] "bull force" [...] neighborhood watch. Williams said: [...] "We started out—at least my intent was to, in a sense, address all of the so-called neighboring gangs {{in the area and}} <b>to</b> <b>put,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sense—I thought 'I can cleanse the neighborhood of all these, you know, marauding gangs.' But I was totally wrong. And eventually, we morphed into the monster we were addressing." [...] Washington himself has stated that he founded the Crips not with the intention of eliminating other gangs, but to create a force powerful enough to protect local black people from racism, corruption and brutality {{at the hands of the}} police.|$|E

2500|$|On 7June 2008, Roach was {{selected}} in the West Indies Test squad to face Australia in the third Test. At {{the time he had}} played in only four first class matches.

I'm quite happy to be there. If selected, I want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good performance". Roach made his international debut on 20 June 2008 in a Twenty20 international against Australia; it was also the first senior Twenty20 match he had played in. He finished with the best bowling figures in the match of 2/29 from three overs, claiming the scalps of Shaun Marsh and Luke Ronchi as the West Indies won by seven wickets. Roach was drafted into the squad for the last two ODIs against Australia in July 2008 after Australia won the first three games and sealed a series victory.|$|E
