5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} {{that they were}} fed a variety of foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, beets and similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, but very little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes that the children were systematically punished for various infractions, and were treated harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} <b>the</b> <b>nuns.</b> Some of <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> at the camp, however, did show love and attention to the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} <b>the</b> <b>nuns,</b> the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> were asked to write letters verifying whether or not <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E

5|$|The cup {{stayed in}} the convent until 1882 when <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> were short of funds and wanted to sell it. It was {{at some point during}} this period that the pearl border to the cover and the Tudor finial were removed. <b>The</b> <b>nuns</b> decided they would get a better price in Paris than in Spain, and the cup was {{entrusted}} to Simon Campo, a priest, who took it to Paris and approached several leading dealers and collectors. There had been a spate of forgeries of medieval objects, and the Parisians were suspicious, until one, Baron Jérôme Pichon, researched the second added cylinder and was sufficiently convinced that this was the cup documented in 1604 to make a rather low offer, which was accepted. In the course of his researches the baron had contacted the current Duke of Frías, who had supplied useful information, and then initially congratulated the buyer on his purchase. However, on looking further into the matter the duke realized that the sale was contrary to the 1610 deed of gift he had discovered in the family archives, and sued in the French courts to recover the cup.|$|E
5|$|Two ballets caused great {{excitement}} in Paris in the 1830s. In November 1831, Meyerbeer's opera Robert le diable had its first performance. It featured a short ballet called Ballet of <b>the</b> <b>Nuns.</b> In this little ballet, scantily clad nuns rise from their graves to dance wantonly in the moonlight. The public loved this little supernatural ballet.|$|E
5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to pray, and were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>nun</b> {{was given}} various gifts {{such as the}} reading of souls. According to popular tradition, Sor Maria was {{able to read the}} mind of a convent servant, named Felipa, who prayed that God would lead her to purgatory after her death. <b>The</b> <b>nun</b> rebuked her, urging her to ask God to go to heaven instead of purgatory. Another miracle {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> <b>nun</b> happened when a mason who worked in the convent fell into the void, rushing to the ground gently and swaying, without dying or suffering damage, since the workman had entrusted to <b>the</b> <b>nun.</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite his fervour, Saglio's {{negotiations}} with the local people were unsuccessful. Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages. The project was eventually abandoned, and the Catholic missions house was transformed by <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the site}} {{began to be}} used as a {{religious}} retirement community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts in which they could live out the final years of their lives in intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as it is seen today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by <b>the</b> <b>nuns,</b> but the nunnery has an administrative body and a site for communal gathering.|$|E
5|$|It remains likely, however, {{that it was}} {{constructed}} by Gundulf, based primarily {{on the history of}} the land holdings during the period. After the founding of the abbey, which Gundulf granted some of his lands around West Malling, St Leonard's became the administrative centre of Gundulf's remaining estates, before also being given to <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> a few years later, shortly after his death in 1108. In practice, probably only Gundulf would therefore have had the time or motivation to build such a keep during this period.|$|E

5|$|On 15 October 1944, Marinić filed {{charges against}} Pulherija and Gaudencija before the Land Commission for the Determination of Crimes by the Occupiers and Their Supporters. Pulherija fled to Austria {{before the end}} of the war, the only one of <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> to do so. Gaudencija {{remained}} at the Children's Home, eventually moving to Ljubljana. No extradition of Pulherija was ever attempted, and neither nun was ever declared a war criminal. According to Fumić, the inhumane actions of Pulherija and other nuns and their role in the deaths of many children has never been condemned by the Catholic Church. Pulherija died in Austria in 1981.|$|E
5|$|The Church of San Benedetto in Catania (Illustrations 15 and 16) is a {{fine example}} of a Sicilian Baroque interior, {{decorated}} between 1726 and 1762, the period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and individuality. The ceilings were frescoed by the artist Giovanni Tuccari. The most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nun's choir (Illustrations 16), created c. 1750, which was designed {{in such a way that}} the nuns' voices could be heard during services, but <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> themselves were still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} required its own church building, {{and already}} owned land {{which could be}} used: in 1828 the Catholics had purchased a former hospital and the surrounding land in Gedangan, near the , and established an orphanage there. However, there were insufficient clergy for further development. Mgr. Joseph Lijnen (1815–82), who had become the congregation's pastor in 1858, left the Indies for Heythuysen, Netherlands. There, he convinced several Franciscan nuns {{to join him in}} the Indies and develop the congregation through education and ministry. Upon returning to the Indies, designs were made for a church building across from the orphanage and convent established for <b>the</b> <b>nuns.</b>|$|E

5|$|The local Partisans {{had been}} advised of the {{presence}} of the camp and the children, probably by Branko Davila, a doctor who had worked at the pre-existing children's home on the camp site. At dawn on 26August 1942, the Partisan 4th Kordun Brigade attacked the camp and dispersed the Ustaše guard force. The children heard the shooting and began shouting that the Partisans had arrived. Despite attempts by <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> to hide the children, Partisan troops broke into the buildings and rescued many children. Some of the fighters even found a brother or sister within the camp. The Partisans gave what food they had to the children, and led away from the camp all the children that could walk.|$|E
5|$|The main {{building}} was begun in 1772, {{as a free}} hospital for the poor, but funding ran out two years later, and it was completed as a private residence. In the early 19th century, it was bought {{by a group of}} Franciscan nuns, who moved from an unsatisfactory site in Winchester. <b>The</b> <b>nuns</b> carried out a number of additions and extensions to the building to make it more suitable for their needs.

5|$|There are {{records of}} {{patronage}} towards the nunnery of North Berwick, a house founded by Donnchadh's probable maternal grandfather or great-grandfather Donnchadh I of Fife.

In addition to Maybole, he gave the church of St Brigit at Kirkbride to <b>the</b> <b>nuns,</b> as well as a grant of three marks from a place called Barrebeth. Relations with the bishop of Glasgow, within whose diocese Carrick lay, are also attested.

5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As {{she did not want to}} be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|J. Keijzer {{replaced}} de Vries {{after the}} latter's death in 1887 and headed {{the church for}} seven years. During his tenure, the church and surrounding grounds were expanded significantly.

Across the street, in 1888 <b>the</b> <b>nuns</b> established an elementary school, and they also began construction of a chapel for the convent, which was opened on 6 August 1892. During this period the church building received stained glass windows and new pews. Further construction continued into the 20th century. A pipe organ was installed in 1903; it was restored in 1993, but remains in poor condition. Also installed that year were carvings depicting the fourteen Stations of the Cross.|$|E
5|$|Rev. John Nepomucene Jaeger, {{the first}} Bohemian abbot in the United States, was urged to {{establish}} a monastic community to teach at parochial schools in Bohemian as well as English. He founded St. Procopius priory in 1885. The priory took control of St. Procopius parish in January 1886, and Jaeger became the pastor. Jaeger also founded a convent in 1895, consisting of nuns brought from St. Mary's Convent in Pittsburgh and headed by Jaeger's biological sister, Mother Mary Nepomucene Jaeger. The Czech-American media had pushed for a convent to prepare Czech-speaking nuns for teaching positions in Czech parochial schools, which had previously hired mostly lay teachers trained in Austrian normal schools. <b>The</b> <b>nuns</b> were transferred from Pittsburgh to St. Scholastica's Convent on Chicago's north side, but later that same year moved to an old parish building at Ashland and 19th Streets, where they would remain until 1912.
