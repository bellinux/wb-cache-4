5|$|Lag {{errors are}} caused {{by the fact that}} any changes in the static or dynamic {{pressure}} outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{advanced}} to Changnyong itself {{during the afternoon}} of September 2, and ROK National Police withdrew from the town. North Koreans were in Changnyong that evening. With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry, Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the Yongsan road {{in an effort to}} re-establish communication. C Company, 72nd Tank Battalion, led its tanks southward. They had to fight <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road through several roadblocks. Of the three tanks that started, only the lead tank got through to Yongsan. There, it delivered an overlay of Task Force Haynes' positions to Bradley.|$|E
5|$|After {{staying at}} Eretria {{for a few}} days, the Persians made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast towards Attica. The Persians dropped the {{captured}} Eretrians off {{on the island of}} Aegilia, before landing at the bay of Marathon in Attica. The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet the Persians, and blocked the exits from the plains of Marathon. After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack the Persians, winning a famous victory at the ensuing Battle of Marathon. After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from Aegilia, and then sailed back to Asia Minor, thereby ending the campaign, and the first Persian invasion of Greece.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{air strike}} and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked {{up the hill}} unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on the hill was about 60 men. The artillery and the air strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill to meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they could establish their identity, but not hit. American forces of the 5th Cavalry Regiment quickly discovered {{the bodies of the}} American prisoners with machine-gun wounds, hands still bound behind their backs.|$|E
5|$|By dawn it {{was clear}} that they had succeeded in {{penetrating}} the perimeter through a gap between the Australian platoons, and they began to engage them with machine-guns from a defilade position covered from fire by a steep dip in the ridgeline, and concealed by thick scrub. In the growing light, 1 and 3 Platoon were soon pinned down and suffered a number of casualties as they attempted to gain better fire positions with which to engage their attackers. At 06:00 a fighting patrol was dispatched to make contact with Company Headquarters, and as the section passed over a false crest on <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> spur line they encountered the Chinese positions by chance. Attacking immediately, six Chinese were killed for the loss of one Australian, and the threat to A Company was eliminated. O'Dowd then launched a counter-attack with 3 Platoon assaulting the Chinese occupying the original 1 Platoon position. By 07:00 they had regained the feature and the Chinese were forced to withdraw under heavy fire from the Australians on the high ground, who again exacted a heavy toll. The night's fighting had cost A Company dearly however, and among the dead were the two New Zealand forward observers. In total they suffered more than 50 casualties—half their original strength. Meanwhile, on the right flank, D Company—under Captain Norm Gravener—held the summit of Hill 504 and was not heavily engaged during the night, while C Company—commanded by Captain Reg Saunders—was attacked only once.|$|E

Fire Marshall Keady would later write that he never found evidence that the exit had been opened.|$|E
25|$|Taponier's 12,000 troops began {{fighting}} <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Niederbronn valley on 8 December. On 12 December, Jean Grangeret's 10,000-man division {{joined the}} other Army of Moselle troops. Pichegru and Hoche met at Niederbronn on the 14th {{to arrange for}} their two armies to act together. A series a battles ensued in which François Joseph Lefebvre took command of Jacob's division and Jean-de-Dieu Soult led an independent detachment. The Battle of Froeschwiller ended on 22 December when the Army of the Moselle captured Froeschwiller, Woerth and Reichshoffen. This event prompted Wurmser to abandon Haguenau and begin retreating to the Lines of Wissembourg on the Lauter River, closely pursued by the Army of the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|Hoping to {{accomplish}} this, Martin Schenck devised a scheme {{through which he}} would take Nijmegen and enhance his own treasury. On the evening of 10nbsp&August 1589, Schenck and 20nbsp&barges of men—approximately 200nbsp&soldiers—made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Waal to Nijmegen. Schenck's plan was simple: they would find a house with open windows. Using scaling hooks and ropes, they would climb {{into the house and}} overpower the inhabitants, who should be sleeping at that hour. Once the house was secured, they would quietly find the city gate, and open it {{to the rest of the}} force, which would be waiting on the river landing. They could then overpower the small local garrison and any citizens who felt resistance was necessary. Not only would they reinforce the city, but there would be opportunity for plunder as well.|$|E

25|$|From {{their bases}} in the Great Lakes area, the French {{steadily}} pushed <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi river valley to the Gulf of Mexico from 1682 onward. Initially, French relations with the Natchez Indians were friendly and in 1716 the French were allowed to establish Fort Rosalie (modern Natchez, Mississippi) on the Natchez territory. In 1729, following several cases of French land fraud, the Natchez burned down Fort Rosalie and killed about 200 French settlers. In response, the French together with their allies, the Choctaw, waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Natchez as French and Choctaw set out to eliminate the Natchez as a people with the French often burning alive all of the Natchez they captured. Following the French victory over the Natchez in 1731 {{which resulted in the}} destruction of the Natchez people, the French were able to begin fur trading down the Arkansas river and greatly expanded the Arkansas Post {{to take advantage of the}} fur trade.|$|E
25|$|When the new Austrian army {{commander}} Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser {{advanced to}} the relief of the Siege of Mantua in late July, he formed his forces into four columns. See the Castiglione 1796 Campaign Order of Battle. The Right-Center Column was led by Michael von Melas and comprised the brigades of Peter Gummer, Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza, Franz Nicoletti, and Pittoni. The latter two reported to Sebottendorf. While Melas led Gummer and Bajalics over Monte Baldo by footpaths, Sebottendorf's two brigades fought <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road through Ferrara di Monte Baldo and Brentino Belluno. They accomplished their mission by driving back the French so that the Left-Center Column under Paul Davidovich could join them via the Adige River valley. The 900-man 11th Light Infantry Demi-Brigade and four guns were isolated and captured during the successful operation. Pittoni and Sebottendorf are not specifically mentioned in {{a detailed account of}} the Battle of Castiglione on 5 August 1796. In a preliminary action on 3 August, 1,000 Austrians became casualties and Pittoni's fellow brigadier Nicoletti was wounded. On the 5th, the Austrians were beaten with losses of 2,000 killed and wounded plus 1,000 men and 20 guns captured. The French counted 1,100 casualties.|$|E

Notre Dame responded with a field goal by Nick Taush. [...] Less than twenty seconds later, however, Michigan answered another touchdown on a 94-yard kickoff return by Darryl Stonum. [...] Notre Dame came back {{to take the lead in}} the second quarter with back-to-back touchdown passes, 4 yards to Golden Tate and 11 yards to Michael Floyd. [...] After another three-and-out by Michigan, the Irish made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field but were stopped by the Wolverine defense, forcing them to kick a 42-yard field goal. Michigan got the ball back with less than 4 minutes in the half and marched down the field, but with little time left on the clock they had to settle to end the first half with a 39-yard field goal.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene that}} {{corresponds}} with [...] "You Can't Win" [...] in The Wiz begins with Dorothy Gale (played by Diana Ross), stumbling upon a scarecrow being heckled by crows while {{stuck in the}} air on a pole. Dorothy remains hidden while the crows mock Scarecrow for asking to be let down. They state that he will remain on the pole because that is his role {{and there is nothing}} to get down for. The crows tell Scarecrow that even if he was let down, {{he would not be able}} to walk as he is a [...] "straw paper dummy". Scarecrow tries to reason with the birds by reading relevant quotations from figures such as Francis Bacon and Cicero as a rationale to be freed. The crows do not relent, however, and make him recite their [...] "Crow Commandments": [...] "Thou shall honor all crows", [...] "Thou shall stop reading all bits of paper and literature" [...] and [...] "Thou shall never, never get down off of this here pole". In addition, the birds tell Scarecrow to sing the crow anthem, [...] "You Can't Win". After the song concludes, Dorothy comes out of hiding and releases Scarecrow from the pole. Together, they then dance <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> yellow brick road in search of The Wiz, singing [...] "Ease on Down the Road" [...] as they go.|$|E
