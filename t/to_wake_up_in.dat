5|$|Berlin's {{civilian}} {{work schedule}} {{had been that}} of a hardworking night owl, generally writing material until two or three in the morning. His efforts to adjust to military life and become a good soldier included springing out of bed obediently each morning, which earned him the resentment of fellow soldiers because he concealed his hatred of reveille too well and appeared eager <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the mornings.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the players}} were {{cooperative}} except for Jose Canseco, who was intimidating. He disliked his original part and insisted it be rewritten, and the writers grudgingly made him as heroic as possible. He was originally slated <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed with Edna Krabappel and miss the game, but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected. He disliked his caricature, stating that [...] "the animation looked nothing like ," [...] but that he found the acting was very easy. When asked in 2007 about his part by the San Jose Mercury News, he responded, [...] "that was 100 years ago," [...] {{hung up the phone}} and did not answer any of the paper's subsequent calls for an interview about his guest spot.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, lead {{characters}} the Doctor, a time travelling alien {{played by}} Matt Smith, and his human travelling companions Amy (Karen Gillan) and her fiancé Rory (Arthur Darvill), {{are in a}} trap set by the mysterious [...] "Dream Lord" [...] (Toby Jones), wherein they repeatedly fall asleep and wake up in a different reality. In one, Amy and Rory are happily married but pursued by elderly people possessed by aliens, while in another they are on board the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, where they anticipate being frozen to death by a nearby astronomical phenomenon. They must decide which is the real reality and die in the dream, <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> reality and escape the trap. At the episode's conclusion, the Dream Lord is ultimately revealed to be {{a manifestation of the}} Doctor's dark side and self-loathing.|$|E

500|$|McCay's longest-running strip, Dream of the Rarebit Fiend, first {{appeared}} in the Evening Telegram in September 1904. [...] The strip was aimed at an adult audience, and had no recurring characters. [...] The characters that appeared in the strip would have fantastic, sometimes terrifying dreams, only <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the last panel, cursing the Welsh rarebit they had eaten the night before, which they blamed for bringing on the dream. [...] Rarebit Fiend was so popular that a book collection appeared in 1905 from publisher Frederick A. Stokes. [...] It was adapted to film by Edwin S. Porter, and plans were made for a [...] "comic opera or musical extravaganza" [...] for stage that failed to materialize. [...] McCay signed the Rarebit Fiend strips with the pen name [...] "Silas", as his contract required that he not use his real name for his Evening Telegram work.|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a tropical house, EDM, and electropop song with elements of bashment, featuring a drum and horn instrumentation. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, the song is composed in the key of A minor, and has a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Lipa's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. In the lyrics, the singer sets a list of rules that prevent her from getting back together with an ex-boyfriend. The rules are: [...] "One: Don't pick up the phone, you know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone / Two: Don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again / Three: Don't be his friend, you know you're going <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his bed in the morning." [...] Lipa confessed in an interview with NPR that [...] "hey're not necessarily rules I've been able to stick by. But [...] rules that I feel like it's important to be able to tell yourself, to tell your friends... There's a reason people break up, and it's probably the same reason why you shouldn't get back together." [...] Warren explained through an annotation on website Genius that the track was a self-reminder for people recovering from a break-up to not succumb to a momentary temptation since it is not [...] "a good idea in the long term".|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} mini-studio, the attic {{contained}} two other rooms: a small guest bedroom and a games room used for recreation. Lennon {{filled it with}} three full sets of the model car racing game, Scalextric. When not in the attic, Lennon could usually {{be found in the}} sunroom watching television or reading newspapers. He would also walk in the garden with his black cat on his shoulder (he had ten cats in total). His drug intake, particularly LSD and hashish, but also amphetamine, was high for much of the time he lived at Kenwood. Drugs were taken there in the company of people such as Marianne Faithfull's ex-husband John Dunbar and art dealer Robert Fraser. At one stage, under the influence of transcendental meditation, Lennon renounced both meat-eating and drugs, and buried a huge quantity of LSD in the garden, which had been obtained by representatives of The Beatles at the Monterey Pop Festival from Augustus Stanley Owsley III. He later tried to find the LSD, but could not remember where he had buried it. Although none [...] of the lavish parties they had planned took place - which remained a source of disappointment to Cynthia - various guests (including Monkee Michael Nesmith and his wife Phyllis, Bob Dylan and Peter Cook) stayed or dined at the house, together with old friends like Ivan Vaughan and Shotton from Liverpool, or strangers Lennon had met at a party or nightclub, such as the Ad Lib. Cynthia and Lennon were beginning to lead separate lives by 1967, and it was not uncommon for Cynthia <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the morning to find the house filled with people in various states of intoxication whom Lennon had met in clubs the night before. Large parts of the house were unused by the Lennons, and visitors remarked that there was frequently a strange atmosphere.|$|E

Gordon tries to help her remember her past, but to no avail. She does, however, go to see Linda's pre-war servant, Ming Ling (Maylia). Ming Ling recognizes her, but Linda's memories are still blocked.|$|R

2500|$|Affected {{people often}} report {{that while they}} do not get to sleep until the early morning, they do fall asleep {{around the same time}} every day. Unless they have another sleep {{disorder}} such as sleep apnea in addition to DSPD, patients can sleep well and have a normal need for sleep. However, they find it very difficult <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> time for a typical school or work day. If they are allowed to follow their own schedules, e.g. sleeping from 3:00am to 12:00 noon, their sleep is improved and they may not experience excessive daytime sleepiness. Attempting to force oneself onto daytime society's schedule with DSPD has been compared to constantly living with jet lag; DSPD has, in fact, been referred to as [...] "social jet lag".|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Taizong, {{for several}} years, had often {{suffered}} from severe illnesses, and Empress Zhangsun often attended to him day and night, carrying poison within her belt and resolving {{to commit suicide}} if the emperor should die. [...] Empress Zhangsun herself was said to suffer from severe asthma, and her conditions were exacerbated in 634 when she was ill, but nevertheless attended to Emperor Taizong when he was forced <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} night and put on armor and weapons due to an emergency report by his brother-in-law, Chai Shao (柴紹) the Duke of Qiao. [...] By 636, her conditions were severe, and Li Chengqian suggested to her that, as the doctors appeared to have done everything they could, Emperor Taizong declare a general pardon and encourage commoners to become Buddhist or Taoist monks, to try to gain divine favor. [...] Empress Zhangsun, knowing that Emperor Taizong had long disapproved of Buddhism and Taoism and herself believing over use of pardons to be improper, refused. [...] Li Chengqian instead told the idea to the chancellor Fang Xuanling, who reported it to Emperor Taizong. [...] Emperor Taizong considered issuing a general pardon, but Empress Zhangsun again refused. [...] As she came close to death (at a time that Fang had drawn anger from Emperor Taizong and was temporarily relieved of his post and returned to his mansion), she bid Emperor Taizong goodbye with these words; ...|$|E
