5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the back of my head.|$|E

25|$|Commercial {{production}} of bottle fermented sparkling wines from grapes grown in England {{started in the}} 1960s, {{although there has been}} a longer history of sparkling wines made in the UK from imported grapes. In the 1980s, some English winemakers started to grow the grape varieties as used in Champagne – Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier – and in the ensuing decades availability of English sparkling wines made from these varieties increased. Today, there are over 100 vineyards in England producing sparkling wines with Nyetimber, Ridgeview and Chapel Down being some of the largest producers. In 2010, Chardonnay and Pinot noir were the two most commonly planted grape varieties in English vineyards. Along with Pinot Meunier, the three varieties combined accounted for around 40% of vines planted, which appears to reflect a significant growth in interest in English sparkling wines. Other varietals used are Auxerrois, Seyval blanc, Müller-Thurgau, Reichensteiner, and Bacchus. <b>To</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> context, the current yield for all types of English wine averages to around 2 million bottles annually.|$|E

500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army I was holding my gun and feeling all dangerous and badass. It's an attitude, it's a different kind of walk, and the way you hold yourself, the way you look at things. I tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> there because she didn't say much." ...|$|E
500|$|The role {{of adult}} Gretel, whom Wirkola {{wanted to be}} [...] "a really, really strong and fun female character," [...] was {{originally}} planned for Noomi Rapace, {{who dropped out of}} consideration for the part prior to early January 2011. [...] Diane Kruger and Eva Green were reported to also be in talks for the role. English actress Gemma Arterton was ultimately cast in the role. She impressed Wirkola with her performance in The Disappearance of Alice Creed, and, after they have met, with her [...] "really filthy sense of humour" [...] as [...] "the humour is essential to this film." [...] Arterton said she was attracted to Wirkola's [...] "strong vision" [...] for the film, calling it [...] "very, very dark, and bloodthirsty and there’s a lot of cursing. It’s kind of got a Tarantino feel, really." [...] Arterton described her character as [...] "much more in tune with her spiritual side. Hansel is a typical action hero, cheeky, funny, a womanizer. She’s much more of a thinker, intense, internal and bit more open-minded than he is." [...] She said that Gretel is [...] "a sexual character but she's not having sex with anybody, which is a change for me because usually in my films I'm sleeping with somebody!" [...] She further explained the characters: [...] "Hansel & Gretel have this unstoppable bond but they’re also so different from each other. She’s the brains of the operation. He’s the brawn. He’s the joker and the show-off. She’s more the watcher, the researcher, the one who tries to really understand witchcraft." [...] Arterton added, [...] "Jeremy [...] and I found within the script moments where we showed the vulnerable side of them. Often in action movies, people are scared <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> <b>in.</b> I think it was important." [...] She said that she [...] "loved every minute" [...] of the production and did not want it to end, also crediting it for helping her overcome her fear of getting hurt.|$|E
