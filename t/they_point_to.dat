5|$|Whales {{can also}} be {{threatened}} by humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as bycatch and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting is a significant cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include beaked whales. Whales are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain. They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales as they are higher up the food chain than baleen whales. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. They {{can also be}} poisoned by swallowing litter, such as plastic bags. Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval sonar endangers some whales. Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger whale beachings, and <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> signs that such whales have experienced decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{groups are}} {{concerned}} that floating plants will be more vulnerable to accidents and terrorism than land-based stations. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a history of naval and nuclear accidents in Russia and the former Soviet Union, including the Chernobyl disaster of 1986.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that Sunnis dismiss the Shia version of the Quranic {{compilation}} as nothing more than Twelver Shia fabrications. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the fact that Zaydi Shias who form the oldest living Shia sect believe in the above events described in Sahih Bukhari.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the {{log cabin}} in which General Hood was quartered.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is {{it not a}} {{beautiful}} piece of cloth?' asked the two impostors, and <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> and described the splendid material which was not there.|$|R
60|$|The Germans {{had turned}} to the strange man who was with them, and when <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the cadets this {{stranger}} nodded. Evidently he was identifying the boys.|$|R
25|$|Amenhotep II did not openly {{record the}} names of his queens; some Egyptologists theorise that he felt that women had become too {{powerful}} under titles such as God's Wife of Amun. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that he}} participated in his father's removal of Hatshepsut's name from her monuments and the destruction of her image.|$|E
25|$|Veterinarian Lana Dunn {{and several}} Saudi {{nationals}} report {{that there are}} no laws to protect animals from cruelty since the term is not well-defined within the Saudi legal system. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a lack of a governing body to supervise conditions for animals, particularly in pet stores and in the exotic animal trade with East Africa.|$|E
25|$|According to Shaheen Sardar Ali and Javaid Rehman, both {{professors of}} law, the Islamic {{military}} jurisprudence {{are in line}} with rules of modern international law. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the dual commitment of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states (representing most of the Muslim world) to Islamic law and the United Nations Charter, as evidence of compatibility of both legal systems.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{commentators}} criticised {{the service}} as expensive and a [...] "solution {{in search of}} a problem". In particular, <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> free or cheaper-than-landline IP phone systems like Skype.|$|R
6000|$|I {{asked the}} cause: the aged man grew sad: <b>They</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> a {{building}} gray and tall, And hoarsely answered [...] "Step inside, my lad, And then you'll see it all." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the study. The {{door was}} shut, but Albinia broke from Lucy, and pushed through it, {{in too much}} haste {{to dwell on the}} sickening doubt what it might conceal.|$|R
25|$|Moon-landing conspiracists focus {{heavily on}} NASA photos. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> oddities in photos and films {{taken on the}} Moon. Photography experts (including those {{unrelated}} to NASA) answer that the oddities are what one would expect from a real Moon landing, and not what would happen with tweaked or studio imagery. Some of the main arguments and counter-arguments are listed below.|$|E
25|$|Baptism is {{a second}} {{essential}} component of UPCI doctrine. Members of the UPCI affirm an indispensable need for baptism, citing John 3:5, Mark 16:16, Acts 2:38 and Matthew 28:19. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> Matthew 3:13–16 as evidence that even Jesus himself was baptized. The UPCI mode of baptism is complete immersion in water, completed {{in the name of}} Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.|$|E
25|$|Some NESARA detractors {{claim that}} NESARA is a cult {{designed}} primarily {{to provide an}} income to Goodwin and others. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the fact that Goodwin, Lee, and Nidle frequently asked their readers to donate money. Goodwin, who also asked readers to donate their frequent flyer miles, claimed that she needed and had used the funds to travel to various locations {{around the world to}} secretly meet with high-level government officials about getting NESARA announced.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mohammed Beyd was not murdered," [...] they cried. [...] "He died {{by his own}} hand. This, and Allah, are our witnesses," [...] and <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> a {{revolver}} in the dead man's hand.|$|R
60|$|A {{clatter of}} blocks broke {{out and the}} upper half of the tall {{mainsail}} suddenly collapsed. Then the schooner's bows swung around a little until <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the seething froth upon the opposite beach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which house?" [...] they asked. [...] "The 'Fortunate House?'" [...] and <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> {{the marble}} palace of Marcus, which, as Caleb now saw {{for the first}} time, had these words blazoned in gold letters on its portico.|$|R
25|$|Pierrebourg and Juneau-Katsuya {{also raised}} {{concerns}} over ties between Confucius Institute administrators and large state-run Chinese companies. For instance, <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the Confucius Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas, {{where one of}} the top officials is also vice-president of Huawei, a Chinese telecom company the U.S. government regards as a national security threat, and which has been accused of industrial espionage, though an extensive security review found no clear evidence of spying.|$|E
25|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{consider the}} birth narratives unhistorical {{because they are}} laced with theology and present two different accounts. For instance, <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> Matthew's account of the appearance of an angel to Joseph in a dream; the wise men from the East; the massacre of the innocents; and the flight to Egypt, which do not appear in Luke, which instead describes the appearance of an angel to Mary; the Roman census; the birth in a manger; and the choir of angels.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{critics have}} focused on the gender system of Early Modern England. For example, <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the common {{classification}} of women as maid, wife or widow, with only whores outside this trilogy. Using this analysis, the problem of Hamlet becomes the central character's identification of his mother as a whore due to her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet, in consequence of which he loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia {{as if she were a}} whore also.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is it not splendid!' said {{both the}} old statesmen {{who had already}} been there. 'See, your Majesty, what a texture! What colours!' And then <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the empty loom, for they {{believed}} that the others could see the cloth quite well.|$|R
5000|$|<b>They</b> also <b>point</b> <b>to</b> verses {{that suggest}} God is immutable, such as: ...|$|R
25|$|Critics, however, {{argued that}} Hanley engaged in {{organizing}} new members only {{in order to}} maintain his own high salary. <b>They</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> Hanley's lavish way of life, the union-owned $2.5 million jet maintained solely for his use, and the union office near his vacation home in Palm Springs, California.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, {{mandatory}} vaccination laws sometimes provoke {{opposition from}} members of anti-government or libertarian factions, who express concern for what they view as the convergence or merger {{of the public and}} private sectors. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> possible conflicts of interest due to vaccine research funding and misinformation that fuels debate on both sides. Others argue that, for compulsory vaccination to effectively prevent disease, there must be not only available vaccines and a population willing to immunize, but also sufficient ability to decline vaccination on grounds of personal belief.|$|E
25|$|Theories {{regarding}} such parallels {{were popular}} in the 19th century. Some modern scholars such as Martin Hengel, Barry Powell, Robert M. Price, and Peter Wick argue that Dionysian religion and Christianity have parallels. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the symbolism of wine and the importance it held in the mythology surrounding both Dionysus and Jesus Christ. Wick, however, argues {{that the use of}} wine symbolism in the Gospel of John, including the story of the Marriage at Cana, at which Jesus turns water into wine, is intended to show Jesus as superior to Dionysus.|$|E
25|$|Personal pronouns in ASL are indexic. That is, <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> their referent, or to a locus {{representing}} their referent. When the referent {{is physically}} present, pronouns involve simply {{pointing at the}} referent, with different handshapes for different pronominal uses: A 'G' handshape is a personal pronoun, an extended 'B' handshape with an outward palm orientation is a possessive pronoun, and an extended-thumb 'A' handshape is a reflexive pronoun; these may be combined with numeral signs to sign 'you two', 'us three', 'all of them', etc.|$|E
25|$|Despite Latham's strong {{performance}} in the debate, most political commentators argued {{that he had not}} gained a clear advantage over Howard. <b>They</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> anomalies in Labor's tax policy and the controversy surrounding Labor's policy of reducing government funding to some non-government schools as issues which Howard was successfully exploiting.|$|R
2500|$|Ferguson was {{the subject}} of a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch in which he, portrayed by Tim Meadows, {{declared}} [...] "I did not shoot them, they shot me" [...] and asked witnesses questions about shooting him while they were on the stand, then ducking when <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> him as the killer.|$|R
5000|$|Commentators {{generally}} {{welcomed the}} new body {{as likely to}} make a positive contribution in the efforts to minimise climate change. At the same time, <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> {{the slow pace of}} government action in promoting energy conservation and implementing existing low-carbon technologies, [...] compared to progress {{in a number of other}} European countries.|$|R
25|$|Critics {{maintain}} that this rating, outlooking, and watching of securities {{has not worked}} nearly as smoothly as agencies suggest. <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> near-defaults, defaults, and financial disasters not detected by the rating agencies' post-issuance surveillance, or ratings of troubled debt securities not downgraded until just before (or even after) bankruptcy. These include the 1970 Penn Central bankruptcy, the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, the 1994 Orange County default, the Asian and Russian financial crises, the 1998 collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, the 2001 Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies, and especially the 2007–8 subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E
25|$|Vladimir Becić's {{earliest}} works {{date from}} the time of the Munich school, and together with the works of Josip Račić and Miroslav Kraljević, <b>they</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a new direction in Croatian modern painting. Moving away from traditional academic styles, they are strongly influenced by Leibl's realism, and the works of Impressionist artists such as Manet whose work they saw in an exhibit of 1907. Other influences at that time were Velázquez and Goya. Becić's later works show an approach that is closer to Cézanne, and emphasizing the structure and geometric shapes. His artistic expression was focused towards modeling and clarity. His sketches in oil, and especially watercolour, express the freshness of the immediate experience. He uses rich colour expression, and tone shaping for strong volume.|$|E
25|$|Marlovians {{suggest it}} is {{significant}} that every person involved in the incident seems to have been associated {{in one way or another}} either with his friend and patron Thomas Walsingham (Frizer and Skeres) or with his employers the Cecils (Poley, Bull and Danby). <b>They</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the lengthy period (10 hours) in which the four men remained together at Eleanor Bull's house that day, and suggest this seems unnecessary if the intent had been simply to dispose of Marlowe. The most likely reason for the get-together, they say, would have been to save him in some way from the peril facing him. They claim that the faking of his death fits more of the facts as known than any other scenario. That Poley, Frizer and Skeres all made a living from being able to lie convincingly may have been relevant too.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{why did he}} seek you out--and {{why were}} you obliged to marry him?' asked the distressed girl. Then the evidences pieced {{themselves}} together in her acute mind, and, her colour gradually rising, she asked her mother if what <b>they</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> was indeed the fact. Her mother admitted that it was.|$|R
60|$|Both the impostors {{begged him}} to be so kind as to step closer, {{and asked him if}} it were not a {{beautiful}} texture and lovely colours. <b>They</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> the empty loom, and the poor old minister went forward rubbing his eyes; but he could see nothing, for there was nothing there.|$|R
25|$|This, <b>they</b> conclude, <b>points</b> <b>to</b> a date {{during the}} middle of the 2nd century for 46.|$|R
