500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box officeâ€”the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept trying <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> how I should love this whole genre. And I told him: I've never had a script with a really great character and a real filmmaker attached to it that I'd be interested in. So, he brought me into it.|$|E

Piest left the store, promising to return shortly. When Piest failed to return, his family filed a missing person report on their son with the Des Plaines police. The owner of the pharmacy named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk with about a job.|$|E

Did I ever give you any right? Honest indeed! What right have you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> being honest?" ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{had been}} working on my novel when she entered the room <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{never see}} why I should trouble myself with strange languages. If foreigners want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> they can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in English.|$|R

60|$|Cecily. I don't {{think it}} can be right for you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like that. Miss Prism never says such things <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Then don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now. I don't {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now. There is a place--This isn't the place. You have misunderstood. I can't explain--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye {{might try}} the bar," [...] Mackellar replied, with a twinkle. [...] "Mr. Johnstone's not anxious <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> How did ye lose him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ena," [...] he said, {{dropping}} his voice a little, [...] "what {{are you going}} to do with that child? I have never quite understood your plans. You promised <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it while we were down here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah; but I'm not joking. It seems such {{a serious}} thing. And I can't expect you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it now {{as you would}} {{if you were in}} the same {{position}} yourself. Do you think I shall make him happy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I don't {{really see}} why you want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>ME</b> <b>about</b> it. And if you are {{thinking}} that such a story would go down for a moment with Joan as an evidence of your reformation, you're completely out, Dick. Was that your idea?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good evening, madam; I sent {{to you for}} a {{charitable}} purpose.

"I wouldn't mind so much," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "if I were not marked out for suspicion--if people would only {{talk to me}} of nice earthly things {{part of the time}} as they would to any other girl--but they never do.

6000|$|... "Anyhow, {{there is}} no reason to suppose that any woman ever has been able to write or ever will be able to write," [...] Eleanor continued. [...] "And yet, {{whenever}} I go among authors they never cease <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> their books. Masterly! I say, or Shakespeare himself!
