25|$|Following Roman law, the English {{system has}} long been based on a closed system of {{nominate}} torts, such as trespass, battery and conversion. This {{is in contrast to}} continental legal systems, which have since adopted more open systems of tortious liability. There are various categories of tort, which lead back to the system of separate causes of action. The <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> is however increasing in importance over other types of tort, providing a wide scope of protection, especially since Donoghue v Stevenson. For liability under negligence a duty of care must be established owed to a group of persons to which the victim belongs, a nebulous concept into which many other categories are being pulled.|$|E
50|$|In law, a {{disclaimer}} {{is a statement}} denying responsibility intended to prevent civil liability arising for particular acts or omissions.

The courts {{may or may not}} give effect to the disclaimer depending on whether the law permits exclusion of liability in the particular situation and whether the acts or omissions complained of fall within the wording of the disclaimer.|$|R
5000|$|On 29 July 1997 {{the federal}} {{government}} filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court to recover its costs for the salvage operation with the owners of Irving Whale, J.D. Irving Ltd., {{as well as the}} Ship Source Oil Pollution Fund and the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund 1971. In Canada v J.D. Irving Ltd., the plaintiff ({{the federal government}}) sought action against the defendants (the barge's owners and charterers) based on the statutory liability of an [...] "owner" [...] under subsection 677(1) of the Canada Shipping Act, {{as well as on the}} <b>torts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> and nuisance. The defendants centred their defence on whether the action by the government was time barred and whether legislation created after the sinking of Irving Whale could be applied retroactively. The case was heard on 9-10 December 1998 in Montreal. The decision was released on 21 December 1998 in favour of the defendants.|$|R

500|$|Trespass to {{the person}} comes in three variants: assault, which is [...] "to act {{in such a way}} that the {{claimant}} believes he is about to be attacked"; battery, [...] "the intentional and direct application of force to another person"; and false imprisonment, [...] "depriving the claimant of freedom of movement, without a lawful justification for doing so". All three require that the act be a direct and intentional act, with indirect or unintentional acts falling under the <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b> Battery and assault require the claimant to establish that the defendant intended to act, while false imprisonment is a tort of strict liability. The guiding principle behind all three is based on the statement of Goff, LJ, who stated in Collins v Wilcock that [...] "any person's body is inviolate", excepting normal, day-to-day physical contact.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{causation}} is {{one part}} of a multi-stage test for legal liability. [...] For example, for the defendant to be held liable for the <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> the defendant must have owed the plaintiff a duty of care, breached that duty, by so doing caused damage to the plaintiff, and that damage must not have been too remote. [...] Causation is but one component of the tort.|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{accidents}} often involve ambiguous risks, i. e., {{the relevant}} probabilities are unknown. This paper studies how liability rules {{are affected by}} ambiguity. The injurer and the victim choose a level of care, which is observable, and an unobservable action. Both actions may affect the size and/or likelihood of loss. We analyze the welfare implications <b>of</b> <b>tort</b> rules. First, we show that with ambiguity, negligence is likely to perform better than strict liability. Second, we propose a <b>tort</b> rule <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> and punitive damages, which gives the efficient levels of both care and unobserved actions...|$|R

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{action in}} tort is negligence. [...] The <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> provides {{a cause of}} action leading to damages, or to relief, in each case designed to protect legal rights, including those of personal safety, property, and, in some cases, intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the United States. Negligence actions include claims coming primarily from car accidents and personal injury accidents of many kinds, including clinical negligence, worker's negligence and so forth. Product liability cases, such as those involving warranties, may also be considered negligence actions or, particularly in the United States, may apply regardless of negligence or intention through strict liability.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantages}} of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada [...] "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for {{public and private}} clients". This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain {{a code of ethics}} that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. In this way these organizations {{play an important role in}} maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law.|$|E

50|$|The scienter {{action is}} a {{category}} within tort law in some common law jurisdictions which deals with {{the damage done by}} an animal directly to a human. It had a long history in English law, although it was abolished by the Animals Act 1971. An action in those common law jurisdictions where it has not been extinguished by statute, is in addition to the <b>torts</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> and nuisance, or more bespoke torts like cattle trespass. Where an animal is known to behave in a certain way, and that is expressed on a person causing injury, an action can be taken in this tort. This tort is not available in New South Wales, The Australian Capital Territory, South Australia or New Zealand. In these jurisdictions the actions involving animals need to be in nuisance or negligence. To be successful the plaintiff needs to take action against the person in control of the animal, and it is strict liability, requiring no more than proof of injury, that the animal had a problematic trait, and the person in control knew about the trait in the animal. Being strict liability, {{there is no need to}} argue fault in the form of wilful intent or negligence on the part of the animal or its controller. The only defence is if it can be proved the plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk of injury by their actions, or if the plaintiff was the cause of the injury. It is common to distinguish between harmless animals and wild animals. No scienter is needed for wild animals. Animals are classed as wild or harmless on the basis of species or kind, not on the basis of being a tame individual. An elephant is considered wild irrespective of its use. The scienter action is referred to in Rylands v. Fletcher in that one who keeps a wild thing “must keep it at his peril” to make reference to part of Justice Colin Blackburn’s comment.|$|R

50|$|In the English law <b>of</b> <b>tort,</b> {{professional}} <b>negligence</b> is {{a subset}} of the general rules on negligence to cover the situation in which the defendant has represented him or herself as having more than average skills and abilities. The usual rules rely on establishing that a duty of care is owed by the defendant to the claimant, and that the defendant is in breach of that duty. The standard test of breach is whether the defendant has matched the abilities of a reasonable person. But, by virtue of the services they offer and supply, professional people hold themselves out as having more than average abilities. This specialised set of rules determines the standards against which to measure the legal quality of the services actually delivered by those who claim to be among the best in their fields of expertise.|$|R
