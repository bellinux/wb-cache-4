5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 {{and the subsequent}} schism shows the necessity of amending the rules concerning papal elections. <b>The</b> <b>decree</b> Licet de evitanda discordia issued by the Third Lateran Council in 1179 abolished the rule of unanimity in favour {{of the rule of}} the majority of two thirds. <b>The</b> <b>decree</b> confirmed also that all three orders of the College of Cardinals (bishops, priests and deacons) are equal in the papal elections. Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons on equal rights with cardinal-bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election, 1118, <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> In Nomine Domini (1059) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal-bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. <b>The</b> <b>decree</b> {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|France officially {{adopted the}} metric system on 10 December 1799. Although it was decreed that its use {{was to be}} {{mandatory}} in Paris that year and across the provinces the following year, <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> was not universally observed across France.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, 2010 the President of Ukraine reloaded a new government. According to <b>the</b> <b>decree,</b> {{the number}} of {{ministries}} was reduced from 20 to 16 and {{the number of}} cabinet employees (1,174 people at the time) is to be more than halved.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Decree</b> on Romanisation {{made this}} law in April, 1928. The Latin variant for Tajik {{was based on}} the work by Turcophone {{scholars}} who aimed to produce a unified Turkic alphabet, despite Tajik not being a Turkic language. The literacy campaign was successful, with near-universal literacy being achieved by the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|The {{elaboration}} of <b>the</b> <b>decrees</b> by <b>the</b> Council {{is limited to}} the lato sensu legality (and the constitutionality of the relevant legal provisions) of <b>the</b> <b>decrees,</b> while <b>the</b> respective control of the French Conseil d'État goes to the substance of the context of <b>the</b> elaborated <b>decree.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>decrees</b> of a {{national}} council may not be promulgated until they have received the approval of <b>the</b> pope. <b>The</b> <b>decrees</b> of a provincial synod have no force until they have been approved by Rome. This approval is twofold: ordinary (in formâ communi), and specific (in formâ specificâ). The former {{means that there is}} nothing which needs correction in <b>the</b> <b>decrees</b> of <b>the</b> synod, and they thereby have force in the province. This is the approval generally given to such decrees. If approval is given in formâ specificâ <b>the</b> <b>decrees</b> have <b>the</b> same force as if they emanated from the Apostolic See, though they are binding only in the province for which they are made.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>decree</b> of the Congregation of the Index banned Copernicus's De Revolutionibus {{and other}} heliocentric works until correction. Bellarmine's {{instructions}} did not prohibit Galileo from discussing heliocentrism as a mathematical and philosophic idea, {{so long as}} he did not advocate for its physical truth.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} army {{received}} sufficient recruits, Diocletian {{appears to have}} instituted systematic annual conscription of Roman citizens {{for the first time}} since the days of the Roman Republic. In addition, he was probably responsible for <b>the</b> <b>decree,</b> first recorded in 313, compelling the sons of serving soldiers and veterans to enlist.|$|E
5|$|Upon taking power, Lenin's regime {{issued a}} series of decrees. The first was a Decree on Land, which {{declared}} that the landed estates of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments. This contrasted with Lenin's desire for agricultural collectivisation but provided governmental recognition of the widespread peasant land seizures that had already occurred. In November 1917, the government issued <b>the</b> <b>Decree</b> on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter-revolutionary. They claimed the measure would be temporary; <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> was widely criticised, including by many Bolsheviks, for compromising freedom of the press.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>decrees</b> {{effectively}} dissolved <b>the</b> Burschenschaften Studentenverbindungen {{as well as}} the Turnerschaften {{and also}} provided for university inspectors and press censors. Reformers in many local governments were forced out and by 1820 all significant German reform movements had come to an end. <b>The</b> <b>decrees</b> were organized into three sections.|$|R

5|$|Apologists for the OCA's autocephaly {{claim that}} <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> {{did not need}} the {{approval}} of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, as it was an internal matter for the Russian Orthodox Church to decide. Many autocephalous churches, the Russian Church included, were not recognized as such for many years, albeit their autocephaly was granted by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.|$|E
5|$|Building on Champollion's grammar, {{his student}} Karl Richard Lepsius {{continued}} {{to develop the}} decipherment, realizing in contrast to Champollion that vowels were not written. Lepsius became the most important champion of Champollion's work. In 1866, <b>the</b> <b>Decree</b> of Canopus, discovered by Lepsius, was successfully deciphered using Champollion's method, cementing his reputation as the true decipherer of the hieroglyphs.|$|E
5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy {{to hold it in}} a decree dated 27 October 251. <b>The</b> <b>decree</b> is brought to Decius (on {{campaign}} against the Goths) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour. The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.|$|E
50|$|Ten of <b>the</b> <b>decrees</b> were {{discovered}} during the 1910-1911 excavations {{of the temple}} of Min at Coptos by Adolphe Reinach and Raymond Weill, working for the Société française des fouilles archéologiques. <b>The</b> <b>decrees</b> had been carefully stowed under {{the ruins of a}} Roman mudbrick structure. <b>The</b> remaining <b>decrees</b> originate either from the same excavations or from illegal operations by local people that were sold in Luxor in 1914 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|R

5|$|In Poland, notable {{imports from}} Arabia {{included}} those of Prince Hieronymous Sanguszko (1743–1812), {{who founded the}} Slawuta stud. Poland's first state-run Arabian stud farm, Janów Podlaski, was established by <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> of Alexander I of Russia in 1817, and by 1850, the great stud farms of Poland were well-established, including Antoniny, owned by the Polish Count Potocki (who had married into the Sanguszko family); later notable as the farm that produced the stallion Skowronek.|$|E
5|$|Octavian also {{demanded that}} <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> should be {{rescinded}} which declared Antony a public enemy. When this was refused, he marched {{on the city}} with eight legions. He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on 19 August 43BC was elected consul with his relative Quintus Pedius as co-consul. Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another leading Caesarian.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Ezra (chapter 6, verses 1 to 11) {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> {{to continue}} {{reconstruction of the}} Temple in Jerusalem, specifying financial support and supplies for the temple services. This decree is dated approximately 519 BCE. Between Cyrus and Darius, an exchange of letters with King Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes is described (chapter 4, verse 7), the grandson of Darius I, during whose reign Ezra and Nehemiah came to Jerusalem. The generous funding of the temple gave Darius and his successors {{the support of the}} Jewish priesthood.|$|E

5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{granodiorite}} stele, {{found in}} 1799, inscribed with three {{versions of a}} decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King PtolemyV. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone {{proved to be the}} key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those}} who were dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work to be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|The crown {{over the}} lion and sun {{configuration}} consolidated {{the association of}} the symbol with the monarchy. The sun lost its importance as the icon of kingship and the Kiani Crown became the primary symbol of the Qajar monarchy. Under Nasir al-Din Shah, logos varied from seated, swordless lions to standing and sword-bearing lions. In February 1873, <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> for Order of Aftab (Nishan-i Afab) was issued by Nasi-al Din Shah.|$|E
