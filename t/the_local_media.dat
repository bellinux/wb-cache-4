5|$|Following {{up with a}} {{successful}} tour of India in late 1969, Chappell demonstrated his fluency against spin bowling by compiling Test innings of 138 at Delhi and 99 at Kolkata. His ability against both fast and slow bowling earned high praise, including from his captain Bill Lawry. When the Australians arrived in South Africa in early 1970, following their victory over India, Lawry told <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>media</b> that Chappell was the best all-round batsman in the world. His appraisal looked misguided when Chappell managed just 92 runs (at 11.5 average), with a top score of 34, as Australia lost 0–4.|$|E

5|$|The local {{branch of}} the TGWU refused {{to meet with a}} {{delegation}} from the West Indian Development Council, and an increasingly bitter war of words was fought out in <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>media.</b> Ron Nethercott, South West Regional Secretary of the union, persuaded a local black TGWU member, Bill Smith, to sign a statement which called for quiet negotiation to solve the dispute. It condemned Stephenson for causing potential harm to the city's black and Asian population. Nethercott launched an attack on Stephenson in the Daily Herald newspaper, calling him dishonest and irresponsible. This led to a libel case in the High Court, which awarded Stephenson damages and costs in December 1963.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{declared}} a police intervention against terrorists, <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>media</b> quickly questioned the officers' testimonies {{as well as}} the only surviving witness for inconsistencies. Although reluctant, Carlos Romero Barceló (PNP), then Governor of Puerto Rico, ordered the local Justice Department to launch various investigations, and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Justice Department to aid in the investigations, which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers' part. However, after the local opposing political party launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers' part, {{as well as the}} possibility of a local and federal cover-up. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.|$|E
5|$|When Bevin {{told the}} media {{he would have}} an {{announcement}} at his campaign headquarters on April 28, speculation raged that he would {{drop out of the}} race. Instead, Bevin announced that he would release his jobs plan later in the week and chided <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>media</b> for focusing on issues other than the economy. On May 1, Bevin released the promised jobs plan, which called for a gradual reduction of the federal corporate tax rate to 10% over five years, allowing companies to return overseas profits to the United States with a 10% tax assessment, and passage of a federal right-to-work law. Saying that burdensome regulations from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency were harmful to business' ability to create jobs, he endorsed the REINS Act, which would require congressional approval of any executive regulation with an economic impact of more than $100 million. He also proposed a flat income tax and opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage.|$|E

5|$|Burge {{moved to}} Championship club Doncaster Rovers on a {{short-term}} deal on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2011. He made his Doncaster debut as a second-half substitute in a 6–0 home defeat to Ipswich Town on 15 February 2011. That {{was to be}} his only appearance for the club. On 17 March 2011, Burge joined League Two team Oxford United on loan {{for the rest of}} the season, after impressing in a reserve game against Colchester United which Oxford won 2–0. He went straight into the starting line-up for the match against Crewe Alexandra two days later, and provided the assist for James Constable's winning goal. His first performance at Oxford received praise in <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>media.</b> A week later, Steve MacLean opened the scoring against Burton Albion, but Burge reportedly claimed the goal after the ball took a deflection off his heel on its way into the net for what would have been his first Football League goal. In mid-April 2011 he was recalled by Doncaster, and a few weeks later they offered him a new deal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} several decades, the mass African American burial site in West Palm Beach was largely {{forgotten}} by the public. The city later sold the property, which switched ownership over the years. In 1991, the property was owned by a private individual when the Sankofa Society conducted a blessing ceremony at the site, well-publicized by <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>media.</b> Around that time, Robert Hazard, a resident of West Palm Beach, established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm. In December2000, the city of West Palm Beach purchased the land back for $180,000. Plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers is dramatized in Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.|$|E
