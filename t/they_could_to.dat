5|$|Team Ninja {{kept working}} on the Ninja Gaiden project after its release, {{with the aim of}} pushing the action genre and their first such title as far as <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> <b>To</b> this end, they {{released}} downloadable expansions, known as Hurricane Packs, free of charge. Itagaki said that since the packs were born out of his team's interest, they did not care to charge players for their efforts. The two packs were available over Xbox Live {{in the third quarter of}} 2004.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E
50|$|During the {{depression}} of the 1930s, many people could not even afford the admission price of a movie ticket, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> afford <b>to</b> purchase a radio where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> listen <b>to</b> free entertainment, interspersed with commercial announcements.|$|R

5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E
5|$|No {{members of}} the general public were {{permitted}} on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.|$|E
50|$|Norfolk Accident rescue Service (NARS) {{was formed}} in 1970, when {{ambulances}} were very basic and their drivers had limited first aid training. Some local doctors recognised that if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be summoned <b>to</b> the scene of serious road traffic accidents, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> help <b>to</b> prevent people dying needlessly.|$|R

5|$|Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{said that}} {{from then on}} the British did {{everything}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> break up the Umma party and to thwart him personally. They tried without success to get tribal chiefs and village leaders to leave the Umma. He claimed {{that it was the}} Umma that forced the British to establish a committee to start drafting a constitution for an independent Sudan in 1951, a constitution that was endorsed in April 1952. However, broader considerations were anyway leading the British towards support for an independent Sudan despite attempts by the United States to persuade them to give Egypt a role.|$|E
5|$|Foiled at the AOC, boycott advocates {{turned to}} the AAU, hoping that the {{athletics}} organization, though also led by Brundage, would refuse to certify athletes for Berlin. Although no vote took place on a boycott at the AAU's December 1934 meeting, Brundage did not seek re-election, and delegates elected Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney as the new president, to take office in 1935. Although pro-boycott activities briefly fell into a lull, renewed Nazi brutality against the Jews in June 1935 sparked a resurgence, and converted Mahoney to the pro-boycott cause. In October, Baillet-Latour wrote to the three American IOC members: William May Garland, Charles Sherrill, and Ernest Lee Jahncke, asking them to do all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> ensure a US team was sent to Germany. Garland and Sherrill agreed; Jahncke, however, refused, stating {{that he would be}} supporting the boycott. Brundage, at Baillet-Latour's request, took the lead in the anti-boycott campaign. Matters came to a head at the AAU convention in December 1935. Brundage's forces won the key votes, and the AAU approved sending a team to Berlin, specifying that this did not mean it supported the Nazis. In victory, Brundage was not magnanimous, demanding the resignation of opponents. Although not all quit, Mahoney did.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> help rescue those trapped in the flood waters {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E

5|$|In early 1880 Hicks Beach {{forwarded}} {{a scheme}} for South African federation to the Cape Parliament. Kruger travelled to the Cape to agitate against the proposals alongside Joubert and Jorissen; {{by the time}} they arrived the Liberals had won an election victory in Britain and Gladstone was Prime Minister. In Cape Town, Paarl and elsewhere Kruger lobbied vigorously against the annexation and won much sympathy. Davenport suggests that this contributed to the federation plan's withdrawal, which in turn weakened the British resolve to keep the Transvaal. Kruger and Joubert wrote to Gladstone asking him to restore the South African Republic's independence, but to their astonishment the Prime Minister replied in June 1880 that he feared withdrawing from the Transvaal might lead to chaos across South Africa. Kruger concluded that they had done all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> try to regain independence peacefully, and over the following months the Transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion. Wolseley was replaced as Governor and High Commissioner by Sir George Pomeroy Colley.|$|E
25|$|Until {{as late as}} 1939, {{women in}} the ceramic {{industry}} in Britain were mostly confined to decorating, since they were thought to have special aptitude for repetitive detailed work. The trades' unions did what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> handicap women even in these occupations, for example refusing {{to allow them to}} use hand rests. Often the women were used for subordinate tasks such as filling in outlines or adding decorative sprigs.|$|E
25|$|The Secret Service {{replaced}} the Thompson submachine gun with the Uzi submachine {{gun in the}} 1970s. Uzis that the Secret Service used have slightly shorter-than-standard barrels so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> fit inside the standard size Samsonite briefcases that concealed them. They phased out the Uzi in the mid 1990s {{and replaced it with}} the H MP5. The Secret Service was the last Federal agency to use the Uzi.|$|E

25|$|Dungan troops {{based in}} Yarkand rose and in August 1864 massacred some seven {{thousand}} Chinese and their Manchu commander. The inhabitants of Kashgar, rising in their turn against their masters, invoked {{the aid of}} Sadik Beg, a Kyrgyz chief, who was reinforced by Buzurg Khan, the heir of Jahanghir Khoja, and his general Yakub Beg. The latter men were dispatched at Sadik’s request by the ruler of Khokand to raise what troops <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> aid his Muslim friends in Kashgar.|$|E
25|$|Indiana steamed out of Ulithi on 14 March for {{the crucial}} {{invasion}} of Okinawa, and until June, she steamed {{in support of}} carrier operations against Japan and Okinawa. These naval air raids did as much as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> aid the ground campaign, and damage the Japanese at home. During this period, she often repelled enemy kamikazes as the Japanese tried desperately but vainly to stem the mounting tide of defeat. In early June, Indiana rode out a terrible typhoon, and then steamed to San Pedro Bay on 13 June.|$|E
25|$|On July 5, 1742 Montiano landed nearly 1900 {{men from}} 36 ships near Gascoigne Bluff, {{close to the}} Frederica River. Faced with a {{superior}} force, Oglethorpe decided to withdraw from Fort St. Simons before the Spanish could mount an assault. He ordered the small garrison to spike the guns and slight the fort (doing what damage <b>they</b> <b>could),</b> <b>to</b> deny the Spanish full use of the military asset. The Spanish took over {{the remains of the}} fort the following day, establishing it as their base on the island.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} European release of Devil Survivor Overclocked, some bugs were prevalent; among these were various game crashes such as after the player summoned a demon during a battle and another crash {{occurring}} during the devil auction. Ghostlight, the publisher, made an announcement regarding this on March 31, 2013, {{and said that}} they were doing everything <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> fix the problems as soon as possible. On April 24, 2013, Ghostlight announced that a bug-fix patch had passed testing, and was to be submitted to Nintendo for distribution. It was released on May 28, 2013.|$|E
25|$|Always {{struggling}} with his knees, during the 1960–61 {{he started to}} be afflicted by ligament damage. The physios used whatever methods <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> reduce the swellings in his knees, and as he was a big-money signing, Charles {{would be forced to}} take to the field week in and week out, despite his injuries. His team were wildly inconsistent, beating Newcastle United 5–0, only to lose 6–0 to West Ham United a few weeks later; meanwhile supporters were anxious at the rise of their North London rivals. Arsenal finished eleventh, some 25 points behind Double-winning Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E
25|$|Australia and England {{drew the}} Test and series 1–1, with Australia {{retaining}} the Ashes {{for the fourth}} time after regaining them in 1958–59. It was the second time the two teams had drawn the series in the last three Ashes series, with 15 of the 20 Tests being drawn (the next series was also drawn 1–1). It had already been realised that the captains on both sides were unusually cautious when playing each other as so much was at stake even though Bobby Simpson and Mike Smith had done all that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> make the games interesting.|$|E
