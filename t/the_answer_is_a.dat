5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of the answers are required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E
2500|$|A crossnumber (also {{known as}} a cross-figure) is the {{numerical}} analogy of a crossword, in which the solutions to the clues are numbers instead of words. [...] Clues are usually arithmetical expressions, but can also be general knowledge clues to which <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> number or year. There are also numerical fill-in crosswords.|$|E
2500|$|Abbreviations, {{the use of}} {{a foreign}} language, variant spellings, or other unusual word tricks are {{indicated}} in the clue. A crossword creator might choose to clue the answer SEN (as in the abbreviation for [...] "senator") as [...] "Washington bigwig: Abbr." [...] or [...] "Member of Cong.", with the abbreviation in the clue indicating that the answer is to be similarly abbreviated. The use of [...] "Var." [...] indicates <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> variant spelling (e.g., EMEER instead of EMIR), while the use of foreign language or a foreign place name within the clue indicates that the answer is also in a foreign language. For example, ETE ( [...] , French for [...] "summer") might be clued as [...] "Summer, in the Sorbonne". ROMA could be clued as [...] "Italia's capital", whereas the clue [...] "Italy's capital" [...] would indicate the English spelling Rome.|$|E

2500|$|James J. Sheehan in The New York Times {{wrote that}} Kershaw clears away various misconceptions {{of the period}} and {{describes}} the terrible fate endured by the civilian population. He also wrote, [...] "No one has written a better account of the human dimensions of Nazi Germany’s end." [...] Antony Beevor in the Telegraph wrote that the subject matter is doubly important due to the massive loss {{of life in the}} final months of the war, all to no purpose. However, Ben Shepard wrote in The Guardian that the book was flawed, saying, [...] "The real difficulty with The End is that its premise is false. It simply isn't true that no one has dealt adequately with the question of why Germany kept fighting. On the contrary, historians have discussed this issue ad nauseam; Kershaw himself gave an excellent account in his monumental biography of Hitler." [...] David Cesarani called the book a [...] "magisterial summing up of the events" [...] and that [...] "it cannot be bettered for relentless analysis". Jill Stephenson, a professor emeritus of the University of Edinburgh, asked, [...] "Do we need another book on the Second World War? In general, no. But in this particular case, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> resounding 'yes'." ...|$|E

60|$|There can be {{no doubt}} that the {{behaviour}} of the French priests in this war has enormously diminished anti-clerical bitterness in France. There {{can be no}} doubt that France is far more a religious country than it was before the war. But if you ask whether that means any return to the church, any reinstatement of the church, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> doubtful one. Religion and the simple priest are stronger in France to-day; the church, I think, is weaker.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> more {{profound}} one {{than you would}} at first imagine. Plants discovered the grand principle of the rotation of crops long before man did. The farmer now knows that if he sows wheat or turnips too many years running on the same plot, he 'exhausts the soil,' as we say--deprives it of certain special mineral or animal constituents needful for that particular crop, and makes {{the growth of the}} plant, therefore, feeble or even impossible. To avoid this misfortune, he lets the land lie fallow, or varies his crops from year to year according to a regular and deliberate cycle. Well, natural selection forced the same discovery upon the plants themselves long before the farmer had dreamed of its existence. For plants, being, in the strictest sense, 'rooted to the spot,' absolutely require that all their needs should be supplied quite locally. Hence, from the very beginning, those plants which scattered their seeds widest throve the best; while those which merely dropped them on the ground under their own shadow, and on soil exhausted by their own previous demands upon it, fared ill in the struggle for life against their more discursive competitors. The result has been {{that in the long run}} few species have survived, except those which in one way or another arranged beforehand for the dispersal of their seeds and fruits over fresh and unoccupied areas of plain or hillside.|$|E
6000|$|Concerning his faults, {{perhaps the}} most {{illuminating}} thing {{that can be said}} is that critics emphasize and ordinary readers ignore them. The {{reason for this is that}} every poem has two elements, form and content: a critic looks chiefly at the one, an ordinary reader at the other. Because the form of Longfellow's verse is often faulty it is easy to criticize him, to show that he copies the work of others, that he lacks originality, that his figures are often forced or questionable; but the reader, the young reader especially, may be too much interested in the charm of the poet's story or the truth of his sentiment to dissect his poetic figures. Thus, in the best-known of his earlier poems, [...] "A Psalm of Life," [...] he uses the famous metaphor of [...] "footprints on the sands of time." [...] That is so bad a figure that to analyze is to reject it; yet it never bothers young people, who would understand the poet and like him just as well even had he written [...] "signboards" [...] instead of [...] "footprints." [...] The point is that Longfellow is so obviously a true and pleasant poet that his faults easily escape attention unless we look for them. There is perhaps no better summary of our poet's qualities than to record again the simple fact that he is the poet of young people, to whom sentiment is the very breath of life. Should you ask the reason for his supremacy in this respect, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> paradox. Longfellow was not an originator; he had no new song to sing, no new tale to tell. He was the poet of old heroes, old legends, old sentiments and ideals. Therefore he is the poet of youth.|$|E

6000|$|VIII. That {{the said}} Warren Hastings was {{bound by the}} {{essential}} principles of natural justice {{to attend to the}} claim made by the Rajah to a fair and impartial trial and inquiry into the matter of accusation brought against him by the said Hastings, at a time and place which furnished all proper materials and the presence of all necessary witnesses; but the said Hastings, instead of instituting the said inquiry and granting trial, did receive an humble request for justice from a great prince as a fresh offence, and as a personal insult to himself, and did conceive a violent passion of anger and a strong resentment thereat, declaring that he did consider the said answer as not only unsatisfactory in substance, but offensive in style. [...] "This answer you will perceive to be not only unsatisfactory in substance, but offensive in style, and less a vindication of himself than a recrimination on me. It expresses no concern for the causes of complaint contained in my letter, or desire to atone for them, nor the smallest intention to pursue a different line of conduct. An answer couched nearly in terms of defiance to requisitions of so serious a nature I could not but consider as a strong indication of that spirit of independency which the Rajah has for some years past assumed, and of which indeed I had early observed other manifest symptoms, both before and from the instant of my arrival." [...] Which representation is altogether and in all parts thereof groundless and injurious; as the substance of <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> justification proper to be pleaded, and the style, if in anything exceptionable, it is in its extreme humility, resulting rather from an unmanly and abject spirit than from anything of an offensive liberty; but being received as disrespectful by the said Hastings, it abundantly indicates the tyrannical arrogance of the said Hastings, and the depression into which the natives are sunk under the British government.|$|E
60|$|The thought will perhaps {{occur to}} the reader that Fox was not less lax than Sheridan, and yet for Fox Burke long had the sincerest friendship. He was dissolute, indolent, irregular, and the most insensate gambler that ever squandered fortune after fortune over the faro-table. It was his vices {{as much as his}} {{politics}} that made George III. hate Fox as an English Catiline. How came Burke to accept a man of this character, first for his disciple, then for his friend, and next for his leader? <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> simple one. In spite of the disorders of his life, Fox, from the time when his acquaintance with Burke began, down to the time when it came to such disastrous end, and for long years afterwards, was to the bottom of his heart as passionate for freedom, justice, and beneficence as Burke ever was. These great ends were as real, as constant, as overmastering in Fox as they were in Burke. No man was ever more deeply imbued with the generous impulses of great statesmanship, with chivalrous courage, with the magnificent spirit of devotion to high imposing causes. These qualities we may be sure, and not his power as a debater and as a declaimer, won for him in Burke's heart the admiration which found such splendid expression in a passage that will remain as a stock piece of declamation for long generations after it was first poured out as a sincere tribute of reverence and affection. Precisians, like Lafayette, might choose to see their patriotic hopes ruined rather than have them saved by Mirabeau, because Mirabeau was a debauchee. Burke's public morality was of stouter stuff, and he loved Fox because he knew that under the stains and blemishes that had been left by a deplorable education, was that sterling, inexhaustible ore in which noble sympathies are subtly compounded with resplendent powers.|$|E
60|$|Those {{who look}} upon {{the war as}} a wicked crusade of the North against the divinely sanctioned {{institutions}} of the South, and those who hope even yet to reknit the monstrous league between slavery and a party calling itself Democratic, will of course {{be willing to take}} back the seceding States without conditions. Neither of these classes is any longer formidable, either by its numbers or the character of its leaders. But there is yet a third class, who seem to have confused their minds with some fancied distinction between civil and foreign war. Holding the States to be indestructible, they seem to think that, by the mere cessation of hostilities, they are to resume their places as if nothing had happened, or rather as if this had been a mere political contest which we had carried. But it is with the people of the States, and not with any abstract sovereignty, that we have been at war, and it is of them that we are to exact conditions, and not of some convenient quasi-entity, which is not there when the battle is raging, and is there when the terms of capitulation are to be settled. No, it is slavery which made this war, and slavery which must pay the damages. While we should not by any unseemly exultation remind the Southern people that they have been conquered, we should also not be weak enough to forget that we have won the right of the victor. And what is that right, if it be not to exact indemnity for the past and security for the future? And what more nobly and satisfactorily fulfils both those conditions, than utterly to extinguish the cause of quarrel? What we fear is the foolish and weak good-nature inherent in popular government, but against which monarchies and aristocracies are insured by self-interest, which the prospect of peace is sure to arouse, and which may make our settlement a stage-reconciliation, where everybody rushes into the arms of everybody else with a fervor which {{has nothing to do with}} the living relations of the actors. We believe that the public mind should be made up as to what are the essential conditions of real and lasting peace, before it is subjected to the sentimental delusions of the inevitable era of good feeling, in which the stronger brother is so apt to play the part of Esau. If we are to try the experiment of democracy fairly, it must be tried in its fullest extent, and not half-way. The theory which grants political power to the ignorant white foreigner need not be squeamish about granting it to the ignorant black native, for the gist of the matter is in the dark mind, and not the more or less dusky skin. Of course we shall be met by the usual fallacy,--Would you confer equality on the blacks? But <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very simple one. Equality cannot be conferred on any man, be he white or black. If he be capable of it, his title is from God, and not from us. The opinion of the North is made up on the subject of emancipation, and Mr. Lincoln has announced it as the one essential preliminary to the readmission of the insurgent States. To our mind, citizenship is the necessary consequence, as it is the only effectual warranty, of freedom; and accordingly we are in favor of distinctly settling beforehand some conditional right of admission to it. We have purposely avoided any discussion on gradualism as an element in emancipation, because we consider its evil results to have been demonstrated in the British West Indies. True conservative policy is not an anodyne hiding away our evil from us in a brief forgetfulness. It looks to the long future of a nation, and dares the heroic remedy where it is scientifically sure of the nature of the disease. The only desperate case for a people is where its moral sense is paralyzed, and the first symptom is a readiness to accept an easy expedient at the sacrifice of a difficult justice. The relation which is to be final and permanent cannot be too soon decided on and put in working order, whether for the true interest of master or slave; and the only safe relation is one that shall be fearlessly true to the principles in virtue of which we asserted our own claim to autonomy, and our right to compel obedience to the government so established. Anything short of that has the weakness of an expedient which will erelong compel us to reconstruct our reconstruction, and the worse weakness of hypocrisy, which will sooner or later again lay us open to the retribution of that eternal sincerity which brings all things at last to the test of its own unswerving standard.|$|E
