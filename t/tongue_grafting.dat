50|$|In whip {{grafting}} the scion and {{the stock}} are cut slanting and then joined. The grafted point is then bound with tape and covered with soft wax to prevent dehydration and infection by germs. Also known as the whip and <b>tongue</b> <b>graft,</b> this is considered {{the most difficult to}} master but has the highest rate of success as it offers the most cambium contact between the two species. It is the most common graft used in top-dressing commercial fruit trees. It is generally used with stock less than 1/2 in diameter, with the ideal diameter closer to 3/8 in and the scion should be of roughly the same diameter as the stock.|$|R
40|$|The lip is {{the primary}} {{aesthetic}} feature of the human body. In the secondary cleft lip defor-mity, mismatch of wet and dry vermilion and lip projection may be problematic. The whistling de-formity was defined as insufficient tissue in the lower border of a repaired cleft lip, giving the appearance of whistling while in repose and worsening on ac-tivation. Many cleft lip patients require secondary reconstruction of the vermilion tubercle. Repair of vermilion deformity represents a unique challenge to the reconstructive surgeon. The methods of reconstruction of the vermilion tubercle are various and have both advantages and disadvantages. For significant deformities, rotation advancement flap reoperation is often necessary. For lesser deformities, many options exist, including local flaps, Z-plasties, <b>tongue</b> <b>grafts,</b> and fillers (eg, hyaluronic acid, collagen, and fat grafts). The uses of local axial-based flaps have also been described. In addition, an Abbe flap {{may be used to}} recruit ad-ditional lip tissue and to correct the cleft lip defor-mity. 1, 2 Kapetansky 3 described an axial-based double pendulum flap for correction of central lip deformi-ties in bilateral cleft lip patients. Our aim was to develop an effective method for correcting vermilion defects and to record our expe-rience with this useful technique for providing cover for reconstruction of the vermilion tubercle. Each patient obtained a more natural contour of the ver-milion tubercle and a more satisfactory proportion between the upper and lower lips. In the following, we introduce the design, technical details, and case experience of a new style of bilateral lip mucosa flaps (BLMF) for reconstruction of the vermilion tubercle in the secondary cleft lip deformity...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of domesticating and integrating high value fruit trees in agricultural landscapes by farmers is increasingly being {{recognized in the}} humid tropics. However in an agroforestry context, the growth attributes of intercropped trees above and belowground determine whether the association will be complementary or competitive. The focus of the present research was on two African indigenous fruit tree species (Dacryodes edulis G. Don) H. J. Lam (Burseraceae) and Allanblackia floribunda Oliv. (Clusiaceae), which are currently under domestication, and have high food, income and environmental security values. On D. edulis, the thrust was to assess and compare the structural and fine rooting systems together with the aboveground growth attributes of fruiting trees propagated sexually and vegetatively, while on A. floribunda, {{the focus was on}} how to reduce the long juvenile phase of about 10 - 12 years before first fruiting to less than 5 years through grafting techniques. The results of the investigations on D. edulis indicate that trees of seed origin were characterized by a tap root, reaching depths of about 1. 20 m, whereas, trees of cutting origin showed three strong vertical roots (d > 5 mm) with the longest reaching depths of 1. 31 m. Similarly, trees of marcot origin were observed to have thick, relatively short prominent vertical roots, reaching depths of 1. 15 m. In addition, trees of seed origin had greater fine root density (RD) (P ≤ 0. 001) than trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) in the upper soil stratum (0 - 30 cm). Trees of seed origin were also shown to have an exponential distribution pattern for fine root density and root length within depth to 80 cm. In contrast, the distribution pattern of fine roots of trees of vegetative origin (cuttings and marcots) were quadratic for the same variables which increased in the 20 - 30 cm soil depth stratum before declining steadily to a depth of 80 cm. Furthermore, shoot density, defined as, number of shoots per tree, and height differed significantly (p= 0. 004 and p= 0. 005, respectively) amongst tree origins. Trees of seed and cutting origins had single-stem shoots whereas marcots had 6 shoots per tree on average. Trees of cutting origin grew tallest, with mean height of 8. 4 ± 2. 2 m compared to 6. 7 ± 0. 9 m and 7. 6 ± 1. 9 m for trees of marcot or seed origins respectively. Mean carbon (C) sequestration estimated using allometric models differed significantly (p= 0. 014) between trees of vegetative origin and those of seed origin, with 10 years old D. edulis trees of cutting and marcot origins sequestrating averagely 26. 8 ± 19. 1 Mg C ha- 1 and 21. 74 ± 12. 8 Mg C ha- 1 respectively over 10 years, compared to 13. 10 ± 9. 4 Mg C ha- 1 for trees of seed origin. In summary, the results from the studies on D. edulis suggest that vegetative propagation on the species, besides reducing the long juvenile phase to fruiting and maintaining trueness in the transfer of desirable traits over generations, also results in trees that are apparently less competitive for belowground resources. In addition, vegetative propagated trees of D. edulis were shown to have apparently stable root system and the trees bigger in stature and higher in carbon sinks than trees of seed origin. In parallel, A. floribunda scions were taken from female trees, and grafted onto rootstocks using side tongue, top cleft, side veneer, and whip-and-tongue methods under nursery conditions. In a separate experiment, side tongue and inverted ‘T’ budding methods were also tested in situ on young A. floribunda wildings growing under semi-deciduous and evergreen tree covers. In addition, the effects of protecting side <b>tongue</b> <b>grafts</b> with non-perforated, translucent plastic, perforated translucent plastic and aluminium foil were assessed. A. floribunda was shown to be amenable to grafting both under nursery and field (in situ) conditions. Under nursery conditions, side <b>tongue</b> <b>grafts</b> were significantly more successful (80. 0 ± 6. 3 %), than grafts of side veneer (52. 5 ± 7. 9 %), top cleft (55. 0 ± 7. 9 %) and whip–and-tongue (50. 0 ± 7. 9 %). The success of side <b>tongue</b> <b>grafts</b> was further increased (86. 7 ± 6. 2 %) under evergreen shade when grafts were protected by non-perforated translucent plastic. A grafted A. floribunda tree transplanted in the field in 2007 flowered and carried a single fruit to maturity after 4 years, thereby reducing the long juvenile period to first fruit production of about 10 - 12 years reported in literature to less than 5 years. In conclusion, the effect of propagation methods on the belowground and aboveground growth attributes and their C storage potential studied in the present research on D. edulis, have not yet been studied and published anywhere according to the authors knowledge. Similarly, the reduced long juvenile period to first fruit production to less than 5 years in A. floribunda grafts reported in this research is the first published prove of concept on this species according to the author’s knowledge. Therefore, the research results presented in this thesis should be considered as pilot case studies aimed at obtaining insights into the effect of vegetative propagation methods on the above and belowground growth and development of improved planting materials of these two African indigenous fruit trees (Dacryodes edulis and Allanblackia floribunda) under domestication...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Vermilion {{irregularities}} {{are common}} secondary deformities after cleft lip repair, regressed or resected hemangiomas, trauma and tumor surgeries. Vermilion deficiency attracts considerable attention and detracts from an otherwise excel-lent lip repair. Minor and moderate vermilion defects can be corrected with upper lip advancement, rotation flaps, <b>tongue</b> flaps or <b>grafts.</b> Major defects defy correction with local flaps. A technique is described for correction of large absolute tissue defects of the vermilion using Mutual Cross-Lip Musculomu-cosal Flaps (MCLMF) Or Ahmad-Ali's flaps. METHODS This technique was applied in eight patients with major ver-milion defects secondary to hemangioma regression, neopla-sia, and trauma. Reconstruction with MCLMF led {{to create a}} balanced donor and recipient lips appearance and function. RESULTS There were no postoperative complications. Surgical results were satisfactory in all patients, and sufficient lip mobility with adequate bulk was maintained. One patient demonstrated minimal transient lip tightening. CONCLUSION Use of Ahmad-Ali's flaps in selected patients resulted in suc-cessful reconstruction of severe vermilion defects. KEYWORDS...|$|R
40|$|Background: Swallowing is {{normally}} initiated voluntarily, and afterwards presumed controlled by brainstem reflexes. Resection of the hypopharynx with reconstruction using a jejunal autograft may conceivably affect this control. Purpose: This study {{was an attempt}} to perform a biomechanical analysis of the motility in the small bowel graft and suggest possible implications for surgery. We also tried to describe how passage through the esophagus is affected by this surgery and compare our objective assessment of the patient s swallowing function with the patient s subjective experience. Material and Methods: Five patients underwent a radiological examination of the neopharyngeal conduit and esophagus and completed a questionnaire. Results: We observed a peculiar movement of the base of the tongue in all patients with varying degrees of thrust. The passage through the jejunal graft was passive and dependent on the <b>tongue</b> and gravity. <b>Graft</b> contractions were observed late in transit and only emptied a residual volume. Esophageal transport also appeared to be rather passive and largely depended upon the pull of gravity. Two out of five patients were not able to eat without restrictions regarding the consistence of the food. Their impaired swallowing resulted in severely reduced quality of life. Conclusion: Tongue thrust is essential for swallowing after pharyngolaryngectomy with reconstruction using a jejunal autograft. We report a distinct movement of the tongue in these patients, probably a compensatory mechanism for achieving propulsion of food. It seems important to implant the jejunal graft properly stretched to restore the funnel shaped opening to the esophagus as well as to avoid blind ends and bends in the jejunal conduit...|$|R
40|$|O estudo teve como finalidade avaliar a propagação de duas espécies de anonáceas (atemoia e araticum). A atemoia é um híbrido que possui características organolépticas muito apreciadas no mundo e é mais intensamente produzida em pomares na Austrália, Israel, Estados Unidos e Brasil. O araticum ou marolo é uma espécie nativa do Cerrado, apreciada localmente no Centro-Oeste e coletada extrativamente para comercialização em feiras e ruas das cidades desta região. O trabalho foi dividido em dois capítulos, o primeiro, enxertia de atemoia Thompson sobre dois porta-enxertos do gênero Rollinia e o segundo, enxertia de araticum sobre 4 porta-enxertos de anonáceas. O Capítulo I avalia a eficiência de dois porta-enxertos (Rollinia sp. e Rollinia mucosa) e dois métodos de enxertia (inglês simples e fenda lateral). Os parâmetros avaliados foram: índice de sobrevivência dos enxertos, comprimento de ramo {{principal}} e número de folhas aos 60, 75, 90 e 105 dias após a enxertia. O porta-enxerto araticum-de-terra-fria apresentou melhores resultados que o biribá, com índice de sobrevivência de 82, 5 % e 35 % respectivamente. O melhor método de enxertia para araticum-de-terra-fria foi o inglês simples com índice de sobrevivência de 90 %. O Capítulo II foi organizado em 5 experimentos para avaliação de diferentes métodos de enxertia e porta-enxertos para a propagação do araticum. O Experimento I consistiu em avaliar a habilidade e eficiência de dois enxertadores para a condução dos experimentos seguintes, quanto ao índice de sobrevivência dos enxertos, onde não foi encontrada significância estatística em nenhuma época de avaliação para o parâmetro avaliado. Nos Experimentos II, III, IV e V foi realizada a enxertia do araticum através de 5 métodos (fenda lateral, fenda cheia, inglês simples, inglês complicado e sub-casca), sobre porta-enxertos de graviola, condessa, araticum-de-terra-fria e biribá de diferentes idades. Em todos os experimentos foi avaliado o índice de sobrevivência e submetidos à análise de variância. Os experimentos de enxertia do araticum sobre 4 porta-enxertos, abrangendo 5 tipos de enxertia e totalizando 500 plantas enxertadas, mostraram que há incompatibilidade na enxertia desta planta, pois somente 3 enxertos sobreviveram. As possíveis causas da incompatibilidade foram investigadas através de estudos anatômicos e histoquímicos, através da análise do material proveniente dos experimentos com o uso dos porta-enxertos graviola, araticum-de-terra-fria e biribá. Identificou-se nos estudos diferença anatômica e presença de compostos fenólicos na região da enxertia. ________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis {{paper has}} {{the purpose of}} studying the propagation of two species of Annonaceae (atemoya and araticum). The two species chosen for this research have morphological affinities, but they also present many different features. Atemoya is a hybrid which has excellent flavor characteristics appreciated {{all around the world}} and it is grown mostly in Australia, Israel, United States and Brazil. The araticum is a native species of the Brazilian savannah, the Cerrado, and it is consumed locally in the central west region, and commercialized in local markets. A common element between these two species is the lack of propagation studies, to which the results of this research are a contribution. It is well known that grafting is a method of vegetative propagation which, besides cloning and rescuing interesting genotypes exhibits, has some advantages such as root disease resistance, trunk borer resistance, as well as inducing desirable characteristics to the canopy. This work was divided in two chapters. The first one was about atemoya Thompson grafting with two methods (side cleft graft and whip graft) onto two rootstocks (Rollinia mucosa e Rollinia sp.). The analyzed parameters were: graft survival rate, main branch length and leaf number at 60, 75, 90 and 105 days after grafting. The atemoya grafting experiment proved the efficiency of the araticum-de-terra-fria rootstock and the unviability of atemoya grafting onto the biribá rootstock (wild sweetsop). Chapter II was organized into 5 experiments for the evaluation of different grafting methods and rootstocks for araticum propagation. Experiment I assessed and compared the ability and efficiency of two grafters. For this experiment it was necessary to conduct the following procedures: The grafts survival rate was compared through an F test but no statistical significance was found in any procedure. In Experiment II, three grafting methods (side cleft, whip <b>graft,</b> whip and <b>tongue</b> <b>graft)</b> were used for araticum grafting onto soursop rootstocks, age 12 and 24 months. In Experiment III, three grafting methods (cleft, whip and whip and tongue) were evaluated for araticum grafting onto araticum-de-terra-fria rootstocks, age 9 and 21 months. The survival rate of the grafts was assessed at 60 days after grafting. In Experiment IV, four grafting methods were tested (cleft, whip graft, sub-shell and side cleft), with randomized blocks design, with 5 blocks, 5 replicates, 8 plants per parcel, totaling 200 plants. In Experiment V, two grafting methods (cleft and whip graft) were evaluated in 2 rootstocks (soursop and custard apple). The survival rate was assessed at 30 days after grafting. All the grafting experiments on 4 rootstocks, including 5 types of grafting and 500 grafted plants, have shown that araticum has grafting incompatibility, because only 3 grafts survived. Possible causes for this problem were investigated through histochemical and anatomical studies and through grafting tissue analysis from experiments of soursop, biriba (wild sweepsop) and araticum-de-terra-fria. Boards and tables record the results. It was identified anatomical differences and phenolic compounds at the graft union. Alternatives are suggested for overcoming the incompatibility in the araticum grafting, which until now has not produced viable plants of this species with the method here employed...|$|R
