40|$|Biodiesel {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{alternative}} fuels to Diesel engine among other sources due to having potential to reduce emissions. Biodiesel is a renewable, biodegradable and environment friendly fuel in nature. The advantages of biodiesel are lower exhaust gas emissions and its biodegradability and renewability compared with petroleum-based diesel fuel. The energy of the biodiesel can be released more efficiently with the concept of semi adiabatic (<b>thermal</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>coated</b> piston) engine. The objective of this study is to investigate the performance and emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection Diesel engine using 25 % biodiesel blend (rubber seed oil methyl ester) as fuel with <b>thermal</b> <b>barrier</b> <b>coated</b> piston. Initially the piston crown was coated with alumina (Al 2 O 3) of thickness of 300 micron (0. 3 mm) by plasma coating method. The results revealed that the brake thermal efficiency was increased by 4 % and brake specific fuel consumption was decreased by 9 % for B 25 with coated piston compared to un-coated piston with diesel. The smoke, CO, and HC emissions were also decreased for B 25 blend with coated piston compared with the uncoated piton engine.

Comparisons between model predictions and experimentally measured stresses and also the relationship between substrate curvature and residual stresses on subsequent spallation of the aerofoil specimen were made. For the flat specimen, predicted and measured residual stresses are of the same order of magnitude.

Steady-state heat-transfer analyses were done to optimize the size and the geometry of the cooling channels to reduce thermal stresses, and to evaluate the thermal environment experienced by the plate during burner rig testing. The limited experimental data available were used to model the thermal profile exerted by the flame on the plate. Thermal stress analyses were performed to assess the stress response due to thermal loading. Contours for the temperature and the representative stresses for the plates were generated and presented for different cooling hole sizes and shapes.

For rod specimens in a carousel, the heating rates increased with (F/A) ratio and were higher at the inward facing surface for a given (F/A). Plate specimens were more sensitive to burner variations. Calculated results are given for the radial stress in the coated rod specimens for variations in (F/A) ratios from 0. 04 to 0. 065. Over this range, the radial stress varies from 4. 3 to 5. 3 MPa. The results indicate that controlling the heating rate of a TBC by controlling the (F/A) ratio offers a potential method to prolong TBC cyclic life; uncontrolled (F/A) ratios will produce scatter in experimental results.
