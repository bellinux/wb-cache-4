By exploiting chemical, biophysical, enymological and molecular biology techniques, he has made contributions towards understanding enzymatic mechanisms.

Allemann's work on hydrogen transfer catalysing enzymes including dihydrofolate reductase has led to deep new insights into the contributions from quantum mechanical tunnelling and protein dynamics to the enormous rate accelerations typical of Nature’s catalysts. Allemann’s laboratory has been among the pioneers in synthetic biology and has developed innovative applications such as the first generation of designer enzymes, intracellular biophotonic nanoswitches (photoactivated peptides) and optogenetic tools for the control of biological processes in cell culture and in live organisms, as well as pioneering new methodology in synthetic biology for generating novel unnatural terpene-like non-natural natural products with applications in agriculture and healthcare.|$|R

40|$|Microsatellite (or simple {{sequence}} repeat, SSR) markers {{are highly}} informative DNA markers {{often used in}} conservation genetic research. Next-generation sequencing enables efficient development {{of large numbers of}} SSR markers at lower costs. Boswellia papyrifera is an economically important tree species used for frankincense production, an aromatic resinous gum exudate from bark. It grows in dry tropical forests in Africa and is threatened by a lack of rejuvenation. To help guide conservation efforts for this endangered species, we conducted an analysis of its genomic DNA sequences using Illumina paired-end sequencing. The genome size was estimated at 705 Mb per haploid genome. The reads contained one microsatellite repeat per 5. 7 kb. Based on a subset of these repeats, we developed 46 polymorphic SSR markers that amplified 2 - 12 alleles in 10 genotypes. This set included 30 trinucleotide repeat markers, four tetranucleotide repeat markers, six pentanucleotide markers and six hexanucleotide repeat markers. Several markers were cross-transferable to Boswellia pirrotae and B. popoviana. In addition, retrotransposons were identified, the reads were assembled and several contigs were identified with similarity to genes of the <b>terpene</b> <b>and</b> <b>terpenoid</b> backbone synthesis pathways, which form the major constituents of the bark resin...|$|R

Figure  4 shows a difference PTR-MS spectrum, where a background spectrum (obtained by measuring reactor off-gas passed through the catalyst) was subtracted from the off-gas measurements, from late stationary phase (119  h into experiment 3).

5000|$|Terpenes (...) are a {{large and}} diverse class of organic compounds, {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} plants, particularly conifers, and by some insects such as termites or swallowtail butterflies, which emit terpenes from their osmeteria. They often have a strong odor and may protect the plants that produce them by deterring herbivores and by attracting predators and parasites of herbivores. The difference between <b>terpenes</b> <b>and</b> <b>terpenoids</b> is that terpenes are hydrocarbons, whereas terpenoids contain additional functional groups.|$|E
5000|$|Terpenes are a {{large and}} diverse class of organic compounds, {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} plants, particularly conifers, which are often strong smelling and thus may have had a protective function. They are the major components of resin, and of turpentine produced from resin. (The name [...] "terpene" [...] is derived from the word [...] "turpentine"). Terpenes are major biosynthetic building blocks within nearly every living creature. Steroids, for example, are derivatives of the triterpene squalene. When terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as terpenoids. <b>Terpenes</b> <b>and</b> <b>terpenoids</b> are the primary constituents of the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers.

40|$|Homeland {{security}} {{relies heavily}} on analytical chemistry to identify suspicious materials and persons. Traditionally this role has focused on attribution, determining the type and origin of an explosive, for example. But as technology advances, analytical chemistry can and will {{play an important role}} in the prevention and preemption of terrorist attacks. More sensitive and selective detection techniques can allow suspicious materials and persons to be identified even before a final destructive product is made. The work presented herein focuses on the use of commercial and novel detection techniques for application to the prevention of terrorist activities. Although drugs are not commonly thought of when discussing terrorism, narcoterrorism has become a significant threat in the 21 st century. The role of the drug trade in the funding of terrorist groups is prevalent; thus, reducing the trafficking of illegal drugs can play a role in the prevention of terrorism by cutting off much needed funding. To do so, sensitive, specific, and robust analytical equipment is needed to quickly identify a suspected drug sample no matter what matrix it is in. Single Particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometry (SPAMS) is a novel technique that has previously been applied to biological and chemical detection. The current work applies SPAMS to drug analysis, identifying the active ingredients in single component, multi-component, and multi-tablet drug samples in a relatively non-destructive manner. In order to do so, a sampling apparatus was created to allow particle generation from drug tablets with on-line introduction to the SPAMS instrument. Rules trees were developed to automate the identification of drug samples on a single particle basis. A novel analytical scheme was also developed to identify suspect individuals based on chemical signatures in human breath. Human breath was sampled using an RTube{trademark} and the trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were preconcentrated using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and identified using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Modifications to the sampling apparatus allowed for increased VOC collection efficiency, and reduced the time of sampling and analysis by over 25 %. The VOCs are present in breath due to either endogenous production, or exposure to an external source through absorption, inhalation, or ingestion. Detection of these exogenous chemicals can provide information on the prior location and activities of the subject. Breath samples collected before and after exposure in a hardware store and nail salon were analyzed to investigate the prior location of a subject; breath samples collected before and after oral exposure to <b>terpenes</b> <b>and</b> <b>terpenoid</b> compounds, pseudoephedrine, <b>and</b> inhalation exposure to hexamine and other explosive related compounds were analyzed to investigate the prior activity of a subject. The elimination of such compounds from the body was also monitored. In application, this technique may provide an early warning system to identify persons of interest in the prevention and preemption stages of homeland security...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between ungulates and vegetation is dynamic, {{with changes in}} either having potential to significantly alter processes and functions of the other at various temporal and spatial scales. Past research on ungulate browse in the Pacific Northwest focused primarily on morphological impacts of browse on regenerating conifers. However, few studies have explored the influence of both plant mineral nutrition <b>and</b> <b>terpenoid</b> production on ungulate browsing behavior and plant growth patterns. A series of experiments were established for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla Raf. Sarg.), and western red-cedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don) to address: (i) ungulate browsing behavior relative to foliar nutrition <b>and</b> <b>terpenoid</b> production; (ii) the influence of simulated browse and supplemental mineral nutrition on resource allocation <b>and</b> <b>terpenoid</b> production; <b>and</b> (iii) the genetic and phenological variation of foliar <b>terpene</b> production <b>and</b> emission across varying levels of nutrient availability. In the presence of browse, the benefits of supplemental mineral nutrition differed by species. For Douglas-fir and western hemlock, these benefits were realized post-browse whereby higher nutrient resources provided recovery from browse by augmenting resources to promote growth. Western red-cedar, however, allocated additional nutrient sources toward production of oxygenated monoterpenes (alpha-, beta-thujone), which act to chemically deter browse. Olfactory cues may not come directly from the emission of alpha-, beta-thujone, but possibly originate from the high quantities of the diterpene beyerene being emitted from western red-cedar.
