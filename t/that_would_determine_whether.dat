60|$|Intelligence {{shown by}} worms in their manner of {{plugging}} up their burrows.--If {{a man had}} to plug up a small cylindrical hole, with such objects as leaves, petioles or twigs, he would drag or push them in by their pointed ends; but if these objects were very thin relatively {{to the size of}} the hole, he would probably insert some by their thicker or broader ends. The guide in his case would be intelligence. It seemed therefore worth while to observe carefully how worms dragged leaves into their burrows; whether by their tips or bases or middle parts. It seemed more especially desirable to do this in the case of plants not natives to our country; for although the habit of dragging leaves into their burrows is undoubtedly instinctive with worms, yet instinct could not tell them how to act in the case of leaves about which their progenitors knew nothing. If, moreover, worms acted solely through instinct or an unvarying inherited impulse, they would draw all kinds of leaves into their burrows in the same manner. If they have no such definite instinct, we might expect <b>that</b> chance <b>would</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> the tip, base or middle was seized. If both these alternatives are excluded, intelligence alone is left; unless the worm in each case first tries many different methods, and follows that alone which proves possible or the most easy; but to act in this manner and to try different methods makes a near approach to intelligence.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} historical development of nursing clinical information systems (CIS) in healthcare {{during the late}} twentieth century. CIS were recast as a contextually bound technological system of skills, tools, and knowledge needed to provide patient care. This recasting provided for consideration of the historical and contemporary meanings of these systems and challenged pervasive assumptions about their structure. Three tools, the Classification of Nursing Diagnosis, the American Nurses 2 ̆ 7 Association Social Policy Statement, and the Nursing Minimum Data Set, were analyzed to gain an understanding of how nurses prioritized certain types of information, skills, and knowledge, while excluding others. Primary source material from individual nurses and nursing organizations that were involved with the creation of CIS were used. The process of identifying information to be included in CIS was contentious. Individual nurses who argued on behalf of a particular piece of data or form of data, did so because of a strong belief in how nursing practice (through information collection) should be structured. Throughout the historical cases, participants paid little attention to existing practice conditions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> ultimately <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> or not the CIS would be used. Time and time again, the composition of the group determined for whom the information practice would be most useful and where the information practice would likely be applied. The development of CIS illustrated the political nature of practice, the importance of including the perspectives of those who do the work of CIS, and how, when existing conditions are ignored, CIS can fail. ...|$|R

40|$|Comunicació presentada a: Speech Prosody 2016, celebrada del 31 de maig al 3 de juny de 2016 a Boston, Estats Units. Research on verbal irony {{has found}} that {{prosodic}} features such as pitch range expansion, syllable lengthening, and specific intonational contours are common prosodic resources that languages use to mark irony in speech. Yet {{little is known about}} the relative weight of these prosodic features in the detection of irony in languages that use these three prosodic correlates. In this paper we present the results of two experiments designed to shed light on the relative contribution of the acoustic cues involved in verbal irony detection. The first experiment –a production task- was designed to confirm that these three prosodic features are typical of irony in French. Indeed, we found that these three features revealed themselves when readers produced a just read ironic utterance as opposed to a literal one. The second experiment presented the same stories as Experiment 1 ’s, but removed a single word from the context <b>that</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> an acoustically presented utterance (which had been based on a literal reading) was ironic or not. The last word in these utterances was manipulated synthetically so as to create five experimental conditions: Not Modified, Modified Pitch Range, Modified Duration, Modified Intonation, and Modified All. Results showed (a) that speakers tended to interpret utterances as ironic when all acoustic modifications (i. e. pitch range expansion, syllable lengthening and marked intonation) were presented together (i. e. Modified_All); and (b) that the Modified_Duration and Modified_Intonation conditions were significantly more likely to encourage ironic readings than the Not_Modified and Modified_Pitch_Range conditions.

We surveyed US neonatologists {{to assess their}} behavior {{in the delivery room}} when confronted with infants with gestational ages of 22 to 26 weeks. We identified 102 infants in our NICU with birth weights/gestational ages of 400 g/ 23 weeks to 750 g/ 26 weeks, whose follow-up care was ensured because of their participation in ongoing clinical trials. We determined 4 proxy measures for "how the infant looked" in the delivery room (Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and heart rates at 1 and 5 minutes) and assessed the predictive value of each marker for subsequent death or neurologic morbidity. RESULTS. For infants with birth weights of 600 g and gestational ages of 25 weeks, > 90 % of neonatologists considered resuscitation obligatory. For infants with birth weights of 500 to 600 g and gestational ages of 23 to 24 weeks, only one third of neonatologists responded <b>that</b> parental preference <b>would</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> they resuscitated the infant in the delivery room.

These are transactions other than contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements that generally are not subject to federal laws and regulations applicable to procurement contracts. In December 2000, DOD revised its Section 845 guide. The guide specifies when Section 845 agreements may be used and provides criteria for tailoring terms and conditions for each agreement. Officials from the military services and defense agencies have found the new guide useful and a significant improvement over the prior version. The Secretary of Defense has required a metric [...] the number of participating nontraditional defense contractors [...] which is measurable and directly related to each agreement. This metric is tracked and reported internally. DOD explored additional metrics, but concluded that the number of nontraditional contractors {{was the only one that}} was quantifiable and tied directly to Section 845 outcomes. DOD's annual report to Congress on Section 845 agreements consists of summaries on each agreement. However, the key metric [...] the number of nontraditional contractors [...] is not clearly presented in these reports, making it difficult to gauge DOD's progress in achieving success on this objective.

A significant Perceived Control x Stress Index interaction was found for willingness: participants low in perceived control and high in stress, as well as those high in perceived control and low in stress, exhibited the highest willingness. No such effect was found for intention. Likewise, no significant effects were found for question order.;Two individual difference measures moderated the effect of perceived control on binge drinking cognitions. For intention, locus of control interacted with manipulated control and stress: participants whose control condition matched their locus of control (i. e., high control condition and internal locus of control; low control condition and external locus of control) exhibited the highest intention, but only when stress was low. Secondly, for willingness and intention, propensity to cope using alcohol interacted with perceived control: the highest binge drinking cognitions were found for participants who reported little tendency to use alcohol as a coping mechanism and experienced low perceived control, and those who reported a high tendency to cope using alcohol and experienced high perceived control.;These results suggested that binge drinking is most likely when college students are at ease. The highest willingness and intention were found for participants that were in the least aversive conditions, suggesting that these participants may have experienced a sense of relief that induced binge drinking cognitions. Except for participants who experienced low perceived control and high stress (the most aversive combination), low willingness and intention were found for participants under aversive conditions. It may be that the academic setting and focus on task performance deterred participants from endorsing binge drinking, as this activity would hinder their current goal state. Only under the most extreme aversive conditions did willingness to binge drink increase...|$|R
