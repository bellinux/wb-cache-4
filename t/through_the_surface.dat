5|$|After a {{temporary}} closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the {{successor to the}} LNER) ended passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace permanently on 3 July 1954. British Rail freight traffic continued {{to pass through the}} station until 1964. After freight traffic ceased, the line continued to be used for occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and the Northern City line, with the stock being pulled over the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> platforms in 1972.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E

In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E

25|$|Some {{species of}} crab use a {{respiratory}} organ called a branchiostegal lung. Its gill-like structure increases {{the surface area}} for gas exchange which is more suited to taking oxygen from the air than from water.

25|$|The Deccan Traps covers {{almost all}} of Maharashtra, a part of Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh marginally. During its journey northward after {{breaking}} {{off from the rest}} of Gondwana, the Indian Plate passed over a geologic hotspot, the Réunion hotspot, which caused extensive melting underneath the Indian Craton. The melting broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the craton in a massive flood basalt event, creating the Deccan Traps. It is also thought that the Reunion hotspot caused the separation of Madagascar and India.|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{assumption}} that mass is conserved means that for any fixed control volume (for example, a spherical volume) – enclosed by a control surface – {{the rate of change}} of the mass contained in that volume is equal to the rate at which mass is passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> from outside to inside, minus the rate at which mass is passing from inside to outside. This can be expressed as an equation in integral form over the control volume.|$|E
25|$|In {{some places}} molten rock intruded into depositional sand but {{it failed to}} erupt <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> so erosion took place to expose the igneous formations. In other places molten rock erupted explosively, {{producing}} clouds of solidified lava that later fell back to earth as ash, forming a cone around the vent. In some cases, it erupted several times as a succession of lava flows from a single vent forming widespread basalt layers taking on {{the form of a}} shield. At times, molten rock came into contact with water-saturated sand and it produced superheated and highly pressurized water vapor that exploded though the earth’s surface with a devastating force creating large craters known as maars or lakes.|$|E

40|$|Small-scale devices {{operate in}} mild {{conditions}} of low nominal pressure and low local coefficient of friction, and <b>the</b> contacting <b>surfaces</b> are much smoother {{than those of}} normal engineering components. Under such conditions the role of adhesion becomes pronounced. In this work a new extended wear model is obtained by incorporating the effect of adhesion into the plastic ratchetting wear model of Kapoor et al. [Wear 212 (1997) 119 - 130]. The model describes the contact of a hard, isotropically rough surface with a wearing surface, contact being made at asperity summits. Such localised contacts lead to high pressures, which drive the plastic ratchetting. The presence of adhesion associates negative, i. e. adhesive, pressures with each contact; some asperities may have negative contact loads which act to pull <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> together. <b>The</b> load transmitted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> is thus <b>the</b> sum of the adhesive force and the applied external load. As the externally applied load is reduced to zero and becomes tensile, <b>the</b> load transmitted <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> and <b>the</b> wear volume decrease to zero. As this happens the well known Archard wear coefficient, which varies inversely with <b>the</b> load, goes <b>through</b> a singularity...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{processes}} that may be used to produce ERW pipes. Each of these processes leads to coalescence or merging of steel components into pipes. Electric current is passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> that have to be welded together; as the components being welded together resist the electric current, heat is generated which forms the weld. Pools of molten metal are formed where <b>the</b> two <b>surfaces</b> are connected as a strong electric current is passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> metal; these pools of molten metal form the weld that binds the two abutted components.|$|R
25|$|Retail {{engravers}} mainly use {{two different}} processes. The {{first and most}} common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.|$|E
25|$|Raeder {{meanwhile}} {{believed that}} Britain {{could be more}} easily defeated <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> raider strategy he favored. The initial version of his plan {{was based on the}} assumption that the fleet should be centered on panzerschiffe, long-range cruisers, and U-boats to attack British commerce. These forces would tie down British naval power and allow a smaller number of battleships to operate in the North Sea. This first draft was called Plan X; a pared-down revision was renamed Plan Y, and the final version presented to Hitler was Plan Z. Hitler rejected Raeder's proposed construction plan, which led to a more balanced fleet that incorporated the battleships Hitler sought and was accepted on 1 March 1939. Raeder planned to use the battleships and aircraft carriers in task forces to support the panzerschiffe and light cruisers attacking British merchant traffic.|$|E
25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.|$|E
