Its placement {{at the head of}} the Iron Gate gorge allowed for easy control of river traffic. It was the last military outpost on that stretch of the Danube river, which caused it to frequently be part of the final line of defense between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, especially during the periods when Serbia was Ottoman-held. The importance of the fortress is further indicated by <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>it</b> received from Sigismund and Murad II, rather than just fighting between locals and commanders of nearby cities. The Golubac Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.|$|E

Despite his wealth and {{extensive}} business travel, Gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, {{when he bought}} a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not {{the richest man in}} the world because he disliked <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>it</b> brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion.

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} {{that much of the}} area has been reduced to a {{patchwork}} of clearings for cattle ranches and peasant communities, the Lacandon contains some of the most extensive and best preserved remnants of lower montane rainforest in Mexico and Central America. The best conserved area is within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, which has about 290,000 hectares of the Reserve in good condition. The Lacandon is the best known of Mexico’s rainforest areas because of <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>it</b> has received in the press and efforts by international organizations to protect what is left of it. The Lacandon {{is one of the most}} biodiverse rainforests in the world, with as much as 25% of Mexico’s total species diversity. The predominant native vegetation is perennial high rainforest with trees that can grow to an average height of thirty meters and often to fifty or sixty including Guatteria anomala, Ceiba pentandra, Swietenia macrophylla, Terminalia amazonia and Ulmus mexicana. Mammoth Guanacaste trees shrouded in vines and bromeliads among clear running streams, enormous firms, palms and wild elephant’s ear plants can still be seen. It has 1,500 tree species, 33% of all Mexican bird species, 25% of all Mexican animal species, 44% of all Mexican diurnal butterflies and 10% of all Mexico's fish species. The jungle contains many endangered species such as the red macaw, the eagle, the tapir, the spider monkey, the howler monkeys, and the swamp crocodile. It is one of the last jungles in North America big enough to support jaguars. Central American jaguars are reported, though rare, in Selva Zoque.|$|E

25|$|Wallace Fard {{founded the}} Nation of Islam in the 1930s. Under his wing Wallace took Elijah (Poole) Muhammad, as his student and {{who later became}} {{the leader of the}} organization. The basis of the group was the belief held that Christianity was a {{religion}} that was exclusively a White man's religion, while Islam was the way for black folk; Christianity was a religion like slavery that was forced upon the people who suffered {{at the hands of the}} whites during their enslavement. The beliefs of the members of the Nation of Islam are that alike to those who follow the Koran and worship Allah under the religion of Islam. The Nation of Islam, having a foundation based on a resentment of the way Whites historically treated people of color, the group itself embraces the ideas of Black Nationalism. The group itself has since the leadership of Elijah recruited thousands of followers from all parts (prisons, and those following movements of Black pride and Nationalism). They preached that integration (into White American culture) was not the goal, but instead to unite and create their own footprint and create their own separate community and obliterate oppression. Their aim was to have their own schools, churches and support each other without any reliance on other racial groups. The members of the Nation of Islam are known as “Black Muslims”. As the group became more and more supported with public speakers and figures such as Malcolm X as their orator and so did <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>it</b> received from others outside. In 1959 the group was revealed in a documentary named “The Hate that Hate Produced”. The document shone the organization in a negative light depicting it as a black supremacy group. Even with such depiction the group did not lose support from its people. When Elijah Muhammad died his son took on the role as the leader of the Nation of Islam, converting the group into a more orthodox representation of the word of Islam, and abandoning its tendencies of violence through its beliefs. This conversion led to others to abandon the group unsatisfied with the change in ideology created a “New” Nation of Islam to reignite the flame that the group originally aimed for.|$|E

500|$|The {{inclusion}} of [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] on Harrison's otherwise self-produced 1973 album has confused some critics and reviewers. Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden noted: [...] "This {{was considered an}} underhand trick in some quarters. However, since the single had clearly not received <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>it</b> merited, {{it could be argued}} that George was simply husbanding his resources carefully." [...] On release, in an otherwise highly favourable review for Material World, Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone called the song [...] "an overblown attempt to restate the [...] spiritual message in material terms: 'Won't you try some / Baby won't you buy some.'" [...] In Melody Maker, Michael Watts wrote that the song fitted the album-wide description of Harrison's personal journey to [...] "musical iconographer" [...] status from his Beatle past. Watts considered the arrangement the [...] "most imaginative" [...] on Material World and described the recording as [...] "a fairground sound, using harpsichord and couched in waltz-time".|$|E

In 2013, Buckley wrote that unquestioning regurgitation of Nazi propaganda by writers and historians was inexcusably casual, when {{a glance at the}} facts showed that the defeat of the 7th Armoured Division by one Tiger crew led by Wittmann was a myth. Wittmann made a bold attack, which helped to stop the advance of the 4th CLY but did not make a solo effort; the action at Point 213 was led by Rolf Möbius.|$|E

500|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>it</b> {{received}} {{after its}} rediscovery, the Astronomica {{has never been}} as widely studied as other classical Latin poems. With that said, interest in the poem developed {{in the second half}} of the 20th century when scholars began to study Manilius's philosophical and scientific ideas. The first full-length English monograph on Manilius and the Astronomica was Volk's Manilius and His Intellectual Background, which was published in 2009. Two years later, Volk and Green edited Forgotten Stars: Rediscovering Manilius' Astronomica with essays from scholars worldwide. The book's purpose was to [...] "encourage readers to discover Manilius" [...] and expand scholarly interest in the Astronomica, since previous research of the work's poetic, scientific, and philosophical themes had been primarily limited to Germany, France, and Italy. And while Manilius and his poem have been analyzed by scholars, many lay readers find the Astronomica confusing and overly technical. According to Kristine Louise Haugen, [...] "The ambiguous phrases and extravagant circumlocutions necessitated by Manilius's hexameter verse must often have made the Astronomica seem, as it does today, rather like a trigonometry textbook rendered as a Saturday New York Times crossword." ...|$|E

Morrisett used the same fund-acquisition techniques as he had used for Sesame Street. The Electric Company stopped production in 1977, but continued in re-runs until 1985; it eventually {{became one of the most}} widely used TV shows in American classrooms and was revived in 2009. Starting during early 1970s, the Workshop ventured into adult programming, but found that it was difficult to make their programs accessible to all socio-economic groups. [...] During 1971, it produced a medical program for adults termed Feelin' Good, hosted by Dick Cavett, which was broadcast until 1974. According to writer Cary O'Dell, the show [...] "lacked a clear direction and never found a large audience". During 1977, the Workshop broadcast an adult drama called Best of Families, which was set in New York City around the turn of the 20th century. However, it lasted for only six or seven episodes and helped the Workshop decide to emphasize children's programs only.|$|E
