40|$|This {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the efficient method for the extraction of astaxanthin from krill. To apply supercritical fluid extraction technique in order to recover astaxanthin from krill, it is essential to know the solubility of astaxanthin in supercritical carbon dioxide(S-CO 2) with varying pressure and temperature. In this work, pure and modified S-CO 2 was used as solvent. Experiments were carried out under different conditions. The effects of different parameters, such as pressure (80 to 280 bar), temperature (35 to 45 °C), modifier volume and extraction time (1 - 4 h), on the SCO 2 extraction for oil including astaxanthin from krill were investigated in order to evaluate their influence on the yield and composition of the krill oil. Organic solvent extraction with the same sample was performed and used as a comparative method. The chemical composition of each supercritical fluid extraction sample has been analyzed by HPLC and GC and the global composition were compared with that obtained by organic solvent extraction.

40|$|A {{dielectric}} cell for deformable solids {{was constructed}} for simultaneous measurements of permit-tivity and thermal expansion. The cell equipped with two concentric guarded electrodes {{is able to}} eliminate the error due to dimensional change of specimen in the permittivity measurement and to measure the specimen thickness simultaneously. The accuracy of permittivity depends mainly on the flatness of the four concentric electrodes, which are consisted of those two guarded electrodes and their guard electrodes. The temperature range, in which the flatness of surface of the four concen-tric electrodes was ensured, was widely extended by an improved design of the cell. The cell is usable to measure a very low dielectric loss owing to the three-terminal configuration for each guard-ed electrode. The performance of the cell was tested by measuring the dielectric and dilatometric properties of undecanoic, <b>tridecanoic,</b> and pentadecanoic <b>acids.</b> These acids show a cosiderable change of their lattice spacings at the transition temperature and show an extremely low dielectric loss near 200 K.

Milk and cheeses were evaluated from crossbred Holstein × Zebu, fed diets enriched with 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % inclusion levels of palm kernel cake in concentrated supplement, which were supplied daily (3. 0 kg). Milk and fresh cheese (p = 0. 001) fatty acids C 12 : 0 exhibited quadratic negative values. Milk fatty acids C 13 : 0, C 20 : 0, C 18 : 2 t 10 c 12, and C 20 : 2 n- 6 presented positive quadratic values. The milk C 18 : 2 n- 6 decreased linearly and in fresh cheese exhibited an increasing linear effect (p = 0. 016). However, the fatty acids grouped in milk fat were not affected.

The observed antioxidant capacities against accumulation of the lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) increased with increasing the alkyl chain length and became saturated for dodecanoic acid (C 12) or higher fatty acid monoesters, for which the capacities were much greater than those of DHS, its <b>tridecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 13) diester, and PhSeSePh.

The significance of the influence of the experimental parameters such as volume of catalyst, volume of n-hexane, incubation temperature, incubation time and the number of extraction steps on derivatisation was established by statistical screening with a factorial approach. Derivatisation was confirmed using attenuated total reflectance infrared (ATR) and 1 H NMR spectrum.

Except at a high concentration of linoleic acid, all the fatty acids examined induced the translocation of γ-PKC–GFP from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane within 30 s with a return to the cytoplasm in 3 min, but they had no effect on γ-PKC–GFP in the nucleus. Arachidonic and linoleic acids induced slow translocation of ε-PKC–GFP from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region, whereas the other fatty acids (except for palmitic acid) induced rapid translocation to the plasma membrane. The target site of the slower translocation of ε-PKC–GFP by arachidonic acid was identified as the Golgi network. The critical concentration of fatty acid that induced translocation varied among the 11 fatty acids tested. In general, a higher concentration was required to induce the translocation of ε-PKC–GFP than that of γ-PKC–GFP, the exceptions being <b>tridecanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid.

Teichoic acid (250 micrograms/ml) was nontoxic under identical conditions. These cytotoxicity results suggest an LTA involvement in group B streptococcal pathogenesis. Also, the first model system for the study of group B streptococcal adherence to primary human embryonic amnion cells in tissue culture is detailed. This system was used to quantitate pronounced differences in tissue tropism between S. agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes and showed enhanced binding by this group A coccus over that of S. agalactiae for amnion cell monolayers. The adherence of both streptococcal species to only a portion (40 %) of these amnion cells suggested that host cell receptor expression may vary for primary cells in vitro. Finally, this strain of S. agalactiae was shown to adhere to amnion cells by a non-LTA-mediated mechanism.

The extract were analyzed with an appropriate Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The reproducibility of extraction and of chromatographic analysis was proved. The identification of extraction in both extraction technique has been intensively studied. In comparison of these two techniques to extraction of TPC in leaves, stems and flowers of Stevia rebaudiana, MAE had a higher extraction efficiency with reduces extraction time. The yield of TPC in leaves of Stevia rebaudiana was 100. 385 mg GAE/g dw and in stems was 18. 702 mg GAE/g dw at concentration 0. 1 g/ml. Meanwhile, the yield TPC in flowers was 64. 461 mg GAE/g dw at the concentration 0. 06 g/ml after 12 min running using MAE. The qualitative GC-MS analysis of the extract from leaves, stems and flowers of Stevia rebaudiana showed that total ion chromatogram (TIC) of Soxhlet and MAE shows some valuable constituents of extracts such as Octadecanoic acid, nHexadecanoic acid, 1 -Octadecene, Taraxasterol, <b>Tridecanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> D-allose,Morpinan, Benzene rings, Stigmasterol, β-Sitosterol, γ-Sitosterol, α-Amyrin,Longifolenaldehyde, Allo-inisitol, Neo-inositol, Azulene, and Phenol.

The analysis of sample was carried out by using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass-Spectrophotometer (ICP-MS) to analyze the Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Magnesium (Mg), plumbum (Pb),Selenium (Se), Zinc (Zn), aluminium (Al), silver (Ag), Cobalt (Co), calcium (Ca),manganese (Mn) and nickel (Ni). The accumulation of heavy metals in leaves, stems, and flowers of Stevia rebaudiana contain fifteen heavy metals below tolerance limit in plant and can be used as food products...|$|E

Studies indicate that nitrogen deprivation of algal cultures could result in higher accumulation of nitrogen-poor carbon compounds such as polysaccharides and fats, a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis and decline in nitrogenous photosynthetic pigments or the reduction in thylakoid stacking and absorption. The aims of this study are to determine if changes in the nitrogen availability in the culture medium will affect the growth rate, oil yields and fatty acid composition of two species of diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Nitzchia sp. Media were prepared with three different concentrations of nitrogen (as NaNO 3), being 0. 882 mM (100 % of recommended concentration), 0. 661 mM (75 %) and 0. 441 mM (50 %). The 75 % N-treated Phaeodactylum tricornutum cultures had lower maximum cell densities (11, 496 * 103), but reached maximum cell density in a shorter time (8. 33 days), had higher total oil yields (104. 6 mg) and higher oil content as a percentage of cell mass (50. 75 %) than the 100 % treatment. Similarity analysis and PERMANOVA indicate nitrogen had a significant effect on fatty acid profiles, particularly between the 50 % and 100 % N treatments. One of the more abundant fatty acids of existing industrial significance is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Production of this compound declined significantly with declining nitrogen availability. Due to low growth rates in all Nitzchia sp. cultures, insufficient biomass could be produced to provide multiple replicate extractions for quantitative statistical comparisons and replicates were pooled to provide a single extract for gas chromatograph analysis. The 100 % N-treated culture of Nitzchia sp. reached highest maximum cell densities (4, 965 * 103) and highest percentages of oil per cell mass (37. 62 %). However, the 50 % N-treated Nitzchia sp. cultures produced higher total oil yields (176. 9 mg) than both 100 % and 75 % N-treated Nitzchia sp. cells (161. 0 mg and 135. 3, respectively). The 50 % N-treated Nitzchia sp. were the only cultures to produce 11, 14, 17 - eicosatrienoic (0. 0122 mg *mL- 1 n-hexane), lignoceric acid (0. 0149 mg*mL- 1 n-hexane) and <b>tridecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 00183 mg *mL- 1 n-hexane). As in Phaeodactylum tricornutum, the 100 % Ntreated Nitzchia sp. cells produced the highest concentration of EPA (1. 68 mg*mL- 1 n-hexane). The results show that, depending on the objectives of the culturing and the nature of the industry, total oil production could be increased by some reduction in the nitrogen levels of the culture medium. This could also influence the financial feasibility of such projects. However, nitrogen limitation reduces {{production of}} some oils of industrial significance and reduces the biomass of cells that are maintained by the culture medium. Optimising oil production will therefore require a balance between supporting cell growth and stimulating total oil yields, but for some particular oils, maximising growth will also maximise yield...|$|E
