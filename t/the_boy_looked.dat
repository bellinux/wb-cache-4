500|$|In September, Generation X and the Clash {{reached the}} top forty with, respectively, [...] "Your Generation" [...] and [...] "Complete Control". X-Ray Spex' [...] "Oh Bondage Up Yours!" [...] didn't chart, but it became a {{requisite}} item for punk fans. BBC refused to play [...] "Oh Bondage..." [...] due to its controversial lyrics. [...] In October, the Sex Pistols hit number eight with [...] "Holidays in the Sun", followed by the release of their first and only [...] "official" [...] album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. Inspiring yet another round of controversy, it topped the British charts. In December, {{one of the first}} books about punk rock was published: <b>The</b> <b>Boy</b> <b>Looked</b> at Johnny, by Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons.|$|E
60|$|At this {{announcement}} <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> questioningly at each other.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> rather anxiously at one another, but {{continued}} silent.|$|R
60|$|Still no answer, and <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> at {{each other}} in amazement.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> round, without, however, {{moving his}} fishing-pole.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> around helplessly, {{with the}} air of a caged tiger.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> astonished, {{and leaned}} over the box in his lap eagerly.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> at each other, {{but no one}} {{volunteered to}} give information.|$|R
60|$|The man {{then went}} on his way, and left <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looking</b> after him.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> {{around for}} a policeman, but none {{happened}} to be in sight.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> at him doubtfully, {{and led the}} way to the lift.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> up into Osgod's {{face with}} an {{expression}} of earnest affection.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> at him, {{but said}} nothing. He {{had not the}} faintest notion.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> around, but saw no {{papers of}} any kind in the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> over <b>the</b> car and, {{accustomed}} as {{they had}} been to face danger, were appalled.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> at {{each other}} in alarm, and as they stood {{motionless}} the mysterious sound was repeated.|$|R
60|$|Claus gently {{stroked his}} head, and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> {{up at him}} and smiled.|$|E
60|$|Val {{smiled up}} at him half-sorry, and yet amused. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> so upset.|$|E
60|$|Instead of Mowbray, Carlyon came in. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> anxious, {{but he was}} calm.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> at each other. Nobody {{had seen}} Merwell or the former teacher of Oak Hall in that vicinity.|$|R
60|$|In {{a minute}} or two, he pointed down, and <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> and saw {{something}} bright and glittering on the bottom.|$|R
50|$|The shop {{shown on}} the cover is in Banbury, Oxfordshire, and <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looking</b> into <b>the</b> window is Chris Leslie's son, Sam.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> at the man. There was {{an excited}} {{appearance}} upon the broker's features.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> up and down, with {{a guilty}} air, and a cunning, cynical reserve.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> up. He had a fair, smooth face, but lips like Trent's own.|$|E
6000|$|... "She’s a rakish-looking craft," [...] said <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> <b>looking</b> round <b>the</b> dingy old tub {{with much}} satisfaction; [...] "but where’s your arms?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are these our enemies, then?" [...] asked <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> <b>looking</b> with {{surprise}} upon the fat little King, who {{had begun to}} tremble violently.|$|R
60|$|Granser's voice faltered {{and broke}} at the recollection, and the weak tears {{streamed}} {{down his cheeks}} while <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> on and giggled.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> at {{her with}} some doubt and surprise, but she went on again without heeding it.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> surprised. The idea of his teacher's {{trying to}} perplex and embarrass him, was entirely new.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>looked</b> wistfully {{into her}} anxious eye, {{and then he}} bent his own hesitating glance on the calm {{features}} of the free-trader.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> {{guilty and}} ashamed, {{but they did}} not feel really penitent. They were not cordially reconciled. Neither was willing to give up.|$|R
60|$|But {{the wolf}} was past doing further harm, and having assured {{themselves}} of this <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> <b>looked</b> {{at what he}} had been carrying away.|$|R
60|$|He got up leisurely, and Ormsgill, {{who called}} to <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> <b>looked</b> at Nares as they plodded {{into the forest}} that skirted the swamp.|$|R
