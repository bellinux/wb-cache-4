2500|$|Wallace {{was raised}} as a Presbyterian. In college, however, he became {{increasingly}} dissatisfied with organized religion after reading William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902). Around 1919 he stopped attending the Presbyterian church {{and spent the}} next ten years exploring other religious faiths and traditions, including spiritualism and esoteric religion. He later said, [...] "I know I am often called a mystic, and in the years following my leaving the United Presbyterian Church I was probably a practical mystic ... I'd say I was a mystic in the sense that George Washington Carver was – who believed God was in everything and <b>therefore,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> went to God, you could find the answers." [...] Wallace joined the Theosophical Society on June 6, 1925, and that same year helped organize a Des Moines parish of the Liberal Catholic Church, a denomination with ties to theosophy, but which had no ties to the Roman Catholic Church. He resigned from the Theosophical Society on or before November 23, 1935, and in 1939 formally joined the Episcopal Church.|$|E
