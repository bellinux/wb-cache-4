It seems that {{in this area of}} Operational Research, as in many others, implementation lags far behind theory. In this paper, written jointly by the client and the researcher, we suggest that there is an equally important 'third dimension' concerned with practical and interpersonal issues which is often overlooked in tackling cutting stock problems.

40|$|ED EPSInternational audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} {{approximate}} and exact algorithms for the double constrained two-dimensional guillotine cutting stock problem (DCTDC). The approximate algorithm is a two-stage procedure. The first stage attempts {{to produce a}} starting feasible solution to DCTDC by solving a single constrained <b>two</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>cutting</b> problem, CDTC. If the solution to CTDC is not feasible to DCTDC, the second stage is used to eliminate non-feasibility. The exact algorithm is a branch-and-bound that uses efficient lower and upper bounding schemes. It starts with a lower bound reached by the approximate two-stage algorithm. At each internal node of the branching tree, a tailored upper bound is obtained by solving (relaxed) knapsack problems. To speed up the branch and bound, we implement, in addition to ordered data structures of lists, symmetry, duplicate, and non-feasibility detection strategies which fathom some unnecessary branches. We evaluate {{the performance of the}} algorithm on different problem instances which can become benchmark problems for the cutting and packing literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{combinatorial}} optimization problem considered {{in this paper}} is a special <b>two</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>cutting</b> stock problem arising in the wood, metal and glass industry. Given a demand of non oriented small rectangles and a theoretically in nite set of large stock rectangles of given lengths and widths, {{the aim is to}} generate layouts with minimal waste, specifying how to cut the demand out of the stock rectangles. Special restrictions are chosen with respect to the production conditions of the at glass industry. An iterative algorithm for solving this problem heuristically is developed. By a maximum weight matching suitable rectangles are matched in every iteration step and the matched pairs are considered as new, so called meta rectangles. These meta rectangles can be treated {{in the same way as}} ordinary rectangles. Furthermore, by the use of shape functions the orientations of the demand rectangles are not xed until the layout has been computed. The algorithm, programmed in C, has been tested with several instances, containing between 52 and 161 rectangles, taken from real demands of a glass factory. The resulting layouts, calculated within a few minutes (on a PC- 486), have anaverage waste of less than 6 percent. ...|$|E

40|$|Through the use {{of design}} for {{manufacturing}} (DfM) method {{and looking at the}} relations between its potential application in architectural production and its implementation using digital manufacturing technologies, we analyze building construction processes and explore, in more detail curved surface fabrication using <b>two</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>cutting</b> and three dimensional milling processes. Afterwards a DfM model for curved surfaces fabrication using three-axis computer numerical control (CNC) router is proposed. The proposed DfM model relies fundamentally in two supporting factors, the implementation of design heuristics that integrates production knowledge and the availability of some design related to production evaluation metrics. Subsequently, we test and refine the model using structured design experiences. This was accomplished by capturing new design heuristics and detecting useful evaluation metrics for production. In the final part of the research, a refined DfM model was tested in a component design case study. The case study is based on producing a curved surface module on wood for an existing proprietary component based wall system.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} a {{new problem}} in the irregular packing literature that has existed in industry for decades; two-dimensional irregular (convex) bin packing with guillotine constraints. Due to the cutting process of certain materials, cuts are restricted to extend from one edge of the stock-sheet to another, called guillotine cutting. This constraint is common place in glass cutting and is an important constraints in two-dimensional cutting and packing problems. In the literature, various exact and approximate algorithms exist for finding the <b>two</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>cutting</b> patterns that satisfy the guillotine cutting constraint. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, all of the algorithms are designed for solving rectangular cutting where cuts are orthogonal with the edges of the stock-sheet. In order to satisfy the guillotine cutting constraint using these approaches, when the pieces are non-rectangular, practitioners implement a two stage approach. First, pieces are enclosed within rectangle shapes and then the rectangles are packed. Clearly, imposing this condition is likely to lead to additional waste. This paper aims to generate guillotine-cutting layouts of irregular shapes using a number of strategies. The investigation compares two two-stage approaches; one approximates pieces by rectangles, the other approximates pairs of pieces by rectangles using phi-functions for optimal clustering. Both these approaches use state of the art rectangle bin packing with guillotine constraints. Further, we design and implement a one-stage approach using a self-adapted forest search algorithm. Experimental results show the one-stage strategy to produce good solutions in less time over the two-stage approach...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we deal with}} two {{problems}} of resource allocation solved through a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming approach and a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Chance Constraint Programming approach. In the first part we propose a framework to model general guillotine restrictions in <b>two</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>cutting</b> problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILP). The modeling framework requires a pseudo-polynomial number of variables and constraints, which can be effectively enumerated for medium-size instances. Our modeling of general guillotine cuts {{is the first one}} that, once it is implemented within a state of-the-art MIP solver, can tackle instances of challenging size. Our objective is to propose a way of modeling general guillotine cuts via Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP), i. e., we do not limit the number of stages (restriction (ii)), nor impose the cuts to be restricted (restriction (iii)). We only ask the cuts to be guillotine ones (restriction (i)). We mainly concentrate our analysis on the Guillotine Two Dimensional Knapsack Problem (G 2 KP), for which a model, and an exact procedure able to significantly improve the computational performance, are given. In the second part we present a Branch-and-Cut algorithm for a class of Nonlinear Chance Constrained Mathematical Optimization Problems with a finite number of scenarios. This class corresponds to the problems that can be reformulated as Deterministic Convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming problems, but the size of the reformulation is large and quickly becomes impractical as the number of scenarios grows. We apply the Branch-and-Cut algorithm to the Mid-Term Hydro Scheduling Problem, for which we propose a chance-constrained formulation. A computational study using data from ten hydro plants in Greece shows that the proposed methodology solves instances orders of magnitude faster than applying a general-purpose solver for Convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Problems to the deterministic reformulation, and scales much better with the number of scenarios. ...|$|E
