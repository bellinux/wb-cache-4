500|$|For {{the most}} part, audio systems both {{professional}} and domestic, have their components interconnected with low impedance outputs connected to high impedance inputs. [...] These impedances are poorly defined and nominal impedances {{are not usually}} assigned {{for this kind of}} connection. [...] The exact impedances make little difference to performance as long as the latter is many times larger than the former. [...] This is a common interconnection scheme, not just for audio, but for electronic units in general which form part of a larger equipment or are only connected over a short distance. [...] Where audio needs to be transmitted over large distances, which is often the case in broadcast engineering, considerations of matching and reflections dictate that a telecommunications standard is used, which would normally mean using 600 Ω nominal impedance (although other standards are sometimes encountered, such as sending at 75 Ω and receiving at 600 Ω which has bandwidth advantages). [...] The nominal impedance of the transmission line and of the amplifiers and equalisers in the <b>transmission</b> <b>chain</b> will all be the same value.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of how much the outcomes of cultural evolution are shaped by the cognitive capacities of human learners has been explored in several disciplines, including psychology, anthropology and linguistics. We address this question through a detailed investigation of <b>transmission</b> <b>chains,</b> in which each person passes information to another along a chain. We review mathematical and empirical evidence that shows that under general conditions, and across experimental paradigms, the information passed along <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> will be affected by the inductive biases of the people involved—the constraints on learning and memory, which influence conclusions from limited data. The mathematical analysis considers the case where each person is a rational Bayesian agent. The empirical work consists of behavioural experiments in which human participants are shown to operate in the manner predicted by the Bayesian framework. Specifically, in situations in which each person's response is used to determine the data seen by the next person, people converge on concepts consistent with their inductive biases irrespective of the information seen by the first member of the chain. We then relate the Bayesian analysis of <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> to models of biological evolution, clarifying how chains of individuals correspond to population-level models and how selective forces can be incorporated into our models. Taken together, these results indicate how laboratory studies of <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> can provide information about the dynamics of cultural evolution and illustrate that inductive biases can {{have a significant impact on}} these dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{determinants}} of virus transmission is a fundamental step for effective design of screening and intervention strategies to control viral epidemics. Phylogenetic analysis can be a valid approach for the identification of <b>transmission</b> <b>chains,</b> and very-large data sets can be analysed through parallel computation. Here we propose and validate a new methodology for the partition of large-scale phylogenies and the inference of transmission clusters. This approach, {{on the basis of}} a depth-first search algorithm, conjugates the evaluation of node reliability, tree topology and patristic distance analysis. The method has been applied to identify transmission clusters of a phylogeny of 11, 541 human immunodeficiency virus- 1 subtype B pol gene sequences from a large Italian cohort. Molecular <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> were characterized by means of different clinical/demographic factors, such as the interaction between male homosexuals and male heterosexuals. Our method takes an advantage of a flexible notion of transmission cluster and can become a general framework to analyse other epidemics. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

30|$|We {{presented}} a two-scale modeling approach for irregular cellular solids. On the micro-scale, we use beam models - an approach which implies {{a significant degree}} of idealization but is computationally much more efficient than for example modeling the microstructure with (Cauchy-) continuum elements. Computational cost {{is an important factor}} when dealing with strongly disordered microstructures where load is internally distributed in a strongly heterogeneous manner through force <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> (Liebenstein et al. 2017): for small sample sizes as considered here, such force <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> may span the entire sample and their stochastic character causes significant sample-to-sample variations. Hence, an efficient computational scheme is indispensable in order to capture the statistics of variations and to reliably determine the average behavior of samples with a given degree of irregularity. Despite the large sample-to-sample variability, the computational efficiency of beam models allows us to determine not only macroscopic stiffnesses but also smooth stress, strain, and rotation fields by averaging over sufficiently large ensembles of typically 6000 microstructure realizations for each system size and irregularity.|$|R

To confirm and further explore preliminary data in Senegal, we aimed to determine 3 years after a first study the HIV- 1 genetic diversity in three different viral regions. From 109 samples available in 2007, 93 were sequenced in gag, 77 in env, and 60 in pol. Phylogenetic analysis showed that subtype C predominated (38 - 52 %), followed by CRF 02 _AG (30 - 40 %), subtype B (13 - 17 %), and CRF 09 _cpx (2. 6 - 5 %). Subsubtype A 3 and strains tightly linked to CRF 43 _ 02 G were identified in env and gag, respectively, and 12 % of the samples were unique recombinants. Six <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> involving two to seven individuals were identified. Some strains carried resistance mutations inside <b>transmission</b> <b>chains.</b> This study confirmed the existence of a dual epidemic in Senegal and emphasized the need to strengthen prevention programs to avoid strains intermixing between low-risk women and high-risk men...|$|R
40|$|Three {{parallel}} <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> of {{measles virus}} (MV) variant ‘D 8 -Villupuram’ (D 8 -V) originated from two coinciding international mass gathering (MG) events in Rimini, Italy, in June 2011.

Secondary spread of D 8 -V was restricted to two generations of transmission in Slovenia {{as well as in}} Germany where the virus was further disseminated at another MG. Serological and epidemiological investigation of the D 8 -V-associated German and Slovenian cases revealed different antibody responses and age distributions. Primary infected young persons between 11 and 27 years-old were affected in Germany, whereas the group of Slovenian cases comprised adults aged from 28 to 47 years and a high proportion (9 / 14; 64 %) of patients with secondary vaccine failure (SVF).

30|$|Our {{next step}} is to use the data from the micro-scale beam models in order to parametrize a macroscopic, Cosserat-type {{continuum}} model. The standard approach is a (bottom-up) homogenization where one seeks to derive macroscopic, effective materials properties through averaging the micro-heterogeneous material response over a representative volume element (RVE). We note that these methods may be problematic when it comes to assessing size dependent effects in structurally disordered materials which exhibit strongly heterogeneous stress and strain patterns with long-range correlations. This is the case in our micro-scale simulations: As demonstrated by Liebenstein et al. (2017), stress transmission in the strongly disordered beam models (high disorder parameter β) occurs through correlated stress <b>transmission</b> <b>chains.</b> In the regime of system sizes where size effects are relevant, in other words in the range of interest for a higher-order continuum model that incorporates internal length scales, these correlated stress <b>transmission</b> <b>chains</b> span the entire simulated sample. Since these chains are of stochastic nature, this leads to very significant sample-to-sample fluctuations in the macroscopic response. In other words, the simulated micro-sample sizes themselves are below the RVE scale.|$|R
