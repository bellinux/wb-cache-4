5|$|In 1882, {{the first}} {{hydroelectric}} power plant in the United States was built at the falls on Upton Island. <b>The</b> <b>Brush</b> Electric Company, headed by Charles F. Brush, supplied the equipment, which included five generators. The electricity was transmitted via four circuits to shops on Washington Avenue. The power plant turned on the lights on September 5, 1882, {{just ahead of the}} Vulcan Street Plant in Appleton, Wisconsin, which started generating electricity on September 30. The company competed with the Minneapolis Gas Light Company, which later became Minnegasco and is now part of CenterPoint Energy.|$|E
40|$|The {{system of}} two polymer brushes in a near-critical binary mixture {{of good and}} poor {{solvents}} is studied {{within the framework of}} the Alexander-de Gennes model. When <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> do not overlap, the problem is shown to be analogous to the system of two hard walls in a near critical binary mixture. As in the two-wall case, it is found that the disjoining pressure between <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> is negative. This attractive interaction, which arises from the preferential attraction of the good solvent to <b>the</b> <b>brushes,</b> has a range comparable to the correlation length of the mixture. When <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> do overlap, <b>the</b> interaction between <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> is repulsive. This leads to a minimum in the disjoining pressure at contact...|$|R

40|$|In graph {{cleaning}} problems, brushes clean a graph by traversing it {{subject to}} certain rules. Various problems arise, such as determining the {{minimum number of}} brushes that are required to clean the entire graph. This number is called <b>the</b> <b>brushing</b> number. Here, we study a new variant of <b>the</b> <b>brushing</b> problem in which one vertex is cleaned at a time, but more than one brush may traverse a dirty edge. In particular, we obtain results on <b>the</b> <b>brushing</b> number of Cartesian products of graphs and trees, as well as {{upper and lower bounds}} on <b>the</b> <b>brushing</b> number in <b>the</b> general case...|$|R

In 1949, the turnpike commission began enquiring into funding for this road, which would run from Irwin to the Ohio border near Youngstown, bypassing Pittsburgh to the north. That September, $77 million in bonds were sold to finance construction of the western extension. Groundbreaking for the extension took place on October 24, 1949. It was scheduled to take place at <b>the</b> <b>Brush</b> Creek viaduct in Irwin with Governor Duff in attendance.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare <b>the</b> <b>brushing</b> number of a graph with the zero-forcing {{number of its}} line graph. We prove that the zero-forcing number of the line graph is an upper bound for <b>the</b> <b>brushing</b> number by {{constructing}} a brush configuration based on a zero-forcing set for the line graph. Using a similar construction, we also prove the conjecture that the zero-forcing number of a graph {{is no more than}} the zero-forcing number of its line graph; moreover we prove that <b>the</b> <b>brushing</b> number of a graph is no more than <b>the</b> <b>brushing</b> number of its line graph. All three bounds are shown to be tight. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
40|$|The anion-specific {{solvation}} and conformational {{behavior of}} weakly basic poly(2 -dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (poly(DMA)), poly(2 -diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (poly(DEA)), and poly(2 -diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate (poly(DPA)) brushes, with correspondingly increasing inherent hydrophobicity, {{have been investigated}} using in situ ellipsometric and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements. In <b>the</b> osmotic <b>brush</b> regime, as <b>the</b> initial low concentration of salt is increased, <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> osmotically swell by the uptake of solvent as they become charged and the attractive hydrophobic inter- and intrachain interactions are overcome. With increased ionic strength, <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> move into <b>the</b> salted <b>brush</b> regime where they desolvate and collapse as their electrostatic charge is screened. Here, as <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> collapse, they transition to more uniform and rigid conformations, which dissipate less energy, than similarly solvated brushes at lower ionic strength. Significantly, in these distinct regimes brush behavior is not only ionic strength dependent but is also influenced {{by the nature of}} the added salt based on its position in the well-known Hofmeister or lyotropic series, with potassium acetate, nitrate, and thiocyanate investigated. The strongly kosmotropic acetate anions display low affinity for the hydrophobic polymers, and largely unscreened electrosteric repulsions allow <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> to remain highly solvated at higher acetate concentrations. The mildly chaotropic nitrate and strongly chaotropic thiocyanate anions exhibit a polymer hydrophobicity-dependent affinity for <b>the</b> <b>brushes.</b> Increasing thiocyanate concentration causes <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> to collapse at lower ionic strength than for the other two anions. This study of weak polybasic <b>brushes</b> demonstrates <b>the</b> importance of all ion, solvent, and polymer interactions...|$|R

Red-capped robins have been observed to be particularly aggressive in driving Horsfield's bronze cuckoos from their territories in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found parasitised there.|$|E
5|$|Mark Rathbun {{spent only}} {{four days in}} the Hole in 2004 but says that he left after seeing his old friend Tom De Vocht being {{physically}} beaten by Miscavige. According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered to jog to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|Mauve took Van Gogh on as {{a student}} and {{introduced}} him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with <b>the</b> <b>brush.</b> He wrote that he {{was surprised at how}} good the results were.|$|E

The soldiers were ordered to find their way east on foot. Having started the offensive with about 5,800 men, 60 tanks (including 30 Tiger IIs), 3 flak tanks, 75 half-tracks, 14 20mm Flak Wagons, 27 75mm assault guns, plus 105 and 150mm SP Howitzers, Hitler's prized Kampfgruppe was reduced to 800 S.S. troopers creeping through <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> at night, trying to get back to their own line.|$|E
5|$|The {{sunflowers}} {{were painted}} {{to decorate the}} walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House's guest room in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Becca becomes hurt upon {{realising}} that Bradley and Stacey {{are getting}} married. While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return <b>the</b> <b>brush,</b> but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got away with it as she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E

5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at each end of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and <b>the</b> <b>Brush</b> Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of the}} carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform.

25|$|Japanese {{calligraphy}} {{was influenced}} by, and influenced, Zen thought. For any {{particular piece of}} paper, the calligrapher has but one chance to create with <b>the</b> <b>brush.</b> <b>The</b> <b>brush</b> strokes cannot be corrected, and even a lack of confidence {{shows up in the}} work. The calligrapher must concentrate and be fluid in execution. <b>The</b> <b>brush</b> writes a statement about the calligrapher at a moment in time (see Hitsuzendō, the Zen way of <b>the</b> <b>brush).</b> Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ensō or circle of enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|How <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> is held {{depends on}} the {{calligrapher}} and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches {{the upper part of}} the shaft of <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script.|$|E
5000|$|Due to friction, <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> {{and copper}} {{commutator}} segments wear out. In small consumer {{products such as}} power tools and appliances <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> may {{last as long as}} the product, but larger machines require regular replacement of brushes and occasional resurfacing of the commutator. So commutated machines are not used in equipment at remote locations that must operate for long periods without maintenance.|$|R
25|$|Many of the {{limitations}} of the classic commutator DC motor are due to <b>the</b> need for <b>brushes</b> to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> cross <b>the</b> insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of <b>the</b> <b>brushes.</b> This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of <b>the</b> <b>brushes,</b> in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.|$|R

25|$|The size of interdental brushes is {{standardized}} in ISO 16409. <b>The</b> <b>brush</b> size, {{which is}} a number between 0 (small space between teeth) and 8 (large space), indicates the passage hole diameter.
