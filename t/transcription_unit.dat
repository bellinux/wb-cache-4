25|$|The {{stretch of}} DNA {{transcribed}} into an RNA molecule {{is called a}} <b>transcription</b> <b>unit</b> and encodes at least one gene. If the gene encodes a protein, the transcription produces messenger RNA (mRNA); the mRNA, in turn, serves as a template for the protein's synthesis through translation. Alternatively, the transcribed gene may encode for either non-coding RNA (such as microRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), or other enzymatic RNA molecules called ribozymes. Overall, RNA helps synthesize, regulate, and process proteins; it therefore plays {{a fundamental role in}} performing functions within a cell.|$|E
2500|$|A DNA <b>transcription</b> <b>unit</b> {{encoding}} for {{a protein}} may contain both a coding sequence, {{which will be}} translated into the protein, and regulatory sequences, which direct and regulate the synthesis of that protein.

2500|$|Active RNA Pol II {{transcription}} holoenzymes can be {{clustered in}} the nucleus, in discrete sites called transcription factories. There are ~8,000 such {{factories in the}} nucleoplasm of a HeLa cell, but only 100-300 RNAP II foci per nucleus in erythroid cells, {{as in many other}} tissue types. The number of transcription factories in tissues is far more restricted than indicated by previous estimates from cultured cells. [...] As an active <b>transcription</b> <b>unit</b> is usually associated with only one Pol II holoenzyme, a polymerase II factory may contain on average ~8 holoenzymes. Colocalization of transcribed genes has not been observed when using cultured fibroblast-like cells. Differentiated or committed tissue types have a limited number of available transcription sites. Estimates show that erythroid cells express at least 4,000 genes, so many genes are obliged to seek out and share the same factory.|$|E

Transcription first appears in germinal vesicles 25 - 40 /tm in diameter, when the oocyte is in early diplotene. Transcription at this stage consists of arrays of short RNP transcripts, irregularly distributed along the DNP axis. Linear regression ana-lysis has shown {{that many of these}} arrays are <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> (Type 1) with the transcripts having a common point of origin. The lengths of these early <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> (mean = 706 ± 506 ftm), calculated from the linear regression data, are comparable to the lengths of <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> from later stages, including Dumont stage 3. The polymerase granules of Type 1 <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> are widely and irregularly spaced, having a mean spacing of 5 ° 5 ± 748 nm.

40|$|Recombinase-mediated {{cassette}} exchange (RMCE) is {{a powerful}} tool for unidirectional integration of DNA fragments of interest into a pre-determined genome locale. In this report, we examined how the efficiency of dual RMCE catalyzed by Flp and Cre depends on the nature of <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> that express the recombinases. The following recombinase <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> were analyzed: (i) Flp and Cre genes expressed as individual <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> located on different vectors, (ii) Flp and Cre genes expressed as individual <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> located on the same vector, (iii) Flp and Cre genes expressed from a single promoter and separated by internal ribosome entry sequence and (iv) Flp and Cre coding sequences separated by the 2 A peptide and expressed as a single gene. We found that the highest level of dual RMCE (35 – 45 % of the transfected cells) can be achieved when Flp and Cre recombinases are expressed as Flp– 2 A–Cre and Flp–IRES–Cre <b>transcription</b> <b>units.</b> In contrast, the lowest level of dual RMCE (∼ 1 % of the transfected cells) is achieved when Flp and Cre are expressed as individual <b>transcription</b> <b>units.</b> The analysis shows that it is the relative Flp–to–Cre ratio that critically affects the efficiency of dual RMCE.

50|$|A {{nonsense}} mutation in one gene of an operon prevents {{the translation of}} subsequent genes in the unit. This effect is called mutational polarity. A common cause {{is the absence of}} the mRNA corresponding to the subsequent (distal) parts of the unit. Suppose that there are Rho-dependent terminators within the <b>transcription</b> <b>unit,</b> that is, before the terminator that usually is used. Normally these earlier terminators are not used, because the ribosome prevents Rho from reaching RNA polymerase. But a {{nonsense mutation}} releases the ribosome, so that Rho is free to attach to and/or move along the RNA, enabling it to act on RNA polymerase at the terminator. As a result, the enzyme is released, and the distal regions of the <b>transcription</b> <b>unit</b> are never transcribed.|$|E

2500|$|Active <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> are {{clustered}} in the nucleus, in discrete sites called transcription factories or euchromatin.

Transcription factories can also be localized using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} or marked by antibodies directed against polymerases. There are ~10,000 factories in the nucleoplasm of a HeLa cell, among which are ~8,000 polymerase II factories and ~2,000 polymerase III factories. Each polymerase II factory contains ~8 polymerases. As most active <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> are associated with only one polymerase, each factory usually contains ~8 different <b>transcription</b> <b>units.</b> These units might be associated through promoters and/or enhancers, with loops forming a [...] "cloud" [...] around the factor.|$|R

40|$|At least 8 % of {{the human}} genome was formed by {{integration}} of retroviral DNA sequences. Here we analyze the forces directing the accumulation of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) by comparing de novo HERV integration targeting with the distribution of fixed HERV elements in the human genome. All known genomic HERVs are inactive due to mutation, but we were able to study integration targeting using a reconstituted consensus HERV-K (designated HERV-KCon). We found that HERV-KCon integrated preferentially in <b>transcription</b> <b>units,</b> in gene-rich regions, and near features associated with active <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> and associated regulatory regions. In contrast, genomic HERV-K proviruses are found preferentially outside <b>transcription</b> <b>units.</b> The minority of genomic HERVKs present inside <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> are in opposite transcriptional orientation relative to the host gene, the orientation predicted to be minimally disruptive to host mRNA synthesis, but de novo HERV-KCon integration within <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> showed no orientation bias. We also found that the youngest HERV-K elements in the human genome showed a distribution intermediate between de novo HERV-KCon integration sites and older fixed HERV-Ks. These findings indicate that accumulation of HERVs in the human germline is a two-step process: integration targeting biases direct initial accumulation, then purifying selection leads to loss of proviruses disrupting gene function.

40|$|Many {{chloroplast}} {{genes are}} co-transcribed in polycistronic <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> that {{give rise to}} numerous overlapping RNAs, but the significance of this pattern of transcript accumulation is not understood. An analysis of the transcripts of the adjacent and divergent maize psbE-psbF-psbL-ORF 40 and ORF 31 -petE-ORF 42 gene clusters indicates that transcription initiation at alternative promoters contributes to the generation of overlapping RNAs for both clusters. Furthermore, developmentally varying transcript ratios for the ORF 31 -petE-ORF 42 gene cluster are determined at least in part by selective promoter usage. During light-induced plastid maturation, increased levels of primarily monocistronic petE transcripts accumulate from a promoter upstream of the internal petE gene. Dark-predominant and non-light-responsive bi- and tricistronic transcripts result from transcription initiation upstream of ORF 31, the proximal gene of the cluster. In addition to the transcriptional overlap within gene clusters, divergent <b>transcription</b> <b>units</b> for the two gene clusters overlap and reciprocal antisense RNAs accumulate.

However, MBP-related transcripts are also present in the bone marrow and the immune system. These mRNAs arise from the long MBP gene (otherwise called [...] "Golli-MBP") that contains 3 additional exons located upstream of the classic MBP exons. Alternative splicing from the Golli and the MBP transcription start sites gives rise to 2 sets of MBP-related transcripts and gene products. The Golli mRNAs contain 3 exons unique to Golli-MBP, spliced in-frame to 1 or more MBP exons. They encode hybrid proteins that have N-terminal Golli aa sequence linked to MBP aa sequence. The second family of transcripts contain only MBP exons and produce the well-characterized myelin basic proteins.
