5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E

In this process, called adsorption, arsenic sticks to the surfaces of deep sediment particles and is naturally removed from the ground water.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the reason}} for employing keelmen was the poor state of the navigation on the Tyne and Wear, which prevented ships from moving up river without danger of grounding. As time went by this situation gradually worsened. Colliers arriving at the river mouth would have a ballast of sand {{that had to be}} disposed of. The correct method of doing this was to deposit the sand on specified areas on the riverbank provided for the purpose or by depositing the sand in the sea. The Wear had ballast keels that were used to unload the ballast from colliers and <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to sea. There were penalties for depositing ballast in the river, but this often occurred. The result was that the riverbed became silted up, causing even more navigational difficulties. Additionally, industry on the riverbanks often deposited its waste products in the river. The situation on the Tyne became so bad that in 1850 the Tyne Navigation Act was passed, which gave control of the river to the Tyne Improvement Commission. This body began an extensive program of dredging to substantially deepen the riverbed. This program was completed in 1888 so that the largest colliers could pass right up to Newcastle and beyond. This deepening of the river meant that colliers could load coal from the staithes without the need for keels to complete the work. In 1876 the existing bridge at Newcastle was replaced by the Swing Bridge, which rotated to allow ships to pass up and down river. This allowed colliers to be loaded from staithes above Newcastle and so further sealed the fate of the keelmen.|$|E

This is the first time Ivan [...] "actually vocalises it" [...] and he is shocked because [...] "he has ever considered anyone to be his boyfriend before". Paul then invites Ivan out for dinner with his father, but Ivan is not ready to come out. The actor said that Ivan needs more time until he feels comfortable with the situation. Ivan's ex-wife Jordan (Erin Shanagher) caught him with another man, outed him and which resulted in a [...] "horrendous" [...] reaction from those he knew. Brocklebank said that this causes his reluctance to come out again because [...] "he's become scared about opening himself up to a new community of people and is worried about the villagers' reaction." ...|$|E

500|$|Besides Big Sugar, Douglas {{spoke about}} the damage the Army Corps of Engineers was doing to the Everglades by {{diverting}} the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than [...] of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central & South Florida Project (C), run by {{former members of the}} Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable. [...] "What a liar I turned out to be!" [...] remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, [...] "Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, so now they <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on us by playing with cement".|$|E
500|$|According to reports, {{the group}} had been eating and {{drinking}} together and [...] "having a party" [...] earlier in the day. Although the charter bus which Ram Singh drove on weekdays was not permitted to pick up public passengers or even to operate in Delhi because of its tinted windows, they decided to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> [...] "to have some fun". A few hours before committing the gang rape, the attackers had robbed a carpenter. The carpenter was 35-years old Ram Adhar who boarded the bus which was being driven by Mukesh Singh. The juvenile convict had lured him into the bus saying {{it was going to}} Nehru Place. He was then beaten up, robbed of his cellphone and 1500 in cash. After robbing him, the group dumped him at the IIT Flyover. Ram reported about the group in the bus robbing him to three police constables Kailash, Ashok and Sandeep who were passing nearby. They however refused to take action saying that the crime scene wasn't under their purview as they were from the Hauz Khas police station and he will have to report the incident to the Vasant Vihar police station.|$|E
500|$|On January 18, 1909, Brenner {{submitted}} {{models to}} the Mint with a Lincoln profile on the obverse, and a reverse design {{very similar to}} that on the then-current French silver coins, showing a tree branch. [...] He also proposed designs for a Lincoln half dollar, with the late president to appear on one side, and a standing Liberty design—almost identical to the obverse of the same French coins. [...] Leach replied on [...] that no change to the half dollar could be made without congressional approval. [...] By , Leach had discovered the origin of the branch design—although numismatic historian Don Taxay notes that it is odd Leach had not discovered the source of the standing Liberty design, given that they were {{on opposite sides of the}} same French coins. [...] Leach did not confront the sculptor with the artistic borrowing, but instead simply ruled out the submitted designs as unsuitable for the reverse of the cent. [...] He urged the sculptor to prepare a simple design, bearing the denomination, the country's name, and the motto [...] "E pluribus unum". [...] Brenner worked quickly, and on , delivered models for both obverse and reverse similar to the eventual coin, though with a somewhat larger bust of Lincoln, and the motto [...] "In God We Trust" [...] omitted. [...] As a design element on the reverse, Brenner used two ears of durum wheat. [...] The designs were shown to President Roosevelt, who approved them although Roosevelt required [...] "UNITED", which Brenner had spelled [...] "VNITED", to be spelled in the conventional way. After Leach examined the models, he objected to the fact that Brenner had put his full surname on the obverse. [...] Brenner wrote in return, [...] "I shall <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and put it in small letters on the reverse." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{initially}} {{intended to}} title the album Metal Up Your Ass with the cover featuring a hand clutching a dagger {{emerging from a}} toilet bowl. However, Zazula convinced them to change this as he thought distributors would not stock it. The final cover featured {{the shadow of a}} hand letting go of a bloodied hammer. Burton was credited with coming up with the name Kill 'Em All—referring to timid record distributors, saying, [...] "Those record company fuckers... kill 'em all!"—as a response to the situation. Ulrich thought Kill 'Em All was a good name, and Zazula agreed. Burton suggested to Gary L. Heard, also responsible for the Metallica photograph on the back cover, to feature a bloodied hammer on the album art. According to Hammett, [...] "Cliff carried a hammer with him everywhere he went. He always had a hammer in his luggage, and he would <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> occasionally and start destroying things." [...] Even though the original title was unused, the band did later release a [...] "Metal Up Your Ass" [...] T-shirt with the proposed artwork. A live bootleg recording of a 1982 performance at the Old Waldorf, titled Metal Up Your Ass (Live), featured the original cover artwork. Original pressings of the album came with an inner sleeve that included pictures and lyrics as well as a silver label on the vinyl. Subsequent pressings had a blank white sleeve and standard album label. The 1988 reissue re-introduced the lyrics and photos. The original release can be distinguished by the words [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] {{at the top of the}} back cover. This was dropped from the reissue. The phrase [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] was dedicated to San Francisco fan Ray Burch, known for his headbanging at the band's early shows.|$|E
