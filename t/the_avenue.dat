5|$|In 1985, US218 was {{bypassed}} around Iowa City and Coralville, joining I-380 at the I-80 interchange. US218 to Cedar Rapids {{was replaced}} by Iowa 965. In the early 1990s, most of I-380 was designated as part of <b>the</b> <b>Avenue</b> of the Saints corridor, which connects St. Louis, Missouri, to St. Paul, Minnesota. Avenue of the Saints route markers were erected along the route the next year. In August 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Avenue</b> of the Saints in Iowa was given a single designation, Iowa27, to facilitate following the route through the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} along Alrov Mamilla Avenue are spaced irregularly {{rather than}} {{placed in a}} continuous line. The open areas between the buildings accommodate different types of public areas, while the spaces themselves afford views of the historic landmarks beyond <b>the</b> <b>avenue,</b> such as the Tower of David and Jaffa Gate. The buildings lining <b>the</b> <b>avenue</b> range in height from three to six stories, with the higher stories set back from the street line. There is also a two-story, domed atrium housing shops and restaurants.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Avenues</b> lie just {{northeast}} of downtown Salt Lake City and just east - over City Creek Canyon - from Capitol Hill. The neighborhood {{to the east}} of the lower (below 11th) Avenues, known as Federal Heights, is traditionally thought of as beginning north of South Temple Street and East of Virginia Street. While physically part of <b>the</b> <b>Avenues,</b> <b>the</b> Federal Heights neighborhood may be considered as generally more affluent than <b>the</b> <b>Avenues,</b> with larger, more stately homes. To the north of Federal Heights is a more recently developed area called Arlington Hills.

5|$|Construction of I-380 took 12 {{years to}} complete, ending in 1985. After the interstate opened, US218 was moved onto the new freeway. In the 1990s, the I-380 {{corridor}} {{was selected as}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Avenue</b> of the Saints corridor, which Iowa designated as Iowa Highway 27 in 2001.

50|$|Transportation {{was a major}} {{draw for}} {{settlement}} in <b>the</b> <b>Avenues.</b> <b>The</b> Salt Lake Railway Company offered mule and horse-drawn trolley rides in <b>the</b> <b>Avenues</b> by 1872, and the trolleys became electric in 1889.

The trolley system expanded {{to other parts of}} the city as the Utah Light and Traction Company, but rail lines were denser in <b>the</b> <b>Avenues</b> than any other part of the city save downtown. The tracks were removed in the 1940s after National City Lines acquired (and dismantled) the trolley lines.|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War Swakeleys House was requisitioned by the {{military}} and a searchlight battery established in the grounds.

5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere.

Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace a one-way street. <b>The</b> <b>Avenue</b> is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E

5|$|The Second Avenue Line trunk {{would be}} {{extended}} to 149th Street {{to allow for a}} transfer to the Third Avenue Elevated.

5|$|This period saw a major {{expansion}} of la ville moyenne, which spread along the lower hilltops and {{slopes of the}} city centered around the French Residency. Modern urban planning was applied in la ville basse ("lower town"), which expanded {{from the base of}} the city's central hills into the surrounding rice fields. Major boulevards like Avenue de l'Indépendance, planned commercial areas like the arcades lining either side of <b>the</b> <b>Avenue,</b> large parks, city squares and other landmark features were built. A railway system connecting Soarano station at one end of <b>the</b> <b>Avenue</b> de l'Indépendance in Antananarive with Toamasina and Fianarantsoa was established in 1897. Beyond these planned spaces, neighborhoods densely populated by working class Malagasy expanded without state oversight or control.|$|E
5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. On the Upper East Side, prices of real estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of <b>the</b> <b>avenue</b> had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{of housing}} in the Smestad area started after Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei (KES) {{established}} a tramway from the city center to Majorstuen in 1894. Four years later, fund-raising started to build the Aker Avenue towards Smestad, but the recession made fund-raising difficult. The plans were launched again in 1904, and subsequently revised in 1908, by which time they including a tramway along <b>the</b> <b>avenue.</b> In 1910, A. S. Guldberg, Iver Lycke, W. Munthes-Kaas and H. A. Mørk applied for a concession to build a tramway along the route. This was granted by the municipal council in Aker on 26 May. The four individuals then transferred their rights to the municipality, who started negotiating rights with KES, and Holmenkolbanen—the latter who had a suburban tramway running from Majorstuen, the Holmenkollen Line.|$|E
