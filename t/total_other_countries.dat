40|$|The U.

S. current-account deficits. The {{resulting}} global imbalances are neither sustainable nor equitable. Capital should be recycled to poorer countries, instead of funneled, overwhelmingly, to the world?s largest rich country. Low-income countries need a substantially higher injection of real external resources and should be allowed to pursue more expansionary, growth-oriented economic policies. Blaming capital-exporting developing countries, such as China, for global imbalances is not the answer. Such countries are merely succeeding in developing rapidly. <b>Other</b> rich <b>countries,</b> which account for most capital exports, have {{to take the lead in}} dramatically restructuring their expenditures. They will be able thereafter to absorb a greater share of developing-country exports. The danger of a recession in the U. S. is rising, threatening growth in the rest of the world. U. S. policymakers have to move aggressively to contain private consumption, especially real estate spending, in favor of productive private investment, and boost exports relative to imports. Without such a structural adjustment, the danger of a ?hard landing? for the U. S. economy?and, by implication, for the rest of the world?will escalate.

40|$|While {{the weapons}} of state armed forces are not the largest major small arms category—civilian small arms appear to outnumber their {{military}} counterparts worldwide by over three to one—they are a serious factor in conflict and violence, and the focus of much international small arms diplomacy (Small Arms Survey, 2006, pp. 37 – 38). Military-owned small arms also constitute the world’s largest centrally controlled stockpiles, forming the content of massive transfers and raising vital control issues (Small Arms Survey, 2004, p. 54). As this Research Note shows, despite their reputation for military secrecy, governments sometimes reveal their military small arms holdings. Based on these acknowledged holdings, estimating methods permit the calculation of approximate military-owned small arms <b>totals</b> for <b>other</b> <b>countries.</b> These sources and methods show that state militaries worldwide hold roughly 200 million small arms, {{out of a total}} of some 875 million firearms of all kinds worldwide (Small Arms Survey, 2007). Almost 25 per cent of the global military total belongs to just 2 countries, while 50 per cent belongs to 20 countries (see Figure 1 and Table 4). The totals owned by particular countries have changed since 2007, with global military procurement of newly manufactured weapons apparently outstripping surplus destruction (Karp, 2010, p. 4). Consequently, these totals must be used with caution and updated where possible. This Research Note complements others on estimations of civilian and law enforcement Figure 1. The largest reported and estimated military-owned small arms inventories small arms holdings (Small Arms Survey, 2011; 2012). The armed forces covered here are military services, typically under ministries of defence, not civilian law enforcement agencies or paramilitary agencies under other ministries. For comparability, this Research Note emphasizes military-owned small arms, as defined by the UN Panel of Governmental Experts (UNGA, 1997, para. 26). Light weapons are not included systematically, because estimating procedures remain more speculative, although some may creep into country totals due to idiosyncratic national reporting procedures and definitions.

Trends {{in total}} {{mortality}} and mortality {{from heart disease}} in 26 countries from 1950 to 1978. International Journal of Epidemiology 1985, 14 : 510 - 520. Death rates for total mortality and for non-rheumatic heart disease and hypertension (‘heart disease') are described {{for men and women}} ages 45 - 64 in six time periods during 1950 - 78 for 26 countries. Rates for men in high-rate countries are three times those in low-rate countries. This variation is more striking for men than women. There were marked increases for heart disease in men in most countries, but in 13 countries there was a slowing or reversal of that trend in the 1960 's or 1970 's or acceleration of an already downward trend. In 22 countries long-term declines for heart disease occurred in women. There was a widening of the north/south gradient in Europe and of the male/female ratio of heart disease mortality. Countries with high heart disease death rates in men had high ratios of heart disease to <b>total</b> death. <b>Other</b> <b>countries</b> experienced a rise in proportionate mortality. In women, proportionate mortality for heart disease remained flat or declined in most countries. In spite of these changes in rates, each country seems to have a range for heart disease mortality that is characteristic of its population and environmental setting so that profound changes in rates do not substantially alter their relative ranking. Our intent is to stimulate the search for reasons why heart disease mortality recently declined in some countries but not in others (already begun in the WHO-sponsored MONICA programme). Our forthcoming monograph on international mortality trends for the major causes of death will be a next step in this proces...|$|R
