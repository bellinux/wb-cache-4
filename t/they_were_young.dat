5|$|Dogs {{were tied}} with strings around the belly {{and kept in}} the house where they were raised as a food source {{alongside}} domesticated pigs. Seen as a delicacy, they were served during feasts and to the high chiefs. Dogs were less abundant than pigs in the islands, possibly because they were killed while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>young.</b> European visitors noticed the native women, especially those who lost their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.|$|E
5|$|After the boys' {{father died}} while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>young,</b> {{responsibility}} for their education fell to their mother. Cornelia ensured the brothers had the best available Greek tutors, teaching them oratory and political science. The brothers were also well trained in martial pursuits; in horsemanship and combat they outshone all their peers. The older brother Tiberius was elected an augur at only 16 – according to the historian J.C. Stobart, had he taken the easy path rather than the cause of radical reform, {{he would have been}} clearly destined for consulship. Tiberius was the most distinguished young officer in the Third Punic War, Rome's last campaign against Carthage. He was the first to scale Carthage's walls; before that he saved an army of 20,000 men by skilled diplomacy. As the boys grew up, they developed strong connections with the ruling elite.|$|E

Tolkien was very {{devoted to his}} children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>young.</b> Each year more characters were added, such as the North Polar Bear (Father Christmas's helper), the Snow Man (his gardener), Ilbereth the elf (his secretary), and various other, minor characters. The major characters would relate tales of Father Christmas's battles against goblins who rode on bats and the various pranks committed by the North Polar Bear.|$|E

He was first attached to the household of Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, the half-brother of King Henry IV of Castile. After Alfonso's death in 1468 Córdoba devoted himself to Alfonso's sister, Isabella of Castile.|$|E
25|$|For braver souls, {{impatient}} with efforts to abolish slavery within the law, {{there were always}} illegal methods. Slaves escaped independently; most often <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>young</b> males, as they could move more freely than women with children. Free blacks and white supporters of abolition of slavery gradually organized a number of safe places and guides, creating the Underground Railroad to help slaves gain safety in Northern states. The many Indian trails and waterways of Maryland, {{and in particular the}} countless inlets of the Chesapeake Bay, afforded numerous ways to escape north by boat or land, with many people going to Pennsylvania as the nearest free state. Supporters would shelter refugees, and sometimes give them food and clothing.|$|E
25|$|Having {{addressed}} the social prejudices against him, Socrates addresses the first accusation — the moral corruption of Athenian youth — by accusing his accuser, Meletus, of being {{indifferent to the}} persons and things about which he professes to care. Whilst interrogating Meletus, Socrates says {{that no one would}} intentionally corrupt another person — because the corrupter later stands to be harmed in vengeance by the corrupted person. The matter of moral corruption is important for two reasons: (i) corruption is the accusation that he (Socrates) corrupted the rich, young men of Athens by teaching atheism; (ii) that if he is convicted of corruption, it will be because the playwright Aristophanes already had corrupted the minds of his audience, when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>young,</b> by lampooning Socrates as the “Sophistical philosopher” in The Clouds, a comic play produced about twenty-four years earlier.|$|E

25|$|Duryodhana's {{hatred for}} the Pandavas stems from his sincere belief that he—being {{the son of}} the eldest brother—is the heir {{apparent}} to the throne of Hastinapura. Because of his blindness, his father had to renounce the throne in favor of the younger Pandu. Duryodhana deeply believed that what was rightfully his was being given away to his older cousin Yudhishthira. He also felt that the Pandavas were sons of Kunti and Gods (devakin), not of Pandu. He never believed that their divine origin alone proved their superiority, on many occasions questioning their merits, and always calling them the 'Kaunteya' (sons of Kunti). He also bore a deep hatred of Bhima, who was his age and dominated his brothers in sport and skill with his immense physical power and strength. When <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>young,</b> Bhima's bullying and taunting were a constant source of pain for Duryodhana and his brothers.|$|E
25|$|In February 1835, {{seven days}} {{out on a}} voyage between Alexandria, Virginia and Charleston, South Carolina, the American brig Enterprise was driven {{off-course}} by a hurricane and forced to put in for provisions at Hamilton, Bermuda, a British colony. When the customs officers arrived on the large, 127-ton ship on February 11, they discovered that it held a total of 78 slaves, in what they reported were appalling conditions. The captives were not listed on the ship's manifest for cargo. Alexandria and Washington, DC comprised a major market for slaves from the Chesapeake Bay area, of Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, being sold and shipped to the Deep South. Most of the slaves on the Enterprise were owned by Joseph Neal, and they were highly valuable, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>young,</b> American-born and spoke English. They were listed as mostly {{between the ages of}} 7 and 15, and 19 to 25. There were a total of 41 females and 37 males.|$|E
