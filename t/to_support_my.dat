25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E

She also cited her work as a dancer as being one of many inspirations for the songs on Pretty on the Inside: [...] "I was blonde, wore makeup, had <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> band by dancing, and had to play this ridiculous archetype at work... so I took, you know, high heels and white pumps, and I had a wiglet—I just took that and messed with it." ...|$|E

He was unable to contact team owner Andre Levingston, who did not assist or help him. Monteiro responded to the charges by claiming that they were unfair. In a statement on May 11, he said, [...] "I am looking for help to fight these unjust sanctions and fines so I can continue to work and be able <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> family. The investigation was not full. The truth of what happened is being ignored. I have not been contacted by any league representative." ...|$|E

I involved Native Women in researching and editing my novel to fairly and accurately represent them. in open-ended interviews they described their experiences of nature, enjoyment, and discrimination {{as well as}} their critiques of the novel itself. Descriptions were of discrimination as perceived difference, originating from their own people, originating from inequality, and of language as both cultural understanding and a stage for discrimination. Critiques varied about representation of estrangement and language, but consistently clarified and corroborated material in addition <b>to</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>my</b> methodology.

William Huskisson already believed that he was dying and had resigned himself to his fate; Emily Huskisson at first caused [...] "a dreadful scene... but at last she calmed herself and {{during the rest of the}} time sat weeping by the couch". Huskisson told Brandreth [...] "You see I shall never live to make any return for your kindness. You have done all that is possible, but it is all in vain."

On October 23, {{less than a week}} before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury. Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now. I work very hard to stay healthy, and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult.

On June 7, 1956, he resigned from the force to concentrate on his writing career.
