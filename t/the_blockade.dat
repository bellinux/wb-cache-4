5|$|By October 6 the Egyptian naval {{task force}} was at Bab-el-Mandeb where they broke radio silence. When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry {{authorized}} the fleet {{to proceed with}} <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> via a codeword. Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased. <b>The</b> <b>blockade</b> was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> due to the long distance between Israel and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid {{at the entrance to}} the Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a blockade was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> was censored in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Although {{pleased with}} {{the result of the}} engagement, Lord Keith issued strict {{instructions}} that Nelson was to remain in active command of <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> and on no account to return to Palermo. If {{he had to go to}} port in Sicily, then he was to use Syracuse instead. Keith then sailed to Livorno, where his flagship was destroyed in a sudden fire that killed over 700 of the crew, although Keith himself was not on board at the time. By early March, Nelson had tired of <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> and in defiance of Keith's instructions returned to Palermo again, leaving Captain Thomas Troubridge of HMS Culloden in command of <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> squadron. In March, while Nelson was absent at Palermo, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell, the last survivor of the Nile, attempted to break out of Malta but was chased down and defeated by a British squadron led by Berry in Foudroyant. Although Nelson briefly returned in April, both of the Hamiltons were aboard his ship and most of his time was spent at Marsa Sirocco in the company of Emma, with whom he was now romantically attached.|$|E
5|$|Forts Monroe and Wool {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. <b>The</b> <b>blockade,</b> initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further <b>the</b> <b>blockade,</b> the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island. For most of {{the first year of the}} war, the Confederacy could do little to oppose or dislodge them.|$|E
50|$|A close {{blockade}} entails placing warships {{within sight of}} <b>the</b> <b>blockaded</b> coast or port, to ensure the immediate interception of any ship entering or leaving. It is both {{the most effective and}} the most difficult form of blockade to implement. Difficulties arise because <b>the</b> <b>blockading</b> ships must remain continuously at sea, exposed to storms and hardship, usually far from any support, and vulnerable to sudden attack from <b>the</b> <b>blockaded</b> side, whose ships may stay safe in harbor until they choose to come out.|$|R
50|$|Starting in June, Uruguay demanded {{before the}} Mercosur Tribunal that Argentina {{be punished for}} <b>the</b> <b>blockades,</b> and that it be forced to pay reparations, {{following}} the Treaty of Asunción, which guarantees the free circulation {{of goods and services}} between Mercosur members. On 9 August, Uruguayan representatives presented their claims, centered in two points: first, that <b>the</b> <b>blockades</b> during <b>the</b> summer had caused grave economic damage to Uruguay (calculated in $400 million losses); and second, that the Argentine government did not act to prevent or lift <b>the</b> <b>blockades.</b>|$|R

5|$|Occupying {{the extreme}} eastern {{position}} of <b>the</b> <b>blockade,</b> Indiana {{fired at the}} cruisers Infanta María Teresa and Almirante Oquendo {{as they left the}} harbor, but, due to engine problems, was unable {{to keep up with the}} Spanish cruisers as they fled to the west. When the Spanish destroyers Plutón and Furor emerged, Indiana was near the harbor entrance and, together with Iowa, she supported the armed yacht Gloucester in the destruction of the lightly armored enemy ships. She was then ordered to keep up <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> of the harbor in case more Spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining Spanish cruisers, Vizcaya and Cristóbal Colón.|$|E
5|$|Over 500 extras {{were used}} for the {{next-to-last}} scene, <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> of the building at Daley Center, including 200 National Guardsmen, 100 state and city police officers, with 15 horses for the mounted police (and three each Sherman tanks, helicopters, and fire engines).|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a blow for the French {{defenders}} of Martinique, who were isolated from France and suffering from shortages {{of military and}} food supplies. Although another supply frigate broke through <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> and arrived in December 1808, the island was surrounded by British bases and was invaded and captured in January 1809. Other French colonies were seized {{over the next two}} years as <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> cut off French communications with their overseas territories. Amethyst and her captain Michael Seymour were active in this campaign, capturing a second French frigate, Niémen, at the Action of 6 April 1809.|$|E

50|$|Following President Abraham Lincoln’s {{proclamation}} of a blockade of Southern ports on April 19, 1861 the Navy Department {{found it necessary}} to subdivide the territory assigned to the Home Squadron. This resulted in the creation of <b>the</b> Coast <b>Blockading</b> Squadron and <b>the</b> Gulf <b>Blockading</b> Squadron in early May 1861.In orders sent on May 1, 1861 Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles appointed Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham to command <b>the</b> Coast <b>Blockading</b> Squadron. Stringham received this order and took command on May 4, 1861. His new command was to be headquartered at Hampton Roads, Virginia and was given responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>blockading</b> of <b>the</b> coast from the capes of the Chesapeake to the southern extremity of Florida and Key West. On May 17, 1861 <b>the</b> Coast <b>Blockading</b> Squadron was re-designated <b>the</b> Atlantic <b>Blockading</b> Squadron.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>blockade</b> of the South {{caused the}} Southern economy to {{collapse}} during the war. Shortages {{of food and}} supplies were caused by <b>the</b> <b>blockade,</b> the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, and foraging by Union and Confederate armies. The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust of the currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing food riots across the Confederacy. The Union victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port, virtually ending blockade running and hastening {{the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|A CSS Merrimac did {{actually}} exist. She was {{a paddle}} wheel steamer {{named for the}} victor (as most Southerners saw it) at Hampton Roads. She was used for running <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> until she was captured and taken into Federal service, still named Merrimac. Her name was a spelling variant of the river, namesake of USS Merrimack. Both spellings are still in use around the Hampton Roads area.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{source of}} funds {{was to be the}} tax on exports of cotton. However, in {{addition}} to the difficulties associated with <b>the</b> <b>blockade,</b> the self-imposed embargo on cotton meant that for all practical purposes the tax was completely ineffective as a fund raiser. Initial optimistic estimates of revenue to be collected through this tax ran as high as 20 million dollars, but in the end only $30 thousand was collected.|$|E

Britain passed the Slave Trade Act 1807, which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade, and the Royal Navy enforced <b>the</b> <b>Blockade</b> of Africa. The United States also prohibited the Atlantic slave trade in 1808 and helped intercept illegal slave ships at sea, predominately after 1842.|$|E
5|$|Although Battleship Division Nine's {{service was}} limited mainly to convoy duty and the {{maintenance}} of <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> of the German coast, its presence greatly augmented the strength of the Grand Fleet, thus making major combat between the British and German fleets even more unlikely in 1918. By helping to keep the High Seas Fleet effectively blockaded in port, Battleship Division Nine played a role in ensuring Allied control of the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Aside from <b>the</b> <b>blockade,</b> the Egyptian Navy {{carried out}} several other missions. Coastal {{artillery}} at Port Said {{participated in the}} fire preparation by bombarding Fort Budapest and Fort Orkal, while coastal artillery at Suez hit targets opposite the Third Army. Missile boats bombarded Rumana and Ras Beyron on the Mediterranean, Ras Masala and Ras Sidr on the Gulf of Suez, and Sharm el Sheikh. Naval frogmen raided the oil installations at Bala'eem, disabling the massive driller.|$|E
5000|$|Uruguay {{threatened}} {{to resort to}} the World Trade Organization, since <b>the</b> <b>blockades</b> [...] "violate basic principles of international commerce" [...] and were not cleared by the Argentine authorities, thus causing an economic loss to Uruguay (which they estimated at $400 million). The Uruguayan government also considered a demand on the International Court of Justice, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>blockades</b> have violated human rights by preventing the free circulation of persons and goods.|$|R

As San Martín was appointed Protector of Peru, Cochrane reasoned that San Martín was no longer under Chilean command, and took the navy away. In later years Cochrane made accusations against San Martín in Chile.|$|E
5|$|De Soto was {{originally}} a privately owned vessel, built for passenger service between New York and New Orleans. With {{the outbreak of}} the Civil War in 1861, she was purchased by the Navy, commissioned as USS De Soto, and sent to assist with <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> of Confederate ports. De Sotos speed made her an effective pursuit ship, and she would capture or bring about the destruction of a total of eighteen blockade runners during the war.|$|E

5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars the Royal Navy had exerted {{dominance}} at sea {{over its}} continental rivals, most immediately the French Navy with its principal fleet based at Brest on the Breton {{coast of the}} Bay of Biscay. To contain this fleet the British practiced a close blockade strategy; maintaining a fleet off Brest whenever weather conditions permitted to prevent the French fleet from breaking out into the Atlantic Ocean. This blockade force also limited French trade and maritime communications, attacking merchant ships and individual warships seeking to resupply or reinforce the main French fleet. This made French maritime journeys extremely hazardous even in inshore waters: in June 1795 the main French fleet had suffered a defeat {{at the hands of}} <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> force at the Battle of Groix in the approaches to the port of Lorient, while at the Action of 13 January 1797 the independently sailing 74-gun ship of the line Droits de l'Homme was driven ashore and destroyed in the approaches to Brest by two frigates of <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> squadron.|$|E

On 11 November, the Maltese-flagged coaster Euroriver, manned by a Croatian crew, was sunk by gunfire off Šolta Island.|$|E
5|$|For most of 1650, a Venetian {{fleet of}} 41 vessels {{maintained}} <b>the</b> <b>blockade</b> of the Dardanelles, prohibiting Haideragazade Mehmed Pasha from sailing for Crete.
