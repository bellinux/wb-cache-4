This has not only simplified a number of procedures, but also brought transparency (less interaction with the customs staff) and certainly more revenues for the exchequer. Needless to mention that in the redundant system each bill of entry (goods declaration) for imports required 34 signatures & 62 verifications. Furthermore, multiple copies and numerous mandatory documents were required to be attached with the GD. All these documents were carried from desk to desk by the importer.

40|$|Antidumping {{has become}} the {{dominant}} instrument for temporarily restricting imports. There is need for concern, as it represents a particularly distorting trade policy measure. Many observers have made {{suggestions on how to}} improve the current situation. These suggestions aim at restraining antidumping by reducing the number of circumstances where it may be applied. In other words, they envisage higher prerequisites for the use of antidumping. Yet, higher prerequisites for <b>temporary</b> <b>import</b> restrictions impair the government’s trade policy flexibility. This article assumes that governments are not ready to sacrifice such flexibility by means of an international trade agreement. Therefore, suggestions that merely intend to raise the prerequisites for the use of antidumping are difficult to realise. We propose an alternative solution for antidumping reform. It considers abolishing antidumping and introducing a revised safeguard clause. This clause would permit <b>temporary</b> <b>import</b> restrictions without any prerequisites, but would make these restrictions dependent on full compensation for affected trading partners. In contrast to existing suggestions for reform, this alternative solution preserves the trade policy flexibility provided by the current antidumpin...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{literature}} on productive internationalisation (international fragmentation, global value chains, channel perspective, {{are some of}} the terms used to describe this more general phenomenon) has focused on strategies based on non equity inter firms relations, involving both single firms and local production systems. While equity-based forms of internationalisation have been amply analysed, {{there is a lack of}} information on the extension and characteristics of non equity-based forms. The intra-industry trade stemming from non equity relations has been studied with reference to different types of empirical evidence: some early efforts were based on the analysis of <b>temporary</b> <b>import</b> export flows; later contributions analysed bilateral trade flows, in the light of the sequence of the production phases, aggregated at the minimum geographical scale available. In this paper we propose a new methodology that extends the latter approach by considering micro data instead of aggregated information.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a minimal general {{equilibrium}} intertemporal model, with optimizing consumers and producers, is developed {{to analyze the}} process of real exchange rate determination. The model is completely real, and considers a small open economy that produces and consumes three goods each period. The model {{is also used to}} analyze {{the way in which the}} current account responds to several shocks. The working of the model is illustrated for the case of two disturbances: the imposition of import tariffs, and external terms of trade shocks. In the case of import tariffs, a distinction is made between temporary, anticipated, and permanent changes. It is shown that, without imposing rigidities or adjustment costs, interesting paths for the equilibrium real exchange rate can be generated. In particular "overshooting" and movements in opposite directions in periods one and two can be observed. Precise conditions under which <b>temporary</b> <b>import</b> tariffs will improve the current account are derived. Finally, several ways in which the model can be extended to take into account other issues such as changes in the fiscal deficit, and financial deregulation are discussed in detail. ...|$|R
