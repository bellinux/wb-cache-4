25|$|Immediately {{after the}} coronation, Louisa Ulrika {{prepared}} a new coup {{in favor of}} absolute monarchy. Queen Louisa Ulrika strongly dominated her husband and the court, and she would likely had been the real ruler during her spouse's reign had Sweden been an absolute monarchy: at this point, however, the king was a mere decoration. This greatly displeased the queen, herself born in an absolute monarchy. She could not understand nor condone the Swedish parliament, the Riksdag. For her, it was not acceptable for a royal person to have to receive peasants in the royal salons, as {{she was forced to}} do with the peasant's representatives from the Riksdag. She was further enraged when the Riksdag forced the king to give up his claims on the throne of Holstein-Gottorp. To display her contempt, she humiliated the representatives of the Riksdag by using the etiquette of the royal court: she stopped their carriages at the Palace gates, forced them to wait for hours while she let those who arrived before them be received, and let <b>them</b> <b>sit</b> on smaller chairs to humiliate them. In the court theatres, the French theatre troupe and the Italian opera company performed plays encouraging hinting that the king to take control of his kingdom.|$|E

500|$|A Mitică {{is present}} in the piece called Ţal!...—the title comes from a face ţal ("to make ţal"), an antiquated {{expression}} which, as Caragiale explains in the beginning of his story, means [...] "to make a payment" [...] (from the German zahlen). The writer illustrates this concept by invoking a meeting between him, Mitică, and Mitică's wife Graziella. Caragiale recounts how his friend served him and others a copious dinner in his house, and then made <b>them</b> <b>sit</b> through Graziella's reading of her own lengthy essay on women as portrayed in Romanian folklore. To this goal, Caragiale explains, Mitică discreetly claimed that it was ţal and added, using a quasi-official parlance, that [...] "all bills are to be paid". The piece ends with Caragiale exiting Mitică's house in haste and: as the latter shouts [...] "to be seeing each other", he exclaims [...] "to be left alone, Mitică".|$|E

The son of a lawyer and a painter, he {{attended}} the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school associated with the University of Chicago. Exposed to music at an early age, he studied classical flute with Walfrid Kujala, of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Butterfield was also athletic and was offered a track scholarship to Brown University. [...] However, a knee injury and a growing interest in blues music sent him in a different direction. He met guitarist and singer songwriter Nick Gravenites, who shared an interest in authentic blues music. [...] By the late 1950s, they were visiting blues clubs in Chicago, where musicians such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and Otis Rush, encouraged them and occasionally let <b>them</b> <b>sit</b> in on jam sessions. The pair were soon performing as Nick and Paul in college-area coffee houses.|$|E

2500|$|The {{period of}} the books begins in the 1920s {{and moves to the}} 1970s as the 50 books {{progress}} (the character being seemingly ageless). In early books most activities are illegal, although directed at villains. In later books, this becomes less so. In books written during World War II, The Saint was recruited by the government to help track spies and similar undercover work. Later he became a cold warrior fighting Communism. The quality of writing also changes; early books have a freshness which becomes replaced by cynicism in later works. A few Saint stories crossed into science fiction and fantasy, [...] "The Man Who Liked Ants" [...] and the early novel The Last Hero being examples; one Saint short story, [...] "The Darker Drink", was even published in the October 1952 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. When early Saint books were republished in the 1960s to the 1980s, it was not uncommon to see freshly written introductions by Charteris apologizing for the out-of-date tone; according to a Charteris [...] "apology" [...] in a 1969 paperback of Featuring the Saint, he attempted to update some earlier stories when they were reprinted but gave up and let <b>them</b> <b>sit</b> as period pieces. The 1963 edition of the short story collection The Happy Highwayman contains examples of abandoned revisions; in one story published in the 1930s ("The Star Producers"), references to actors of the 1930s were replaced for 1963 with names of current movie stars; another 1930s-era story, [...] "The Man Who Was Lucky", added references to atomic power.|$|E
2500|$|While T.I. was incarcerated in 2004, {{another popular}} {{southern}} rapper, Lil Flip, {{took issue with}} him over his [...] "King of the South" [...] claims which launched a much publicized feud.

T.I. said he was also upset Lil' Flip waited until his incarceration to criticize him. According to AllHipHop, T.I. and Lil' Flip had an altercation in Lil' Flip's neighborhood, the Cloverland section of Houston. It has been said that T.I. went there to create a DVD exposing Lil' Flip to be a fraud. When T.I. went to Cloverland with his entourage, he was met by Flip and his people. Then it was said a fight broke out with {{one of the members of}} Lil Flip's entourage started swinging at T.I. until one of T.I.'s bodyguards started shooting. The same day T.I. went on a Houston, Texas radio station talking about the altercation. He revealed that he had the tape and he was going to release it with an upcoming mixtape, but that did not happen because James Prince stopped him from distributing the tape.
