5|$|Besides {{population}} statistics, Villani {{also offered}} statistics on education. He wrote that {{boys and girls}} learning to read numbered 8,000 to 10,000 each year. There were 1,000 to 1,200 children learning to use the abacus and algorism for mathematics. In the four large, prestigious schools of Florence, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> 550 to 600 students in attendance to learn proper grammar and scholastic logic.|$|E
5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E

5|$|Canterbury {{retained}} as suffragans, or subordinates, {{the bishops}} of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield. This listing, however, comes from the Gesta pontificum Anglorum of the later medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury, written in about 1120. Although the division is logical, William confuses Hygeberht with Hygeberht's successor Ealdwulf, and does not give a source for his list, which suggest {{that it may be}} untrustworthy. The creation of a third archbishopric was controversial, and the community at Canterbury Cathedral seems never to have accepted Hygeberht as an archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby speculates that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> some in the Mercian kingdom who disapproved of the elevation of Lichfield to an archdiocese.|$|E

25|$|For braver souls, {{impatient}} with efforts to abolish slavery within the law, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> illegal methods. Slaves escaped independently; most often {{they were young}} males, as they could move more freely than women with children. Free blacks and white supporters of abolition of slavery gradually organized a number of safe places and guides, creating the Underground Railroad to help slaves gain safety in Northern states. The many Indian trails and waterways of Maryland, {{and in particular the}} countless inlets of the Chesapeake Bay, afforded numerous ways to escape north by boat or land, with many people going to Pennsylvania as the nearest free state. Supporters would shelter refugees, and sometimes give them food and clothing.|$|E

Ambassador McDonnough noted that heightened expectations and the desire to see the CDF operational in the shortest possible time, meant that Member States sometimes underestimated the work which had to be done to make the CDF ready for full operations.|$|E
25|$|On average, 42 {{episodes of}} Blue Heelers were {{broadcast}} per year on Australian television, with each episode comprising fifty scenes. One episode was made every week.

There were 16 episodes {{in various stages of}} production at any one time (from the conception of new storylines to post-production). In addition, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> seven complete episodes waiting to go to air.

25|$|The Thames and Severn Canal is a canal in Gloucestershire in {{the south}} of England, which was {{completed}} in 1789. It was conceived as part of a canal route from Bristol to London. At its eastern end, it connects to the River Thames at Inglesham Lock near Lechlade, while at its western end, it connects to the Stroudwater Navigation at Wallbridge near Stroud, and thence to the River Severn. It has one short arm (branch), from Siddington to the town of Cirencester. It includes Sapperton Tunnel, which when built was the longest canal tunnel in Britain, and remains the fourth longest. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> problems with water supply, as no reservoirs were built, while the summit section near the tunnel ran through porous limestone, and there were constant difficulties with leakage.
