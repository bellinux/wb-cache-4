A {{particular}} flower may not be dead in early winter, but the flowers are dying; a particular pebble may never be wetted with the tide, but the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in.</b> To the scientific eye all human history is a series of collective movements, destructions or migrations, like the massacre of flies in winter or the return of birds in spring. Now the root fact in all history is Race. Race produces religion; Race produces legal and ethical wars. There is no stronger case than that of the wild, unworldly and perishing stock which we commonly call the Celts, of whom your friends the MacNabs are specimens. Small, swarthy, and of this dreamy and drifting blood, they accept easily the superstitious explanation of any incidents, just as they still accept (you will excuse me for saying) that superstitious explanation of all incidents which you and your Church represent. It is not remarkable that such people, with the sea moaning behind them and the Church (excuse me again) droning in front of them, should put fantastic features into what are probably plain events. You, with your small parochial responsibilities, see only this particular Mrs MacNab, terrified with this particular tale of two voices and a tall man out of the sea. But the man with the scientific imagination sees, as it were, the whole clans of MacNab scattered over the whole world, in its ultimate average as uniform as a tribe of birds. He sees thousands of Mrs MacNabs, in thousands of houses, dropping their little drop of morbidity in the tea-cups of their friends; he sees--" ...|$|E
50|$|The ballad {{also appears}} {{in a number of}} guises in Scottish Gaelic, under the name 'A' Bhean Eudach' or 'The Jealous Woman'. In many of the Scottish Gaelic {{variants}} the cruel sister murders her sibling while she is sleeping by knotting her hair into the seaweed on a rock at low tide. When she wakes the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> fast and as she is drowning she sings the song 'A' Bhean Eudach' detailing her tragic end.|$|E
50|$|Mainwaring tells Wilson to {{ring the}} {{engineers}} - but they're dealing with another emergency and won't {{be able to get}} there for another three hours, which will be too late because the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in.</b> Walker suggests taking a boat, but Frazer squashes this idea by saying it would take too long to get there from the nearest dock, and that they would be dashed to pieces on the rocks. With no alternative, they decide to negotiate a path through the minefield. Frazer has seen the mines laid, so he outlines the pattern to Mainwaring. Jones' section, save Godfrey who has mysteriously vanished, prod their way down the beach with Jones's bayonet.|$|E
60|$|Having {{finished}} our meal, I lighted my {{pipe and}} sat down under a tree, while Walkirk, with his rod, wandered away along {{the bank of the}} stream. After a while he returned, and proposed that we try fishing near the eastern outlet of the creek, where, as the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> we might find better sport.|$|R
50|$|Pacheco did not {{pause for}} {{greetings}} or inquiries, but immediately turned his boats around and raced {{back to the}} Kumbalam pass. The high <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> and the wind was changing. He arrived back at Kumbalam ford {{just in time to}} anchor himself in with the others and prepare to meet the bulk of the Calicut fleet, now bearing down on the ford.|$|R
50|$|In {{connection}} {{with the election of}} a relative as member of parliament for Liverpool he wrote a libellous attack on the rival candidate, and to escape prosecution was advised to abscond. To baffle pursuit he determined to cross the Saltney when the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in.</b> In the middle of the stream he quit his horse, resolving to trust to his remarkable powers as a swimmer, but he was unable to reach the shore. His death took place in February 1722.|$|R
50|$|After that cheap victory, the Archduke held {{a conference}} with his captains. Most urged to entrench the army {{across the road}} to Ostend, forcing Maurice to attack along a narrow front where the Dutch cavalry, mostly heavy, would not be {{effective}} against the lighter Spanish cavalry. However, the mutineers, who had been rallied by the Archduke {{on the promise of}} free plunder, were eager for a fight and out-argued the rest. The army therefore advanced in battle order along the coast; it was midday and the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> so that in the end they were forced to abandon the shrinking beach and climb slowly up the slippery dunes.|$|R
60|$|Alarmed and irresolute, Cleer {{sat down}} on the rock, and facing landwards for awhile, waved her {{handkerchief}} to and fro to attract, if possible, her father's attention. Then she scanned the opposite cliffs, beyond the gap or chasm that separated her from the mainland; but she could nowhere see him. He must have forgotten her and gone home to dinner alone, she fancied now, for it was nearly seven o'clock. Nothing remained but to climb down again and follow him. It was getting full late to be out by herself on the island. And <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> and the surf was getting strong--Atlantic swell from the gale at sea yesterday.|$|R

After landing them, the boats returned to the fleet.The attackers found themselves on a beach between the sea and a high stone wall.The <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> reducing the beach to a narrowing strip, and the Moors were raining rocks and arrows on them from above.|$|R
6000|$|He {{set out to}} swim instinctively, {{the life}} {{preserver}} holding him up, although {{it had not been}} light enough to counteract the suction of the sinking ship. Where he was going he did not know, for the glare of the searchlight and the splashing of shots on the water was perfectly bewildering. [...] "I'm lost!" [...] he thought a dozen times. [...] "O God, help me to get out alive!" [...] And that prayer was answered, for presently his foot touched bottom and he saw land ahead,--a bit of sandy beach between Morro Castle and a battery located on Estrella Cove, for the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> and had carried him up the harbor instead of down.|$|R
60|$|After some further conference, Mr. Bucket (whom {{everybody}} {{seemed to}} know and defer to) went in with the others at a door and left me in the carriage, while the driver {{walked up and down}} by his horses to warm himself. The <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> as I judged from the sound it made, and I could hear it break {{at the end of the}} alley with a little rush towards me. It never did so--and I thought it did so, hundreds of times, in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour, and probably was less--but the thought shuddered through me that it would cast my mother at the horses' feet.|$|R
50|$|In January 1711 {{she married}} Thomas Brereton, {{at that time}} a {{commoner}} of Brasenose College, Oxford. Her husband soon spent his fortune {{and went over to}} Paris. Some time after this, a separation took place and she retired in 1721 to Flintshire, where she led a solitary life, seeing little company but some intimate friends. About this time Thomas Brereton obtained from Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland a post belonging to the customs at Parkgate, Cheshire, but in February 1722 he was drowned in the River Dee at Saltney, when the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in.</b> His widow then retired to Wrexham for the benefit of her children's education, where she died 7 August 1740, aged 55, leaving two daughters, Lucy and Charlotte.|$|R
50|$|The way to {{determine}} {{the direction of the}} tidal flow at the narrows is to observe the direction in which the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> flowing. If the tidal flow is heading toward theJervis Inlet then the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> going out (low tide). But if the flow is moving toward Princess Louisa Inlet the <b>tide</b> it <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> (high <b>tide).</b>|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the column}} of General Abercromby made very slow {{progress}} along the beach, mostly because the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> again, which narrowed {{the beach to}} a very small band, consisting of loose sand. The troops and horses were suffering severely from fatigue and thirst. In {{the course of the}} afternoon they were observed by the French who brought up sharpshooters at first, who caused a number of casualties, especially of the officers. The French sent more and more substantial reinforcements through the dunes and eventually General Vandamme brought up a substantial cavalry force which he led personally in a charge against the British horse-artillery batteries that temporarily fell into French hands. This cavalry attack was eventually repulsed by a counter-attack led by Lord Paget, who drove the French {{all the way back to}} Egmond aan Zee.|$|R
50|$|Oldbuck {{decides to}} {{introduce}} Lovel to his good friend, Sir Arthur Wardour. When Sir Arthur arrives, Lovel meets Arthur's daughter, Isabella {{and the two}} realize they have seen each other before. Because Lovel is illegitimate, she knows her father would not approve of a marriage between them. When she sees Lovel standing in the road waiting to talk to her, she convinces her father to take the long way home, walking down to the beach. Luckily, Edie Ochiltree, having the insight that someone may be trapped on the beach not knowing that the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> finds the Wardours and helps them escape the rising waters. Then, Lovel appears and gets them to relative safety, huddling {{on the side of}} a rocky cliff. Finally, Oldbuck arrives with men and ropes to pull the four up over the cliff to safety.|$|R
5000|$|The lightermen were a vital {{component}} of the Port of London before the enclosed docks were built during the 19th and 20th centuries. Ships anchored {{in the middle of}} the Thames or near bridge arches transferred their goods aboard or in respect of a few exports from lighters. Lightermen rode the river's currents [...] - [...] westward when the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> eastward on the ebb tide [...] - [...] to transfer the goods to quay-sides. They also transferred goods up and down the river from quays to riverside factories and vice versa. This was an extremely skilled job, requiring an intimate knowledge of the river's currents and tides. It also demanded a lot of muscle power, as the lighters were unpowered; they relied on the current for motive force and on long oars, or [...] "paddles", for steering.|$|R
60|$|It {{was this}} Canute of whom the famous {{story is told}} that, in order to rebuke his flatterers, who, in extolling his {{grandeur}} and power, had represented to him that even the elements were subservient to his will, he took his stand upon the sea-shore when the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> with his flatterers by his side, and commanded the rising waves not to approach his royal feet. He kept his sycophantic courtiers in this ridiculous position until the encroaching waters drove them away, and then dismissed them overwhelmed with confusion. The story is told in a thousand different ways, and with {{a great variety of}} different embellishments, according to the fancy of the several narrators; all that there is now any positive evidence for believing, however, is, that probably some simple incident of the kind occurred, out of which the stories have grown.|$|R
6000|$|These {{servants}} {{of the king}} used to flatter him. They {{told him he was}} lord of land and sea, and that every thing would obey him. [...] "Let us try," [...] said Cnut, who wished to show them how foolish and profane they were; [...] "bring out my chair to the sea-side." [...] He was at Southampton at the time, close to the sea, and the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in.</b> [...] "Now sea," [...] he said, as he sat down, [...] "I am thy lord, dare not to come near, nor wet my feet." [...] Of course the waves rolled on, and splashed over him; and he turned to his servants, and bade them never say words that took away from the honor due to the only Lord of heaven and earth. He never put on his crown again after this, but hung it up in Winchester Cathedral. He was a thorough good king, and there was much grief when he died, stranger though he was.|$|R
60|$|The <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> now <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> and {{everybody}} {{on board the}} two fighting vessels knew very well that the first one of them which should float would have a great advantage over the other, and {{would probably be the}} conqueror. In came the tide, and still the cannons roared and the muskets cracked, while the hearts of the pirates and the South Carolinians almost stood still as they each watched the other vessel to see if she showed any signs of floating.|$|R
50|$|He {{returns in}} a boat, with the boatman and two local workmen, {{to the same}} area, where the <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> now <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> and he shows them where he {{encountered}} the creatures. They see them below in the shallow water. Their tentacles start {{to reach for the}} occupants of the boat, and there is a prolonged struggle, the oars and a boat hook are used as weapons, which are gripped by the creatures. During all this, a larger boat is seen: the occupants, which include three women and a child, seem unaware of the danger and Fison tries to warn them.|$|R
60|$|Hereupon {{the noise}} and clamor was renewed, and became more violent than ever, the men insisting that the king should land, and filling the air with screams, yells, and vociferations of all sorts, which made the scene truly terrific. The counselors of the king insisted {{that it was not}} safe for the king to remain any longer on the river, so the oarsmen were ordered to pull their oars, and the barge {{immediately}} began to recede from the shore, and to move back up the river. It happened that the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> now <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> and this assisted them very much in their progress, and the barge was swept back rapidly toward the Tower.|$|R
50|$|On a rocky coast, Miss Spinn, {{an elderly}} spinster, directs {{servants}} {{to set up}} the picnic and flirts with Joe Bangles, a bachelor of about the same age. Bangles jokes around with her, and, as the others begin to arrive, he discovers himself having all but proposed to her. Randall is disliked by the group, but he eventually gets Miss Spinn to have pity on him, and she decides to flirt with him to make Bangles jealous. However, the <b>tide</b> will <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> shortly, and the group begins to head in. Bangles stays behind a bit to talk to Dr. Trotway about Buckthorpe, who he finds a bit suspicious as he always seems to be meeting up with Edith, supposedly by chance.|$|R
60|$|One day I {{witnessed}} {{a very strange}} thing, the action of a dog, by the waterside. It was evening and the beach was forsaken; cartmen, fishermen, boatmen all gone, and I was the only idler left on the rocks; but the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> rolling quite big waves on to the rocks, and the novel sight of the waves, the freshness, the joy of it, kept me at that spot, standing {{on one of the}} outermost rocks not yet washed over by the water. By and by a gentleman, followed by a big dog, came down on to the beach and stood at a distance of forty or fifty yards from me, while the dog bounded forward over the flat, slippery rocks and through pools of water until he came to my side, and {{sitting on the edge of}} the rock began gazing intently down at the water. He was a big, shaggy, round-headed animal, with a greyish coat with some patches of light reddish colour on it; what his breed was I cannot say, but he looked somewhat like a sheep-dog or an otter-hound. Suddenly he plunged in, quite disappearing from sight, but quickly reappeared with a big shad of about three and a half or four pounds' weight in his jaws. Climbing on to the rock he dropped the fish, which he did not appear to have injured much, as it began floundering about in an exceedingly lively manner. I was astonished and looked back at the dog's master; but there he stood in the same place, smoking and paying no attention to what his animal was doing. Again the dog plunged in and brought out a second big fish and dropped it on the flat rock, and again and again he dived, until there were five big shads all floundering about on the wet rock and likely soon to be washed back into the water. The shad is a common fish in the Plata and the best to eat of all its fishes, resembling the salmon in its rich flavour, and is eagerly watched for when it comes up from the sea by the Buenos Ayres fishermen, just as our fishermen watch for mackerel on our coasts. But on this evening the beach was deserted by every one, watchers included, and the fish came and swarmed along the rocks, and there was no one to catch them--not even some poor hungry idler to pounce upon and carry off the five fishes the dog had captured. One by one I saw them washed back into the water, and presently the dog, hearing his master whistling to him, bounded away.|$|R
5000|$|This statement, {{made just}} as the armies met, {{must have been a}} late attempt to put heart into his own {{surprised}} army. Significantly the main O'Donnell war host had employed rising ground to successfully cover their advance until it was far too late for O'Neill to deploy his own Gallowglass spars into proper line of battle to hold the enemy while the O'Neill horse mounted up. The O'Neill army were caught utterly unprepared, {{in much the same way}} as O'Neill himself had taken a MacDonnell host by surprise at Glentaisie in 1565. Despite the element of surprise and O'Neill's lack of manoeuvre room, the resistance of the surprised O'Neill Gallowglass in this encounter battle was at first successful for the Four Masters state that the action lasted [...] "for a long time." [...] Eventually, with their loose protective screen of gallowglass cut down, a panicked rout of Shane's force ensued. The O'Donnell pressure of attack continued so fiercely that the broken O'Neill host was forced back on the ford and attempted to recross the Swilly. As the <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> now <b>coming</b> <b>in,</b> many of them to simply drowned in the speeding rush of waters (4-7 knots average). O'Neill's losses are estimated by their enemies at 1,400 men killed and no prisoners are mentioned, although the English sources note a more credible total of 680 dead. With many of his most senior commanders and advisors killed amid the chaos of the first onslaught, O'Neill himself escaped the final slaughter with the timely aid of a party of the Gallaghers. They guided him to Ath an Tairsi (Ford of protection) near Crieve Smith in Oldtown to-day, (not to be confused with Scarrifholis which is further up the river) where they escorted him to his own territory and relative safety.|$|R
