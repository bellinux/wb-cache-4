25|$|As the {{production}} of radioactive atoms by the ISOL technique depends on the free atom chemistry of the element to be studied, there are certain beams which cannot be produced by simple proton bombardment of thick actinide targets. Refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium do not emerge from the target even at high temperatures due to their low vapour pressure. In order to produce these types of beams, a <b>thin</b> <b>target</b> is required. The Ion Guide Isotope Separator On Line (IGISOL) technique was developed in 1981 at the University of Jyväskylä cyclotron laboratory in Finland. In this technique, a thin uranium target is bombarded with protons and nuclear reaction products recoil out of the target in a charged state. The recoils are stopped in a gas cell and then exit through a small hole {{in the side of}} the cell where they are accelerated electrostatically and injected into a mass separator. This method of production and extraction takes place on a shorter timescale compared to the standard ISOL technique and isotopes with short half-lives (sub millisecond) can be studied using an IGISOL. An IGISOL has also been combined with a laser ion source at the Leuven Isotope Separator On Line (LISOL) in Belgium. <b>Thin</b> <b>target</b> sources generally provide significantly lower quantities of radioactive ions than thick target sources and this is their main drawback.|$|E

The <b>thin</b> <b>target</b> immediately before the separator allows the fragments produced through various reactions to escape the target material still at a very high velocity. The products are forward-focused because of the high velocity of the center-of-mass in the beam-target interaction, which allows fragment separators to collect a large fraction (in some cases nearly all) of the fragments produced in the target.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{a carbon}} therapy treatment, the beam {{undergoes}} inelastic nuclear reactions {{leading to the}} production of secondary fragments. These nuclear interactions tend to delocate a part of the dose into healthy tissues and create a mixed radiation field. In order to accurately estimate the dose deposited into the tissues, the production rate of these fragments all along the beam path have to be taken into account. But the double differential carbon fragmentation cross sections are not well known in the energy range needed for a treatment (up to 400  MeV/nucleon). Therefore, a series of experiments aiming to measure the double differential fragmentation cross sections of carbon on <b>thin</b> <b>targets</b> of medical interest has been started by our collaboration.

40|$|During {{therapeutic}} treatments using ions such as carbon, nuclear {{interactions between}} the incident ions and nuclei present in organic tissues may occur, leading to the attenuation of the incident beam intensity and {{to the production of}} secondary light charged particles.
