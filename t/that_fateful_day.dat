500|$|Hannibal had {{defeated}} {{the equivalent of}} eight consular armies (16 legions plus {{an equal number of}} allies). Within just three campaign seasons (20 months), Rome had lost one-fifth (150,000) of the entire population of male citizens over 17 years of age. Furthermore, the morale effect of this victory was such that most of southern Italy joined Hannibal's cause. After Cannae, the Hellenistic southern provinces of Arpi, Salapia, Herdonia, Uzentum, including the cities of Capua and Tarentum (two of the largest city-states in Italy) revoked their allegiance to Rome and pledged their loyalty to Hannibal. As Livy noted, [...] "How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae than those which preceded it, can be seen by the behavior of Rome's allies; before <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> <b>day,</b> their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver {{for the simple reason that}} they despaired of Roman power." [...] In the same year the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while the Macedonian king, Philip V, pledged his support to Hannibal, initiating the First Macedonian War against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with the new King Hieronymus of Syracuse, the only independent left in Sicily.|$|E

Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed King Hieronymus of Syracuse, and Tarentum also came over to him around that time. Hannibal now had the resources and personnel needed to launch a successful attack on the City of Rome. However, he was uncertain of the feasibility of such an attack and spent a great deal of time pondering it. While he hesitated, the Romans were able to regroup, and the opportunity was lost. The Romans looked back on Hannibal's indecision as what saved Rome from certain defeat. Hannibal sent a delegation to Rome to negotiate a peace and another one offering to release his Roman prisoners of war for ransom, but Rome rejected all offers.|$|E

Teoh's family lawyers claimed that during questioning by the police, his family had been asked questions suggesting that they were primarily interested in [...] " [...] MACC officers from liability" [...] by pursuing the possibility of a suicide.

40|$|The Battle of the Little Big Horn, {{popularly known}} as Custer 2 ̆ 7 s Last Stand, retains its fascination for Custer buffs, historians, and {{scholars}} who continue to seek a satisfactory explanation of why Sioux and Cheyenne warriors were able to overwhelm the Seventh Cavalry on <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> June <b>day</b> in 1876. Although the story has been told and retold with inexhaustible fascination focused on Custer and his doomed command, the Indian side of that story has been largely neglected. As Hardorff points out, scholars frequently discounted Indian testimony because of its apparent conflict with known facts and accepted theories about the battle. Admittedly, there is some distortion in Indian accounts. There was no overall Indian battle plan. Each warrior came away with his own impression of what happened. Because of fear of punishment, many veterans of the fight waited years before telling their story, and memories had faded. Nonetheless, the twenty-nine Sioux and nine Cheyenne accounts published here help present the much-neglected Indian point of view. Also included are three brief accounts from Seventh Cavalry soldiers...|$|R

40|$|On {{a chilly}} day in Stockholm last month, I visited the Vasa museum. Situated on the waterfront, the museum holds a sailing ship that sank in the Stockholm harbor on its maiden voyage in 1628. The ship had {{barely made it}} a {{kilometer}} from the dock <b>that</b> <b>fateful</b> August <b>day,</b> when it began to roll, letting water into its open cannon ports and then quickly sinking to the bottom. The Vasa took with it the lives of about 40 people and only {{the top of its}} tallest mast was left above water. Roger A. Pielke, Jr. The ship was raised in 1961, and in 1990 was moved to its current location in a giant building that holds the restored ship in its entirety. The Vasa was to be a technological marvel of its day, during a period when “international competitiveness” had a familiar meaning. Based on the perception that Sweden was losing ground in the race for naval technology, particularly to neighboring Denmark, Swedish King Gustav II Adolph (better known in English as Gustavus Adolphus) had commissioned the bigger and better-armed Vasa. As I explored the museum that day, I couldn’t help but think that the tragedy of the Vasa and its fate since that day more than 380 years ago hold lessons for how we think about contemporary innovation policies...|$|R

The motive was money. Mary Gerrard was the illegitimate daughter of Laura Welman and Sir Lewis Rycroft. Had this been discovered sooner, she would have inherited Mrs Welman's estate. Nurse Hopkins knows Mary's true parents because of a letter from her sister Eliza some years earlier. When Hopkins encouraged Mary Gerrard to write a will, Mary named as beneficiary the woman whom she supposes to be her aunt, Mary Riley, the sister of Eliza Gerrard, in New Zealand. Mary Riley's married name is Mary Draper. Mary Draper of New Zealand it turns out is Nurse Hopkins in England, as two people from New Zealand who knew Mary Draper both confirm in court. Hopkins leaves the courtroom before the judge can recall her.|$|E
