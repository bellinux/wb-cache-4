40|$|Gambling {{to recover}} losses {{is a common}} gaming behavior. In a {{clinical}} context, however, this phenomenon mediates the relationship between diminished control over gambling and the adverse socioeconomic consequences of gambling problems. Modeling loss-chasing through analogous behaviors in rats could facilitate its pharmacological investigation as a potential therapeutic target. Here, rats were trained to make operant responses that produced both food rewards, and unpredictably, imminent <b>time-out</b> <b>periods</b> in which rewards would be unavailable. At these decision points, rats were offered choices between waiting for these <b>time-out</b> <b>periods</b> to elapse before resuming responding for rewards ('quit' responses), or selecting risky options with a 0. 5 probability of avoiding the time-outs altogether and a 0. 5 probability of <b>time-out</b> <b>periods</b> {{twice as long as}} signaled originally ('chase' responses). Chasing behavior, and the latencies to chase or quit, during sequences of unfavorable outcomes were tested following systemic administration of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, 8 -OH-DPAT, the D 2 receptor antagonist, eticlopride, and the D 1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390. 8 -OH-DPAT and eticlopride significantly reduced the proportion of chase responses, and the mean number of consecutive chase responses, in a dose-dependent manner. 8 -OH-DPAT also increased latencies to chase. Increasing doses of eticlopride first speeded, then slowed, latencies to quit while SCH 23390 had no significant effects on any measure. Research is needed to identify the precise cognitive mechanisms mediating these kinds of risky choices in rats. However, our data provide the first experimental demonstration that 5 -HT 1 A and D 2, but not D 1, receptor activity influence a behavioral analog of loss-chasing in rats.

[...] Animals infected with a viral vector overexpressing miR-212 in the dorsal striatum produced the same initial levels of cocaine intake; however, drug consumption progressively decreased as net cocaine exposure increased. The authors of the study noted that viral-infected animals exhibited decreased operant responding during the post-infusion <b>time-out</b> <b>period</b> and proposed that this demonstrated a reduction in compulsive drug-seeking behavior.(Hollander et al.) miR-212 acts through Raf1 to enhance the CREB response; CREB-TORC is known to negatively regulate the reinforcing effects of cocaine.

50|$|Continuous reinforcement: A single operant {{response}} triggers the dispense {{of a single}} dose of reinforcer. A <b>time-out</b> <b>period</b> may follow each {{operant response}} that successfully yields a dose of reinforcer; during this period the lever used in training may be retracted preventing the animal from making further responses. Alternatively operant responses will fail to produce drug administration allowing previous injections to take effect. Moreover, time-outs also help prevent subjects from overdosing during self-administration experiments. Fixed-ratio studies require a predefined number of operant responses to dispense one unit of reinforcer. Standard fixed ratio reinforcement schedules include FR5 and FR10, requiring 5 and 10 operant responses to dispense a unit of reinforcer, respectively.Progressive ratio reinforcement schedules utilize a multiplicative {{increase in the number}} of operant responses required to dispense a unit of reinforcer. For example, successive trials might require 5 operant responses per unit of reward, then 10 responses per unit of reward, then 15, and so on. The number of operant responses required per unit of reinforcer may be altered after each trial, each session, or any other time period as defined by the experimenter. Progressive ratio reinforcement schedules provide information about the extent that a pharmacological agent is reinforcing through the breakpoint. The breakpoint is the number of operant responses at which the subject ceases engaging in self-administration, defined by some period of time between operant responses (generally up to an hour).Fixed interval (FI) schedules require that a set amount of time pass between drug infusions, regardless of the number of times that the desired response is performed. This ârefractoryâ period can prevent the animal from overdosing on a drug.Variable interval (VI) schedules of reinforcement are identical to FI schedules, except that the amount of time between reinforced operant responses varies, making it more difficult for the animal to predict when the drug will be delivered.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Part I: In primates, corticomotoneuronal (CM) {{cells have}} {{sufficiently}} strong synaptic linkages to motoneurons to mediate post-spike facilitation in spike-triggered averages of muscle activity. We investigated {{the degree to}} which activity of CM cells and their target muscles could be independently controlled by operantly conditioning their relative activation levels. In two Macaca nemestrina monkeys, single cortical neurons were recorded with moveable microwires chronically implanted in the caudal bank of the pre-central gyrus. Rectified EMG of 12 distal forelimb muscles was recorded with sub-cutaneously implanted pairs of wires in each muscle in one monkey from which 35 unique cell-muscle pairs were operantly conditioned. In the other animal, surface electrodes were placed over wrist flexor and extensor muscles (9 unique cell-muscle pairs). Spike-triggered averages of rectified EMG were compiled while the monkeys performed a force target-tracking task about the wrist. Twenty-four CM cells, with post-spike effects at latencies between 6 and 16 ms in one or more forelimb muscles, were selected for activity dissociation conditioning. Monkeys performed an operant conditioning task through which relative activation of the CM cell and a target muscle could be explored (44 unique cell-muscle pairs). Cell and muscle activity controlled the position of a cursor on a screen, with cursor position determined by concurrent cell spike rates (C) and EMG activity of a target muscle (M); one activity assigned the horizontal direction the other, vertical. Monkeys received fruit sauce rewards for holding the cursor in target positions requiring at least four combinations of increased (+) and suppressed (-) activation relative to levels observed during force generation, namely C+M+; C+M-; C-M+ and C-M-. The monkeys learned to reciprocally activate cells and target muscles exhibiting post-spike facilitation (42 out of 44 cell-muscle pairs), in both directions. For muscles with post-spike suppression (4 out of 4 pairs), monkeys learned to co-activate these cell-muscle pairs. These results indicate that cortical cells with direct synaptic linkages to motoneurons can be flexibly activated relative to their target muscles. Further, CM cell-muscle activity dissociations can be rapid, robust, reversible and are subject to volitional control. Calculation of mutual information between CM cell and muscle activation patterns during reciprocal dissociation events, compared to force target-tracking, implicates involvement of other upstream sources. Activity independence between correlationally-linked components within a neural circuit favors strategies for brain computer interface (BCI) control in which individual neurons are each assigned an individual degree-of-freedom of device output. Part II: Operant conditioning of neural activity has typically been achieved under controlled behavioral conditions using food reinforcement. To reward cell activity during unconstrained behavior, we sought midbrain sites whose stimulation would support operant responding. Three nemestrina monkeys learned to perform a manual step-tracking task rewarded by fruit sauce. We found sites in nucleus accumbens and surrounding striatum whose stimulation could maintain task performance and verified that response rates increased monotonically with increasing pulse frequency and amplitude. We recorded activity of single neurons with moveable microwires chronically implanted in the precentral gyrus and documented neural modulation with a force-guided target-tracking task. We attempted to condition increased firing rates first with the monkey in the training booth and then during free behavior in the cage using the Neurochipâa head-fixed, autonomous recording and stimulating system. Spikes occurring above baseline rates triggered single or multiple electrical pulses to the reinforcement site (1 mA, 0. 2 ms biphasic current pulses). This rate-contingent, unit-triggered stimulation was made available for periods of 1 to 3 minutes separated by 3 to 10 minute <b>time-out</b> <b>periods</b> without stimulation, regardless of cell activity. During in-booth sessions feedback was presented as vertical cursor movement and auditory clicks. During in-cage conditioning, barely audible clicks occurred during each spike-triggered stimulation event. In-booth conditioning produced increases in single neuron firing probability after transition to intracranial reinforcement in 48 of 58 cells. Reinforced cell activity could rise > 5 times that of non-reinforced activity, doubling in most sessions. Activity peaks typically occurred during the first 10 seconds of each time-in period and, for many cells, activity remained elevated above baseline for the full period. In-cage conditioning produced significant increases in post-transition activity in 21 out of 33 sessions. In-cage effects peaked later and lasted longer than in-booth effects but were often comparatively smaller, between 13 and 18 percent above non-reinforced activity. The difference in responding in the two conditioning environments could be due to the dynamic range of candidate cell firing rate, robustness of the reinforcement site and differing levels of attention and competing behaviors in the booth and cage. Controls indicate that stimulation of the reinforcement site did not directly evoke increased cell activity. In several sessions, neighboring, synaptically-linked motor cortex neurons were recorded simultaneously with the trigger cell, revealing network involvement in eliciting conditioned rate changes in the stimulation-triggering neuron...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with maximizing the performance of policies for routing and transferring jobs in systems of heterogeneous servers. The tools used are probabilistic modelling, optimization and simulation. First, a system is studied where incoming jobs are allocated to the queue belonging to {{one of a number}} of servers, each of which goes through alternating periods of being operative and inoperative. The objective is to evaluate and optimize performance and cost metrics. Jobs incur costs for the amount of time that they spend in a queue, before commencing service. The optimal routing policy for incoming jobs is obtained by solving numerical programming equations. A number of heuristic policies are compared against the optimal, and one dynamic routing policy is shown to perform well over a large range of parameters. Next, the problem of how best to deal with the transfer of jobs is considered. Jobs arrive externally into the queue attached to {{one of a number of}} servers, and on arrival are assigned a <b>time-out</b> <b>period.</b> Jobs whose <b>time-out</b> <b>period</b> expires before it commences service is instantaneously transferred to the end another queue, based on a routing policy. Upon transfer, a transfer cost is incurred. An approximation to the optimal routing policy is computed, and compared with a number of heuristic policies. One heuristic policy is found to perform well over a large range of parameters. The last model considered is the case where incoming jobs are allocated to the queue attached to one of a number of servers, each of which goes through periods of being operative and inoperative. Additionally, each job is assigned a time-out on arrival into a queue. Any job whose <b>time-out</b> <b>period</b> expires before it commences service is instantaneously transferred to the end of another queue, based on a transfer policy. The objective is to evaluate and optimize performance and cost metrics. Jobs incur costs for the amount of time that they spend in a queue, before commencing service, and additionally incur a cost for each transfer they experience. A number of heuristic transfer policies are evaluated and one heuristic which performs for a wide range of parameters is observed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} recent {{controversy over the}} empirical form of the function relating response rate to reinforcement rate on Variable Interval (VI) schedules. Some theories (matching, for example) predict a monotonic relationship between response rate and reinforcement rate. Other theories (behavioral economics, for example) predict a bitonic relationship. There is empirical support for both positions. Recently, Dougan, Kuh, and Vink (in press) have shown that session length is one variable which alters {{the form of the}} function. Functions were predominantly monotonic when sessions were short (10 minutes), and predominantly bitonic when sessions were long (30 minutes), when data from the entire session were considered. However, the degree of bitonicity increased in successive 10 -minute blocks within the 30 -minute session, which is consistent with satiation processes. The present experiments further examined the effects of session length and satiation on the VI function. In Experiment 1, 8 rats were exposed to a ten-minute session either immediately preceding or immediately following a 20 -minute time-out. Placement of the session relative to the <b>time-out</b> <b>period</b> had no effect on the form of the response function. In Experiment 2, 7 rats were exposed to a 10 -minute session followed by a 20 -minute <b>time-out</b> <b>period.</b> On some occasions, animals were prefed before the session. The response function was different depending on the prefeeding condition. The results are not consistent with recent demonstrations by McSweeney and her colleagues that response rates change systematically within reinforcement sessions.

40|$|Poor impulse {{control has}} been {{associated}} with compulsive drug seeking and an enhanced risk of relapse, suggesting that impulsivity is causally related to addiction proneness and relapse vulnerability. However, whether this association is specific to drugs of abuse or whether heightened impulsivity relates to a general increase in sensitivity to rewards and reward-associated stimuli is unknown. To address this issue, the authors selected rats on the basis of individual differences in impulsive action in the 5 -choice serial reaction time task, after which they were subjected to an operant sucrose self-administration paradigm. High-impulsive rats displayed a progressive increase in responding on the active hole (including responses emitted during the <b>time-out</b> <b>period)</b> in comparison with low-impulsive rats, which reflects escalation of sucrose-seeking behavior. Once sucrose and sucrose-associated stimuli were omitted (extinction training), nose-poke responding ceased rapidly, an effect that was independent of impulsivity level. In contrast, on reintroduction of sucrose-associated stimuli, sucrose seeking was successfully reinstated in high-impulsive but not in low-impulsive rats. Collectively, the results suggest that impaired response inhibition is associated with enhanced responsiveness to reward-associated stimuli. As such, elevated impulsivity might constitute a risk factor for the initiation and maintenance of addictive behaviors. Â© 2009 American Psychological Association...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{performances}} of three rats were examined under a procedure in which steady rates of bar pressing were maintained by conditioned aversive stimulation. Originally neutral visual and auditory stimuli {{were accompanied by}} widely and irregularly spaced pulses of shock; they were terminated on a variable-interval schedule by pressing a bar. The contingencies between behavior and shock were also duplicated in a control procedure in which no visual or auditory stimuli were provided. Pressing observed under the control procedure was attributed to differences in the aversiveness of pressing and nonpressing behavior engendered by differences {{in the incidence of}} shock following the two classes of behavior. Increased rates with visual and auditory stimuli were attributed to termination of conditioned aversive stimulation. Control rates declined more rapidly than did experimental rates as the mean interval between successive shocks was lengthened; both rates tended to decline when less than 60 sec was allowed as time out from shocks following the successful response. In the control procedure, discrimination between the continuation and discontinuation of the shock series, as measured by relative rates, depended on the relative length of the interval between shocks and the <b>time-out</b> <b>period.</b> Regular warm-up accelerations in rate were noted following an initial delay in responding {{at the beginning of each}} session. The length of time required for the warm-up depended on the length of the mean interval between shocks, indicating that exposure to a certain amount of shock was required to establish a supporting state for the observed performance...|$|E
40|$|NTNU Test Satellite (NUTS) is a student-built double CubeSat with a {{scheduled}} launch in 2015. The project is multidisciplinary where students from all specialities can apply both for thesis assignments and volunteer work. The satellite {{will be in}} a low earth orbit (LEO) where radiation creates a challenging environment for electronics and on-board systems. To counter the effects of space radiation, a thorough and detailed mission event plan, as well as battery estimation and methods for removing lasting faults have been evaluated and implemented. Two watchdog solutions have been suggested, a global watchdog with triple modular redundancy (TMR) on the backplane and a solution with a local watchdog on each master module. Both solutions have the capability to remove single event latchups (SEL) by temporarily removing power to the affected module. Based on results and analysis, the solution with two local watchdogs are the preferred solution due to the increased complexity of the TMR solution. Furthermore, the voter necessary in a TMR implementation is a single point of failure which if malfunctioning, will leave the satellite unresponsive. Guidelines for choosing a new watchdog system's parameters are given. This includes the watchdog's <b>time-out</b> <b>period,</b> power-on-reset (POR) delay and a threshold voltage for the voltage supervisory function. Mission event plans are proposed for initial power-up, in-orbit power monitoring, payload verification and satellite self-tests. A flowchart defining a software watchdog responsible for maintaining an operational satellite is also presented. An adjustable beacon rate enables power conservation by defining three different transmission rates; low, normal and full rate. For the full rate, the power consumption is estimated to 2200 mW, 233. 33 % higher than in low rate and 100 % higher than normal rate. A battery management framework has been proposed in order to avoid a low battery condition...|$|E
