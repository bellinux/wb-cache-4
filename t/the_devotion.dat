He was also present for the trial of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was posthumously found guilty for the crime of maiestas (treason). On 16 December, his father gave a eulogy for Germanicus during a Senate meeting, and he gave a eulogy the next meeting. It was decided that their eulogies would both be inscribed in bronze: that of Tiberius for future generations, but the libellus (eulogy) of Drusus to demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> of Drusus for his adoptive brother {{in a show of}} pietas (piety).|$|E

The Queen suffered another bereavement in 1883, when her highland servant, John Brown, died at Balmoral. Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on Beatrice for support. Unlike her siblings, Beatrice had not shown dislike for Brown, and the two had often been seen in each other's company; indeed, they had worked together {{to carry out the}} Queen's wishes.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Devotions</b> have {{received}} a mixed reaction from critics. Evelyn Simpson described it as [...] "a curious little book", and wrote that [...] "s a manual of devotion [...] compares unfavourably with <b>the</b> <b>Devotions</b> of Bishop Andrewes or the Holy Living of Jeremy Taylor. It is too introspective, too metaphysical, too much overloaded with learning of different kinds". Helen C. White described it as the output of an [...] "anxious and restless mind".|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} {{literary}} theorists have approached <b>the</b> <b>Devotions</b> as politically themed. Richard Strier, in particular, identifies <b>the</b> <b>Devotions</b> as an [...] "Arminian polemic", {{arguing that it}} was highly atypical of Donne to actually publish works, rather than merely let them circulate amongst friends. Both before and after ordination, Donne actively resisted publication, normally only publishing works {{that had been the}} result of a commission, such as The Anniversaries or Pseudo-Martyr. <b>The</b> <b>Devotions,</b> however, were [...] "literally rushed" [...] into print, with the volume being handed to the printers a month after he had recovered from his disease. Strier argues that Donne's rationale for publishing <b>the</b> <b>Devotions</b> matches his rationale for publishing a sermon, the Encaenia, the same year, to assert the importance of [...] "places, and of dayes, and of all outward meanes", because he felt some sense of urgency about what he had to say. This is coupled with Devotion XVI, in which Donne explicitly comes out against Puritanism and is simultaneously [...] "purposely militant", deliberately frustrating the other extreme from Puritanism, where [...] "the Arminianism and the polemical anti-puritanism of the volume becomes explicit".|$|R
5|$|Though Operation Irma {{was widely}} publicized, and was {{reported}} in September 1993 to have raised £1 million in donations to evacuate the wounded from Sarajevo, it attracted a number of criticisms. These addressed the operation's limited scale, the motives of the British press and foreign governments in launching the airlifts, <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> of resources to evacuation instead of supplying material support to local medical services, and the broader issue of the United Kingdom's response {{to the war in}} Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|According to Hindu legend, god Vishnu sat in {{meditation}} at this place, keeping {{away from}} Thuling, {{a place in}} the Himalayas which was corrupted by meat-eating monks and unchaste people. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. Lakshmi, his consort, protected him {{in the form of the}} Badri tree (jujube or Indian date). Pleased by <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashram. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which are not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the padmasana posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by a sage, who saw Vishnu's consort Lakshmi massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of such initiatives, Romania {{tended to}} give little {{attention}} to the potential of recruitment in Russia, as many decision-makers were still uncertain about <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> of Transylvanians and Bukovinans, and worried that they might be welcoming Austro-Hungarian spies into army ranks. Additionally, probably half of the 120,000 men excluded themselves from the pool of recruits, as Austrian loyalists, invalids or men who had reason to fear Austria-Hungary's retaliation. Support from within Romania was therefore weak, and Russian obstruction still had a part to play, but in January the camp was visited by Lieutenant Colonel Constantin Gh. Pietraru of the Romanian Land Forces, on a mission to evaluate the recruitment project. The reversal of fortunes on the Romanian front had brought a Central Powers' invasion into southern Romania, and the Romanian military authority became pressured into finding new soldiers for the defensive action.|$|E
5|$|Shastry {{says that}} rhyme (Antyānuprāsa) is a {{distinguishing}} feature of Rambhadracharya's Sanskrit poetry. Shastry notes that another feature of Rambhadracharya's works is <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> to motherland and patriotism, {{which is most}} evident in the poetic work Ājādacandraśekharacaritam {{on the life of}} Chandrashekhar Azad. Shastry says that this strong feeling of love towards motherland is reminiscent of old Sanskrit literature including Prithvi Sukta of Atharva Veda, various Puranas including Bhagavata Purana, and also in the Sanskrit works of Swami Bhagavadacharya, a former Jagadguru Ramanandacharya. Dikshit says that the nationalistic play Śrīrāghavābhyudayam establishes Rambhadracharya as a successful playwright at a young age. Dikshit praises the aesthetics of the work Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī saying that it represents all the six Sampradāyas of Indian literature (Rīti, Rasa, Alaṅkāra, Dhvani, Vakrokti and Aucitya), and that it is a unique work of Rambhadracharya when it comes to figures of speech. Dikshit says that this work places Rambhadracharya in the league of Ritikavya poets like Raskhan, Keshavdas, Ghananand and Padmakar; but observes the distinction that while the works of all these poets are primarily in the Śṛngāra Rasa, Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī is a work which has Vātsalya Rasa as the primary emotion, which is augmented by Śṛngāra Rasa.|$|E
5|$|The Bhakti (devotional) {{movement}} was active during this time, and involved well known Haridasas (devotee saints) of that time. Like the Virashaiva {{movement of the}} 12th century, this movement presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions. The haridasas represented two groups, the Vyasakuta and Dasakuta, the former being required to be proficient in the Vedas, Upanishads and other Darshanas, while the Dasakuta merely conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through the Kannada language {{to the people in}} the form of devotional songs (Devaranamas and Kirthanas). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vyasatirtha, Vadirajatirtha and others. Vyasatirtha, the guru (teacher) of Vadirajatirtha, Purandaradasa (Father of Carnatic music) and Kanakadasa earned <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> of King Krishnadevaraya. The king considered the saint his Kuladevata (family deity) and honoured him in his writings. During this time, another great composer of early carnatic music, Annamacharya composed hundreds of Kirthanas in Telugu at Tirupati in present-day Andhra Pradesh.|$|E

5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) {{are one and}} the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>devotion</b> to the Holy Face of Jesus {{dates back}} to Sister Marie of St. Peter in 1843 who {{reported}} visions of Jesus and Mary {{in which she was}} urged to spread <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> to the Holy Face of Jesus, in reparation for the many insults Jesus suffered in His Passion.

25|$|The {{first to}} {{establish}} the theological basis for <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> was Polish Jesuit Kasper Drużbicki (1590-1662) in his book Meta cordium - Cor Jesu (The goal of hearts - Heart of Jesus).

Père Eudes was the apostle of the Heart of Mary, but in his devotion to the Immaculate Heart there was a share for the Heart of Jesus. Little by little, <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> to the two Hearts became distinct, and on 31 August 1670 the first feast of the Sacred Heart was celebrated in the Grand Seminary of Rennes. Coutances followed suit on October 20, a day with which the Eudist feast was from then on to be connected. The feast soon spread to other dioceses, and <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> was likewise adopted in various religious communities.

25|$|Devotions to the Immaculate Heart of Mary {{date back}} to St. Bernard and in the 17th century Saint Jean Eudes {{obtained}} the approbation and the first book on <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary.

25|$|In Catholic teachings, {{the object}} of <b>the</b> <b>devotion</b> to the Heart of Mary is her {{physical}} Heart that burned so intensely with love for God.
