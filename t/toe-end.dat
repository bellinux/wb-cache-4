25|$|There are an {{increasing}} number of ideas coming into the market place to extend the options for openhole completions; for example, electronics can be used to actuate a self-opening or self-closing liner valve. This might be used in an openhole completion to improve clean-up, by bringing the well onto production from the <b>toe-end</b> for 100 days, then self-opening the heel-end. Inflow control devices and intelligent completions are also installed as openhole completions.|$|E

There's many a man who never tells his adventures, for he can't hope to be believed. Who's to blame them? For this will seem {{a bit of a}} dream to ourselves in a month or two. WHAT did you say they were?" ...|$|E

50|$|Round {{the corner}} kicking was first {{credited}} to Wilf Wooler in the 1930s. It was later {{practiced in the}} 1940s by Willie Horne, the Barrow, Lancashire, England and Great Britain captain and rugby league player. His distinctive round the corner style of kicking enabled him to kick over 100 goals in the 1945-46 season and then he scored more than 700 goals for his club Barrow before his retirement in 1969. He was known to wear relatively soft-toed boots the heavier boot then general being unnecessary for him, unlike for others using the <b>toe-end</b> style of kicking which was then prevalent in both league and union throughout the world.|$|E
50|$|Announced 1 December 2010, the adiPure IV {{followed}} {{the trend of}} adidas' 2010 range of football boots by undergoing a signoficant weight reduction verses previous incarnations.As well as being the lightest adiPure {{at the time of}} release, the adiPure IV was also the first adiPure boot since the adiPure I to feature a central lacing system and a tongue separate {{to the rest of the}} upper. Adidas also moved the classic three-stripes further towards the <b>toe-end</b> of the boots, giving them a look more reminiscent of the classic adidas boots of the 1950s, like those worn by the German national football team in the 1954 World Cup.The adiPure IV officially launched on 1 January 2011 with two colourways; Black/White/Poppy and White/Black/Fresh Splash. The release of the adiPure IV marked an increase in price for the range, with the price points of both the FG & SG models increased to Â£120. A Light Scarlet/White/Black colourway was also made available in early February.|$|E

Note that only the <b>toe-end</b> tufts are used. Right: improper {{position of}} the brush. When all the bristles are used in palatal cleansing, the marginal gingiva and cervical part of the crown - the essential areas requiring brushing - are omitted [ [...] . ]. [URL]...|$|E
30|$|Intrinsically, global {{optimization}} algorithms, including PSO, {{perform the}} search for optimum design variables within preset {{upper and lower bounds}} on each variable. In addition to this, the optimization routine should be able to handle all structural constraints specified for the horizontal and vertical wells. First, the wells must be placed within the reservoir. In particular, no part of a horizontal well must fall outside the reservoir or cross any external reservoir boundary. This is important because the <b>toe-end</b> of the well may still fall outside the reservoir even if the lower and upper bounds imposed on the optimization variables are met. Thus, {{there is a need to}} define additional constraints within which the optimization problem must be solved. This, inevitably, leads to a constrained optimization problem.|$|E
