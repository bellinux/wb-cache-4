5|$|Four {{days later}} on 21 August at 08:30, Orizaba, {{traveling}} with Siboney, spotted a submarine {{in the act}} of submerging. Orizaba attempted to ram <b>the</b> <b>sub</b> and dropped depth charges, but there was no indication that the attack was successful.|$|E
5|$|A {{system is}} {{designated}} as a tropical depression or a subtropical depression when it reaches wind speeds above 28knots (50km/h, 32mph). Should a tropical depression reach wind speeds of 35knots (65km/h, 40mph) {{then it will be}} classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either <b>the</b> <b>Sub</b> Regional Center in Mauritius or Madagascar. No matter how strong a subtropical system is in this basin, it is always {{designated as a}} subtropical depression.|$|E
25|$|After {{mapping the}} lake an area was {{selected}} for <b>the</b> <b>subs</b> to dive. Floats were added to <b>the</b> <b>subs</b> {{to compensate for the}} lower density of fresh water, and <b>the</b> <b>subs</b> were launched. Jacques Cousteau and Albert Falco piloted <b>the</b> <b>subs,</b> which were accompanied by divers to a depth of 100 feet, then continued to a depth of 400 feet, where more toads were observed.|$|R
50|$|He was the {{youngest}} person to ever try out for the Legion. He and <b>the</b> <b>Subs</b> aided <b>the</b> Legion numerous times mostly as local law enforcement while the Legion was off-world. In later appearances <b>the</b> <b>Subs</b> were used as comic relief. After <b>the</b> <b>Subs</b> successfully thwarted an invasion of Bismoll by duplicates of Computo the Conqueror, in an embarrassing inept fashion, he disbanded <b>the</b> <b>Subs.</b> His work with <b>the</b> <b>Subs</b> had earned him a waiver to the Legion's rule that new members must be under 18, and he joined the regular Legion, eventually becoming elected their leader and staying with them until they disbanded.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> JASON <b>sub</b> is {{much smaller}} than <b>the</b> main <b>sub</b> {{and can be used}} to explore gaps too small for <b>the</b> main <b>sub</b> to enter and {{it can be used to}} {{completely}} evade the deadly octopus tentacles. <b>The</b> JASON <b>sub</b> has a power level indicating the limited time <b>the</b> JASON <b>sub</b> can part from <b>the</b> main <b>sub.</b> <b>The</b> JASON <b>sub</b> must reunite with main sub to recharge its power. The JASON can only reach the second torpedo level.|$|R
5|$|The USS Allegiance, an American nuclear submarine, is {{patrolling the}} Beaufort Sea {{off the coast}} of Alaska when it comes across a craft below the ice that is {{emitting}} a radio signal. The Allegiance is ordered to fire upon the craft by Pacific Command. However, the craft manages to disable <b>the</b> <b>sub</b> using a high-pitched frequency, stranding it far below the ice.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, <b>the</b> <b>sub</b> king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth Relic of the Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, and this is still done as a tradition in the country. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to Identification friend or foe (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached <b>the</b> <b>sub,</b> the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and <b>the</b> <b>sub</b> assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E
50|$|At 09:00 on 18 August, <b>the</b> <b>subs</b> sent {{a rescue}} boat to stretch rope from the ships {{to the shore}} {{that would allow the}} {{remaining}} Raiders' boats to be pulled out to sea. But just as the operation began, Japanese planes arrived and attacked, sinking the rescue boat and attacking <b>the</b> <b>subs,</b> which were forced to crash dive and wait on the bottom the rest of <b>the</b> day. <b>The</b> <b>subs</b> were undamaged. At 23:08, having managed to signal <b>the</b> <b>subs</b> to meet his Raiders at the entrance to Makin Lagoon, Carlson had a team, led by Lt. Charlie Lamb, build a raft made up of three rubber boats and two native canoes, powered by the two remaining outboard motors. Using this raft, 72 exhausted Raiders sailed 4 miles from Makin to the mouth of the lagoon, where <b>the</b> <b>subs</b> picked them up.|$|R

The system is bass managed such that all the speakers on the left side use <b>the</b> left <b>sub</b> and all <b>the</b> speakers on the right use <b>the</b> right <b>sub.</b> <b>The</b> Center and Back Surround speaker are split among <b>the</b> two <b>subs.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>subs</b> also serve as two discrete LFE (Low Frequency Effects) channels.|$|R
50|$|Members of <b>the</b> <b>Subs</b> {{were given}} a waiver to the Legion's rule that new members must not be older than eighteen.

5|$|The Church of the SubGenius {{was founded}} by Ivan Stang (born Douglas St Clair Smith) and Philo Drummond (born Steve Wilcox) as the SubGenius Foundation. Dr. X (born Monte Dhooge) was also present at the group's inception. The organization's first {{recorded}} activity was {{the publication of a}} photocopied document, known as <b>the</b> <b>Sub</b> Genius Pamphlet #1, disseminated in Dallas, Texas in 1979. The document announced the impending end {{of the world and the}} possible deaths of its readers. It criticized Christian conceptions of God and New Age perceptions of spirituality.|$|E
5|$|The New Guinea Advanced Base {{was formed}} in Port Moresby in August 1942, and sub bases were created at Milne Bay and Oro Bay. These became Advanced Sub Base A and Advanced Sub Base B {{respectively}} in April 1943. Advanced Sub Base C was created on Goodenough Island in April 1943, but was discontinued when the island was handed over to Sixth Army control in July. Meanwhile, Advanced Sub Base D was formed at Port Moresby in May. <b>The</b> <b>sub</b> bases became bases in August 1943. Advanced Base E was formed at Lae and Advanced Base F at Finschhafen in November 1943, followed by Bases G and H at Hollandia and Biak respectively.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} from the military he completed his studies in 1920 and was awarded a Rhodes scholarship in the same year, at New College, Oxford. At Oxford, Treatt gained a Master of Arts and a Bachelor of Civil Law in 1923 and was briefly admitted to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in that year. When he returned to Australia, Treatt {{was appointed to the}} New South Wales Bar and also as <b>the</b> <b>Sub</b> Warden of St Paul's College, University of Sydney from 1925 to 1930. In 1927, he played first grade Rugby Union for the Drummoyne DRFC. He married Dorothy Isabelle Henderson (1902–1992) on 5 June 1930 and had four children: George Vernon, John Vernon (1930–1935), Rosemary Vernon (1930–1944), and Diana Vernon.|$|E
50|$|In November 2010, Navy {{investigators}} discovered rampant cheating {{taking place}} on training exams among <b>the</b> <b>sub's</b> crew. <b>The</b> <b>sub's</b> skipper, Commander Charles Maher was removed. Thirteen other crewmembers were also removed. Navy officers interviewed by the Associated Press stated that training exam cheating was widespread within the navy's submarine force.|$|R
50|$|Nick uses two subs on his search. <b>The</b> main <b>sub</b> can be {{upgraded}} {{with four}} levels of torpedoes, a surfacing missile weapon and a utility that allows <b>the</b> main <b>sub</b> and JASON sub to attack simultaneously. <b>The</b> main <b>sub</b> picks up all items, while <b>the</b> JASON <b>sub</b> can only pick up treasures.|$|R

5|$|Employing <b>the</b> <b>Sub</b> Intelligent Numbers Selector {{theory that}} {{assigned}} non-descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations {{in order to}} disguise their role from the enemy, the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit. Upon formation, {{it was decided that}} the company would be considered an ad hoc, or provisional unit, which meant it did not have a permanent lineage and was only a temporary formation, akin to a task force. This decision was unique to the Eighth Army Ranger Company, as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of Ranger units from World War II, and veterans later expressed resentment with the choice as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations. While subsequent Ranger companies were authorized shoulder sleeve insignia with the distinctive black and red scroll of their World War II predecessors, the Eighth Army Ranger Company wore the shoulder patch of the Eighth United States Army, which commanded all UN troops in Korea.|$|E
5|$|Frank and {{the group}} reach <b>the</b> <b>sub,</b> and they take control of it. After betraying the Man in Black, Widmore's men attack, but they manage to submerge. Jack then discovers the Man in Black planted the C4 in Jack's bag. Sayid sacrifices himself and runs off with the C4 {{as far away from}} the others as he could until it explodes. The {{explosion}} causes the submarine to sink, and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him. Frank revives and makes it {{to the surface of the}} water. He is found by Richard and Miles as they head for Hydra Island to blow up the Ajira plane. Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it. After much repair work and picking up Kate, Claire, and Sawyer, the plane takes off and heads for home.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, one of <b>the</b> <b>sub</b> {{contractors}} of Bouygues {{fell under}} criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to}} be dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the H-11 and H-16 the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of one MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One rotatable Drehlafette DL 131/1C (or E) gun mount in the B-stand was standard and later MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational direction-finding gear was also installed. The Peil G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H blind landing equipment was built in to help with night operations. The radio was a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could be mounted on external ETC 1000 racks, or four ESAC 250 racks. <b>The</b> <b>sub</b> variant H-20/R4 could carry 20 50kg (110lb) bombs as external loads.|$|E
