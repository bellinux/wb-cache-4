5|$|Elizabeth {{gave birth}} to her first child, Prince Charles, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King had issued letters patent {{allowing}} her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess, to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as <b>their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> no longer a royal prince. A second child, Princess Anne, was born in 1950.|$|E
5|$|James Paul McCartney {{was born}} on 18 June 1942 in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary Patricia (née Mohin), had {{qualified}} to practise as a nurse. His father, James ("Jim") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to {{his work as a}} volunteer firefighter during World WarII. McCartney has one younger brother named Michael. Though the children were baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, <b>their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a former Protestant turned agnostic, and religion was not emphasised in the household.|$|E
5|$|Scott and {{his brother}} were inseparable {{when they were younger}} and often played hockey together. While <b>their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> often their team doctor, their mother taught them to skate. She {{enrolled}} them in figure skating to aid their skills development and taught power skating classes in Cranbrook in exchange for ice time for her sons. An offensive defenceman, Scott led his Cranbrook midget team in scoring with 55 goals and 92 points in 1988–89.|$|E

5|$|The {{brothers}} {{were born to}} a plebeian branch {{of the old and}} noble Sempronia family. <b>Their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> the elderly Tiberius Gracchus the Elder (or Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus) who was tribune of the plebs, praetor, consul, and censor. Their mother was a patrician; Cornelia Africana daughter of Scipio Africanus himself considered a hero by the Roman populace for his part in the war against Carthage. Their parents had 12 children, but only one daughter - who later married Scipio Aemilianus (Scipio Africanus the Younger) - and two sons, Tiberius and Gaius, survived childhood.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, KG (c.1530 – 21February 1590) was an English nobleman and general, and {{an elder}} brother of Queen Elizabeth I's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. <b>Their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, {{who led the}} English {{government}} from 15501553 under Edward VI and unsuccessfully tried to establish Lady Jane Grey on the English throne after the King's death in July 1553. For his participation in this venture Ambrose Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London and condemned to death. Reprieved, his rehabilitation came after he fought for Philip II of Spain (then England's co-monarch) in the Battle of St. Quentin.|$|E
5|$|Before his {{departure}} for the Holy Land, Henry of Champagne had bequeathed the Counties of Champagne and Brie to his brother, Theobald, should he die without issue. Although Alice {{and her younger}} sister, Philippa, survived their father, Philip II of France invested their uncle, Theobald III, with Champagne and Brie in January 1198. Theobald III died on 24 May 1201, leaving Champagne and Brie to his posthumous son, Theobald IV, under the regency of his mother, Blanche of Navarre. However, Theobald IV's position was not secure as Alice and Philippa, both born while <b>their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> count, could challenge a posthumous son's right to rule the counties.|$|E

5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that <b>their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E
5|$|The {{petitions}} {{and political}} crisis continued to {{the reign of}} Hamad (1923–42) who —encouraged by the British— began it by setting up a criminal court to try {{those involved in the}} violence including his first cousins, the Khalids. The ruler was put in a dilemma between his tribal alignment and public law, and so he exiled his cousins, but paid their expenses. The Khalids, however, held a deep grudge against residents of Sitra who witnessed against them, and in 1924 attacked the island before their exile, killing several Shia men, women and children. The attackers were sentenced to death following major Shia protests and a lengthy second trial, but managed to escape before the sentence was carried out. <b>Their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> confined to Manama. The trials marked the first time in Bahrain's history that members of the ruling family were convicted.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{moved to}} Drumcondra in October 1919, where Thomas {{found a job}} as a bank cashier. The job did not pay well, but the two managed on his meagre wages. In early 1920, they moved to Grove Road in the Rathmines district, and Brendan was born in October. Soon afterwards, Brendan and his mother were nearly killed when caught in the cross-fire between the controversial, mostly British {{temporary}} constables employed by the Royal Irish Constabulary—Black and Tans—and the Irish Republican Army (IRA). In 1921, Brendan's brother Raymond was born, followed by sisters Clare and Monica, and a brother, Kevin. The household was somewhat split over religious and political issues. <b>Their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> a teetotaller and a strict Catholic. Their mother, however, encouraged the elder brothers to adopt a more liberal leaning in life. Brendan was educated at Synge Street and Marlborough Street. At 10, Brendan showed a keen interest in sport, particularly rugby.|$|E

5|$|The term in Athens {{seems to}} have always been {{somewhat}} loosely used in legal proceedings. Apollodorus, an Athenian politician and litigant from the 4th century BCE, {{in one of his}} speeches attempted to use an Athenian law about betrothal to make his mother an epikleros. He claimed that the law defined an epikleros as a female without father, a brother who shared a father with her, or a paternal grandfather. His opponent, however, {{seems to have}} disputed this interpretation of the law. A speech by Isaeus, a 4th-century BCE speechwriter, rests on the claim that the speaker's mother only became an epikleros after her young brother died following their father's death. Whether the legal authorities recognized the speaker's claim as valid is unknown. It appears, at least according to some plays, that a woman with a brother who died after <b>their</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> considered the epikleros of her brother, not her father.|$|E
