40|$|Cotton, flax, hemp, {{and cotton}} bracts {{extracts}} did not release histamine from mouse, rat, guinea pig, horse, cow, and monkey lung. Neither rat peritoneal mast cells nor mouse mastocytoma cells released histamine when incubated with <b>textile</b> <b>dust</b> extracts. Compound 48 / 80 caused a considerable release of histamine {{from all these}} tissues and the extracts released histamine from pig and human lung tissues. Whereas dusts that cause bronchospasm in man released histamine [...] for instance, cotton [...] those that are inactive, such as pericarps, did not. Histamine release was not quantitatively related to the concentration of extract used. Cotton bracts extract released histamine from pig lung tissue whereas in the same preparations methyl piperonylate was inactive. The active releasing agent was highly water soluble but could not be steam distilled from, nor extracted by, ether from bracts extract. These physicochemical properties are not characteristic of methyl piperonylate. There was no correlation between the induction of histidine decarboxylase and the histamine releasing capacity of the extracts. We conclude that pig lung is a useful qualitative assay tissue for the further characterisation of the histamine releasing agent(s) in <b>textile</b> <b>dust</b> extracts...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{resource}} efficiency by utilising {{secondary raw material}} {{is one of the}} key characteristics of a circular economy. <b>Textile</b> <b>dust</b> fibre, a waste generated from textile mechanical recycling has the prospect to be utilised as secondary raw material for producing novel material: textile paper suitable for packaging and other applications. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of carrier bags made from one ton of virgin paper, recycled paper and novel textile paper (~ 22584 paper bags with grammage of 100 g/m 2 and same dimensions for all 3 types of bags) showed that textile paper bag is more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint. The largest environmental contributors were energy consumed in the pulping and paper making processes, followed by the use of adhesives and printing ink in the conversion process of paper to papercarrier bags. A comparative Techno-economic Assessment (TEA) was carried out for the operating cost of producing the three selected carrier bag types. The analysis conveyed that textile paper bags are more economically attractive, mainly due to the partial substitution of paper fibre with low-cost <b>textile</b> <b>dust</b> fibre. Furthermore, a simple tool was developed with an attempt to assess and compare materials suitability for the circular economy considering life cycle thinking and business perspectives. Assessment of textile paper using the Circular material assessment tool indicated that there is still scope for improvement on the following circularity characteristics of circular material: scarcity of raw material, local supply of resources, clean and non-toxic resources. Textile paper material scored high in the following circularity characteristics: secondary raw material, industrial symbiosis, recycling, {{resource efficiency}} in manufacturing and use. In the final step, the textile paper bag was eco-designed through the combined and iterative LCA and TEA approach with the aim to achieve improved scores as a circular material. In order to understand the overall sustainability advantages and trade-offs, further research is recommended on different <b>textile</b> <b>dust</b> fibre grades as well as textile paper performance based on mechanical properties.

40|$|Background: Sinonasal cancer (SNC) {{is a rare}} tumor with {{predominant}} occupational etiology {{associated with}} exposures to specific carcinogens. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe SNC cases recorded in Italy in the period 2000 - 2016. Methods: Clinical information, occupational history, and lifestyle habits of SNC cases collected in the Italian Sinonasal Cancer Register were examined. Age-standardized rates were estimated. Results: Overall, 1529 cases were recorded. The age-standardized incidence rates per 100000 person-years were 0. 65 in men and 0. 26 in women. Occupational exposures were predominant among the attributed exposure settings, primarily to wood and leather dusts. Other putative causal agents included chrome, solvents, tannins, formaldehyde, <b>textile</b> <b>dusts,</b> and pesticides. Many cases had unknown exposure.

IARC monograph concludes that working in the textile manufacturing industry entails exposures that are possibly carcinogenic to humans. The purpose of this study was to investigate risk of lung cancer incidence in {{textile industry}} workers by the type of job and evaluate the relation between occupational textile dusts exposure and lung cancer risk in a cohort. Methods Altogether 14650 textile workers were included in this retrospective study and were followed from 1978 to 2002. Lung cancer risk was analyzed using the standardized incidence ratios (SIR) calculated by the person-years method. The expected number of cases was calculated by indirect methods using Lithuanian incidence rates. Results During the period of 25 years 70 cancer cases for male and 15 for female were identified. The SIR for male was 0. 94 (95 % CI PI 0. 73 – 1. 19), for female 1. 36 (95 % CI 0. 76 – 2. 25). The lung cancer risk for male in the cotton textile production unit was significantly lower after 10 years of employment (SIR = 0. 34; 95 % CI 0. 12 – 0. 73).

Aim To investigate the risk of mortality in a cohort of textile workers and examine whether specific occupational exposures were associated with mortality. Methods Data on members and former members of a textile industry union were extracted from membership cards and matched with the National Death Index to obtain date and cause of death. Exposure to 31 different substances was assessed using a specifically designed job exposure matrix that consisted of profiles of exposures in 11 occupational titles. These profiles were modified according to individual circumstances. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed comparing the cohort to the Australian population and Mantel-Haenszel estimates of the rate ratios were computed comparing exposed with unexposed for each of the substances. Results There were 113 deaths in the cohort of 7684 workers. Male and female textile workers had similar risks of death from any cause, cancer or cardiovascular disease to the general Australian population. Male workers had an increased risk of death from injury (SMR = 157, 95 % confidence interval 113 – 213).

40|$|A high {{proportion}} of textile workers handling cotton and flax complain of respiratory symptoms and show a loss in lung function. These effects are reversible {{in the early stages}} but {{the degree to which they}} lead to permanent respiratory disability is unknown. Two surveys were therefore conducted in which respiratory function and symptoms were compared in ex-textile workers and in control subjects who had never been exposed to <b>textile</b> <b>dusts.</b> One survey was of ex-flax workers in Northern Ireland. The present survey was of ex-cotton workers in Lancashire. A survey of random population samples in Oldham and Bolton, in both of which cotton had formerly been the most important source of employment, was conducted. After allowing for age, height, and smoking, lung function was about 2 - 8 % lower in the ex-textile workers than in controls who had never been exposed to any dust. Ex-textile workers were slightly shorter than the controls, suggestive of past social and nutritional deprivation which may have contributed to the decrement in lung function. There was evidence of a small but increasing decrement in lung function with an increase in a "dust exposure" score. For men, about 15 years of heavy dust exposure was associated with a loss in FEV 1 equivalent to that shown by light or ex-smokers.

40|$|Purpose of reviewOver 60 {{million people}} {{worldwide}} {{work in the}} textile or clothing industry. Recent studies have recognized the contribution of workplace exposures to chronic lung diseases, in particular {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Early studies in textile workers have focused on the relationship between hemp or cotton dust exposure {{and the development of a}} syndrome termed Byssinosis. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effect of long term exposure to organic dust in textile workers on chronic respiratory disease in the broader context of disease classifications such as reversible or irreversible obstructive lung disease (i. e. asthma or COPD), and restrictive lung disease. Recent findingsCessation of exposure to cotton dusts leads to improvement in lung function. Recent animal models have suggested a shift in the lung macrophage:dendritic cell population as a potential mechanistic explanation for persistent inflammation in the lung due to repeated cotton-dust related endotoxin exposure. Other types of <b>textile</b> <b>dust,</b> such as silk, may contribute to COPD in textile workers. SummaryTextile dust related obstructive lung disease has characteristics of both asthma and COPD.

Our {{aim was to}} investigate {{a wide range of}} occupational exposures, individual occupational titles and socioeconomic status (SES) as potential risk factors for acoustic neuroma. Methods We conducted a population-based caseecontrol study of 793 acoustic neuroma cases identified through the Swedish Cancer Registry and 101 762 randomly selected controls. Information on SES and occupation was obtained from censuses and linked to job-exposure matrices. Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and calculate 95 % CIs. Results An increased OR was seen for mercury exposure < 10 years before the reference year (OR 2. 9; 95 % CI 1. 2 to 6. 8), and a more modest association for benzene exposure (OR 1. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 0 to 3. 2) $ 10 years before the reference year. We observed a threefold increased risk for females working as tailors and dressmakers $ 10 years before the reference year, and a more than threefold significantly elevated OR for those working as truck and conveyor operators < 10 years before the reference year. We found no convincing evidence that SES is related to disease development. Conclusion We observed an increased risk of acoustic neuroma associated with occupational exposure to mercury, benzene and <b>textile</b> <b>dust.</b> Men working as truck and conveyor operators < 10 years before the reference year had the highest increased risk of acoustic neuroma, but it is unclear what in those occupations might contribute to disease development. Our study also suggested an association between acoustic neuroma and being a class teacher or policeman.

40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} effects {{occur in}} {{a high proportion of}} subjects exposed to <b>textile</b> <b>dusts.</b> The extent to which these lead to permanent respiratory symptoms and loss of lung function is unknown. A survey of random population samples was therefore conducted in ten towns in Northern Ireland in which flax processing had been a major source of employment. The MRC questionnaire on respiratory symptoms was administered and Vitalograph tracings recorded on subjects aged 40 to 74 inclusive. An occupational history was taken {{at the end of each}} interview. Lung function in ex-flax workers was slightly lower than in control subjects never exposed to flax dust, but the presence of a positive interaction with age meant that differences were apparent only in the younger subjects. Over about the age of 65 the lung function in the ex-flax workers was comparable with that of the controls and overall the loss was at most about half that due to light smoking (1 - 14 cigarettes a day). The association between a "dust exposure score" and lung function was inconsistent in the two sexes. In men there was a small decrement with increasing dust exposure. In women there was also a small decrement, but a positive interaction with age meant that the women with the highest dust exposure scores had a lower loss with increasing age than the women with the least dust exposure. There was an excess in symptoms in the ex-flax workers but the size of the excess was greater than would be expected from the lung function results. It is possible that, although the survey was conducted without explicit reference to the flax industry, knowledge throughout Northern Ireland that many flax workers have been awarded compensation on the grounds of respiratory disablement may have led to an increased reporting of symptoms in the ex-flax workers...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{aim of this}} {{analysis}} of the French Cooperative PAARC (Pollution Atmosphérique et Affections Respiratoires Chroniques) survey, was to test whether occupational exposures to dusts, gases, or chemical fumes or to specific hazards, estimated by job exposure matrices, were related to a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). METHODS [...] The most recent occupation was recorded in adults, aged 25 - 59, from non-manual worker households. Analysis was restricted to 10, 046 subjects whose occupation was encountered at least 10 times {{in the study and}} who performed good FEV 1 tracings. From occupational title, exposures to dusts, gases, and chemical fumes, and to specific hazards were classified in three categories (no, low, and high) with a British, a French, and an Italian job exposure matrix. Specific hazards were analysed for the British and French job exposure matrices for the same 42 specific dusts, gases, and chemical fumes. To limit spurious associations, a selection of seven hazard groups and 12 specific hazards was set {{before the start of the}} analysis. Based on the consistency of the relations according to sex and the British and French job exposure matrices, associations of age, height, city, and smoking adjusted FEV 1 score with occupational exposures were classified as very likely, possible, or unlikely. RESULTS [...] For the three job exposure matrices and both sexes clear exposure-response relations between the level of exposure to dusts, gases, and chemical fumes, and a decrease in FEV 1 were found. Associations with FEV 1 were classified as very likely for known hazards such as organic <b>dusts</b> and <b>textile</b> <b>dusts,</b> and not previously recognised hazards such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and detergents, and as possible for solvents, waxes and polishes, and diesel fumes. Associations found for PAHs and solvents were confirmed by the Italian job exposure matrix. Associations remained significant in women, but not in men, after adjustment for educational level. CONCLUSIONS [...] Hypotheses have been generated for exposure to detergents, PAHs, and solvents, but they need to be interpreted with caution before replication. Significant associations found for known risk factors with a decrease in FEV 1 are arguments for the validity of the matrices. Despite the expected limitations of job exposure matrices, these results encourage further work to improve exposure assessment by job exposure matrices...|$|R

Detailed information on smoking, alcohol consumption, and lifetime occupational history was collected. Occupational exposure to seven substances (formaldehyde, leather dust, wood dust, flour dust, coal dust, silica dust, and <b>textile</b> <b>dust)</b> was assessed with a job exposure matrix. Exposure variables used in the analysis were probability, duration, and cumulative level of exposure. Odds ratios (ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression, and were adjusted for major confounding factors (age, smoking, alcohol, and when relevant other occupational exposures).  RESULTS—Hypopharyngeal cancer was found to be associated with exposure to coal dust (OR 2. 31,  95 % CI 1. 21  to 4. 40), with a significant rise in risk with probability (p< 0. 005 for trend) and level (p< 0. 007 for trend) of exposure. Exposure to coal dust was also associated with an increased risk of laryngeal cancer (OR 1. 67,  95 % CI 0. 92  to 3. 02), but no dose-response pattern was found. A significant relation, limited to hypopharyngeal cancer, was found with the probability of exposure to formaldehyde (p< 0. 005 for trend), with a fourfold risk for the highest category (OR 3. 78  ,  95 % CI 1. 50  to 9. 49). When subjects exposed to formaldehyde with a low probability were excluded, the risk also increased with duration (p< 0. 04) and cumulative level of exposure (p< 0. 14).

Conspicuous findings in humans are the effects of outdoor air pollution on the nasal mucosa, and tobacco smoking as {{a risk factor for}} sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma. Objective methods in humans to discriminate between sensory irritation and olfactory stimulation and between adaptation and habituation have been introduced successfully, providing more relevant information than sensory irritation studies in animals. Against the background of chemoperception as a dominant window of the brain on the outside world, nasal neurotoxicology is rapidly developing, focusing on olfactory and trigeminal nerve toxicity. Better insight in the processes underlying neurogenic inflammation may increase our knowledge of the causes of the various chemical sensitivity syndromes. Nasal immunotoxicology is extremely complex, which is mainly due to the pivotal role of nasal lymphoid tissue in the defense of the middle ear, eye, and oral cavity against antigenic substances, and the important function of the nasal passages in brain drainage in rats. The crucial role of tissue damage and reactive epithelial hyperproliferation in nasal carcinogenesis has become overwhelmingly clear as demonstrated by the recently developed biologically based model for predicting formaldehyde nasal cancer risk in humans. The evidence of carcinogenicity of inhaled complex mixtures in experimental animals is very limited, while there is ample evidence that occupational exposure to mixtures such as wood, leather, or <b>textile</b> <b>dust</b> or chromium- and nickel-containing materials is associated with increased risk of nasal cancer. It is remarkable that these mixtures are aerosols, suggesting that their "particulate nature" may be a major factor in their potential to induce nasal cancer. Studies in rats have been conducted with defined mixtures of nasal irritants such as aldehydes, using a model for competitive agonism to predict the outcome of such mixed exposures. When exposure levels in a mixture of nasal cytotoxicants were equal to or below the "No- Observed-Adverse-Effect-levels" (NOAELs) of the individual chemicals, neither additivity nor potentiation was found, indicating that the NOAEL of the "most risky chemical" in the mixture would also be the NOAEL of the mixture. In vitro models are increasingly being used to study mechanisms of nasal toxicity. However, considering the complexity of the nasal cavity and the many factors that contribute to nasal toxicity, it is unlikely that in vitro experiments ever will be substitutes for in vivo inhalation studies. It is widely recognized that a strategic approach should be available for the interpretation of nasal effects in experimental animals with regard to potential human health risk. Mapping of nasal lesions combined with airflow-driven dosimetry and knowledge about local metabolism is a solid basis for extrapolation of animal data to humans. However, {{more research is needed to}} better understand factors that determine the susceptibility of human and animal tissues to nasal toxicants, in particular nasal carcinogens...|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{materials}} design research there is an increasing interest in an amalgamation of the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and maths in order to focus upon smart fiber and textile innovation for human and environmental applications. What may seem sci-fi solutions for a raft of different problems have at the core innovative man-made textiles and technologies, and are becoming the zeitgeist of many international research and development sectors {{with the promise of}} as yet unknown applications and commercial opportunities. In 2007 Ohmatex's White Paper on Smart Textiles reported that in 2005 smart and interactive fabrics were worth US$ 340 million with a compound growth rate of 28. 3 percent per year which became US$ 642 million in 2008 and has continued to rise. Today there is a paradigm shift in research activity due to technical developments in miniaturization at nano-scale, coupled with improved sensor networks and the creation of new composites to enable the creation of smart technologies for integration into soft engineering products for the body and the built environment. These innovations are enabled in many cases by traditional textile design thinking and product development such as the creation of synthetic nano fiber polymers, to incorporate ubiquitous computing into textiles which have immediate applications that include health-monitoring, active insulation, personal communication, environmental sensors, and security. The enhancement of integral nano-innovations such as self-cleaning, water repellence, thermal regulation, “breathability,” and materials that stiffen on impact or change shape are part of the <b>textile</b> future. Smart <b>Dust</b> is in this vanguard area, where the combination of synthetic textile polymer and pervasive and adaptive computing knowledge is emergent and highly technical in relation to applications.

Näiden pölyjen aiheuttamaa pitkäaikaista tulehdusta ei ilmeisesti kuitenkaan seuraa lisääntynyt riski sairastua syöpään, vaan ne saattavat jopa suojata joiltakin syöviltä. Altistuminen orgaanisille pölyille ei näyttäisi olevan merkittävä syövän riskitekijä. Eläin- ja kasviperäisille pölyille altistuminen saattaa jopa suojata keuhkosyövältä ja mahdollisesti joiltakin muilta syöviltä. Maanviljelijöillä todettiin alentunut riski sairastua keuhkopussin, maksan, kurkunpään, keuhkojen, nenän, ruokatorven ja virtsarakon syöpään. Home- ja bakteeripölylle altistumisen todettiin olevan yhteydessä alentuneeseen riskiin sairastua keuhkosyöpään. Eri ammatteja tarkasteltaessa todettiin viitteellisesti lisääntyneitä syöpäriskejä seuraavasti: keuhkosyöpä leipureilla, kurkunpäänsyöpä mylläreillä ja huulisyöpä maanviljelijöillä. Eri orgaanisia pölyjä tutkittaessa todettiin lisääntyneitä syöpäriskejä seuraavasti: puupöly ja nenäsyöpä, keuhkosyöpä ja keuhkopussinsyöpä; kasvipöly ja kurkunpääsyöpä, home- ja bakteeripöly ja kohdunkaulansyöpä ja huulisyöpä. Työterveyslaitoksen ja Suomen Syöpärekisterin hankkeen Työperäinen altistuminen ja syöpävaara Suomessa osana selvitettiin Suomen Syöpärekisterin syöpätietokannasta elintarviketeollisuuden työntekijöiden ja maanviljelijöiden kaikkien syöpien esiintyvyys, jota verrattiin koko väestön syövän esiintyvyyteen. Hankkeen tarkoituksena on löytää työperäisen syövän riskiammatteja ja syövälle altistavia tekijöitä, jotta työskentelyolosuhteiden parantamista voidaan kohdentaa oikein. Tarkastelun kohteena oli altistuminen seuraaville orgaanisille pölyille: eläinpöly, kasvipöly, jauhopöly, puupöly, paperipöly, tekstiilipöly, nahkapöly, synteettinen polymeeripöly, homepöly ja bakteeripöly. Tässä tarkastelussa mukaan tuli myös muita ammatteja mm. tekstiili- ja rakennusalalta. Työterveyslaitoksen työaltistematriisia (FINJEM) käyttäen arvioitiin näille orgaanisille pölyille altistuneiden työntekijöiden määrää ja altistumisen tasoa eri ammateissa ja altistumisen vaikutusta eri syöpien esiintyvyyteen. Tutkimuksessa selvitettiin uusien syöpä tapausten määrä ja laatu 1970 -luvulta 2000 -luvulle 1930 - 1970 -luvun työikäisillä. Organic dusts of vegetable, {{animal or}} {{microbial}} origin are major causes of occupational {{diseases of the}} respiratory tract. There is inconclusive evidence concerning the risk of cancer from organic dusts, and only limited knowledge on inhalatory exposure to some organic dusts and cancer, e. g., bacteria and moulds. The food industry and agriculture have significant occupational organic dust exposure. The aims {{of the present study}} were: 1. To study the risk of respiratory cancer among workers in the food industry and agriculture, whose exposure is mainly inhalatory. 2. To generate a hypothesis concerning other cancers among food industry workers and agricultural workers, and to discover new associations between occupational agents and cancer. 3. To describe the cancer risk pattern of Finnish farmers and to define the type of farm as a potential determinant of the observed risk ratios. 4. To study whether changes in the type of farm account for alterations in lung cancer risk. A low prevalence of cancer has been associated especially with dairy farming; discontinuing dairy farming might thus increase the risk of lung cancer. 5. To assess the association between cancer and occupational exposure to bacteria and moulds in Finland. The presumption was that exposure to biological dust dominated by moulds and Gram-positive bacteria increases the risk of respiratory cancer due to mycotoxin and bacterial exotoxin, and that, conversely, exposure dominated by Gram-negative bacteria decreases respiratory cancer risk due to the presence of endotoxin. 6. To study whether inhalatory exposure to moulds increases the risk of cancers of the liver, oesophagus, upper respiratory tract, and urinary tract. The computerized registries of Statistics Finland (census, occupations, and death certificates), Finnish Cancer Registry (cancer cases), Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (Finnish job-exposure matrix (FINJEM)), Finnish National Public Health Institute (life-style data) and Farm Registry of Finland (farm data) were linked based on either individual or group level key variables. The cohort in the studies utilizing FINJEM comprised all economically active Finns born between 1 January 1906 and 31 December 1945 who participated in the national population census on 31 December 1970 (667, 121 men; 513, 110 women). Statistics Finland maintains and updates the census files for vital status to allow exact person-year calculation. Data on the main occupation in 1970 were obtained from the Population Census records (Statistics Finland 1974). The socioeconomic status (SES) of each subject was based on the subject's occupation. In our analyses, the SES was categorized as follows: farmers, higher white-collar, clerical, skilled blue-collar, and unskilled workers. The occupational exposures of the cohort were estimated by using a job-exposure matrix, FINJEM. FINJEM covers the major occupational exposures in Finland from 1945 onwards by occupation and calendar time. FINJEM characterizes exposure by the proportion of exposed persons (P) and the average level of exposure (L) among the exposed persons in each occupation. The estimates are based on exposure measurements, hazard surveys, and the assessments of occupational hygienists. P and L are assessed in FINJEM quantitatively for chemical, biological and physical agents. Major changes in exposure over time are taken into account enabling estimations of cumulative exposure (CE). FINJEM also includes estimates of alcohol consumption and smoking prevalence by occupation. The Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR) has collected data on cancer cases diagnosed in Finland since 1953. All physicians, hospitals and other institutions, and all pathologic, cytological and haematological laboratories in the country must notify the FCR of all cancer cases that come to their attention. In addition, Statistics Finland annually provides a computerized file on all death certificates in which cancer is mentioned. The expected number of cancer cases was calculated by multiplying the number of person-years lived by persons in that occupation (or in exposure) with the cancer incidence rate of the referent population (or un-exposed population). Exposure for each birth cohort was assumed to start in the year when {{the average age of the}} birth cohort was 20, and to end in the mid-year of the observation period, or at 65 years of age, whichever came first. In internal comparison within an occupation, the employees within an occupation were divided into groups of cumulative exposure of un-exposed (none) and exposed (low, medium, high) using time, and P and L data as the base for grouping. In selected cancers, regression analysis was performed adjusting for smoking, social class, and alcohol consumption (laryngeal cancer), asbestos and quartz dust (lung cancer). A total of 2, 526 incident cancer cases were found among Finnish food industry workers. Among male food industry workers, elevated risks were observed for pancreatic cancer (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 1 - 2. 0) and kidney cancer (SIR 1. 5, CI 1. 2 - 1. 9). There was an excess of lung cancer among female bakers (SIR 1. 4, CI 1. 0 - 1. 9) and laryngeal cancer among male grain millers (SIR 2. 6, CI 1. 1 - 5. 4). A total of 20, 426 incident cases of respiratory cancer were found among employees exposed to one or more types of eight organic dusts. A slightly elevated risk of nasal cancer (SIR 1. 4, CI 0. 8 - 2. 4) was observed among men exposed to wood dust. Men exposed to plant dust (mainly grain millers) had an elevated SIR of laryngeal cancer in the high exposure class (SIR 3. 6, CI 1. 3 - 7. 7). Men exposed to wood dust had an elevated SIR for lung cancer, but only in the low exposure class (SIR 1. 1, CI 1. 0 - 1. 2). Women exposed to wood dust had an elevated SIR for mesotheliomas in the low exposure class (SIR 4. 6, CI 1. 3 - 11. 7) and some excess in the medium exposure category. Men with the highest occupational exposure to moulds and bacteria had a reduced relative risk for lung cancer (risk ratio (RR) 0. 7, 95 % confidence interval 0. 6 - 0. 9 for moulds and RR 0. 9 (CI 0. 8 - 1. 0) for bacteria) as compared with non-exposed men. Women in the highest mould and bacteria exposure category had RRs of 3. 1 (CI 1. 0 - 9. 2) and 2. 6 (CI 1. 5 - 4. 7) for cervical cancer, respectively. The respective RRs for lip cancer in the highest mould and bacteria exposure category among men and women combined were 2. 4 (CI 1. 2 - 5. 1) and 1. 6 (CI 1. 2 - 2. 2). The farmer study cohort comprised all farmers on 31 December 1978, who were included in the Finnish Farm Registry. The continuation of farming activity was checked from the 1990 and 1994 Farm Registry data. The overall cancer incidence among farmers was lower than in the general population. The only significantly elevated SIR was that for lip cancer. The lowest rates among farmers who continued farming were in mesothelioma and cancers of the liver, larynx, lung, nose, oesophagus and urinary bladder. Permanent beef and dairy farmers had the lowest SIRs for overall cancer. In 1978 those dairy farmers who had changed over to crop farming had a slightly higher overall cancer incidence than those who continued dairy farming. Occupational exposure is unlikely to be a major risk factor for cancer among Finnish food industry workers. Exposure to organic dusts is unlikely to be a major risk factor of respiratory cancer, with the possible exception of wood dust in the causation of nasal cancer. We found some evidence that exposure to grain dust might elevate the risk of laryngeal cancer. Exposure to either moulds or bacteria is unlikely to be a major risk factor of cancer, even though increased risk was observed for some cancer types. The cancer incidence of Finnish farmers was significantly below the national average. The hypothesis that exposure to <b>textile</b> <b>dust</b> and plant and animal dust might decrease the risk of lung cancer was supported. The finding that lung cancer risk was low among dairy farmers but increased along with a change to other types of farming offers some support to the hypothesis that endotoxin exposure may decrease cancer risk. Both the present results as well as earlier ones related to lung cancer need to be interpreted with caution, because even after adjustment for the strongest confounding factor, i. e., smoking, there is a possibility of residual confounding...|$|E
