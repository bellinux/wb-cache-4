5|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> acclaim, players' {{response to}} the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design {{was too much of}} a change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, as opposed to the more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E
5|$|Knowles {{had been}} working on her second studio album on and off since 2005 {{following}} her return home to Houston, Texas, and her divorce from Daniel Smith, with whom she had lived following the birth of their son Daniel Julez in October 2004. The follow-up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> and commercial disappointment of 2003's Solo Star was preceded by Knowles's move from Columbia to Geffen Records in late 2007. Knowles was heavily influenced by Motown girl groups such as The Supremes and The Marvelettes, and by her mother Tina, a one-time member of the 1960s harmony group The Veltones, who used to play music by the likes of Dusty Springfield and Martha Reeves to her. Knowles decided to distance herself from the teen pop and dance-pop-oriented R sound mainly associated with her previous effort, Solo Star.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Universe {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe. Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that is very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E

5|$|Who's That Girl: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is {{the first}} soundtrack album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records to promote the film of the same name. It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, Coati Mundi and Michael Davidson. The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album, despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album. After the commercial success of her film Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled Slammer, about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused of homicide. However, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> and commercial failure of her adventure film Shanghai Surprise (1986), Warner Bros. were initially reluctant to green light the project, but later agreed, after Madonna convinced them and also {{because they wanted to}} cash in on Madonna's success with soundtracks.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} {{approach is to}} test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore {{the probability that the}} estimator belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> region given that null hypothesis is true (statistical significance) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator doesn't belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> region given that the alternative hypothesis is true.
