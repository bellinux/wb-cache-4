5|$|The four NATO {{aircraft}} {{shot down}} during Operation Deny Flight also forced NATO members to consider new defensive measures for their aircraft, including increased stealth capabilities. Deny Flight also demonstrated {{the necessity of}} better communications and integration among forces operating together, and led to some calls for technical training of UN personnel to work with NATO military systems. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> established under Deny Flight also {{played an important role}} in shaping <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> for later NATO operations other than war, including Operation Joint Endeavor, and even NATO operations in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|In June, William Sullivan was {{replaced}} as ambassador by G. McMurtrie Godley, who immediately loosened <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> {{and increased the}} bombing campaign {{in the north and}} northeast. The results were almost immediate. Nearly 50 {{percent of the population of}} the once heavily populated Plain of Jars had moved into refugee camps in the south. Refugee rolls for the Agency for International Development, which had averaged 130,000 between 1964 and 1968, jumped to 230,000 in February 1970.|$|E
5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of the combatants painted their helicopters {{to look like}} those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and difficulties in aircraft identification, NATO forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.|$|E

5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> {{prevented}} U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases, and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against a decoy target, and shoot them down in the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the right time to launch a decoy operation.|$|E
5|$|Bolívar, {{learning}} about {{the collapse of the}} Cádiz expedition, spent the year 1820 preparing a liberating campaign in Venezuela. Bolívar was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although Bolívar rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month truce and the regularization of <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> under the law of nations on November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the ayuntamiento of Maracaibo declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new nation-state of Gran Colombia. Miguel de la Torre, who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bolívar returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Bolívar could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.|$|E

25|$|The {{combined}} bomber offensive {{was born}} out of the need to strike back at Germany during the years when the United Kingdom had no forces on the continent of Europe.

In Burundi, a fierce civil war then erupted between Tutsi and Hutu following the army's massacre. This conflict spilled over the border into Rwanda and destabilized the fragile Rwandan accords. Tutsi-Hutu tensions rapidly intensified. Although the UN sent a peacekeeping force named the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), it was underfunded, under-staffed, and largely ineffective {{in the face of}} a two country civil-war.

The exact size and strength of the force must be agreed to {{by the government of}} the nation whose territory the conflict is on. <b>The</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Engagement</b> must be developed and approved by both the parties involved and the Security Council.

In April 1999, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> were changed to allow Harriers to use GPS navigation and targeting during medium-altitude bombing missions. A total of 870 Harrier II sorties were carried out during the 78-day bombing campaign.

25|$|The Patriotic Neutralists {{established}} their headquarters within a known no-strike zone {{so that it}} could not be bombed by air strikes. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> followed by the American forces within the Kingdom of Laos posited a 16 kilometer wide sanctuary along the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to avoid inadvertent attacks on the DRV. However, in October 1969, the American ambassador changed the rules of engagement; the protected border area was cut to eight kilometers. The Patriotic Neutralist headquarters lay in the newly exposed zone. At 0600 hours on 13 October 1969, one of the Raven FACs flying a T-28 Trojan directed a pair of F-4 Phantoms in a devastating raid on the headquarters. All of Deuane's subordinate officers were killed; however, he was in the DRV at the time.|$|E
