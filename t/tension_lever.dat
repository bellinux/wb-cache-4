5000|$|A crampon is a {{traction}} {{device that}} {{is attached to}} footwear to improve mobility on snow and ice during ice climbing. Not only are crampons used during ice climbing, {{but they are also}} used for secure travel on snow and ice, such as crossing glaciers, snowfields and icefields, ascending snow slopes, and scaling ice-covered rock. There are three main attachment systems for footwear: step-in, hybrid, and strap bindings. The first two require boots with welts, as a <b>tension</b> <b>lever</b> attaches the crampon to the heel. The last type (strap bindings) are more versatile and can adapt to virtually any boot or shoe, but often do not fit as precisely as the other two types.|$|E
40|$|Compact, {{manually}} operated mechanical actuator applies controlled, limited tensile or compressive axial force. Designed to apply loads to bearings during wear tests in clean room. Intended to replace hydraulic actuator. Actuator rests on stand and imparts axial force to part attached to clevis inside or below stand. Technician turns control screw {{at one end}} of lever. Depending on direction of rotation of control screw, its end of lever driven downward (for compression) or upward (for <b>tension).</b> <b>Lever</b> pivots about clevis pin at end opposite of control screw; motion drives downward or upward link attached via shearpin at middle of lever. Link drives coupling and, through it, clevis attached to part loaded...|$|E
50|$|A serving {{board or}} serving mallet {{can be used}} to help get the outer twine as tight as possible. Despite the name (arising from its shape) the serving mallet is not used to hit anything; it forms a kind of guide and <b>tensioning</b> <b>lever</b> for {{applying}} the twine to the rope.|$|R
40|$|The device {{consists}} of two grab elements, each with a grab jaw section {{and a lever arm}} section. The lever arm sections are charged by a movable power-transmitting element, which is <b>tensioned</b> against the <b>lever</b> arm sections by a tensioner device. An actuator is formed by a piezo adjusting element, which is charged by an electrical control voltage. This lengthens the element {{in the direction of the}} lever arm sections, so that it presses against the power-transmitting element, which in turn is driven in the direction of the lever arm sections. This causes the grab jaws to move about joints, and towards each other. ADVANTAGE - Simple to manufacture, modular construction...|$|R
50|$|Originally {{called the}} Barber-Colman Impressor, the Barcol impressor was {{developed}} by Walter Colman as a hand-held, portable means of assessing the hardness of a material during World War II. The United States Army Air Corps required a hand-held method of checking the hardness of rivets due to concerns that aircraft could be sabotaged by replacing normal rivets with soft lead or wooden ones which would fail during flight. The impressor operates when the tip is pressed against the material in question. The hardness of the material determines how far the tip indents and this is transferred by a <b>tension</b> spring and <b>lever</b> to be read on a dial.|$|R
50|$|The bladess of the three-bladed {{main rotor}} are {{attached}} to the rotor head via a lightweight and strong interleaving steel plates while tie-rods absorb direct centrifugal force under <b>tension.</b> The blade <b>levers</b> are connected via ball joints to the arms of a control spider, the cone of which being actuated up and down by the collective pitch lever in order to change to pitch of all of the blades; an irreversible mechanism is present to prevent blade loads being transferred back to the control stick. The blades are supported when still or at slow rotational speeds by droop stops, which serve to keep a level of clearance between the blades and the fuselage even under high wind conditions; these stops are withdrawn above 100 RPM so that full freedom of movement for effective flight is possible.|$|R
30|$|To {{attach the}} threads to the {{traction}} device, the threads are passed {{along the sides}} of the traction device over movable rollers (to protect the thread) [1] to the spring opposite [2]. The springs also have movable rollers [3] to protect the thread. The threads are run around these and then placed in the holding device slit. After lowering the tensioning wheel [4] until a click is heard, the tension can be built up in intervals by turning the wheel. The great advantage of this is that both threads can be tightened simultaneously, and most important, evenly. Furthermore, the tensile direction is predetermined throughout the entire procedure. Partial relaxation of tension is possible at any time via the release lever [5]. Once the desired tension has been attained the tensioning wheel should be locked into position via the safety lever [6]. This safety device prevents the patient or operator from releasing the traction device unintentionally. To increase and decrease <b>tension</b> the safety <b>lever</b> must be released.|$|R
50|$|Every APR rifle is {{equipped}} with a MIL-STD-1913 rail on top of the upper receiver for mounting components to accommodate different types of optical or electro-optical sights, with the option to mount three extra rails on the stock for attaching tactical accessories. The rifle can be equipped with an optional folding front sight and an aperture-type rear sight. Iron sights cannot be mounted on integrally silenced APR models. Brügger & Thomet offers a proprietary TRS (Tactical Rifle Scope) telescopic sight for the APR. The TRS is a Schmidt & Bender PMII 3-12×50 LP scope with a proprietary stadiametric rangefinding reticle layout made exclusively for Brügger & Thomet. The TRS scope is meant to be mounted with a Brügger & Thomet mounting set consisting of two scope rings, where the front ring provides an adaptor for Simrad KN night sights. Those rings are attached to a Picatinny interface on the rifle's upper receiver. The scope and mount are clamped on the rifle's Picatinny rail by the <b>tension</b> of two <b>levers,</b> allowing the operator to quickly remove the scope in case of failure or while cleaning or during transit. Detaching and attaching the scope repeatedly will not affect the zero. APR rifles can be equipped with an anti-mirage band to suppress mirage caused by air heated by a warm barrel during extended training sessions.|$|R
