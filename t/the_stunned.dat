5|$|The priests {{catch the}} snake {{and prepare to}} kill her, but are stopped by the goddess Kwan Im, who tells <b>the</b> <b>stunned</b> pursuers that the snake is {{pregnant}} and thus must not be killed. A month after the snake gives birth, the priests return. The snake-woman gives her child to Khouw and then surrenders herself to her fate. She is captured in a magical jar and brought away.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{meets with}} each of his {{employees}} to discuss their job performance. He plunders the employee suggestion box for ideas to impress his own boss, Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), but the ruse backfires and he embarrasses himself. Michael relentlessly pesters Jan about their previous romantic connection but she bluntly rejects him, especially when, during the office's suggestion box meeting, she discovers {{that everyone in the}} Scranton branch is aware of the incident. As Jan storms out of the office, she admonishes Michael before complimenting him and reluctantly stating that she is not ready for a relationship. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>stunned</b> staff listens in.|$|E
5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on <b>the</b> <b>stunned</b> fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with a blunt snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E

5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but <b>the</b> <b>stunned</b> player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E

The father quickly exits {{in time to see}} his chauffeur drive away and hails a taxi. Hal arrives at the boarding school and the disguise works, claims Sue and drives away. Seconds later the father arrives and confronts the mistress, departing to pursue in a fit of anger. Hal and Sue go to the parson's house to be immediately wed. The father is delayed for a short time by car trouble, but quickly arrives before the two are wed. He bursts in and sees his double and both he and Hal laugh. The father relents and approves the marriage as Hal removes his disguise in front of <b>the</b> <b>stunned</b> Parson.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} version, the Enterprise visits Naterra and meets the planet's leader, Zxolar, who {{is concerned that}} Captain Kirk is an alien called Komether who is due to return within twenty days to destroy their world. Zxolar suddenly collapses and Doctor McCoy tries to help him but an energy surrounds the doctor's head and he runs at a wall and disappears. The landing party search for McCoy {{but to no avail}} and Zxolar is beamed to the Enterprise. Doctor Chapel attempts to help him but the energy appears around her and she passes out. Xon and Kirk discuss the energy and realize it wants Zxolar to die as it has attacked anyone who helps him. The pair beam back down the planet to investigate the palace they met Zxolar in and discover an archive which shows them {{the original}} agreement made by six philosophers, including a much younger Zxolar, and Komether a thousand years earlier. They note one of the philosophers is Zxolar and the Komether is the energy being which attacked the two doctors. As in the later version used on Star Trek: The Next Generation, the agreement was that the being would correct the pollution of the planet in return for ownership of the planet a thousand years later. Xon and Kirk decide to move Zxolan to a life support table and ask for other volunteers as it is apparent that Komether will attack them as they attempt to save him. Scotty, Sulu and Chekov all volunteer as well, and the alien disables each of them as they move Zxolar. It is only because of Xon's strength as he is being attacked that they manage to attach Zxolar to a life support machine and his life signs immediately improve. Zxolar tells Kirk about the contract, who retrieves it from the planet's surface and challenges it. Komethar appears and agrees to a trial with the Enterprises computer acting as an impartial judge. Kirk realises that Komethar was created by the six philosophers and so as the last remaining, Zxolar is in control of it. Zxolar manages to defeat the creature using his will and releases <b>the</b> <b>stunned</b> crewmen. He finds that McCoy was trapped in the wall itself and releases him too, the Enterprise departing shortly thereafter.|$|E

50|$|STUN {{does work}} with {{three types of}} NAT: full cone NAT, {{restricted}} cone NAT, and port restricted cone NAT. In the cases of restricted cone or port restricted cone NATs, the client must send out a packet to the endpoint before the NAT will allow packets from the endpoint through to <b>the</b> client. <b>STUN</b> does not work with symmetric NAT (also known as bi-directional NAT) which is often found in the networks of large companies. Since the IP address of <b>the</b> <b>STUN</b> server {{is different from that}} of the endpoint, in the symmetric NAT case, the NAT mapping will be different for <b>the</b> <b>STUN</b> server than for an endpoint. TURN offers better results with symmetric NAT.|$|R

5000|$|Amnesty International, [...] "Ban the Belt" [...] Campaign.Amnesty had {{released}} a report on stun technology (Electroshock weapons) {{a few years before}} the 1999 USA Campaign that generated scant public attention. At the heart of the issue was <b>the</b> <b>stun</b> belt, increasingly becoming a tool of choice by the criminal justice system. Because of the temptation for abuse and misuse of this weapon, Amnesty viewed <b>the</b> <b>stun</b> belt as a tool of torture. Building upon the relationship with Muhammad Ali, Amnesty seized the opportunity to win a celebrity endorser to assist in a public call to ban the use of <b>the</b> <b>stun</b> belt. A poster (for world-wide distribution) and an ad were prepared for the New York Times. This was accompanied by a public service announcement and a video news release which, guided by McKinney & Associates provided a new wave of media coverage for the USA Campaign.|$|R

According to British reports, <b>the</b> <b>stunned</b> commandos tumbled down the stairs, laying their weapons on the ground.

25|$|On 18 March 1808, 200 Imperial French {{soldiers}} {{asked to}} be admitted within the precincts of the fortress and were allowed in, since the French {{were believed to be}} allies.

Since its capture, the French had used Sant Ferran as a major supply base for the sieges of Roses in 1808 and Gerona in 1809. But after three years, the French generals grew complacent and in April 1811 the key fort was only held by an Italian provisional battalion.|$|E

Lechi ordered a military review, and, as his soldiers marched past the main gate of the citadel, they suddenly veered left and rushed into the fortress. Without bloodshed, the Imperial troops hustled <b>the</b> <b>stunned</b> Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place.
