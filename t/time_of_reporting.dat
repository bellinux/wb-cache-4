5000|$|A typical {{context in}} which rules of {{sequence}} of tenses apply is that of indirect speech.

In some languages the tense tends to be [...] "shifted back", so that what was originally spoken in the present tense is reported using the past tense (since what was in the present at the time of the original sentence is in the past relative to the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting).</b> English is one of the languages in which this often occurs. For example, if someone said [...] "I need a drink", this may be reported in the form [...] "She said she needed a drink", with the tense of the verb need changed from present to past.|$|E
50|$|Mr Mothew was a {{solicitor}} who {{had acted}} for both borrower and lender in a mortgage transaction {{relating to the}} purchase of a residential property. It was alleged that he negligently told the building society that there was no second charge on the house when the mortgage agreement was signed. At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> to the building society and requesting its funding, unbeknown to Mr Mothew, the borrower had a relatively small bank overdraft facility limited to £2,000. After completion of the purchase and mortgage (at which time the lender's funds were applied to the transaction) but before the transactions were registered at Land Registry Mr Mothew was approached by the borrower's bankers Barclays to say that they were granting a second mortgage facility to the borrower and seeking that their second charge be registered at Land Registry. The second charge documentation had been prepared and executed by the borrower at the bank's premises. By registering the second charge documentation contemporaneously with the purchase and (first) mortgage there was a waiver of fees payable to the Land Registry thereby saving expense for the borrower than if the second charge had been registered separately later. The Cheshunt Building Society were asked by Mr Mothew to consent to registration of the second charge which they did and they were also given formal notice of the second charge which they acknowledged. Mr Mothew delayed sending the application to the registry whilst the lender's consent was being obtained since it was also required to be lodged at the Land Registry. At the time of their default the borrower's overdraft facility had risen from £2,000 to £3,350. The housing market collapsed, and the homeowners (having lost their employment in the recession) defaulted on their mortgage with the building society. To realise their money, the building society had the property sold off for £53,000 in February 1991, a considerable time after they had taken possession of it. The lender claimed that if it had known of the borrower's overdraft facility, it would not have granted its mortgage to the borrower. They sued Mothew for the sum they lent (£59,000) less the proceeds of the sale.|$|E

30|$|There is also {{a concern}} that the {{responsibility}} for ensuring that imaging reports are acted upon will transfer to the radiologist, {{even though they have}} only limited information about the patient at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting.</b> Even legal responsibility might transfer to the radiologist. To address this, departmental policies should be clearly defined and adhered to.|$|E
40|$|Background: In many {{academic}} hospitals globally, radiology residents provide preliminary {{interpretations of}} CT studies performed outside of regular working hours. As {{part of a}} competence based education (CBE) system this is {{with a view to}} continue providing the necessary radiology consultation {{while at the same time}} exposing the radiology resident to much needed experience in making independent decisions and in developing professional skills. Realtime cases are the foundation of any competency based educational program. Discrepancies however do occur between the residents’ interim reports generated after normal working hours and the final reports released to the clinician. This may lead to adverse clinical outcomes including worsened morbidity, repeated imaging or delayed diagnosis. Objectives: The primary objective was to prospectively define the extent and factors contributing to discrepancy in out of hours CT reporting. Secondary objectives were to identify the most common discrepancies that occur during after-hours reporting, risk factors for such discrepancies and to establish ways of improving patient management in a competency based training institution. Design: Prospective cohort study of patients undergoing CT scans at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) -Nairobi, carried out over a consecutive duration of six months from October 2011 to end of March 2012. Sampling method: Consecutive sampling of all interim CT scan reports by residents after normal working hours was done. Data analysis: The data collected were analyzed using Stats Program Software, SPSS version 16. The proportion of major and minor discrepancies were determined within a 95 % confidence interval. Categorical variables of interest including type of radiological examination, confidence level of the resident at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting,</b> level of residency and <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> were plotted and displayed in tables, pie charts and stacked columns against the major and minor discrepancy rates. Potential associations between major discrepancy rates and numerical variables including adequacy of clinical information and level of confidence of the resident during reporting were tested using Chi square. Results: The major discrepancy rates were 4. 5 % with an overall discrepancy rate (both major and minor discrepancies) of 11. 7 % i. e. 34 out of 291 reports. Majority of these of these were errors of observation (19 out of 34). There were five (5) false positives and one (1) error of interpretation or cognition. These errors led to change in management in fifteen cases, increased patient morbidity in ten cases, required additional imaging in three cases, necessitated or resulted in extended hospital stay in four patients and did not potentially alter the patients’ clinical outcome in ten of the cases. No patient mortality was reported to have occurred as a direct cause of these errors. There was no statistically significant association between discrepancy rates and the level of residency, <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting,</b> type of examination, adequacy of history provided and level of confidence of the resident at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting.</b> Conclusion: Overall the study fully addressed its objectives. The point estimate of major discrepancy of 4. 5 % was within the estimated range used in the calculation of the sample size (7 +/- 3 %), and is comparable to rates described in literature. Lack of a statistically significant correlation between the discrepancy rate and the secondary outcomes including the level of residency, <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting,</b> level of confidence of the resident at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> or the adequacy of the history given is a pointer to no evidence of effect rather than evidence of no effect of these variables on the discrepancy rate...|$|E
