5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add <b>telegraph</b> onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent <b>telegraph</b> clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM <b>telegraph</b> at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of <b>telegraph</b> in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each <b>telegraph</b> signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E

His first year as a trainee was without pay. Myers then received a salary of $100 per year, being higher than normal since he put in extra attention to his work habits. He opened his own little <b>telegraph</b> office in July 1863 within the counting office of the bank. This was the first <b>telegraph</b> office for the town of Mohawk, New York. He constructed all the necessary <b>telegraph</b> equipment needed and taught himself Morse code. Myers' income from this bank <b>telegraph</b> business was one-half of his total income. He eventually {{had to give up}} being a part-time <b>telegraph</b> operator within the bank, as his bank responsibilities took up most of his time. He turned over the <b>telegraph</b> business to the local post office with Austin Shall as the operator.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman Ministry of Post and <b>Telegraph</b> was {{established}} in 1840 and the first post office, the Imperial Post Office, opened near the courtyard of Yeni Mosque. By 1876, the first international mailing network between Istanbul and the lands beyond the Ottoman Empire had been established. Sultan Abdülmecid I issued Samuel Morse his first official honor for the <b>telegraph</b> in 1847, and construction of the first <b>telegraph</b> line—between Istanbul and Edirne—finished in time to announce {{the end of the}} Crimean War in 1856. A nascent telephone system began to emerge in Istanbul in 1881 and after the first manual telephone exchange became operational in Istanbul in 1909, the Ministry of Post and <b>Telegraph</b> became the Ministry of Post, <b>Telegraph,</b> and Telephone. GSM cellular networks arrived in Turkey in 1994, with Istanbul among the first cities to receive the service. Today, mobile and landline service is provided by private companies, after Türk Telekom, which split from the Ministry of Post, <b>Telegraph,</b> and Telephone in 1995, was privatized in 2005.

5|$|In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York {{worked to}} expand telegraphic {{communication}} through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union <b>Telegraph</b> Company, saving a <b>telegraph</b> line he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new <b>telegraph</b> {{was an instant}} hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the New York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand this new technology with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter <b>telegraph</b> codes were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This new system would relieve this issue.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, the north–south highway through Pontiac was numbered M-10, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. A number of highway designation and routing changes in the Pontiac were made when US10 was shifted out of downtown to replace M-58 along <b>Telegraph</b> Road west of downtown {{by the middle of}} 1961. Before the change, US10 followed Dixie Highway and Oakland Avenue southeast into Pontiac to Perry Street and then Perry to Woodward while M-58 was routed along <b>Telegraph</b> and Square Lake Roads. After the change, US10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto <b>Telegraph</b> and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward. The old route through downtown was assigned the Bus. US10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Nine years later, US10 was moved off Woodward Avenue between Pontiac and Detroit to follow the Lodge Freeway and <b>Telegraph</b> Road. Bus. US10 was extended westward along Square Lake Road from the intersection of Woodward Avenue to the junction with <b>Telegraph</b> Road so that it would continue to connect with its parent highway on the southern end. In 1985, the Michigan Department of Transportation received permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to truncate US10 to Bay City, and when the change was made the following year, US24 replaced US10 on <b>Telegraph</b> Road north of Square Lake Road, and Bus.
