25|$|In Latter-day Saint (Mormonism) theology, <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> body {{constitute}} the human soul. Whereas {{the human body}} is subject to death on earth, they believe that the spirit never ceases to exist and that one day the spirits and bodies of all mankind will be reunited again. This doctrine stems from their belief that the resurrection of Jesus Christ grants the universal gift of immortality to every human being.|$|E
25|$|According to Sri Aurobindo, {{the current}} status of human {{evolution}} is an intermediate stage in the evolution of being, which {{is on its way to}} the unfolding of <b>the</b> <b>spirit,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> self-revelation of divinity in all things. Yoga is a rapid and concentrated evolution of being, which can take effect in one life-time, while unassisted natural evolution would take many centuries or many births. Aurobindo suggests a grand program called sapta chatushtaya (seven quadrates) to aid this evolution.|$|E

They spent time jamming on Doors and John Lennon songs, whereupon Stoermer joined them, sometimes filling in on drums. Stoermer also brought his collection of Hitchcock and cult films into the studio late at night and entertained the band with the old movies.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{attribute}} {{her debut}} to Venice at La Fenice, as Odabella in Verdi's Attila. She appeared {{in that role}} at Udine on 24 July 1847, and later as Lucrezia in I due Foscari in the same theatre. Later in 1847 she was singing Odabella in Rovigo, and it was there, {{at the end of}} that year, that Benjamin Lumley heard and ('struck with the splendid voice, the impulsive dramatic temperament, <b>the</b> <b>spirit,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> captivating person') recruited her for the season of 1848 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, of which he was the impresario. The family objected that she was too young to face the English public, but Lumley was urged to proceed by the tenor Rubini: 'I tell you plainly, and with deep conviction, that you are making an excellent acquisition. A most beautiful voice – give her good models and a good maestro'. Sophie herself was delighted with the proposals. In the winter of 1847 she made several appearances at La Fenice.|$|E

500|$|Donaldson, in {{her essay}} [...] "The Last Temptation of Mulder", writes that in Kazantzakis' novel Jesus [...] "represents what is the utmost human challenge, that of {{releasing}} the divinity within from its earthly confines." [...] In this way, the Jesus of The Last Temptation of Christ represents [...] "utter humanity" [...] and the [...] "struggle between <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flesh". Mulder is similarly challenged when he is enticed by The Smoking Man, and overcomes temptation by giving up his dream life and embracing his destiny to stop the alien invasion. Several characters in the episode resemble those in the novel. For instance, Fowley is similar to Kazantzakis' version of Mary Magdalene—both characters [...] "thwart the mission" [...] of the hero. Scully parallels Kazantzakis' version of Judas Iscariot, as they both call the heroes out of their respective trances.|$|E
