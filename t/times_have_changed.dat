5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how <b>times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

25|$|When he {{was really}} down, {{depressed}} about things. A relationship had failed. He rang me in a terrible state {{and asked me to}} go down to his house in Frankston. Joan, my wife, said you better go. He sounded really desperate. There wasn't much he could do for such a long time. Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The <b>times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed.</b> It's almost compulsory to be homosexual now.|$|E

25|$|Regina confronts Hook at {{the docks}} {{to remind him}} about what {{happened}} back in the Enchanted Forest, but Hook chokes her, saying <b>times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed.</b> At Granny’s, Mary Margaret, David, and Henry choose to spend their last hours alive, while Emma reveals her plan to Regina {{that she wants to}} sacrifice herself of the darkness inside. Gold then hands over Excalibur to Emma and arranges for Belle to escape town and live her life. Regina and Robin then confront Zelena again, only to have Regina use Merlin's Wand to conjure up a magic tornado to send Zelena to Oz, with Zelena vowing to return. Emma prepares her plan to confront Hook, who appears at her house, but he has the upper hand after he transforms into Henry, fooling her into handing over Excalibur, which leaves her defenseless.|$|E
25|$|The art {{of playing}} the dhak is now being {{referred}} to as a dying profession,this is sad but true. While some of the dhakis may be lucky to retain old contacts, many are facing a decline and some are moving away from the traditional profession. Take the example of the seventy dhaki families in Amrul, a village in Bankura district. Ancestors of the dhakis were on the rolls of Malla kings of Bishnupur. Daily pujas were organised for the deities in the palace and the dhakis played a significant role. <b>Times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed.</b> One of them was offered Rs. 800 for playing the dhak for five days. It is a pittance. Some of the younger generation even took to work as shoe shine boys, but the older generation still has pride in being artists. They look down upon such misadventures of the younger generation, but do not have an alternative before themselves.|$|E
500|$|Kulintang {{music can}} be used for {{communicating}} long distance messages from one village or longhouse to another. Called apad, these renditions mimic the normal speaking tones of the Maguindanao language, creating a specific message or, through the use of double entendre, a social commentary understood by nearly any adult native Maguindanao speaker. However, apad is falling into disuse because <b>times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed,</b> and the necessity of its use for long-distance communication purposes has faded away. [...] Anun as a music without a message, is used instead to express sentiments and feelings, and has come more and more into use due to its compatibility with the musical elaborations and idiosyncratic styles of the times.|$|E

500|$|Doctors {{observed}} that Trott continually stood in one place, showing {{little interest in}} events around him. [...] A doctor noted on Trott's file: [...] "Refuses to converse not appearing {{to be able to}} follow what is said to him. Answers questions in monosyllables. Does not rouse up when subjects are spoken of that formerly he was interested in." [...] Attempting to reach him, doctors sent Trott to play cricket, which he did in a [...] "mechanical, indifferent fashion". In a departure from normal hospital procedure, he was allowed newspapers reporting the details of Darling's Australian side in England; this left him unmoved. Trott's friend Ben Wardill, the secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club, visited in November 1899 but Trott did not recognise him. [...] A fellow patient, when released, wrote of Trott: [...] "Here is a well-known cricketer, whom we once treated as a hero. [...] But alas! Like everything else, <b>times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> and he is almost forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bangkok Post {{noted that}} the band [...] "stick firmly to their '90s alt-rock guns." [...] Their [...] "fuzzy-guitar/catchy-hook formula {{continues}} to dominate the album" [...] and amidst the fuzz and electronics, [...] "the title-track, Sugar and Beloved Freak do offer moments of (relatively) quiet bliss" [...] — songs that [...] "refreshingly showcase the essence of Manson's voice". It is proposed however that, apart from older, devoted 90's fans, the album probably won't connect with contemporary audiences. In his review for Time, Adam Kivel likewise stated that the album {{is most likely to}} resonate with fans of 90's alternative fusion, characterizing it as [...] "an anomaly" [...] in the current musical climate and not likely to gain significant radio-play. Lindsay Zoladz of Pitchfork Media summarized the album as [...] "a statement from a band that's stuck, combatively, to its guns. The <b>times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> but Garbage haven't, and now, for better and for worse, they've at last become alternative to everything." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Honolulu Advertiser {{called it}} [...] "A smart script," [...] with [...] "slick production values {{and maybe a}} splash of nostalgia got the remake of Hawaii Five-O placed on the CBS prime-time lineup this fall, {{but it will take}} more than beefcake and a remixed theme song to keep the show on the air." [...] The piece also pointed out that <b>times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> since the original series left the air, citing other shows that were set in Hawaii which have come and gone. It expressed a hope that the producers will succeed in bringing a new life to the title with this remake. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode B+, calling it an [...] "unexpected pleasure," [...] and praised Caan for being [...] "terrific as the moody but excellent" [...] Danno. Tucker also believed that Kim and Park [...] "play off each other nicely." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times felt that the script was [...] "neatly balanced between action, clever banter and serious issues," [...] adding that it [...] "seems poised to hold its own in the modern age." [...] McNamara also liked O'Loughlin's performance, stating that his [...] "limpid-eye woodenness" [...] worked well for the role. Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it stated that it was [...] "damn entertaining" [...] and [...] "visually stimulating," [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between McGarrett and Danny.|$|E

2500|$|Some argued Merezhkovsky's stance was {{inconsistent}} {{with his own}} ideas of some five years ago. After all, the Vekhi authors were trying to revitalize his own failed project of bringing the intellectual and the religious elites into collaboration. But the <b>times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed</b> for Merezhkovsky and – following this (some argued, unacceptably scornful) anti-Vekhi tirade, his social status, too. Shied by both former allies and the conservatives, he was hated by the Church: Saratov bishop Dolganov even demanded his excommunication after the book Sick Russia [...] was published in 1910. For the Social Democrats, conversely, Merezhkovsky, not a [...] "decadent pariah" [...] any-more, suddenly turned a [...] "well-established Russian novelist" [...] and the [...] "pride of the European literature." [...] Time has come for former friend Rozanov to write words that proved {{in the long run}} to be prophetic: [...] "The thing is, Dmitry Sergeyevich, those whom you are with now, will never be with you. Never will you find it in yourself to wholly embrace this dumb, dull and horrible snout of the Russian revolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the January 4, 2010, special live, three-hour Monday night {{edition of}} Impact! Hogan made his debut in TNA, and Scott Hall and Sean Waltman made {{their return to}} the company to greet him. Nash, Hall and Waltman quickly {{reformed}} their alliance, but Hogan kept {{himself out of the}} group, claiming that <b>times</b> <b>have</b> <b>changed.</b> At Genesis in their first match back together Nash and Syxx-Pac, who replaced Scott Hall in the match, were defeated by Beer Money, Inc. On the February 4 episode of Impact!, Hall and Syxx-Pac turned on Nash. At Destination X Nash and Young faced Hall and Syxx-Pac in a tag team match, where The Band's TNA futures were on the line. Nash turned on Young and helped the Band pick up the victory, which finally gave them contracts with the company. On the March 29 episode of Impact!, Nash offered Young a spot in the Band, claiming that what happened in Destination X was just business and nothing personal. Young refused the offer and in the main event of the evening, teamed up with Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy to defeat the Band in a six-man tag team steel cage match. Nash gained a measure of revenge on Young by defeating him in a steel cage match at Lockdown. Later in the night, Nash replaced Syxx-Pac, who no-showed the event, and teamed up with Hall in a St. Louis Street Fight, where they were defeated by Team 3D. On the May 3 episode of Impact!, Eric Young turned on Team 3D and joined The Band. On May 4, at the tapings of the May 13 episode of Impact!, after TNA World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan had been attacked by Samoa Joe, Nash cashed in his [...] "Feast or Fired" [...] contract, teaming with Hall, and pinned him to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Nash later named Young one third of the champions under the Freebird rule. At the June 14 tapings of the June 17 episode of Impact!, The Band was stripped of the Tag Team Championship, due to Scott Hall's legal problems. The following day it was reported that Hall had been released from his contract with TNA. On the June 24 episode of Impact!, Nash and Young decided to part ways, as Nash intended to go after Hogan, whom he blamed for what had happened to Hall and Waltman, and didn't want Young to get into trouble for it.|$|E
