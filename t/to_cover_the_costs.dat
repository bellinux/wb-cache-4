5|$|In 1825, {{following}} the disruption the group were experiencing, Shapira travelled to Europe once again. He hoped {{to secure the}} necessary firman, which would place the courtyard firmly in the Perushim's possession, and also to raise funds <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> incurred trying to redeem the courtyard. His mission, however, was unsuccessful, as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Zoref.|$|E
5|$|In February 2000, {{the county}} {{government}} attempted to gain 57 million {{dollars from the}} state government at a courthouse in Charles County, <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of having sheriff's deputies providing security at a district court since 1971. The state countered that the county was responsible {{for any of the}} costs incurred.|$|E
5|$|King James' embalmed heart {{may have}} been taken on pilgrimage to the Holy Land {{following}} his interment at Perth Charterhouse, as the Exchequer Rolls of Scotland for 1443 note the payment of £90 <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of a knight of the Order of St John who had returned it to the Charterhouse from the Island of Rhodes.|$|E

5|$|Allcroft's {{descendants}} {{fell into}} financial difficulties {{during the early}} 20th century, however, and it became increasingly difficult for them <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of maintaining Stokesay. In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Oldham Athletic fans had a St George's Cross flag {{made in his}} honour, {{which was}} due to be {{displayed}} at Oldham's matches, {{as well as being}} taken abroad for England international fixtures. The tribute flag was stolen in February 2009, when Spanish hooligans attacked English fans in Seville before an international friendly on 20 February, stealing England flags from fans as trophies. The flag was replaced after a number of donations helped <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E
5|$|The cost {{of testing}} and {{operating}} the Green Line left WMATA struggling financially. These costs (along with {{costs associated with}} extending and operating the Blue Line to Van Dorn Street) forced WMATA to cut 335 jobs as well as supplies, travel, overtime, and temporary employee budgets. Although ridership was projected to rise 3.8 percent to 260 million trips in the coming year, the increased revenue was not expected <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of operating the new lines and stations. Mount Vernon Square, Shaw–Howard University, and U Street–Cardozo stations opened on Saturday, May 11, 1991.|$|E

5|$|By 2November, all owners, {{except the}} two {{environmental}} organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, had sold their shares to NSB. The two environmental organizations owned 7 of 40,000 {{shares of the}} company. At the general meeting the same day, the company was liquidated, even though the two organizations opposed. Prior to the meeting, the other minority owners had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do. Several municipalities were concerned that they would lose even more money {{if they did not}} sell. The other minority owners agreed <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of the two environmental organizations, and let them make the principal stand to oppose the liquidation.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Congress {{appropriated}} $700,000 for the NWR <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> {{of designing}} a public visitor’s center. By 2005 construction had progressed on public facilities {{at the site}} that included trails, observations decks, parking, and an entrance from Oregon Route 99W with plans for permanently opening {{to the public in}} 2006. In July 2005, the refuge received $3.9 million from the federal government to complete a visitor’s center and new headquarters for the facility. In February 2006, construction began on the main observation deck at the visitor’s plaza, with plans to open the refuge to the public in June.|$|E
5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs,</b> the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, the Seeley G. Mudd Fund granted Vassar $1.3 {{million for}} the {{construction}} of a new chemistry building. Mudd was a California-based cardiologist, professor, and trustee with the University of Southern California's School of Medicine as well as with a number of other West Coast schools. Over his lifetime, Mudd donated more than $10 million to higher education institutions and upon his death in 1968, his will established a further $44 million for building construction at universities and colleges, with the stipulation that institutions requesting a grant provide at least half the funds for their projects and that his name be prominently displayed on any buildings receiving the funding. While the cost of the building was originally reported to be $4.5 million, this estimate grew to $6.5 million by 1984 and would ultimately come to $7.2 million once the project was completed. The College planned <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> not paid for by the Mudd Fund with a $100 million development fundraising program that spanned the entirety of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioning}} of memorials occurred {{through a}} wide range of national and local institutions, reflecting local political traditions; funding was similarly disparate, with most countries relying heavily on local charitable contributions <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of construction. War cemeteries and memorials to particularly significant battles, however, were typically centrally controlled and funded by the state. The war encouraged the creation of new forms of memorial. Lists of memorial names, reflecting the huge scale of the losses, were a common feature, while Tombs of the Unknown Soldier containing a selected, unidentified body, and empty cenotaph monuments commemorated the numerous unidentifiable corpses and those servicemen whose bodies were never found. Ceremonies were often held at the memorials, including those on Armistice Day, Anzac Day and the Fêtes de la Victoire, while pilgrimages to the sites of the conflict and the memorials there were common in the inter-war years.|$|E

25|$|On 21 October 2015 {{education}} minister Simon Birmingham told {{a senate committee}} the offered funding had been withdrawn. It was subsequently unclear whether the Australian Government would honour its original commitment and transfer the funds directly to the Centre <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> incurred, in particular given Lomborg's unique expertise and contribution.|$|E
25|$|A {{committee}} {{was formed in}} 1851 under Joseph Hume to investigate the matter, but failed to reach a clear recommendation. Despite the vociferous objection, William Gladstone, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1852, kept the progressive income tax, and extended it <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of the Crimean War. By the 1860s, the progressive tax had become a grudgingly accepted element of the English fiscal system.|$|E
25|$|A {{drilling}} team under George B. Reynolds {{was sent}} to Persia and began to search. In 1903 a company was formed and D'Arcy had to spend over £500,000 <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs.</b> False hopes were raised in 1904 and D'Arcy was forced to find further financial support, with the Burmah Oil Company Ltd. agreeing to put up to £100,000 into the venture in return {{for much of the}} stock.|$|E

25|$|In August 2015 it was {{announced}} that Boca Juniors's volleyball team will not participate in the Argentine major league (A1) from 2016. The decision was personally taken by Boca Juniors chairman, Daniel Angelici. The club alleged that taking part in a professional league resulted in a hugh commercial deficit so Boca Juniors declined to participate, although the volleyball department had reached an agreement with several sponsors which would put the money <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> (about A$ 3 million).|$|E
25|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of the trip, Vahram Papazyan {{requested}} {{financial assistance}} from the Armenian sports club Ardavast {{in which he was}} a member of.
