500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much talk about our side {{and a lot of}} pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E
2500|$|Jan Egeland, Special Advisor to the UN Special Envoy for Syria, {{stated in}} November 2016: [...] "I {{have not seen}} a place where <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much politicization, {{manipulation}} of aid, {{as we have seen}} in Syria in recent months. It has to stop!". He also called the bombardment and destruction of the city a [...] "dark chapter" [...] in modern history: ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Behindwoods gave {{two and a}} half out of five stars citing that the film had a [...] "loose screenplay" [...] but was compensated by a [...] "power packed performance" [...] by the actors. The reviewer compared Arya and Vishal Krishna saying [...] "Unlike Vishal, Arya doesn’t have much scope over performance, but manages to remain under spotlights with his rib-tickling comedy tracks and dialogue delivery. Although we have the signature as ‘A Film By Bala’ during final credits, it’s worth mentioning that the film completely belongs to Vishal." [...] A reviewer from in.com gave three and half out of five and said that the movie is a [...] "definite watch for Bala's followers and to watch the new Vishal emerge as a performer". Further praising Vishal, the critic stats, [...] "there is no doubt that {{from the beginning of the}} making of the film, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much riding on Vishal's character as he has been playing the role of a squint and has done a fab job." [...] Rohit Ramachandran of nowrunning.com gave it two out of five stars stating that [...] "Avan Ivan, in the end, is Vishal and Arya battling for recognition in the acting arena." [...] Supergoodmovies also gave three and a half stars and concluded that [...] "Avan Ivan will not let down the audience. Though not a typical Bala film, a feel of joy creeps as we watch the film. It is one of the best technically made movies by Bala so far." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} so occupied, Adela. There {{is so much to}} do in taking up a parish. Even though I know all the people so well, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} hurriedly, [...] "certainly; but ma {{has been quite}} queer of late, and she may think--you know--that since--since <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much {{property}} to dispose of, she {{ought to have been}} consulted." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'My dear,' exclaimed Albinia, 'what can it signify? They {{are only}} a very good joke. I did not think <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much {{imagination}} in Bayford.' And off she went laughing again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Girls, do {{you know}} that Carrie has gone abroad? <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much talk, her father could n't bear it, and took the whole family off. Is n't that gay?" [...] said one lively damsel, who had just come in.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} the young lord," [...] she said, [...] "of whom <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> {{much in the}} papers lately? He was staying at the Red Hall when you were, and {{is supposed to have}} left for London early one morning and disappeared." ...|$|E
60|$|The work in America {{has been}} so very hard, and the winter <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> {{excessively}} severe, that I really have been very unwell for some months. But I had not been at sea three days on the passage home when I became myself again.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, {{when asked}} if he was {{considering}} a sequel, Giancola said: [...] "We don't have any plans for a sequel, <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many time travel films since covering the same material, I don't feel I have anything new to add." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{we should}} have heard of it long ago if <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been!</b> <b>So</b> I mind the coming out the less; but it's {{perfectly}} abominable to have had all this row, and for Papa to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> cut up in this little short time at home." ...|$|R

6000|$|He added awkwardly: [...] "Since we started, <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much to {{hold the}} attention. I {{remember}} a mood--an immense despair. I feel it's still somewhere {{at the back of}} things, waiting to be dealt with. It's our essential fact. But meanwhile we've been busy, looking at fresh things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it will be}} {{something}} to see, Chris, and something to hear, for I doubt whether <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> heavy a fire as that which will be kept up to-morrow, ever since war began. We have some twenty-three thousand men, and the Boers more than as many, and what with magazine-guns, machine-guns, and fast-firing cannon of all sizes, {{it will be an}} inferno." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you are Miss Mary Lovel, but you wouldn't like {{everybody}} {{in the house to}} call you so. And then <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much said about it all my life, that it makes me quite unhappy. I do so wish your mamma wouldn't call me Lady Anna." [...] Whereupon Minnie very demurely explained that she could not answer for her mamma, but that she would always call her friend Anna,--when papa wasn't by.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad too,--so that I may say good-bye." [...] Then she put out her hand, {{and he held}} it for {{a moment}} as he looked into her eyes. There was not a word more, but it seemed to Lucy as though <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many words.|$|R
60|$|At last, <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many partings {{that there}} were no {{children}} left, and only the traveller, the gentleman, and the lady, went upon their way in company.

60|$|He {{does not}} seem to have seen a {{newspaper}} during those wanderings, and a chance sight of the transparency of a kiosk in the market-place at Bishop's Stortford announcing a 'Grave International Situation' did not excite him very much. <b>There</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many grave international situations in recent years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{the baggage}} should {{all have been}} left at Panwell and, in that case, the force could have entered Poona three days after landing, instead of delaying from the 25th of November until today, the 7th of January; and even now, at their present rate of advance, they may be another {{fortnight}} before they arrive at Poona. I don't think <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> disgraceful a business since we first put foot in India.|$|E
6000|$|Leif put to sea once more. For {{two days}} {{the wind was}} from the north-east. Then again they reached land. This new region was the famous country which the Norsemen called Vineland, and of which every schoolboy has read. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much dispute as to whether Vineland--this warm country where grapes grew wild--was Nova Scotia or New England, or some other region, that it is worth while to read {{the account of the}} Norse saga, {{literally}} translated: ...|$|E

50|$|The Costa da Morte {{received}} its name because <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many shipwrecks along its treacherous rocky shore.

6000|$|I {{could not}} deny {{a word of}} this, and {{had nothing to say}} to it in general. 'But why, then,' says I, 'can you persuade me to such a horrid step as leaving you, since you have not left me?

6000|$|... "Excellent security, excellent; no better; {{and yet he}} will foreclose; but you see he has {{no power}} himself. But the {{question}} is, can the trustee refuse? Then, again, trustees are so circumscribed nowadays that they are afraid to do anything. <b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much said lately, Mr Gresham, that a man doesn't know where he is, or what he is doing. Nobody trusts anybody. There have been such terrible things that we can't wonder at it. Only think of the case of those Hills! How can any one expect that any one else will ever trust a lawyer again after that? But that's Mr Bideawhile's bell. How can any one expect it? He will see you now, I dare say, Mr Gresham." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>There</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> {{much talk}} about the mysterious [...] "wild man" [...] {{out there in the}} West for some time, that I finally felt it was my duty to go out and {{interview}} him. There was something peculiarly and touchingly romantic about the creature and his strange actions, according to the newspaper reports. He was represented as being hairy, long-armed, and of great strength and stature; ugly and cumbrous; avoiding men, but appearing suddenly and unexpectedly to women and children; going armed with a club, but never molesting any creature, except sheep, or other prey; fond of eating and drinking, and not particular about the quality, quantity, or character of the beverages and edibles; living in the woods like a wild beast, but never angry; moaning, and sometimes howling, but never uttering articulate sounds.|$|E
