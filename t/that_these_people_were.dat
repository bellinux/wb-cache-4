The Israeli government did not recognize the Messianic groups in India as candidates for aliyah.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{cemetery}} space has been surrounded with a dry-stone wall. Some tumuli were built beyond that wall; 8 corpses were found there. Historians think <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> either Canarians deemed unworthy of burial in the proper ground, or foreigners having landed on the island before the Spanish conquest.|$|E
25|$|The Windust {{phase is}} dated between 10600 BC and 7100 BC. At the Lind Coulee Archaeological Site in east-central Washington, leaf-shaped {{projectile}} points and knives date between 8500-5500 BC. Based on archaeological evidence, {{it is suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> hunters, subsisting also from fishing and plant gathering. The presence of sea shells gives an indication that trading took place. A small oval shaped dwelling was also found at the Paulina Lake site in Oregon, dating to 7100 BC.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{researchers}} first {{attributed the}} mound to the Adena culture (1000 BC - 1 AD). William Webb, noted Adena exponent, found evidence through carbon dating for Kentucky Adena {{as early as}} 1200 BC. As there are Adena graves near the Serpent Mound, scholars thought the same people constructed the mound. The skeletal remains of the Adena type uncovered in the 1880s at Serpent Mound indicate <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> unique among the ancient Ohio Valley peoples. It was more than 45 years before scholars paid sufficient attention to the Adena studies.|$|E
25|$|The similar Hamitic hypothesis, which {{developed}} {{directly from the}} Asiatic Race Theory, argued that the Ethiopid and Arabid populations of the Horn of Africa were the inventors of agriculture and had brought all civilization to Africa, and asserted <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> Caucasians, not Negroid. It also rejected any Biblical basis despite using Hamitic as the theory's name. Charles Gabriel Seligman in his Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1913) and later works argued that the ancient Egyptians were among this group of Caucasian Hamites, having arrived in the Nile Valley during early prehistory and introduced technology and agriculture to primitive natives they found there.|$|E
25|$|Stauning {{remained}} {{prime minister}} {{until his death}} in 1942, as head of a coalition cabinet encompassing all major political parties (the exceptions being the tiny Nazi party, and the Communist Party, which was outlawed in 1941 as discussed). Vilhelm Buhl replaced him briefly, only to be replaced by foreign minister Erik Scavenius, who had been the main link to the Nazi authorities throughout the war. Scavenius was a diplomat, not an elected politician, and had an elitist approach to government. He was afraid that emotional public opinion would destabilize his attempts to build a compromise between Danish sovereignty and the realities of German occupation. Scavenius felt strongly that he was Denmark's most ardent defender. After the war there was much recrimination over his stance, particularly from members of the active resistance, who felt that he had hindered the cause of resistance and threatened Denmark's national honour. He felt <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> vain, seeking to build their own reputations or political careers through emotionalism.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, the Dutch were contending {{with other}} problems. The {{excessive}} use of land for sugar cane plantation {{in the interior of}} West Java reduced the flow of water in Ciliwung River (which flows through the city of Batavia) and made the city canals an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, resulting in a series of malaria outbreaks in 1733–1795. This was aggravated by the fall of sugar price in European market, bringing bankruptcy to sugar factories in the areas around Batavia (the Ommelanden), which were mostly operated by Chinese labour. The unrest prompted VOC authorities {{to reduce the number of}} unlicensed Chinese settlers, who had been smuggled into Batavia by Chinese sugar factory owners. These labourers were loaded onto ships out of Batavia but the rumour <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> thrown into the sea as soon as the ship was beyond the horizon caused panic among the remaining Chinese. On 7 October 1740, several Chinese mobs attacked Europeans outside the city and incited the Dutch to order a massacre two days later. The Chinese settlement in Batavia was looted for several days, in which 10,000 Chinese were killed. The Chinese ran away and captured Bekasi, which was dislodged by VOC in June 1741.|$|E
25|$|The {{mass grave}} near Schletz, part of Asparn an der Zaya, was located about 33 {{kilometres}} (roughly 20 miles) {{to the north}} of Vienna, Austria, and dates back about 7,500 years. Schletz, just like the Talheim death pit, is one of the earliest known sites in the archaeological record that shows proof of genocide in Early Neolithic Europe, among various LBK tribes. The site was not entirely excavated, but it is estimated that the entire ditch could contain up to 300 individuals. The remains of 67 people have been uncovered, all showing multiple points of trauma. Scientists have concluded <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> also victims of genocide. Since the weapons used were characteristic of LBK peoples, the attackers are believed to be members of other LBK tribes. In similar proportions to those found at Talheim, fewer young women were found than men at Schletz. Because of this scarcity of young women among the dead, it is possible that other women of the defeated group were kidnapped by the attackers. The site was enclosed, or fortified, which serves as evidence of violent conflict among tribes and means that these fortifications were built as a form of defense against aggressors. The people who lived there had built two ditches to counter the menace of other LBK communities.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, the {{families}} attempted {{to put forward}} a writ of amparo and accused the government of violating their rights by putting unnecessary barriers and forcing them to visit Mexico City {{to see the results}} of the DNA samples. On May 24, {{the families}} pushed their case to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) to help them retrieve the DNA samples from the PGR in Jalisco. The CNDH told the lawyer that the families no longer had to go to Mexico City for the DNA samples and that they could do the procedures in Jalisco. The government was able to confirm the identity of 3 of the 8 civilians killed. They stated that their DNA samples matched those of the family members, but clarified <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> killed in clashes with security forces on May 1 and not on May 19. The families of Villa Purificación contested the government's final decision, and stated that between May and May 19, dozens of people were killed in the town. They claimed that the Army safeguarded the morgues to prevent civilians from seeing the bodies and identifying them. On May 22, the families of the missing people returned to Villa Purificación.|$|E

500|$|Sir Edward Coke was {{in charge}} of the interrogations. [...] Over a period of about ten weeks, in the Lieutenant's Lodgings at the Tower of London (now known as the Queen's House) he {{questioned}} those who had been implicated in the plot. [...] For the first round of interrogations, no real proof exists <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> tortured, although on several occasions Salisbury certainly suggested that they should be. [...] Coke later revealed that the threat of torture was in most cases enough to elicit a confession from those caught up in the aftermath of the plot.|$|E
500|$|In {{the entire}} corpus of Roman {{literature}} and historiography, Yule {{was unable to}} uncover any other mention of such a direct diplomatic encounter between the Romans and the Seres. He speculated <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> {{more likely to have}} been private merchants than diplomats, since Chinese records insist that Gan Ying was the first Chinese to reach as far west as Tiaozhi ( [...] ; Mesopotamia) in 97 AD. Yule notes that the 1st-century AD Periplus mentioned that people of Thinae (Sinae) were rarely seen, because of the difficulties of reaching that country. It states that their country, located under Ursa Minor and on the farthest unknown reaches of the Caspian Sea, was the origin of raw silk and fine silk cloth that was traded overland from Bactria to Barygaza, as well as down the Ganges.|$|E
5000|$|Scott's main {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> [...] "barbaric by design": {{their social}} organization, geographical location, subsistence practices and culture have been carved to discourage states to annex {{them to their}} territories. Likewise, states want to integrate Zomia {{to increase the amount}} of land, resources and people subject to taxation. In other words, to raise their revenue.|$|R

2500|$|Awakened {{already to}} a {{consciousness}} of race discrimination, these migrants from the South {{came into contact}} with militant movements among northern Negroes. Practically none of them had been in the North prior to the collapse of the Marcus Garvey movement. A few of them had come {{under the influence of the}} Moorish-American cult which succeeded it. The effect of both these movements upon the future members of the Nation of Islam was largely indirect. Garvey taught the Negroes that their homeland was Ethiopia. The Noble Drew Ali, the prophet of the Moorish-Americans, proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> [...] "descendants of Morrocans".|$|E
2500|$|On July 30, 2010, the European police agency Europol {{issued a}} warning on an {{increase}} of Hells Angels and Bandidos activities in Southeast Europe and Turkey. The newly founded Hells Angels Turkey denied the warning's content, calling the relevant report [...] "utter nonsense" [...] and alleging Europol officials are after more European Union funds. On July 2, 2011, around 20 Hells Angels Turkey members in Kadıköy, Istanbul attacked people in a bar and injured 7 of them (2 severely) pleading <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> drinking alcohol {{on the street and}} disturbing the neighbourhood.

2500|$|Other {{documents}} entitled [...] "gospels" [...] {{came into}} existence {{in the second and}} third Christian centuries.

The Church Fathers insisted <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> the ones making distortions, but some modern scholars do not. It remains to be seen whether any are earlier and more accurate versions of the canonical texts. Details of their contents only survive in the attacks on them by their opponents, and so for the most part it is uncertain as to how extensively different they are, and whether any constitute entirely different works. These texts include: ...|$|E

2500|$|In both Gaza City and Khan Yunis, street-fighting led to {{the deaths}} of [...] "dozens, perhaps hundreds, of non-combatants". Food and {{medicine}} distribution for refugees in need of assistance was complicated when some Palestinians ransacked the warehouses belonging to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. This was compounded by a widespread view in Israel that the responsibility for the care of the Palestinian refugees rested with the UNRWA, not Israel, which led the Israelis to be slow with providing aid. By noon of 3 November, the Israelis had control of almost the entire Gaza Strip save for a few isolated strong points, which were soon attacked and taken. The UN estimated that in total 447 to 550 Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli troops during the first weeks of Israeli occupation of the strip. The manner <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> killed is disputed.|$|E

[...] Donations poured in {{from all over the country}} to support the families of the victims who lost their lives. [...] Entire newspapers covered nothing but stories about the incident for days on end, supported by mournful editorials and articles calling for the removal of the officials in question.

2500|$|On 21 August 2015, CICIG and the Guatemalan {{attorney}} general held a joint press conference where they issued {{a warrant for}} Baldetti's arrest and asked for president Pérez Molina's impeachment; they informed the press that they had gathered evidence during the 16 April operations that linked both to La Linea, and that the two were most likely the true leaders of the ring. On 17 April 2015 they had presented an intercepted phone conversation in which {{some of the other}} suspects talked about [...] "el Presidente", without saying his name, but said that [...] "el Presidente' had asked them to open four bank accounts since CICIG already had too much information.
