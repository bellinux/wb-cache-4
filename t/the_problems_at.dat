5|$|To fix <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> Fort Jackson, Alexander {{recommended}} {{the addition of}} an artillery section, a second company of infantry, and various improvements to the fort itself. Spurred {{in part by the}} Confederate attack on Fort Stevens north of Washington, several improvements were made, including the restoration of gates that had been removed when the railroad line was constructed. Gen. Christopher Columbus Augur, commander of the Department of Washington, recommended that Fort Jackson be assigned two light guns as armament during the reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Arnold was {{disappointed}} with what XXIBomber Command had achieved, and wanted the Command {{to produce results}} quickly. In addition, Hansell's preference for precision bombing {{was no longer in}} accordance with the views of the Twentieth Air Force headquarters, which wanted a greater emphasis on area attacks. In late December 1944 Arnold decided to relieve Hansell of his command. Seeing LeMay's success in improving XXBomber Command's performance, Arnold thought LeMay could solve <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> XXIBomber Command, and replaced Hansell with him. Hansell was informed of Arnold's decision on 6January, but remained in his position until mid-January. During this period, XXIBomber Command conducted unsuccessful precision bombing attacks on the Musashino aircraft plant in Tokyo and a Mitsubishi Aircraft Works factory in Nagoya on 9 and 14January respectively. The last attack planned by Hansell was more successful, however: a force of 77 B-29s crippled a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory near Akashi on 19January. During XXIBomber Command's first three months of operations, it lost an average of 4.1% of aircraft dispatched in each raid.|$|E

25|$|Augustinians were {{expected}} to observe strict protocols in contacts with outsiders, to travel only with their abbot's permission and never to sleep alone. One of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> Lilleshall was that canons were often forced to undertake expeditions to the outlying estates, outside direct supervision of the abbot. This was much less prevalent at Haughmond, with its more concentrated estates, although it seems there was sometimes a need for canons to stay at Nefyn, {{where there was a}} canons' house in the early 14th century. There were also facilities, including chapels, for canons and abbots to stay on some of the granges, including Leebotwood and Beobridge. As the canons were all ordained priests, they could also officiate at chapels in the extra-parochial areas to the west, although secular clergy were appointed as soon as these communities became viable. Eyton traced in detail how the chapel at Knockin evolved, under the abbey's control, into a parish church with a vicar. In the early years there were lay brothers to help {{in the work of the}} abbey, but they are never mentioned after 1190. There were, however, numerous paid officials and servants on the premises.|$|E
25|$|BBC {{television}} cameras {{were at the}} ground to record the game for Match of the Day. As the disaster unfolded, the events were relayed live to the Saturday sports show, Grandstand. In Ireland, RTÉ also showed the disaster unfolding, as it was covering the match live through its programme Sports Stadium. When the gates were opened, thousands of fans entered a narrow tunnel leading {{to the rear of}} the terrace into two overcrowded central pens (pens 3 and 4), creating pressure at the front. Hundreds of people were pressed against one another and the fencing by the weight of the crowd behind them. People entering were unaware of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> the fence; police or stewards usually stood at the entrance to the tunnel and, when the central pens reached capacity, directed fans to the side pens, but on this occasion, for reasons not fully explained, they did not. A BBC TV news report conjectured that if police had positioned two police horses correctly, they would have acted as breakwaters directing many fans into side pens, but on this occasion, it was not done.|$|E
25|$|The fame of the Vieux-Colombier {{seemed to}} reach its apogee in the 1922/1923 season. The house was filled for every {{performance}} and visitors to Paris complained of the impossibility of getting tickets to any of its offerings. Copeau organized a touring company to the provinces. Invitations to play in {{other countries in the}} off-season abounded. When Konstantin Stanislavski, the director of the Moscow Art Theatre, came to Paris in December 1922, he and his troupe were warmly received on the stage of the Vieux-Colombier. The influence of Copeau's principles to which he held without flinching was felt throughout Europe and the United States. Despite the fame, conflict arose. Jouvet, who understood the economics of the theatre better than Copeau, knew that a larger theatre and a more profitable pricing system were needed. His proposal fell on deaf ears. When he was asked to direct at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, he chose his freedom. Even Romains decided that the Right Bank theatres were more hospitable to his work after Copeau rejected one of his plays. Despite <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> the theatre, the school continued to thrive. Copeau allowed his young charges to appear in a production of Gide's Saül as the masked demons that taunt the king played by Copeau himself. The critical reaction was quite positive. The season ended, as the previous ones had, with the Vieux-Colombier in debt.|$|E

500|$|During 1815, the {{relationship}} between Grimaldi and Thomas Dibdin became strained. Dibdin, as manager at Sadler's Wells, denied Grimaldi's request for a month's leave to tour the provincial theatres. [...] Dibdin was annoyed at the tolerant attitude Grimaldi displayed in his position as the Chief Judge and Treasurer of the Sadler's Wells Court of Rectitude, a body set up to regulate the behaviour of performers. [...] Grimaldi briefly left Sadler's Wells in 1815 to conduct {{a tour of the}} northern provincial theatres. [...] Alongside Jack Bologna, he staged fifty-six shows during the summer months and earned £1,743, a much higher amount than he earned at Sadler's Wells. Dibdin was struggling, and after the tour Grimaldi used <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>at</b> Sadler's Wells to negotiate a lucrative contract. [...] Dibdin agreed to a salary increase but bristled at Grimaldi's other demands and eventually gave the position of resident Clown to the little-known Signor Paulo.|$|E

He did not intend to resolve any religious or existential questions about the end of life, but wanted to examine the process in which a person becomes a mere body. Whedon's mother, a teacher, also died of a cerebral aneurysm, and he drew on his own experiences, and those of friends and other writers, in constructing the episode.
