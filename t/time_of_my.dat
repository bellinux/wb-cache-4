5|$|I wish {{to state}} that my book, Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen, {{contains}} a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea. The book in question is a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; {{on the other hand}} it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.|$|E

I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
