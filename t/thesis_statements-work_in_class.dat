5000|$|Yellow supergiants {{generally}} have spectral types of F and G, although sometimes late A or early K stars are included. [...] These spectral types are characterised by hydrogen lines {{that are very}} strong <b>in</b> <b>class</b> A, weakening through F and G until they are very weak or absent <b>in</b> <b>class</b> K. Calcium H and K lines are present in late A spectra, but stronger <b>in</b> <b>class</b> F, and strongest <b>in</b> <b>class</b> G, before weakening again in cooler stars. Lines of ionised metals are strong <b>in</b> <b>class</b> A, weaker <b>in</b> <b>class</b> F and G, and absent from cooler stars. <b>In</b> <b>class</b> G, neutral metal lines are also found, along with CH molecular bands.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} the mean values of various intra-arch distances <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I, Class II division 1 and Class II division 2 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The search engines PubMed, Embrace and Cochrane were employed to select articles for further study, and the sample thereby selected comprised adult subjects with full permanent dentition, without missing teeth, malformations or previous orthodontic treatment. Only subjects from articles published during the last 10 years {{were included in the}} study. RESULTS: The search located a total of 628 articles regarding arch form. However, only eight articles were chosen for the study. We observed that: the distance between mandibular canines is smaller <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I than <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> II division 1; mandibular inter-molar distance is similar <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I and Class II division 1; maxillary inter-canine distance is similar <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I, Class II division 2 and Class II division 1; maxillary inter-premolar width is greater <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I than <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> II division 1; and that maxillary inter-molar width is similar <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I and Class II division 2. CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant differences in arch width were found between the different classes analysed (there are only slightly differences between <b>classes),</b> except <b>in</b> the case of mandibular inter-canine width (L 3), which was smaller <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I than <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> II, 1, and maxillary inter-premolar width (U 4), which was smaller <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> II-I than <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> I...|$|R

30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{different}} test formats, no {{significant difference was found}} among the three types examined here. There is only one example that shows that differences in test format might affect students’ performance. In Conversation 2 of Test 4, the percentage of correct answers to Question 2 was low <b>in</b> <b>Classes</b> 1 and 3 (25.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 1 and 35.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 3) but relatively high <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 2 (65.0  %), while in Question 1, the results were completely opposite: The percentage of correct answers was higher <b>in</b> <b>Classes</b> 1 and 3 (75.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 1 and 70.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 3) than <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 2 (65.0  %). A possible {{reason for this is that}} the key words to Question 2 appear before the key words to Question 1. The students <b>in</b> <b>Classes</b> 1 and 3 managed to catch the key words to Question 1, but missed those to Question 2. In the case of Class 2, the students listened to the three questions in both English and their L 1 before listening to the spoken text. However, the students <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 1 did not read or listen to the questions prior to listening to the text, and those <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 3 were allowed to read the questions but were not told to read all three questions beforehand. As a result, they might have concentrated on Question 1, and thus missed the key words to Question 2. Except for this case, differences in students’ test performance among three classes were statistically insignificant.|$|R

30|$|However, the {{above-mentioned}} statement is refuted {{when we look}} at the percentages of correct answers of Questions 2 and 3 in Conversation 1 of Test 3. Test takers have to deduce “the room was not ready” from the expression “hasn’t been cleaned” in Question 2 and “it was too small” from “we needed a bigger room” in Question 3. However, such deductions are relatively easy because these are not technical terms but are words often used in our daily lives. As a result, the percentages of correct answers were quite high in all three groups (80.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 1, 80.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 2, and 75.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 3 on Question 2, and 70.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 1, 75.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 2, and 80.0  % <b>in</b> <b>Class</b> 3 on Question 3).|$|R
