A planetary gear train is proposed to be used as processing device. The device consists of one or several gear pairs and it can be fixed to multiple tools.

It is important on improving the machined surface quality, improving processing efficiency, and reducing processing errors. In the milling process, the assembly error of the cutting tool has great importance {{that should not be}} ignored for the forming of milled surface. Aiming at the problem of machining error in milling process caused by tool assembly error, this article investigated the milling process of peripheral milling, and researched the surface topography caused by the tool assembly error. Then the author established a simulation model to forecast the processing error caused by peripheral milling cutter assembly error. The model calculates the location of the tooth tipoff the milling tool by analyzing the knife tooth trajectory variation caused by the tool assembly error. Then discrete tracks of the teeth, to obtain the final processed surface by calculating the minimum value of all the <b>teeth</b> <b>traces</b> at discrete points. Through this model, we can get different surface morphology formed by different tool assembly errors to explore how the tool assembly error influences the processing quality. The study shows that when the cutter assembly errors exist, each tooth tip trajectory changes, making the surface topography phenomena that surface rises and falls, and cutting grooves’ size shrinks and expands. Cutting groove depth will change {{in the direction of the}} tool axis direction. The surface roughness will increase when the cutter assembly error increases, but the roughness does not change after increasing to a threshold value...|$|R

40|$|The {{influences}} of various factors on {{the mechanics of}} wood cutting by a spring-supported, vertically oscillating frame saw are examined. These include saw tooth pitch, tooth gullet depth and capacity, saw blade overhang, oscillation frequency and amplitude, and log feed speed. [...] The efficiency and effectiveness of the cutting process are dependent primarily on the relative path of motion taken by each tooth through the wood during sawing; thus it is the tooth traces upon which the attention {{of this study is}} focused. The factors listed above govern the shapes of these traces, and thus it is the determination of optimum values for some of these factors which is the main objective here. [...] For the purpose of <b>tooth</b> <b>trace</b> analyses, a computer program has been developed which, when coupled with plotting facilities, allows the user to view a set of simulated relative tooth paths. The program incorporates features which accommodate the other than normal kinematic characteristics of the plate spring supported sash, and combines these influences with those of the factors listed above. Most importantly it allows for the introduction of a non-constant log feed speed function, specifically one which combines a constant with a sinusoidal portion.

We used adult male Wistar albino rats with a mean weight of 250 – 300  g and divided the rats into eight groups. The groups were subjected to an ELF-EMF that was applied with a high-voltage line for 8  hours/day for 26  days (Groups I, II, and III) or 52  days (Groups V, VI, and VII). Groups IV and VIII were the 26 - and 52 -day control/sham groups, respectively. Groups II and VI were treated with GL, and Groups III and VII were treated with MLT. MLT and GL were administered daily based on the weight of the animals and appropriate standards. At the end of the study, the rats were euthanized, and their anterior teeth were extracted. The teeth were preserved in pure water before evaluating the major TEs. At the end of the study, TE concentrations (in mg/kg) were assessed in the control and test groups. Compared with Group V, statistically significant differences in the concentrations of zinc (Zn) and strontium (Sr) were found for Group VII (ELF-EMF + MLT) (P< 0. 05). Therefore, ELF-EMF exposure can change the content of certain TEs in teeth and, after administering MLT and GL, the values of some of the TEs return to normal.

40|$|Trace element {{profiles}} {{for common}} divalent cations (Sr, Zn, Ba), rare-earth elements (REE), Y, U, and Th were measured in fossil bones and teeth from the c. 25 ka Merrell locality, Montana, USA, by using laser-ablation ICP-MS. Multiple traverses in teeth were transformed into 2 -D trace element maps for visualizing structural influences on trace element uptake. Trace element compositions of different soils from the fossil site were also analyzed by solution ICP-MS, employing progressive leaches that included distilled H 2 O, 0. 1 M acetic acid, and microwave digestion in concentrated HCl–HNO 3. In <b>teeth,</b> <b>trace</b> element uptake in enamel is 2 – 4 {{orders of magnitude}} slower than in dentine, forming an effective trace element barrier. Uptake in dentine parallel to the dentine–enamel interface is enhanced by at least 2 orders of magnitude compared to transverse, causing trace element “plumes” down the tooth core. In bone, U, Ba and Sr are nearly homogeneous, implying diffusivities 5 orders of magnitude faster than in enamel and virtually complete equilibration with host soils. In contrast all REE show strong depletions inward, with stepwise linear segments in log-normal or inverse complementary error function plots; these data require a multi-medium diffusion model, with about 2 orders of magnitude difference in slowest vs. fastest diffusivities. Differences in REE diffusivities in bone (slow) vs. dentine (fast) reflect different partition coefficients (Kd’s). Although acid leaches and bulk digestion of soils yield comparable fossil–soil Kd’s among different elements, natural solutions {{are expected to be}} neutral to slightly basic. Distilled H 2 O leachates instead reveal radically different Kd’s in bone for REE than for U–Sr–Ba, suggest orders of magnitude lower effective diffusivities for REE, and readily explain steep vs. flat profiles for REE vs. U–Sr–Ba, respectively. Differences among REE Kd’s and diffusivities may explain inward changes in Ce anomalies. Acid washes and bulk soil compositions yield misleading Kd’s for many trace elements, especially the REE, and H 2 O-leaches are preferred. Patterns of trace element distributions indicate diagenetic alteration at all scales, including enamel, and challenge the use of trace elements in paleodietary studies...|$|R

AIM: To monitor 8 year {{changes of the}} gingival contour occurring in adolescents and adults and relate these changes to dentofacial growth. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Forty adolescents (mean age 16. 3), and 14 adults (mean age 29. 7) were included in the study with photographs, radiographs and casts taken 2 and 10 years after orthodontic treatment. The gingival contour of upper central incisors and the midline passing through the contact surface of both <b>teeth</b> were <b>traced</b> digitally using calibrated photographs. Changes were measured on seven standardized lines of the gingival contour. Lower facial height changes and tooth eruption were measured using lateral cephalograms. RESULTS: Adolescents and adults showed a central mean apical displacement of the gingival margin of 0. 51 mm (SD 0. 4 mm) and 0. 13 mm (SD 0. 17 mm), respectively. This displacement decreased by moving away from the centre. The gingival displacement was associated to the individual's lower facial height augmentation, r= 0. 63 (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Pearl oysters {{belonging}} to the genus Pinctada (Bivalvia: Pteriidae) are widely distributed between the Indo-Pacific and western Atlantic. The existence of both widely distributed and more restricted species makes this group a suitable model to study diversification patterns and prevailing modes of speciation. Phylogenies of eight out of the 11 currently recognised Pinctada species using mito-chondrial (cox 1) and nuclear (18 S rRNA) data yielded two monophyletic groups that correspond to shell size and presence/absence of hinge <b>teeth.</b> Character <b>trace</b> of these morphological characters onto the molecular phylogeny revealed a strong correlation. Pinctada margaritifera appears polyphyletic with specimens from Mauritius grouping in a different clade from others of the French Polynesia and Japan. Hence, P. margaritifera might represent a species complex, and specimens from Mauritius could represent a different species. Regarding the putative species complex Pinctada fucata/Pinctada martensii/Pinc-tada radiata/Pinctada imbricata, our molecular analyses question the taxonomic validity of the morphological characters used to discriminate P. fucata and P. martensii that exhibited the lowest genetic divergence and are most likely conspecific as they clustered together. P. radiata and P. imbricata were recovered as monophyletic. The absence of overlapping distributions between sister lineages and the observed isolation by distance suggests that allopatry is the prevailing speciation mode in Pinctada.

40|$|One hundred human lower second molars, 51 {{from the}} left side and 49 from the right side, {{extracted}} due to their poor clinical and radiographic conditions were utilized in this study. Using a Contracer apparatus, the profiles of the buccal and lingual root surfaces of these <b>teeth</b> were <b>traced</b> on a millimeter-scaled paper. The profiles were registered from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), millimeter by millimeter, up to the entrance of the furcation. The width, length and depth of the root trunk groove, as well as the length of the root trunk, were studied. After statistical analysis (p < 0. 05) it was possible to conclude that: a) the mean width of the root trunk groove on the buccal surface was 3. 6 mm and, on the lingual surface, 3. 3 mm; b) the mean depth of the root trunk groove on the buccal surface was 0. 88 mm and, on the lingual surface, 0. 77 mm; c) the mean length of the root trunk groove on the buccal surface was 2. 93 mm and, on the lingual surface, 3. 61 mm. The mean length of the root trunk on the buccal surface was 3. 09 mm and, on the lingual surface, 3. 91 mm (p < 0. 025). There was a coincidence between the length of the root trunk and that of its groove in 90. 2 % of the buccal surfaces of the samples {{from the left}} side, and in 77. 5 % of the samples from the right side; on the lingual surface, the coincidence occurred in 77. 5 % of the teeth {{from the left side}}, and on 88. 3 % of the teeth from the right side.

40|$|After {{the advent}} of the laser {{ablation}} system (LA), the analysis of micro-samples of hard materials has spread to many scientific fields (i. e. geology, engineering, archaeometry, anthropology). The Laser Ablation Coupled with a Mass Spectrometer (as in the LA–ICP–MS) allows to investigate any hard material at the scale of a few µms, for example, defining the elemental compositional profile of bone, teeth and nephroliths, measuring any element with an atomic mass between 2 and 255 amu (i. e. heavy metals as Pb, Cr, Cd, As, etc.). Moreover, one of the main advantages offered by LA, compared to more traditional techniques, is the drastic reduction of analytical time, because the sample is analysed as it is without chemical dissolution or separation of elements. In this work, we have tested and developed a routine to measure all trace elements in human bones and teeth with the LA–ICPMS housed at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. We analyse all trace element but we have focused here our attention on Zn and Pb, given their importance and significance in dentistry, human health and forensic pathology studies. We have then analyzed two human <b>teeth,</b> measuring their <b>trace</b> elements compositional profile and drawing conclusions on the health history of these two individuals. Materials and Methods. We analysed two human teeth (molar 1 HT–R and premolar 2 HT–R) sampled from two post-medieval mummies (Roccapelago, Modena, 16 th – 18 th cent.). The concentrations of Pb and Zn were measured in situ through a 213 nm Nd:YAG Laser Ablation system coupled to a quadrupole ICP–MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific® X SeriesII). Before analysis, each sample was cut in half with a diamond low-speed wheel saw, to expose the inner parts of the tooth. Eighteen LA–spots (diameter 100 µm) were analysed along two profiles (n= 10 sample 1 HT–R; n= 8 sample 2 HT–R), exploring enamel and dentine. The elemental concentrations of our samples have been corrected through a calibration with NIST 1486 Bone Meal as a multi-element standard. To correct any matrix-related effect, the calcium concentration, measured with an ESEM Quanta 200, has been used as the internal standard. To ensure the accuracy of the method, a two-tailed t-test was performed on two certified elements of the standard. Statistical analysis shows no significant difference between expected and measured values (p< 0. 05; mean of 3 analyses). Results. The first tooth (1 HT–R) shows a Zn concentration ranging from 230 in the outer enamel to 110 ppm in the inner primary dentine (x = 150 ± 38 ppm, 1 σ) and, respectively, a Pb concentration ranging from 3 to 1 ppm (x = 2 ± 1 ppm, 1 σ). From the outer enamel to the inner dentine, the second tooth (2 HT–R) shows a Zn concentration ranging from 301 to 123 ppm (x = 177 ± 66 ppm, 1 σ) and a Pb concentration ranging from 6 to 2 ppm (x = 3 ± 1 ppm, 1 σ). Conclusions. Our results are in agreement with Pb and Zn profiles described in literature for human teeth (Humphrey et al. 2008). The concentrations of both elements tend to increase from the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) to the enamel external surface and tend to decrease from the EDJ to the inner dentine. The Pb concentration of both samples is on average lower than the threshold of poisoning reported for human bones (5 ppm; Hess et al. 2013). The Zn concentrations are low, in particular in the outer enamel. As reported by Lynch (2011), this could be related to tooth wear or to the old age of the two individuals (~ 40 yr). The LA–ICP–MS is a non-destructive in–situ analytical technique, fundamental in forensic pathology and human health studies to measure the elemental composition of human hard tissue and in particular, in outlining the history of the <b>tooth</b> by <b>trace</b> element compositional profile from the inner to the outer portions of the tooth...|$|R

Strontium and Ba generally biopurify with increasing trophic level, but Ba shows decreasing discrimination with tissue type in the order secondary dentine – primary dentine – enamel. Most elements show strong zoning within tissues and variable trophic level behavior, so concentrations in omnivores rarely fall between herbivores and carnivores. Trace element mass balance suggests that soil and dust, not food, commonly deliver the largest trace element load in terrestrial carnivores and omnivores, even for elements that biopurify, like Ba. Use of trace elements for inferring past diets are likely compromised by unknown rates of dust and soil ingestion rather than indicating the degree of herbivory and carnivory. The low concentrations of many elements provide multiple sensitive markers of post-burial overprinting {{that can be used}} to discriminate altered vs. original biogenic compositions. REE and actinide trends do not directly follow bedrock compositions...|$|R
40|$|An ophthalmosaurid {{ichthyosaur}} {{was discovered}} in Upper Jurassic deposits of the Umbria-Marche sedimentary succession near Genga (Ancona, Marche, Italy). While other Mesozoic marine reptiles have been found at different stratigraphic intervals in Italy, this specimen represents the first ichthyosaur ever recorded from the Upper Jurassic of the Apennines. It consists of an almost complete skeleton preserved on a slab, with an articulated vertebral column, and disarticulated skull and pectoral girdle. This paper describes the stratigraphy of the ichthyosaur-bearing deposits. The Umbria-Marche sedimentary succession is characterized by Meso-Cenozoic pelagites and hemipelagites overlying Lower Jurassic shallow-water carbonates (Calcare Massiccio Fm.). The rifting stage, which affected the Western Tethys in the Early Jurassic, produced a complex submarine architecture, resulting in a mosaic of variable facies and thickness differences in the syn- and post-rift succession. Extension linked with opening of the Liguria - Piedmont Ocean dismembered and drowned a huge carbonate platform (Calcare Massiccio paleoplatform), and converted it into a system with small horsts-and-grabens/semigrabens, where pelagic deposits capped the shallow-water carbonates. The original Early Jurassic paleobathymetric differences were levelled by Early Cretaceous times. The basin-fill deposits onlapped the (mostly pre-rift) Calcare Massiccio facies, exposed at the footwall of Jurassic faults {{in the form of}} paleoescarpments, and buried the structural highs while their margins were largely inactive. The area in which the ichthyosaur was found was characterized by numerous structural highs (Mt. Murano, Mt. Revellone, Mt. Scoccioni and Mt. Valmontagnola), onlapped by the Jurassic - Early Cretaceous basin-fill units. In the Middle Jurassic, a huge block (about 0, 7 km longer axis) of Calcare Massiccio - characterizing the Il Sassone sector - collapsed from the western escarpment of the Mt. Scoccioni or from the Mt. Revellone high, due to tectonic/gravitative instability. The olistolith was embedded in the “Calcari e marne a Posidonia” Fm. (late Toarcian-?late Bajocian), and subsequently was onlapped by the “Calcari Diasprigni” (?late Bajocian-early Kimmeridgian) and “Calcari ad aptici e Saccocoma” (Kimmeridgian p. p. -early Tithonian) Fms. Additional stratigraphic evidence for tectonic instability across the study area is found in the Middle Jurassic with gravity flow deposits, slumps and breccias bearing Calcare Massiccio clasts. The specimen {{was discovered in}} the Upper Jurassic deposits onlapping the Il Sassone mega-olistolith. It was embedded in green and reddish limestones and cherty-limestones referable to the “Calcari ad aptici e Saccocoma” Fm. The faunal assemblage includes belemnites (Duvalia spp.), aptychi (Laevaptychus sp., ?Laevilamellaptychus sp.), rhyncholites (Leptocheilus sp.), shark <b>teeth</b> (hexanchiforms), <b>trace</b> fossils (Thalassinoides sp., Chondrites sp.), radiolarians, calcisphaerulids and abundant Saccocoma tenella. These elements, coupled with the absence of S. vernioryi, Chitinoidella spp. and calpionellids, constrain the age of the ichthyosaur to the late Kimmeridgian - earliest Tithonian...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, ICP-MS {{is used for}} detecting inorganic impurities in pharmaceuticals and their ingredients. New and reduced maximum permitted exposure levels of heavy metals form dietary supplements, introduced in USP (United States Pharmacopeia) <232>Elemental Impurities—Limits [...] and USP <233> Elemental Impurities—Procedures, will increase the need for ICP-MS technology, where, previously, other analytic methods have been sufficient.Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a powerful technique for the elemental analysis {{of a wide variety}} of materials encountered in forensic casework. (LA-ICP-MS) has already successfully been applied to applications in forensics, metals, glasses, soils, car paints, bones and <b>teeth,</b> printing inks, <b>trace</b> elemental, fingerprint, and Paper. Among these, forensic glass analysis stands out as an application for which this technique has great utility to provide highly.Car hit and runs, burglaries, assaults, drive-by shootings and bombings such as these situations may cause glass fragments that could be used as evidence of association in glass transfer conditions. LA-ICP-MS is considered one of the best techniques for analysis of glass due to the short time for sample preparation and sample, small sample size of less than 250 nanograms. In addition there is no need for complex procedure and handling of dangerous materials that is used for digestion of the samples. This allows detecting major, minor and tracing elements with high level of precision and accuracy. There are set of properties that are used to measure glass sample such as physical and optical properties including color, thickness, density, refractive index (RI) and also, if necessary, elemental analysis can be conducted in order to enhance the value of an association.Cosmetics, such as lipstick, recovered from a crime scene may provide valuable forensic information. Lipstick smears left on cigarette butts, glassware, clothing, bedding; napkins, paper, etc. may be valuable evidence. Lipstick recovered from clothing or skin may also indicate physical contact between individuals. Forensic analysis of recovered lipstick smear evidence can provide valuable information on the recent activities of a victim or suspect. Trace elemental analysis of lipstick smears could be used to complement existing visual comparative procedures to determine the lipstick brand and color. Previous forensic techniques employed for the organic analysis of lipsticks by compositional comparison include thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography (GC), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These methods provide useful information regarding the identification of lipsticks. However, they all require long sample preparation times and destroy the sample. Nondestructive techniques for the forensic analysis of lipstick smears include UV fluorescence observation combined with purge-and-trap gas chromatography, microspectrophotometry and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and Raman spectroscopy.|$|R
