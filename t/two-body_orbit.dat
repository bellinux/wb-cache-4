40|$|The {{equations}} for {{the electromagnetic}} two-body problem are neutral-delay equations that for generic initial data have solutions with discontinuous derivatives. If {{one wants to}} use these neutral-delay equations with arbitrary initial data, solutions with discontinuous derivatives must be allowed. Surprisingly, this same neutrality {{is compatible with the}} recently developed variational method with mixed-type boundaries for the Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics. We show that <b>two-body</b> electromagnetic <b>orbits</b> with discontinuous velocities are physically necessary by showing that orbits with vanishing far-fields amost everywhere must have some discontinuous velocities on a few points. We generalize the Wheeler-Feynman electrodynamics with the variational method to include all continuous trajectories, allowing piecewise-differentiable weak solutions represented by trajectories with fields defined almost everywhere (but on a set of points of zero measure where velocities jump). Along with this generalization we formulate the generalized absorber hypothesis that the far-fields vanish asymptotically almost everywhere and show that bounded <b>two-body</b> <b>orbits</b> satisfying the generalized absorber hypothesis need to have discontinuous derivatives on a few points. We also give the general solution for the family of bounded non-radiating <b>two-body</b> <b>orbits.</b> We discuss the physics of orbits with discontinuous derivatives and show that these conserve the physical momentum, stressing the differences to classical variational methods. Last, we discuss how the electromagnetic variational method with mixed-type boundaries is well-posed but lacks reversibilty.

The origin of the instability is analyzed analytically using the Stark problem as a fiducial test case. We similarly examine the robustness of several alternative methods: a regularized WH map due to Mikkola (1997); the potential-splitting (PS) approach of Lee et al. (1997); and two types of Stark-based methods. Comparative simulations show the regularized WH map to be stable at high eccentricities, and an enhanced PS algorithm to perform well when close encounters are additionally present. We find Stark-based schemes to be of marginal use in N-body type integrations. Comment: 38 pages (12 figures, 1 table), AASTeX sourc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} how to refine patched-conic orbit ap-proximations with a restricted four-body orbit setup. By approximating an overall orbit {{as a series of}} <b>two-body</b> <b>orbits,</b> patched-conic approximations offer a greatly simplified way of analyzing missions. However, they are limited in their ability to fully represent a particular orbit. Therefore, we must use a numerical integra-tion technique to more precisely describe interplanetary missions. By extending the patched-conic approximation to a restricted four-body problem, we achieve a more precise orbit transfer description. Taking into consideration the gravitational influences of the sun, Earth, and Mars at all times, we compute a spacecraft’s trans-fer orbit from Earth to Mars. The integrator provides a more precise estimate {{of the state of the}} vehicle upon its arrival at Mars. The initial orbit conditions are adjusted and the effects upon the arrival state are measured. Also, the values of required departure burn are compared for the Hohmann solution, the patched-conic approximation, and the restricted four-body problem. ...|$|R

40|$|A global, Pareto, and {{parallel}} optimization method for low-thrust orbit transfers is developed by applying a multi-objective parallel genetic algorithm to the Primer Vector control law. Complex trajectories are parameterized with the well-known Primer Vector control law using only the initial {{values of a}} co-state vector. The multi-objective parallel genetic algorithm searches for initial values that lead to mass- and time-optimal trajectories that satisfy a prescribed final target condition. The optimization method yields a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, which demonstrate the trade-off between ∆V and flight time for a given low-thrust orbit transfer. The method is applied to three different multiple-revolution orbit transfer problems: 1) a <b>two-body</b> <b>orbit</b> transfer around the Earth, 2) a restricted three-body, coplanar distant retrograde orbit (DRO) transfer around Europa, and 3) a restricted three-body, non-coplanar DRO transfer around Europa.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{structure}} and dynamics of the galaxies in the Coma cluster using a catalog of 552 redshifts including 243 new measurements. The velocity distribution is shown to be non-Gaussian due to structure associated with the group of galaxies around NGC 4839, 40 arcmin SW of the cluster core. We apply a mixture-modelling algorithm to the galaxy sample and obtain a robust partition into two subclusters which we use to examine the system's dynamics. We find that the late-type galaxies are freely-falling into a largely virialised cluster core dominated by early types. We obtain a virial mass for the main cluster {{in close agreement with}} the estimates derived from recent X-ray data. The mass of the NGC 4839 group is about 5 - 10 % the mass of the main cluster. Assuming the main cluster and the NGC 4839 group follow a linear <b>two-body</b> <b>orbit,</b> the favored solution has the two clusters lying at 74 degrees to the line of sight at a true separation of 0. 8 Mpc and moving together at 1700 km/s. The cluster core shows evidence of an ongoing merger between two subclusters centered in projection on the dominant galaxies NGC 4874 and NGC 4889 but offset in velocity by 300 km/s and 1100 km/s respectively. Combining these results with X-ray and radio observations, and an interpretation of the presence or lack of an extended halo around the dominant galaxies, we develop a merger history for the Coma cluster.

40|$|In {{order to}} conduct {{sustained}} human exploration beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), spacecraft systems {{are designed to}} operate {{in a series of}} missions of increasing complexity. Regardless of the destination, Moon, Mars, asteroids or beyond, there is a substantial set of common objectives that must be met. Many orbit characterization studies have endeavored to evaluate the potential locations in cislunar space that are favorable for meeting common human exploration objectives in a stepwise approach. Multiple studies, by both NASA and other international space agencies, have indicated that Earth-moon libration point orbits are attractive candidates for staging operations in the proving ground and beyond. In particular, the Near Rectilinear Orbit (NRO) has been demonstrated to meet multi-mission and multi-destination architectural constraints. However, a human mission to a selected NRO presents a variety of new challenges for mission planning. While a growing number of robotic missions have completed successful operations to various specific libration point orbits, human missions have never been conducted to orbits of this class. Human missions have unique challenges that differ significantly from robotic missions, including a lower tolerance for mission risk and additional operational constraints that are associated only with human spacecraft. In addition, neither robotic nor human missions have been operated in the NRO regime specifically, and NROs exhibit dynamical characteristics that can differ significantly as compared to other halo orbits. Finally, multi-body orbits, such as libration point orbits, are identified to exist in a simplified orbit model known as the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem (CRTBP) and must then be re-solved in the full ephemeris model. As a result, the behavior of multi-body orbits cannot be effectively characterized within the classical <b>two-body</b> <b>orbit</b> dynamics framework more familiar to the human spaceflight community. In fact, a given NRO is not identified by a set of Keplerian orbit parameters, and a valid epoch specific state vector must be first obtained from a multi-body dynamical model. In this paper, the significant performance and operational challenges of conducting human missions to the NRO are evaluated. First, a systematic process for generating full ephemeris based ballistic NROs of various families is outlined to demonstrate the relative ease in which a multi-revolution orbit can be found for any epoch and for various orbit geometries. In the Earth-Moon system, NROs, which are halo orbits with close passage over a lunar pole, can exist with respect to libration point 1 (L 1) or libration point 2 (L 2) and are either from a North or South family orbit class with respect to the ecliptic. Second, the ability to maintain the orbit over the lifetime of a habitat mission by applying a reliable station-keeping strategy is investigated. The NRO, while similar to the quasi-halo orbits that the Artemis mission flew, requires an updated station keeping strategy. This is due to several dynamical differences such as the increased relative stability of the NRO compared to other halo orbits and the close passage over the lunar surface as shown in Figure 1. Multiple station-keeping strategies are being investigated to ensure a human spacecraft remains on a predictable path. As the NRO is not described in simple two-body parameters, analysis must determine the best strategy for targeting a reference NRO as well as how closely a future state should be constrained. In addition, costs will be minimized by determining maneuver directionality based on an identified pattern in the optimal station-keeping solutions or an analytically derived relationship. The candidate station-keeping algorithm must be stable and robust to environmental and vehicle uncertainties as well to navigation estimation and flight control execution errors. To that end, navigation accuracies, the impact on the station-keeping execution errors as well as other vehicle uncertainties need to be assessed. Starting with Orion, current navigation accuracies are evaluated and then navigation requirements are derived assuming a desired station-keeping propellant budget. Third, the performance requirements to and from the NRO are evaluated. Important parameters for developing expected propellant costs include epoch of operation, size and type of NRO, Earth departure and return constraints, as well as abort or early-return capability. Finally, rendezvous and proximity operations are vital aspects of multi-mission human exploration endeavors. The ability to conduct rendezvous and the associated propellant costs are assessed as well as the impacts of various profile assumptions including the location within the NRO the rendezvous is performed. The results of these studies will influence plans for international cooperation on both nearer term proving ground missions and beyond...|$|E

This article is focused more on the kinematical issues surrounding planar motion, that is, determination of the forces necessary to result in a certain trajectory given the particle trajectory. General results presented in fictitious forces here are applied to observations of a moving particle as seen from several specific non-inertial frames, for example, a local frame (one tied to the moving particle so it appears stationary), and a co-rotating frame (one with an arbitrarily located but fixed axis and a rate of rotation that makes the particle appear to have only radial motion and zero azimuthal motion).
