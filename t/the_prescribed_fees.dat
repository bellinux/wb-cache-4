50|$|The Maharaja had {{occasion}} to visit a school that was imparting instruction in English at Nagarcoil {{under the auspices of}} the London Missionary Society (LMS). He was impressed by the school and the quality of the education given there and was convinced that the new type of school held out great prospects for the people of the state. The school later evolved into Scott Christian College, Nagercoil. Shortly thereafter he invited Mr. Roberts who was in-charge of the school at Nagarcoil to come to Thiruvananthapuram and start a similar school there. The educationist, who was an Englishman, agreed and a new school was started in 1834. It was private institution, but the state government contributed <b>the</b> <b>prescribed</b> <b>fees</b> for 80 pupils who thereby got free tuition. The classes were conducted in an old building about half a mile to the south of University College, on the premises where the Govt. Ayurveda College stands today. In less than a year, the government took over the school and assumed full responsibility for its management. Roberts was appointed headmaster and it came to be known as the Raja's Free School. In the following year the institution was moved to a new building constructed for the purpose on the premises where the University College is now located. The school continued as a free institution till 1863-64. Those were days when education of the western type was being newly introduced in India and the Raja's Free School was one of the earliest institutions in South India established {{under the auspices of the}} government for imparting instruction to the children of the state. It attracted pupils from all parts of Travancore and many of its alumni rose to high positions in the public life of the state and distinguished themselves in may fields of cultural activity.|$|E

40|$|PhD (Education Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Background: After {{independence}} {{education was}} declared {{one of the}} inviolable fundamental human rights of all persons entrenched in the Supreme Law of the country, the Constitution of the Republic of Namibia. It is an irrefutable fact proven {{by a number of}} research findings and confirmed by educational theorists and decided cases that appropriate and quality early childhood education is a foundation of all levels of education. In Namibia currently, public early childhood development and education is provided by community members in Early Childhood Development Community Centres in both rural and urban areas. It is against this background {{that the purpose of the}} study on which this research report is based was to determine, through stakeholder participants’ eyes, how the presumed right to education of the pre- grade one learners in rural early childhood development and education community centres (ECDECCs) in Northern Namibia is adhered to. Research Design and Methodology: The study was based on a qualitative interpretive hybrid case study of four (including pilot study) rural ECDECCs, review of early childhood development and education literature, legal literature, relevant legislation, case law, regulations, policies and International Human Right Instruments conducted before and after conducting research in the field. Empirical data were collected through semi-structured individual (one on one) face to face interviews with various stakeholder participants (such as heads of/teachers at ECDECCs, parents/guardians, community leaders/members, officials from the Ministry of Gender Equality, Ministry of Education and Human Rights Activists. The findings of the study were inter alia that all participants had knowledge of and understood the fact that five to six years old children indeed have the right to education, and most of them also understood the significance of pre- grade one learners’ education. As such, the communities were doing everything in their power to provide early childhood education. However, early childhood development and education community centres were ill-equipped in terms of physical facilities, human resources, and learning-teaching aids. In addition, heads of centres/teachers were not properly trained. There was no tap water, no electricity, and no toilet facilities. Most children did not fully or not at all attend community centres for early childhood education, because of inability on the part of their parents/guardians to pay <b>the</b> <b>prescribed</b> <b>fees.</b> Buildings (structures) in which pre-grade one education was practised were not completed and therefore not suitable for human occupation, as community members who initiated them did not have sufficient funds to finance such undertakings. Literature studies of selected relevant legal literature, Constitutions, legislation, decided cases and international human right instruments confirm the fact that pre-grade one education is indeed a legally enforceable fundamental human right to basic education. To this end, there are legal determinants of the provision of pregrade one learners early childhood development and education. Recommendations were that the State (government) had to take over early childhood education, and that teachers have to be academically and professionally trained and accordingly paid salaries by the Ministry of Education. Because of the above obstacles experienced in rural ECDECCs, pre-grade one learners’ right to education leaves much to be desired. Consequently, it is recommended that the Ministry of Education must, as of necessity, legally take over education of all pre-grade one learners (preprimary learners) in entirety in order to comply with the provisions of International Human Rights Instruments in general, and Article 20 (1) of the Constitution of Namibia in particular. In addition, in order to ensure promotion, advancement, realisation and fulfilment of the pre-grade one learners’ right to education, the current Namibian Education Act needs to be amended like the South African Schools Act, or a new Early Childhood Development and Education Act has to be promulgated altogether, to specifically and particularly cater for the pre-grade one learners’ right to basic education. This is indispensable because, in the words of Smith (2011 : 305) : “The value and necessity of education is beyond dispute because education is both a human right in itself and a crucial means of realising other human rights. ” The study concluded that early childhood education provision and practice in ECDECCs in rural areas in their current nature and status at the time of conducting this study in Northern Namibia leaves much to be desired. As such, it is not the best possible vehicle for the early childhood development and education provision of pregrade one education for the five to six years old children in light of their human right to education.

According to a story repeated by Plutarch, when Demosthenes was an adolescent, his curiosity was noticed by the orator Callistratus, who was then {{at the height of his}} reputation, having just won a case of considerable importance. According to Friedrich Nietzsche, a German philologist and philosopher, and Constantine Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, Demosthenes was a student of Isocrates; according to Cicero, Quintillian and the Roman biographer Hermippus, he was a student of Plato. Lucian, a Roman-Syrian rhetorician and satirist, lists the philosophers Aristotle, Theophrastus and Xenocrates among his teachers. These claims are nowadays disputed. According to Plutarch, Demosthenes employed Isaeus as his master in rhetoric, even though Isocrates was then teaching this subject, either because he could not pay Isocrates <b>the</b> <b>prescribed</b> <b>fee</b> or because Demosthenes believed Isaeus's style better suited a vigorous and astute orator such as himself [...] Curtius, a German archaeologist and historian, likened the relation between Isaeus and Demosthenes to [...] "an intellectual armed alliance".|$|R

Francis Millerd, general manager and part-owner of Somerville, challenged the oriental exclusion policy through hiring Japanese-Canadian fishermen and lobbying to secure salmon fishing licenses for them. Charges against Somerville were dismissed, on the grounds that fish canneries did not require a federal license. Further pressure by Somerville and the Association of Fishermen of Japanese Origin resulted in the following reference questions being posed to the Supreme Court of Canada: [...] :1.
