5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{into the}} 2014–15 season, Hilliard {{was named to}} the Preseason Second Team All-Big East. He {{averaged}} 14.3 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game as a senior. Villanova was ranked in the top ten for most of the season thanks <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> offense. Hilliard scored 23 points on December 20 in an overtime victory over Syracuse, hitting 9-of-17 shots. He hit two free throws to give the Wildcats the first lead of the game in overtime before being kicked in the face and tested for concussion-like symptoms. Against Creighton on January 25, 2015, he scored 24 points and made 6-of-10 three-pointers in a 71–50 victory at home. On February 14, in a 78–75 victory over Butler, Hilliard scored a career-high 31 points and also set a career high with 8 three-pointers made out of 13 attempts. He also hit the game-winning three-pointer with 1.5 seconds to play in the game. Eight of his nine field goals in that game were three-pointers, and his eight rebounds were one short of a career-high. He averaged 18.7 points during a nine-game stretch that included the Butler game.|$|E

25|$|When a dipole with an {{unbalanced}} feedline such as {{coaxial cable}} {{is used for}} transmitting, the shield side of the cable, {{in addition to the}} antenna, radiates. This can induce radio frequency (RF) currents into other electronic equipment near the radiating feedline, causing RF interference. Furthermore, the antenna is not as efficient as it could be because it is radiating closer to the ground and its radiation pattern may be asymmetrically distorted. To prevent this, dipoles fed by coaxial cables have a balun between the cable and the antenna, to convert the unbalanced signal provided by the coax <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> symmetrical signal for the antenna.|$|E
25|$|In August 2014, the Chinese-language Shanghai Morning Post listed that Liaoning {{would carry}} 36 aircraft: 24 Shenyang J-15 fighters, six Changhe Z-18F anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, four Changhe Z-18J {{airborne}} early warning helicopters and two Harbin Z-9C rescue helicopters. The Chinese carrier aircraft inventory is similar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> combat and support aircraft approach intended for Soviet aircraft carriers, which supported nuclear submarines, large surface combatants, and land-based strike bombers performing anti-access roles. The air wing lacks long-range radar and anti-submarine fixed-wing aircraft, needing support from shore-based aircraft such as Tupolev Tu-154 ASW and Shaanxi Y-8 AWACS aircraft. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that J-15s will have below normal range and armament when operating from the carrier, due to limits imposed by the ski-jump takeoff system. The lack of a carrier onboard delivery aircraft like the United States Navy (USN) Grumman C-2 Greyhound also limits logistics capabilities. Liaoning would need extensive land-based support to oppose a USN carrier strike group; however, it would be potent against the Vietnam People's Navy and the Philippine Navy. Deficiencies will likely be corrected with future aircraft carriers, which {{are expected to be}} larger with conventional takeoff decks and catapult launching for heavier fighters, plus fixed-wing radar and anti-submarine patrol aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|The single predator-single prey {{relationship}} between wolves and moose on Isle Royale in Lake Superior is unique, {{and has been}} the subject of detailed study for over 55 years. Isle Royale, the principal island of Isle Royale National Park in Michigan in the United States, is an isolated island with little [...] of animals into and out of the island and as a national park human interaction and impact on the two species is also limited. Both the wolves and the moose first became established populations on Isle Royale in the 1900s. Over the fifty years of the study, the populations of both moose and wolves have shown repeated spikes and declines and have not settled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> relationship. The moose populations have ranged from 500 to 2500 while the number of wolves has ranged from almost 50 down to 2.|$|E
2500|$|Spectral {{clustering}} methods, {{in which}} the vertices of a graph are grouped by the coordinates of the eigenvectors of matrices derived from the graph, have long {{been used as a}} heuristic for graph partitioning problems for nonplanar graphs. As [...] show, spectral clustering {{can also be used to}} derive an alternative proof for a weakened form of the planar separator theorem that applies to planar graphs with bounded degree. In their method, the vertices of a given planar graph are sorted by the second coordinates of the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, and this sorted order is partitioned at the point that minimizes the ratio of the number of edges cut by the partition to the number of vertices on the smaller side of the partition. As they show, every planar graph of bounded degree has a partition of this type {{in which the}} ratio is O(1/√n). Although this partition may not be balanced, repeating the partition within the larger of the two sides and taking the union of the cuts formed at each repetition will eventually lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> partition with O(√n) edges. The endpoints of these edges form a separator of size O(√n).|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} year, PCI {{was based in}} the rented Garden View House, a Summer resort hotel at 536 Broadway Avenue, Saratoga Springs, that had the {{capacity}} for seventy-five students. Tuition, room, board, and laundry was only $100, with an increase to $125 the following year. From its inception, PCI was both co-educational and interdenominational. The initial enrolment was 51 students, with 21 from Saratoga Springs, and students from eight different states. The students were enrolled in PCI's high school, and its preparatory department. There were 17 elementary, 12 high school, 11 seminary, and 11 special students. Unlike Bible Colleges of that day, PCI was a post-secondary school collegiate institute and for its first two years had a liberal arts program with [...] "Latin, Greek, modern languages, art, music, and oratory" [...] in its curriculum for ministerial students. PCI specially rejected the use of higher criticism to study the Bible. It was the stated purpose of the founders that [...] "holiness shall be written upon all from headstone to keystone, and shall be Christocentric under the constantly sought and clearly recognized guidance of the Holy Ghost." [...] Additionally, they indicated [...] "both mind and body ruled by a blood washed, fire crowned spirit is the end sought for every student." [...] As a consequence, from its inception, there was a commitment <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> educational preparation for ministry, however [...] "tremendous pressure was applied throughout the year to bring every student into a profession of saving and sanctifying grace. Scenes of rather unrestrained emotional fervor were characteristic." [...] By {{the end of the}} first school term, [...] "virtually all were converted, and most of them were sanctified wholly".|$|E
