5|$|Nixon's {{career was}} {{frequently}} dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it. Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> {{line between the}} human and the caricature became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow.|$|E
5|$|The fold {{that connects}} {{the back of the}} sublingua and tongue to the rear floor of the mouth is called the plica sublingualis.

5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal {{force at the}} equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One {{possible explanation for the}} braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the event, a crate filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. Many of those in {{attendance}} had come to see the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was damaged both by the explosion and by the rowdy fans to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> White Sox were required to forfeit the second game of the doubleheader to the Tigers.|$|E

5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury {{over the issue of}} whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries.

A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the strong}} win, bitter {{feelings}} at Johns Hopkins {{continued to grow}} into the next season. The school's attitude towards the series worsened to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> 1889 game was rescheduled away from the traditional Thanksgiving Day playing and was moved to a week earlier. That year's game ended in a 36–0 shutout victory for the Naval Academy, and wound up being the breaking point for Johns Hopkins. Hopkins decided to terminate the series following that game. However, Hopkins' students returned to the Naval Academy the following year, yet again to root against Navy, this time supporting Lehigh.|$|E

5|$|On 6August1860 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A), {{with the}} 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as {{chairman}} and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament with the object of connecting the Buckinghamshire Railway (by now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke used his influence to ensure the new route would run via Quainton, near his remaining estates around Wotton, instead of the intended more direct route via Pitchcott. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight years to build, eventually opening on 23September1868. The new line {{was connected to the}} Wycombe Railway's Aylesbury station, and joined the existing Buckinghamshire Railway lines at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Oxford–Bletchley line and the line to Buckingham already met. Verney Junction railway station was built at <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> lines joined, named after Sir Harry who owned the land on which it was built, since there was no nearby town. Aylesbury now had railways to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated {{pendulum}} {{house was}} assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base.

However, the high winds made so much noise that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate.

Most ships have to terminate at Salford Quays, although vessels capable of passing under Trafford Road swing bridge (permanently closed in 1992) can continue up the River Irwell to Hunts Bank, near Manchester Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{scientist}} Peter Kropotkin {{first proposed}} {{the idea of}} fresh water under Antarctic ice sheets {{at the end of}} the 19th century.

Kropotkin's theory was further developed by Russian glaciologist I. A. Zotikov, who wrote his Ph.D. thesis on this subject in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003.
