5000|$|The Senegal jack, Caranx senegallus (also {{known as}} the African jack), is a species of large marine fish {{classified}} in the jack family Carangidae. The species is distributed through the tropical waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging along the west African coast from Angola {{in the south to}} Mauritania in the north. It can be distinguished from co-occurring relatives by its longer dorsal fin lobe, as well as a host of other anatomical features. The Senegal jack grows to a known maximum length of 1 m. It is a coastal species, known to live semi-pelagically, inhabiting both the sea floor and surface waters to depths of around 200 m. The Senegal jack is a predatory species, taking fish, crabs and shrimps as its main prey items. The species reaches sexual maturity at 21 cm in females and 24 cm in males, with spawning occurring in two periods; February to April and September to November. The species is of minor importance to fisheries, and is not discriminated from other jacks in catch statistics. It is taken by <b>trawls,</b> <b>seines</b> and hook and line, and sold fresh or preserved.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Trawls,</b> <b>seines,</b> and {{trammel nets}} {{were used to}} sample the Galve^s^ ton Bay crab populations. The data {{collected}} were used in determining the seasonal abundance of the crabs as compared to previous years sampling. Blue crab populations in 1962 appeared to be larger than in 1961. The female population lagged behind the male in abundance all months in 1962, except April, October, and December. The movement of adult crabs appeared to be governed by their search for food, reproductive cycle, and seasonal temperatures. Juveniles remained in the bay all seasons, moving toward the primary bay as they grew. Growth rate of the juvenile crabs was 0. 4 millimeter per day„ Objective: To sample the blue crab populations with various collecting devices {{in an attempt to}} determine their seasonal abundance, migration patterns, and growth rate as related to environmental conditions. Procedures: Blue crab populations were sampled semi-monthly at permanent stations in the Galveston Bay complex (Figure 1). Either a 10 foot traw...|$|E
40|$|Change in {{behaviour}} {{is usually}} the first response to human-induced environmental change and key for determining whether a species adapts to environmental change or becomes maladapted. Thus, understanding the behavioural response to human-induced changes is crucial in the interplay between ecology, evolution, conservation and management. Yet the behavioural response to fishing activities has been largely ignored. We review studies contrasting how fish behaviour affects catch by passive (e. g., long lines, angling) versus active gears (e. g., <b>trawls,</b> <b>seines).</b> We show that fishing not only targets certain behaviours, but it leads to a multitrait response including behavioural, physiological and life-history traits with population, community and ecosystem consequences. Fisheries-driven change (plastic or evolutionary) of fish behaviour and its correlated traits could impact fish populations well beyond their survival per se, affecting predation risk, foraging behaviour, dispersal, parental care, etc., and hence numerous ecological issues including population dynamics and trophic cascades. In particular, we discuss implications of behavioural responses to fishing for fisheries management and population resilience. More research on these topics, however, is needed to draw general conclusions, and we suggest fruitful directions for future studies...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of BiologyCraig PaukertIn-stream {{dredging}} is {{a common}} practice in rivers worldwide that can affect fish and fish habitat. We investigated the magnitude of these alterations and their influence on the fish community of the Kansas River, a large sand bed river. Fishes were collected monthly from June 2010 to June 2011 in Edwardsville and Lawrence, KS from 12, 1 -km reaches (three actively dredged, two historically dredged {{that have not been}} dredged in at least one month, and seven control reaches) with bottom <b>trawls,</b> <b>seines,</b> and electrofishing. Water depths and velocities were measured with an acoustic doppler current profiler and interpolated in ArcGIS at all 12 reaches. Actively dredged reaches had proportionally more deep water habitat (> 3 m) and lower velocity (0. 30 m/s), low velocity habitat (0. 75 m/s) were similar among all reach types (Ps > 0. 05). A canonical correspondence analysis was used to characterize relationships among habitat variables, reach types (actively dredged, historically dredged, and control), and catch per unit effort (CPUE) of fishes in the Kansas River. Mean velocity and depth explained a significant amount of variation in species CPUE; however, reach type was not a significant factor for any of the gear types for any season. Our results show that dredging in Great Plains Rivers can increase depths, but alterations to fish community structure was not evident, likely because many of these fishes are adapted to a range of habitat conditions and are highly mobile...|$|E

50|$|Because of {{its large}} thorns, the Jenkins' whipray is highly prized for its skin; {{the meat and}} {{cartilage}} may also be utilized. It is frequently taken intentionally and incidentally across much of its range by intensive coastal fisheries, using tangle nets, bottom <b>trawls,</b> <b>seine</b> nets, {{and to a lesser}} extent longlines. Particularly large numbers are caught by an Indonesian commercial gillnet fishery targeting wedgefishes, that operates in the Arafura Sea and increasingly, illegally, in Australian waters. Although species-specific data is lacking, this fishery has caused a substantial decline in overall stingray populations. Off northern Australia, the Jenkins' whipray is relatively protected; it is thought to contribute minimally to the bycatch of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) since the mandatory introduction of Turtle Excluder Devices (TERs). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as of Vulnerable globally due to the intensity and inadequate regulation of regional fishing activities in Southeast Asia.|$|R

25|$|The false scad, Caranx rhonchus (also {{known as}} the spotfin scad, ten-finned horse {{mackerel}} and yellow horse mackerel), is a species of medium-sized marine fish classified in the jack family Carangidae. The false scad is distributed throughout the tropical and temperate waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Namibia {{in the south to}} Spain and throughout most of the Mediterranean in the north. The species has an atypical body form compared to other species of Caranx, and can be distinguished from these on its elongate 'scad-like' body shape alone. Distinguishing the species from members of Decapterus and Trachurus is more difficult, requiring detailed anatomical analysis. The false scad is known to grow to a length of 60cm and a weight of 1 kg. The species lives both pelagically and demersally in continental shelf waters, ranging from depths of 15 to 200 m. It is a predatory fish, taking small fishes, crustaceans including euphausiids and shrimps, and cephalopods as its main prey, with significant dietary shifts as it ages. The false scad reaches sexual maturity at 2 years of age, with spawning occurring between April and July in shallow inshore waters, where the juveniles remain. The species is of major importance to fisheries throughout its range, but particularly from Morocco to Senegal, with annual catches ranging from 500 to 19000 t. The species is caught using <b>trawls,</b> <b>seine</b> nets and gill nets and sold fresh, frozen or salted.|$|R

Middle Eastern countries also record this species in their hauls, but at lower amounts of between 50 and 5000 t. In more southerly regions such as South Africa, it is a rare catch, usually appearing in beach seines. The species is taken by a variety of netting methods such as beach <b>seines,</b> <b>trawls,</b> purse <b>seines</b> and other types of trap including hook and line. It is usually marketed fresh, dried or salted. Torpedo scad are often caught by recreational fishermen throughout their range, however are not considered a target for gamefishing. They readily take small lures and are good sport on light tackle. Torpedo scad are said to have fair to good quality flesh, however are not very popular. Some chefs recommend frying or steaming the fish, although grilling is also acceptable. In polluted waters it has been demonstrated the fish contain higher than acceptable levels of heavy metals, and should be avoided in such regions. Torpedo scad are often used as live baits for larger gamefish.|$|R
