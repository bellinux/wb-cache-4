5|$|Like other Jacobin novels, The Wrongs of Woman {{relies on}} a web of suggestive {{character}} names to convey its message: Jemima is named for Job's daughter; Henry Darnford's name resembles that of Henry Darnley, the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots; and George Venables shares a name with the notorious womanizer George, Prince of Wales. Wollstonecraft added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of her philosophical text by quoting from familiar literature, such as Shakespeare, alluding to important historical events, and referencing relevant facts. The Wrongs of Woman comments {{on the state of}} women in society by rewriting earlier texts with a feminist slant, such as Henry Fielding's Tom Jones; Fielding's Mrs. Fitzpatrick becomes Wollstonecraft's Maria. These rhetorical strategies made the philosophical elements of the novel more palatable to the public.|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and Vientiane and bore little relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> on the ground. There were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenery and}} {{background}} of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources; car model types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus' abductors escaped the police were drawn from real examples, while Hergé closely adhered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of the port and docks at Saint-Nazaire. Professor Tarragon's house was drawn from a real house in Avenue Delleur, Boitsfort, which Jacobs had identified for Hergé's purposes. Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves outside the house and completed a sketch of the building. Immediately after, two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up; {{the house had been}} requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Hergé realised that, had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching, they would have been interrogated.|$|E

25|$|The one-state {{solution}} and the similar binational solution are proposed approaches to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Proponents of a binational {{solution to the}} conflict advocate a single state in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with citizenship and equal rights in the combined entity for all inhabitants of all three territories, without regard to ethnicity or religion. While some advocate this solution for ideological reasons, others feel simply that, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> on the ground, it is the de facto situation.|$|E
50|$|Darryl Walker (Damon Wayans) is {{a clumsy}} nerdy repairman, {{who is a}} genius and Batman fan. Darryl has a pure heart and an optimistic Pollyannish personality.

It brings forward a set of generic considerations applicable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> of urban governance in Africa, acknowledging that cities embody highly diverse histories and connections with the larger world, and advocating for greater knowledge and understanding of the social and cultural underpinnings of those practices that continue to undermine transparent and accountable urban management in Afric...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{fertility decline}} {{in developing countries}} often adopt measures of determinants of fertility behavior developed based on observations from developed countries, without adapting them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> of <b>the</b> study setting. As a result, their findings are usually invalid, anomalous or statistically non-significant. This commentary draws on the research article by Moeeni and colleagues, as an exemplary work which has not adapted measures of two key economic determinants of fertility behavior, namely gender inequality and opportunity costs of childbearing, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>realities</b> of Iran’s economy. Measurement adaptations that can improve the study are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Besides higher {{employment}} and living standards, {{the first two}} years of economic revival seemed to offer a break in the cycle of rising rural violence. The flow of displaced peasants from the Sierra eased, and a good many peasants began to return to the countryside. That reverse might be explained by García's initial efforts to reduce reliance on military force to combat the guerrillas and thereby to lessen the degree of two-way violence driving people out of their villages. But the trend may also have been a response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of better economic conditions and earning possibilities in the agricultural sector.|$|E
25|$|Parker’s West Roxbury church {{remained}} loyal. Sermons {{and media}} attacked him, however, when he denied Biblical miracles and the literal {{authority of the}} Bible and Jesus. Many questioned his Christianity. Nearly all the pulpits in the Boston area were closed to him, and he lost friends. Parker reacted with grief and defiance. He remained unwilling to concede that his views placed him beyond the outer bounds of Unitarian liberalism. After this unwilling break with the Unitarian establishment, he spent two years (1841-1843) adjusting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of his newly controversial and independent career and increasing his social activism on religious grounds. He began to see himself as a prophetic religious reformer.|$|E
25|$|Instead of recalling {{something}} related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of {{the spoken}} word, calligraphy for the Muslim is a visible expression of spiritual concepts. Calligraphy has arguably {{become the most}} venerated form of Islamic art because it provides {{a link between the}} languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The holy book of Islam, al-Qur'ān, has played a vital {{role in the development of}} the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the Arabic alphabet. Proverbs and complete passages from the Qur'an are still active sources for Islamic calligraphy. Contemporary artists in the Islamic world draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions in their work.|$|E

25|$|Skeptics such as Paul Edwards have {{analyzed}} many {{of these}} accounts, and called them anecdotal, while also suggesting that claims of evidence for reincarnation originate from selective thinking and from the false memories that often result from one's own belief system and basic fears, and thus cannot be counted as empirical evidence. Carl Sagan referred to examples apparently from Stevenson's investigations in his book The Demon-Haunted World {{as an example of}} carefully collected empirical data, though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories. Sam Harris cited Stevenson's works in his book The End of Faith as part of a body of data that seems to attest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of psychic phenomena.|$|E
25|$|In sharp {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> {{throughout most of}} Europe, {{there are still some}} examples of Portuguese Romanesque civil architecture that survived to our days, specially the fortified noble residences or Domus Fortis (in Portuguese:"Casa-Torre"). Most are no longer more than single towers that stand out from more modern constructions carried out in the house that surrounds them, and many were remodelled in later Gothic and Renaissance styles, but their Romanesque features are still very much visible. These noble fortified manors were built within, or in the periphery, of feudal lands (Coutos or Honras), among agricultural fertile valleys. We can also find them in neighbouring areas of forests or mountain ranges where nobility could control new farm lands outside more occupied regions in which the purchase of new lands and titles was more difficult.|$|E
25|$|It {{starts in}} Gathiuru, and mainly follows the North Burguret River, then {{continues}} up to Hut Tarn on the Peak Circuit Path. It {{is the shortest}} route to Peak Lenana. It is managed by the Gathiuru Community Forest Association. The locals in the areas have {{for a long time}} suffered human-wildlife conflict. They had to wake up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> that God has endowed them with a great mountain and wildlife from which they can earn a living. They came together and formed the Gathiuru Community Forest Association which was aimed at conserving the two great natural resources as they make a living. To access the route tourists will have to pass through the Mt Kenya Royal Cottages for payment and facilitation. This is a lodge situated opposite the Nanyuki airstrip and has entered into a partnership with the association to help market the route for the locals so that the community benefits. The Gathiuru Route boasts of great fauna and flora, wildlife and great scenery.|$|E

25|$|Bektashism is also initiatic {{and members}} must {{traverse}} various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reality.</b> First level members are called aşıks عاشق. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called nasip) one becomes a mühip محب. After some {{time as a}} mühip, one can take further vows and become a dervish. The next level above dervish is that of baba. The baba (lit. father) {{is considered to be}} the head of a tekke and qualified to give spiritual guidance (irshad إرشاد). Above the baba is the rank of halife-baba (or dede, grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the dedebaba (great-grandfather). The dedebaba was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the dedebaba was the Pir Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of Hajji Bektash Wali in the central Anatolian town of Hacıbektaş (Solucakarahüyük).|$|E
25|$|Leaving aside any {{question}} as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of supernatural events as such, the primary {{doubts about the}} historicity of Juan Diego (and the Guadalupe event itself) arise from the silence of those major sources who {{would be expected to}} have mentioned him, including, in particular, Bishop Juan de Zumárraga and the earliest ecclesiastical historians who reported the spread of the Catholic faith among the Indians in the early decades after the capture of Tenochtítlan in 1521. Despite references in near-contemporary sources which do attest a mid-16th-century Marian cult attached to a miraculous image of the Virgin at a shrine at Tepeyac under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and despite the weight of oral tradition concerning Juan Diego and the apparitions (which, at the most, spans less than four generations before being reduced to writing), the fundamental objection of this silence of core 16th-century sources remains a perplexing feature {{of the history of the}} cult which has, nevertheless, continued to grow outside Mexico and the Americas. The first writer to address this problem of the silence of the sources was Francisco de Florencia in chapter 12 of his book Estrella de el norte de Mexico (see previous section). However, it was not until 1794 that the argument from silence was presented to the public in detail by someone – Juan Bautista Muñoz – who clearly did not believe in the historicity of Juan Diego or of the apparitions. Substantially the same argument was publicized in updated form at the end of the 19th and 20th centuries in reaction to renewed steps taken by the ecclesiastical authorities to defend and promote the cult through the coronation of the Virgin in 1895 and the beatification of Juan Diego in 1990.|$|E
