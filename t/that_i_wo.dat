[...] "I've already confessed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wos</b> made a pirate against my will, and that I've never done no murder--though I have plundered a little, just like the rest. As for helpin' to bring my comrades to justice, I only wish as I know'd how, and I'd do it right off, I would." ...|$|R

[...] "Ye see, lads, I've had more or {{less to do with}} the sea, I have, since ever I comed into this remarkable world--not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever, to my knowledge, knew one less coorous, for I never was up in the stars; no more, I s'pose, was ever any o' you. I was born at sea, d'ye see? I don't 'xactly know how I comed for to be born there, but <b>I</b> <b>wos</b> told <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wos,</b> and if them as told me spoke truth, <b>I</b> s'pose <b>I</b> <b>wos.</b> <b>I</b> was washed overboard in gales three times before I comed for to know myself at all. When I first came alive, so to speak, to my own certain knowledge, <b>I</b> <b>wos</b> a-sitting {{on the top of a}} hen-coop aboard an East Indiaman, roarin' like a mad bull as had lost his senses; 'cause why? the hens wos puttin' their heads through the bars o' the coops, and pickin' at the calves o' my legs as fierce as if they'd suddenly turned cannibals, and rather liked it. From <b>that</b> time <b>I</b> began a life o' misery. My life before that had bin pretty much the same, it seems, but I didn't know it, so it didn't matter. D'ye know, lads, when ye don't know a thing it's all the same as if it didn't exist, an' so, in coorse, it don't matter." ...|$|R

It's o' no manner o' use tryin' {{to shove}} on the wind. If ye've got {{a thing to}} do, do it slow--slow an' sure. If ye haven't got a thing to do, in coorse ye can't do it, but if ye have, don't be in a hurry--I says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>that's</b> {{not what}} <b>I</b> <b>wos</b> goin' to tell ye yet. We comed to a part o' the plains where we wos well-nigh starved for want o' game, an' the Natter-list got so thin that ye could a-most see through him, so I offered {{to kill my}} horse, an' cut it up for meat; but you niver saw sich a face he made. `I'd rather die first,' says he, `than eat it;' so we didn't kill it. But that very day Martin got {{a shot at a}} wild horse and killed it. The Natter-list was down in the bed o' a creek at the time gropin' for creepers, an' he didn't see it.|$|R

But <b>that's</b> not wot <b>I</b> <b>wos</b> goin' to tell ye about him," [...] {{continued}} Joe; [...] "I wos goin' to tell ye how we made him eat horseflesh. He carried a revolver, too, this Natter-list did, to load wi' shot as small as dust a-most, and shoot little birds with. I've seed him miss birds only three feet away with it. An' one day he drew it all of a suddent and let fly at a big bum-bee that wos passin', yellin' out that it wos the finest wot he had iver seed. He missed the bee, of coorse, cause it was a flyin' shot, he said, but he sent the whole charge right into Martin's back--Martin was my comrade's name. By good luck Martin had on a thick leather coat, so the shot niver got the length o' his skin.|$|R

"The Grotto," [...] said Dick, {{speaking}} {{as well as}} he could through an immense mouthful of bacon and bread, [...] "is an institootion which I 'ave reason for to believe desarves well of its country. It is an institootion sitooate in Paddington Street, Marylebone, where homeless child'n, as would otherwise come to the gallows, is took in an' saved--saved not only from sin an' misery themselves, but saved from inflictin' the same on society. I do assure you," [...] said Dick, striking the table with his fist in his enthusiasm, so that the crockery jumped, and some of the children almost choked by reason of their food going down what they styled their [...] "wrong throats"--"I do assure you, that it would 'ave done yer 'art good to 'ave seed 'm, as I did the day I went there, so clean and comf'r'able and 'appy--no mistake about that. Their 'appiness was genooine. Wot made it come 'ome to me was, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> seed there a little boy as I 'appened to know was one o' the dirtiest, wickedest, sharpest little willains in London--a mere spider to look at, but with mischief enough to fill a six-fut man to bu'stin'--an' there 'ee was, clean an' jolly, larnin' his lessons like a good un--an' no sham neither, cos 'e'd got a good spice o' the mischief left, as was pretty clear from the way 'ee gave a sly pinch or pull o' the hair now an' again to the boys next him, an' drawed monkey-faces on his slate.
