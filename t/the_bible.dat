5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E
5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought {{to find the}} existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> could be overcome by demythologising <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.|$|E

5|$|The Confession {{starts with}} the {{doctrine}} of revelation, or how people can know about God. The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature as well as <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> but they also believed that <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> or Scripture, {{is the only way}} in which people attain saving knowledge of God. The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time. Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew vowel points, marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation, of the Old Testament were probably not part of the original. This caused significant debate between Reformed polemicists and Roman Catholics. Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative magisterium to interpret <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of perspicuity, that the essential teachings of <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> could be interpreted by anyone. English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine. The divines had a strong view of the inspiration of <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> and believed that God revealed himself in the propositions found in Scripture. While the issue of biblical inerrancy, the belief that there are no errors in <b>the</b> <b>Bible,</b> did not arise until the eighteenth century, the divines clearly did not believe <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> to contain any errors. Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration, believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the Hebrew text were inspired by God. On the other hand, they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles. They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration.|$|E
