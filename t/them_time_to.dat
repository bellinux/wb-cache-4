5|$|Hurricane Dean's {{smooth and}} well-predicted track gave unusually advance warning {{to all of}} the nations in its path and allowed <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare for the storm's impact. Because of the advance warning and Dean's {{extraordinary}} strength, the nations of Central America and the Caribbean set up hundreds of shelters, readied thousands of disaster recovery experts, evacuated hundreds of thousands of vulnerable residents, and prepared millions of dollars of emergency supplies.|$|E
5|$|After a busy week {{servicing}} Hubble, {{the crew}} of Atlantis had {{the majority of the}} day off, giving <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> rest and prepare for landing. They took their traditional on-orbit crew portrait, and spoke with reporters from around the world in a news conference. The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call routed through satellites. The station crew congratulated them on a very successful mission, and {{the crew of}} Atlantis expressed their gratitude to the station crew for all the work they do during their long duration stays on the station.|$|E
5|$|Allenby {{reviewed}} {{the threat of}} counterattack and his supply situation and decided that a force large enough to attack into the Judean Hills and a separate force to operate on the maritime plain could be maintained far from base. He decided to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Ottoman 7th Army in the Judean Hills {{with the hope of}} capturing Jerusalem. This would keep pressure on this army in the hope of denying <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete their reorganisation, dig deep trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E

5|$|Hoepner now {{pursued the}} {{retreating}} French. Being impatient, {{he did not}} wait for his infantry divisions to catch up. Instead, he hoped to continue pushing the French back and not give <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> construct a coherent defence line. German formations pursued the enemy to Gembloux. The Panzer Corps ran into retreating French columns and inflicted heavy losses on them. The pursuit created severe problems for the French artillery. The combat was so closely fought that the danger of friendly fire incidents were very real. Nevertheless, the French, setting up new anti-tank screens and Hoepner, lacking infantry support, caused the Germans to attack positions head-on. During the following Battle of Gembloux the two Panzer Divisions reported heavy losses during 14 May and were forced to slow their pursuit. The German attempts to capture Gembloux were repulsed.|$|E
5|$|The Scranton branch faces {{off against}} the {{corporate}} branch, commenting {{that they deserve}} to lose for deciding to close down Buffalo. The game is close, and Pam ends up injuring her ankle, although she wants to continue. Seeing an opportunity to remove Scranton's best player from the game, Charles insists that Pam take {{a seat on the}} grounds of her injury being a company liability. Determined to beat corporate, Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X-ray while Dwight stalls the game to give <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get back. When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update, the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant. Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{familiar with}} their new shadows, the party travels to Talta village, befriending Marumaro on the way, who also possesses a magical shadow. Finding that the villagers from Talta have started to head towards {{the capital city of}} Jibral, the party takes off after them. Just outside Jibral, the party finds the villagers attacked by Steel-Eating Tigers. They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces, including Zola. Once the villagers are brought to Jibral, the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola. Together, the party works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene's Mechat base. After the base is destroyed, the party heads north in search of Nene. Nene captures Kluke, and places a collar around her neck which Nene alleges will explode. After reaching Nene, Zola separates from the party to buy <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> attack Nene. When the party attempts to remove Kluke's collar, Nene absorbs the party's shadows by placing collars on all of them. After taking their powers and placing them in himself, he removes their collars and attempts to kill them before they recover. Shu, despite being drained of magical ability, unconsciously teleports the party to the distant Devour village.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought to delay the election by demanding a new biometric registry system, hoping that it would give <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> form a united front against MAS. Many MAS activists reacted violently against the demands, and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition to rescind their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry, but insisted that it was rushed through so as not to delay the election. Morales and the MAS won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote. The MAS won a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Morales notably increased his support in the east of the country, with MAS gaining a majority in Tarija.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} WarioWare series, WarioWare: Smooth Moves is a puzzle game focusing on microgames, which are short games that last for about five seconds. Each microgame requires that the player position the Wii Remote in a specific way, such as holding it vertically, or placing the bottom end of the device against the nose. The player is required to use the Nunchuk attachment for the Wii Remote in certain microgames. Before each microgame begins, the required position for the Wii Remote is shown to the player, to allow <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> position the device. The game is broken up into stages, each represented by a WarioWare character and loosely connected by a story, with the microgames divided among the stages. After the player completes a stage's microgames, they advance to the boss stage, which is a microgame that is longer and {{more complex than the}} others. After the player completes all of the single-player stages, the game unlocks a multiplayer mode, in which only one Wii Remote is used and shared by up to 12 players. While a player plays a microgame in this mode, other players watch, and after the microgame is completed, the player passes the Wii Remote to the next person.|$|E

25|$|German {{intelligence}} {{detected the}} Soviet buildup, allowing <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the forward defenses of the LIII Army Corps {{with large numbers}} of anti-tank weapons, minefields, and hastily dug trenches and dugouts. The German armor was withdrawn rearwards to create an operational reserve, and constructed rear defenses with multiple lines of dugouts and bunkers. The German defenses were based on the Zhizdra and Vytebet Rivers, the network of ravines, and settlements turned into fortified strongpoints.|$|E

Many have judged this belief to be fallacious, since the dictators' demands were not limited and appeasement gave <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> gain greater strength.|$|E
25|$|On 18 November, while Allenby {{was at the}} XXI Corps {{headquarters}} at El Kastine, {{the decision was made}} to closely follow the Ottoman Seventh Army into the Judean Hills.

25|$|In {{its early}} years rock-cracking, hard labour and solitary {{confinement}} were the notable features of life at the prison. It was seen that hard worked prisoners would not wish {{to return to the}} prison, with solitary confinement giving <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reflect on past misdeeds. From inception prisoners main task was the breaking of one cubic yard of rock per day. Until the middle of the 20th century the prisons department's philosophy remained punitive with much reliance on obedience to rules and regulations.|$|E

25|$|The Eighth Army counter-attack, Operation Aberdeen, was poorly co-ordinated and {{defeated}} in detail; many tanks were lost and the Axis {{were able to}} regain the initiative.

Rommel exploited the success by pursuing the British into Egypt, denying <b>them</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover from the defeat. As both sides neared exhaustion, the Eighth Army managed to check the Axis advance at the First Battle of El Alamein.|$|E
