5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{settled the}} issue of Chinese immigration, passing the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. Arthur {{initially}} vetoed a similar measure, which he believed contradicted the United States' treaty with China, but eventually signed a later compromise bill, which banned immigration from China for ten years. Tariffs, {{a major issue in}} the campaign, remained largely unchanged in the four years that followed, although Congress did pass a minor revision <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> them by an average of less than 2 percent. After a half-hearted attempt at the nomination in 1884, Arthur retired and died two years later.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{was not as}} {{enthusiastic}} about a customs union as Blaine and Harrison were, but tariff reciprocity provisions were ultimately included in the McKinley Tariff <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> duties on some inter-American trade. Otherwise, the conference achieved none of Blaine’s goals in the short-term, but did lead to further communication and what would eventually become the Organization of American States.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> genetic diversity below what would be expected given {{the age of the}} species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals. However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed, and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, HP {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>Reduced</b> Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures {{were approaching}} a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel.|$|E

5|$|Inexpensive {{hydropower}} {{supported the}} location of a large aluminum industry in the region, because its reduction from bauxite requires large amounts of electricity. Until 2000, the Northwestern United States produced up to 17percent of the world's aluminum and 40percent of the aluminum produced in the United States. The commoditization of power in the early 21st century, coupled with drought <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> the generation capacity of the river, damaged the industry and by 2001, Columbia River aluminum producers had idled 80percent of its production capacity. By 2003, the entire United States produced only 15percent of the world's aluminum, and many smelters along the Columbia had gone dormant or out of business.|$|E
5|$|Myers had {{mechanical}} {{understanding and}} improved many devices. One was a patented invention of a kerosene lamp damper <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> considerably the flame's smoke. Another innovation, {{of which he}} was proud, was an automatic self-recording mercury barometer that memorialized its measurements on a paper strip; with this meteorological instrument he kept a continuous barometric record that covered a span of 30 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Minton {{became a}} local {{commander of the}} American Legion. The group had a large and active membership in the state at the time, and he used his position to encourage support of Democratic Party agenda. Paul McNutt was the national commander, {{and the two men}} became political allies. When McNutt became governor in 1930, he offered Minton a position {{at the head of a}} new utility regulation commission. As commissioner, Minton successfully imposed regulations <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> state telephone bills by a combined total of $525,000. The cuts received widespread media coverage, and Minton was credited in the reports with the success.|$|E

The following year, the stadium underwent a remodelling <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> the capacity to around 115,000.|$|E
5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led {{to rapid}} {{depopulation}} {{in many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{scheme was}} introduced, {{using a combination}} of automatic signalling and modifications to the layout at Liverpool Street. The station introduced coaling, watering, and other maintenance facilities directly at the station, as well as separate engine bays and a modified track and station layout <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> turnaround times and increased productivity. Services began on 2 July 1920 with trains to Chingford and Enfield running every 10 minutes. The cost of the modifications was £80,000 compared to an estimated £3million for electrification. The service was officially called the Intensive Service (as it allowed a 50% increase in capacity on peak services), but became popularly known as the Jazz Service. It lasted until the General Strike of 1926, following which services generally declined.|$|E

5|$|Braham's {{return to}} Britain {{was not a}} welcome one. His family found him {{exceptionally}} difficult to live with. His short temper and aggressiveness manifested themselves when journalists came to the family's home in Leicestershire searching for a war-story to print. Braham, who despised publicity, physically ejected them from his property. His decision to shut the media {{out of his life}} likely explains why, even {{as one of the most}} successful aces, he was virtually unknown in Britain outside the RAF. Braham had also become despondent about the political climate in a country <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> Winston Churchill to Leader of the Opposition, where the black market was rife and rationing was set to become an indefinite feature of post-war Britain into the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|By 1830, {{because of}} {{difficult}} economic conditions in Britain <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> {{the demand for}} fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning Georg Scharf to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche's watercolour painting, Duria Antiquior, portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to her. It became the first such scene from what later became known as deep time to be widely circulated. In December 1830 she finally made another major find, a skeleton of {{a new type of}} plesiosaur, which sold for £200.|$|E
5|$|Fortifications such as this, and the star-shaped fortresses more {{commonly}} found in the flatter lands of the Dutch Provinces, increasingly made 16th-century warfare both difficult and expensive; victory {{was not simply a}} matter of winning a battle over the enemy's army. Victory required traveling from one fortified and armed city to another and investing time and money in one of two outcomes. Ideally, a show of extraordinary force convinced city leaders to surrender. If the show of force did not intimidate a city, the alternative was an expensive siege <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> the city to rubble and ended with storming the ruins. In the case of the former, when a city capitulated, it would have to quarter troops at its own expense, called execution, but the soldiers would not be permitted to plunder. In the case of the latter, no quarter would be given to the defenders and the victorious soldiers were released to pillage, plunder, and sack.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that some life forms are {{more capable of}} suffering, and non-violence to him meant not having the intent as well as active efforts to minimise hurt, injury or suffering to all life forms. Gandhi explored food sources <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> violence to various life forms in the food chain. He {{believed that}} slaughtering animals is unnecessary, as other sources of foods are available. He also consulted with vegetarianism campaigners during his lifetime, such as with Henry Stephens Salt. Food to Gandhi {{was not only a}} source of sustaining one's body, but a source of his impact on other living beings, and one that affected his mind, character and spiritual well being. He avoided not only meat, but also eggs and milk. Gandhi wrote the book The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism and wrote for the London Vegetarian Society's publication.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> the phosphate rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members).

During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill <b>that</b> <b>reduced</b> {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a vote on a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E
