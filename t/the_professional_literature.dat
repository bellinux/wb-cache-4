2500|$|Application of {{recovery}} models to psychiatric disorders is comparatively recent. The concept {{of recovery}} {{can be traced}} back as far as 1840, when John Perceval, son of one of Britain's prime ministers, wrote of his personal recovery from the psychosis that he experienced from 1830 until 1832, a recovery that he obtained despite the [...] "treatment" [...] he received from the [...] "lunatic" [...] doctors who attended him. But by consensus the main impetus for the development came from the within the consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement, a grassroots self-help and advocacy initiative, particularly within the United States during the late 1980s and early 1990s. <b>The</b> <b>professional</b> <b>literature,</b> starting with the psychiatric rehabilitation movement in particular, began to incorporate the concept from the early 1990s in the United States, followed by New Zealand and more recently across nearly all countries within the [...] "First World". Similar approaches developed around the same time, without necessarily using the term recovery, in Italy, the Netherlands and the UK.|$|E

This work examined the evolution controversy in <b>the</b> <b>professional</b> educational <b>literature</b> and discussed the controversy in terms of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions. An exhaustive search was made of <b>the</b> <b>professional</b> educational <b>literature</b> published between 1900 and 1981. The literature was then reviewed to determine the types of journals which had published articles about the teaching of evolution and the themes which had been present over time. It was found that the discussion of the teaching of evolution was not confined to <b>the</b> <b>professional</b> education <b>literature</b> but was also found in science, religious, and general interest publications; however, science education journals did play a prominent role. It was found that major themes of the literature were regulatory actions, the history of the controversy, and general and specific suggestions about how to teach evolution. Books about the evolution controversy were also reviewed. The work is divided into chapters by time periods, 1900 - 1927, 1928 - 1959, 1960 - 1969, and 1970 - 1981. Each chapter contains a discussion of the background to the evolution controversy during that time period. The evolution controversy is discussed in terms of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn proposed that information is dealt with in the scientific community in ways that are different from other disciplines. It was found that while there are similarities, substantial differences exist between the way the evolution controversy has progressed in <b>the</b> <b>professional</b> educational <b>literature</b> and <b>the</b> way Kuhn believes that information is handled in the scientific community. This study shows that once an idea has won acceptance in the scientific community, it must undergo a second testing to gain acceptance by the general public. Based on this study, it appears that the more a scientific idea conflicts with the fundamental values of individuals and groups within the society, the greater the chance of conflict. The study also shows that the criteria and mechanisms for acceptance of new ideas in the larger society are different from the criteria and mechanisms for acceptance in the scientific community...|$|R

A higher level of awareness and appreciation among economists of these concepts might serve the beneficial purpose of downgrading the perceived significance of Pareto efficiency as an operational criterion of economic performance.
