5|$|The B-1A mockup review {{occurred}} in late October 1971. The first B-1A prototype (Air Force serial no. 74-0158) flew on 23 December 1974. Three more B-1A prototypes followed. As the program continued the per-unit cost continued <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> {{part because of}} high inflation during that period. In 1970, the estimated unit cost was $40 million, and by 1975, this figure had climbed to $70 million.|$|E
5|$|After being {{signed by}} WWE, the {{brothers}} worked as enhancement talents, before gaining notoriety in the tag team division, {{partly due to}} their participation in Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches. With the addition of Lita, the team became known as Team Xtreme and continued <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> popularity. As a tag team wrestler, Hardy is an 11-time world tag team champion (six World Tag Team Championships, one WCW Tag Team Championship, one Raw Tag Team Championship, two TNA World Tag Team Championships, and one ROH World Tag Team Championship) â€“ all with his brother Matt. On the independent circuit, Jeff was also one-half of the OMEGA Tag Team Champions with Matt in their second reign and one-half of the Crash Tag Team Champions with Matt in their first reign.|$|E

5|$|Along its path, Japhet dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused widespread river flooding. The rains occurred after an extended drought, although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage, notably around where the storm moved ashore. In two provinces in Mozambique, the cyclone {{damaged or destroyed}} 25,000houses, leaving at least 23,000people homeless. Flooding in Zambia caused rivers <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> Mozambique several days after the storm's passage. There were 17deaths in Mozambique. Further inland, remnant rainfall destroyed a bridge and several houses in Zimbabwe, killing eight people.|$|E
5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|D {{departs from}} {{traditional}} wargaming and assigns each player a specific character to play {{instead of a}} military formation. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master serves as the game's referee and storyteller while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and {{playing the role of}} the inhabitants. The characters form a party that interacts with the setting's inhabitants, and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process the characters earn experience points in order <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions.|$|E

5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Arlington's largest {{employers}} remained its shingle mills and saw mills. Other industries, including dairy processing, mechanical shops, stores, and factories, became prominent after World War I, {{during a period}} of growth for the city. The Great Depression of the 1930s forced {{all but one of the}} mills to close, causing unemployment <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> Arlington and neighboring cities. The federal government established a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp near Darrington to create temporary jobs; the young men built structures and conducted firefighting in the Mount Baker National Forest. The Works Progress Administration and Civil Works Administration funded the construction of the city's sidewalks, a high school, and a municipal airport that opened in 1934.|$|E

5|$|Mountains {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the Sevier orogenic belt to {{the west}} during the Cretaceous while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the Gulf of Mexico helped {{the southern end of}} the basin to subside, which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways ever, called the Western Interior Seaway, drowned much of western North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of Cedar City, Utah while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, stable platform ramp in Nebraska and Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Nabis had {{appointed}} his brother-in-law, the Argive Pythagoras, {{as commander}} of his garrison of 15,000 men in Argos. As the Romans and the Achaean League were advancing towards the city, a young Argive named Damocles attempted {{to stir up}} a revolution against the Spartan garrison. With a few followers, {{he stood in the}} city's agora and shouted to his fellow Argives, exhorting them <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> revolt. However, no mass uprising materialized and Damocles and most of his followers were surrounded and killed by the Spartan garrison.|$|E
5|$|The Conservatives {{began the}} {{campaign}} period with a policy-per-day strategy, {{contrary to the}} Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, began <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b> <b>In</b> response, the Liberals launched negative ads targeting Harper, similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient to erode the Conservative's advantage, although they did manage to close {{what had been a}} ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper's personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but a better choice for prime minister than Martin.|$|E

5|$|The fall of Enna {{reduced the}} Byzantines {{to the eastern}} coastal strip between Syracuse and Taormina, and forced the emperor to send a large army and a fleet of {{reportedly}} 300 ships, under Constantine Kontomytes, which arrived at Syracuse in autumn 859. Soon after, the Byzantine navy was defeated a major battle with the Muslims, in which the Byzantines lost {{a third of their}} fleet. Nevertheless, the arrival of a large Byzantine army induced several settlements, which had previously submitted to the Muslims, <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> revolt. Abbas soon suppressed these uprisings, and marched against Kontomytes. The two armies met near CefalÃ¹, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were heavily defeated and retired to Syracuse, while Abbas strengthened his position by refortifying and colonizing Enna.|$|E
5|$|William Hale Thompson was the Mayor of Chicago {{during the}} riot and {{a game of}} brinksmanship with Illinois Governor Frank Lowden may have {{exacerbated}} the riot since Thompson refused to ask Lowden to send in the National Guard for four days, despite Lowden ensuring that the guardsmen were in Chicago and ready to intervene. Although future mayor Richard J. Daley never officially acknowledged {{being part of the}} violence, at age 17 he was {{an active member of the}} Irish Hamburg Athletic Club, which a post-riot investigation named as instigators in attacks on black Americans.

5|$|Between October 1992 and March 1993, Sargsyan {{served as}} the Presidential Adviser on Defence Affairs and the Presidential Envoy to Border Regions of Armenia. Subsequently, he was {{appointed}} the State Minister on Defence, Security and Internal Affairs. In these positions, Sargsyan had {{a major role in}} the advance of the Armenian army. With other key commanders, he regulated the operations to the Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. He was particularly active in unifying the various semi-independent detachments active in the war zone. Political chaos in Azerbaijan and the demoralization of the Azerbaijani army resulted in the Armenian forces taking control over the territories outside of the original Soviet-drawn borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1993, Sargsyan founded and led Yerkrapah, a union of 5,000 war veterans, that had a great influence in Armenia's domestic politics in the post-war years and became the main base for Vazgen Sargsyan <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> power.|$|E

5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism â€“ {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently â€“ which began <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies â€“ such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos â€“ for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that protects against Creutzfeldtâ€“Jakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E
5|$|In 1337 Phillip confiscated Aquitaine and Ponthieu from Edward alleging he was {{harbouring}} Phillipâ€™s fugitive {{cousin and}} enemy, Robert of Artois. In response, Edward proclaimed himself king of France {{to encourage the}} Flemish <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> open rebellion against the French king. The conflict, later known as the Hundred Years' War, included a significant English naval victory at the Battle of Sluys, and a victory on land at CrÃ©cy, leaving Edward free to capture the important port of Calais. A subsequent victory against Scotland at the Battle of Neville's Cross resulted in the capture of David II and reduced the threat from Scotland. The Black Death brought a halt to Edward's campaigns by killing perhaps {{a third of his}} subjects. The only Plantagenet known to have died from the Black Death was Edward III's daughter Joan in Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and {{widespread}} poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialization, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>in</b> the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see 1981 Brixton riot, 1981 Toxteth riots). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in the economic depression that hit the country before the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|E
