50|$|Active Steering System realizes {{handling}} {{with more}} linear response by adaptively controlling front wheel <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> according to steering input and vehicle speed. At slower vehicle speeds the system improves response by shifting to a quicker steering gear ratio, while at higher speeds it substantially improves stability by {{moving to a}} slower gear ratio.

40|$|AbstractA {{comparison}} {{of the results of}} a computational simulation and an experimental measurement indicates a good agreement between them: the bowed blade lowers the energy loss coefficient of engine by 11 % in the simulation and by 13 % in the measurement. To further discuss the application conditions of bowed blade in compressor, with incidence equal to zero and other boundary conditions unchanged, a computational investigations on four series of linear stators with different aerofoil <b>turning</b> <b>angles</b> are achieved. It is found that the bowed blade has much positive effect in high airfoil <b>turning</b> <b>angle</b> cascade, for example, the optimal retrofit of 30 ° bow angle highly reduces the energy loss coefficient by 17. 9 %, when the aerofoil <b>turning</b> <b>angle</b> is 59. 5 °. But the optimal retrofit of 15 ° has only 0. 7 % reduction when the aerofoil <b>turning</b> <b>angle</b> is 39. 5 °, or even the compressor performance will get worse with the bow angle gradually increasing. Consequently, it is verified that the <b>turning</b> <b>angle</b> is one of the important factors to decide whether to apply the bowed blade into compressor at low Mach number...|$|R

40|$|T cells {{navigate}} complex microenvironments {{to initiate}} and modulate antigen-specific immune responses. While recent intravital microscopy {{study revealed that}} migration of T cells were guided by various tissue microstructures containing unique nanoscale topographical structures, the effects of complex nanotopographical structures on the migration of T cells have not been systematically studied. In this study, we fabricated surfaces containing nanoscale zigzag structures with various side lengths and <b>turning</b> <b>angles</b> using UV-assisted capillary force lithography and motility of T cells on zigzag patterned surfaces was studied. Motility of T cells was mostly affected by the <b>turning</b> <b>angle,</b> not by the side length, of the zigzag structures. In particular, motility behaviors of T cells near interfaces formed by turning points of zigzag patterns were significantly affected by <b>turning</b> <b>angles.</b> For obtuse <b>turning</b> <b>angles,</b> most of the T cells smoothly crossed the interfaces, but as the <b>turning</b> <b>angle</b> decreased, a substantial fraction of the T cells migrated along the interfaces. When the formation of lamellipodia, thin sheet-like structures typically generated at the leading edges of migrating cells by actin polymerization-driven membrane protrusion, was inhibited by an Arp 2 / 3 inhibitor CK- 636, a substantial fraction of T cells on those surfaces containing zigzag patterns with an acute <b>turning</b> <b>angle</b> were trapped at the interfaces formed by the turning points of the zigzag patterns. This result suggests that thin, wide lamellipodia at the leading edges of T cells play critical roles in motilit...|$|R

The tractor turns tighter and faster so it spends less time turning and more time working. The SuperSteer front axle also increases the wheelbase, {{with the weight of}} the front ballast resting directly on the front axle beam.

50|$|Helimagnetism is an incommensurate form of {{magnetic}} ordering {{that results from}} the competition between Ferromagnetic and Antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, and is typically only observed at liquid helium temperatures. Spins of neighbouring magnetic moments arrange themselves in a spiral or helical pattern, with a characteristic <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> of somewhere between 0 and 180 degrees. It is possible to view Ferromagnetism and Antiferromagnetism as Helimagnetic structures with characteristic turn angles of 0 and 180 degrees respectively. Helimagnetic order breaks spatial inversion symmetry, {{as it can be}} either left-handed or right-handed in nature.|$|E
50|$|Although the M-cell {{is often}} {{considered}} {{the prototype of}} a command neuron in vertebrates, this designation may not be fully warranted. Although electrical stimulation of the M-cell is sufficient for eliciting a C-start, this C-start is normally weaker than the one evoked by a sensory stimulus. Moreover, the C-start can be evoked even with the M-cell ablated, although {{in this case the}} latency of the response increases. The most widely accepted model of the M-cell system, or brainstem escape network, is that the M-cell initiates a fixed action pattern to the left or right by activating a spinal motor circuit initially described by J. Diamond and colleagues, but the precise trajectory of the escape is encoded by population activity in the other classes of reticulospinal neurons functioning in parallel to the M-cell. This notion is supported by studies using in vivo calcium imaging in larval zebrafish which show that MiD2cm and MiD3cm are activated along with the M-cell when an offending stimulus is directed towards the head but not the tail, and are correlated with C-starts of a larger initial <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E

50|$|With his {{feud with}} Jarrett behind him, Angle aligned himself with Sting to feud {{with the rest}} of Immortal, {{including}} the group's newest member, TNA World Heavyweight Champion Mr. Anderson. On the July 14 episode of Impact Wrestling, Angle helped Sting regain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Anderson. On August 7 at Hardcore Justice, Angle defeated Sting, after hitting him with a chair he snatched away from Hulk Hogan, to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the record-breaking fifth time, thus turning heel. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Angle explained that he did not agree with Sting, who, using the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, wanted to hand the promotion back to Dixie Carter, as he had found out that she had lied to him about not knowing of the relationship between Karen and Jeff Jarrett. When Sting confronted Angle, he was attacked by Hogan, which led to Angle revealing that Hogan had been the one who had exposed Carter's lie to him. Angle also revealed that his goal was now to ruin Carter's youth movement in TNA by eliminating the younger wrestlers one-by-one and started by attacking Bound for Glory Series leader Crimson after the main event, cementing his heel <b>turn.</b> <b>Angle</b> made his first televised title defense on the September 1 episode of Impact Wrestling, defeating Sting in a rematch, following interference from special enforcer Hulk Hogan and the rest of Immortal. The following week, Angle's title match with Mr. Anderson ended in a disqualification, following interference from Immortal, which led to a three-way match between Angle, Anderson and Sting on September 11 at No Surrender, where Angle managed to retain the title, following interference from Hogan. On October 16 at Bound for Glory, Angle successfully defended the title against Bobby Roode. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Angle lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Roode's tag team partner, James Storm.|$|E
40|$|The {{impulsive}} {{transfer of}} minimum characteristic velocity between two given hyperbolic asymptotes {{associated with a}} real planet is considered. The constraint of remaining above {{the surface of the}} planet introduces a maximum natural <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b> This divides the problem naively into two categories.

The resulting optimal transfers are of five basic types. In boundary conditions space, by far the largest area of transfers are either single impulse transfers or transfers through the parabolic level requiring two finite impulses. In no case has an optimal transfer been found which uses more than two finite impulses and three infinitesimal impulses.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{design and}} {{analysis}} of omnidirectional single feed circularly polarized, wide axial ratio beamwidth resonant side-fed bifilar helix antennas {{that do not require}} a ground plane is presented. The simulation and measurement results show that side-fed helix antennas of various radii gives near perfect circular polarization (CP) almost over the whole sphere except at and around nulls, at a certain <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> by properly proportioning the area of loop (A) with the product of pitch (ρ) and radianlength (l) of helix. Helix antennas with smaller radii give axial ratio (AR) close to one at higher values of <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> with lower value of resonant input impedances but CP is less sensitive to inaccuracy in <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b> However helix antennas with larger radii results in AR close to one at lower values of <b>turn</b> <b>angle</b> and provides better values of input resistance but its AR is more sensitive to variations in <b>turn</b> <b>angle.</b> The simulated results show that the polarization solid angle beamwidth (for AR ≤ 3 dB) varies from 3. 96 pi to 4 pi steradian. The gain and 3 dB beamwidth of the antennas are 2 dBi and 90 ◦ respectively. The polarization bandwidth varies from 34 % to 65 %. The simulated results are verified by experimental measurements. 1...|$|E
