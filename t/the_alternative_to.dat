Rick sports his full sheriff's wardrobe in the reshoot, whereas in the original version he is wearing the white undershirt he was wearing in the Season 1 finale.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public {{criminal}} prosecution {{have changed the}} criminal laws. Contrary to the traditional way of settling the disputes which puts emphasis on analyzing the committed crimes, the most significant factor in <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public prosecution is the conditions, in which the crime happens. The present research seeks to evaluate the problems and challenges {{in the way of}} developing and increasing <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{criminal prosecution}} by taking the England’s laws into consideration. <b>The</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecution are an intermediate approach that are substituted for criminal prosecution and filing the criminal record away unconditionally. In this way, the aim of the punishments is achieved without imposing <b>the</b> punishment. <b>The</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecutions are based on the ideological, criminological and practical principles. There are many similar cases of imposing <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecutions on the defendants in Islamic teachings. But <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecutions have not properly developed in Iran. Their development faces with many theoretical and practical challenges. According the investigations, we can define the theoretical challenges faced with <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecutions as the series of the factors and reasons that impede the development of this idea and runs it into the problem. In other words, lack of intention and will <b>to</b> apply these <b>alternatives...</b>|$|R

5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when tourist traffic adds to the congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become bottlenecks at such times. <b>The</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> the bypass is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues. Despite being a shorter and a more direct route, those avenues are much more congested than the bypass at rush hours and they contain at-grade intersections and traffic lights at some of their junctions.|$|E

The mission's designers determined that, despite the fact that solar power is only 4% as intense at Jupiter as it is in Earth's orbit, solar was both cheaper than plutonium and practical to use on the spacecraft. Despite the increased weight of solar panels compared to plutonium-powered generators, the vehicle's mass had been projected to still be within acceptable launch limits.|$|E

25|$|According to King, LaRouche's {{associates}} had {{for some}} years {{been in contact with}} members of the Reagan administration about LaRouche's space-based weapons ideas. LaRouche proposed the development of defensive beam technologies as a policy that was in the interest of both the US and the USSR, as <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> an arms race in offensive weapons, and as a generator of spin-off economic benefits. Between February 1982 and February 1983, with the approval of the National Security Council, LaRouche met with Soviet embassy representative Evgeny Shershnev to discuss the proposal. During this period, Soviet economists also began to study LaRouche's economic forecasting model. However, following Reagan's public announcement of the SDI in March 1983, Soviet representatives broke off all contact with LaRouche and his representatives.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, the Clan Line and the Union-Castle Line, the two {{shipping}} lines {{controlled by}} the Cayzers, joined with the King Line and Bullard King & Co to form British & Commonwealth Shipping. During that time, the War Office invited new tenders for trooping flight contracts to Europe and the Far East, {{as a consequence of}} the Government's growing dissatisfaction with the operational performance and high costs of the ageing Hermes fleet that was contracted from Airwork, Britavia and Skyways to operate most of these flights. The War Office specified exclusive use of state-of-the-art Bristol Britannia turboprops on the Far Eastern route as it had calculated that this would save the Government £1.75m each year compared with continuing use of the Hermes. The War Office offered the successful bidder the option of purchasing three new Britannias from the Government as part of a five-year contract or <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> lease these planes under a three-year contract. The contracts were to become effective from 1958. Hunting-Clan, which already had two Britannias on order, won against competition from Air Charter and Airwork.|$|E
