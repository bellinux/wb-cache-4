5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> women, while the production of income depended on <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E
5|$|The volume {{continues}} briefly {{through the}} postwar period, where harsh experiences persisted even after slavery ended. For example, Black Codes apprenticeship laws were {{a means for}} former slaveowners to own <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> the formerly enslaved children. Other topics covered in the book include gradual abolition, parental teachings, pregnancy, {{and the importance of}} the family.|$|E
5|$|Workshops {{located in}} the commanderies made silks and {{embroidered}} fabrics, silver and gold luxury items, and weapons. One workshop, in modern Anhui province, had a shipyard where battle ships were built. Although the government used <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> state-owned slaves, corvée laborers, and convicts in its workshops, they also hired skilled craftsmen who were well-paid.|$|E

5|$|Two sanctified, stone-covered springs nearby feed {{a stream}} that is {{believed}} to hold powers of purification and flows through the buffer zone surrounding the royal city. Their water was used to form the sacred lake of Amparihy, artificially created by at least the 18th century to provide water to fill two ceremonial pools constructed within the Ambohimanga compound. Oral history attributes {{the creation of the}} lake to Andrianampoinimerina. He reportedly engaged <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> surrounding villagers to dig the lake {{at the site of the}} spring-fed swamp at the base of the hill. Before initially filling the lake with water carried in baked earthen jars from the sacred sites of Alasora, Antsahatsiroa and Anosibe, the lake's creation was sanctified by sacrificing zebu at the site; Andrianampoinimerina is also said to have thrown pearls and silver rings into the lake to inaugurate it.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E
5|$|Slaves (nuli 奴隸) {{comprised}} roughly 1% of the population, {{a proportion}} {{far less than}} the contemporary Greco-Roman world which relied on <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> a large slave population. Slaves were classified into two categories: those who were privately owned, and those who were owned by the state. Privately owned slaves were often former peasants who fell into debt and sold themselves into slavery, while others were former government slaves bestowed to nobles and high officials as rewards for their services. State-owned slaves were sometimes prisoners of war (yet not all were made slaves). However, most slaves were tributary gifts given to the court by foreign states, families of criminals who committed treason against the state, and former private slaves who were either donated to authorities (since this would exempt the former slaveholder from labor obligations) or confiscated by the state if their master had broken a law. In both Western and Eastern Han, arrested criminals became convicts and it was only during the reign of Wang Mang that counterfeiting criminals were made into slaves.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Columbus's first voyage {{touched off a}} series of westward explorations by European {{seafaring}} states.

25|$|In the {{following}} decades, Goldsborough's growth continued {{in part by}} new railroad connections to Charlotte and Beaufort. By 1861, the town's population {{was estimated to be}} 1,500.

By this time, it had been developed as large cotton plantations dependent on <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> enslaved African Americans, as the invention of the cotton gin had enabled profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton in the upcounties.|$|E

25|$|The third type of knowledge, {{innovative}} knowledge, is <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> genius, such as {{the work}} of Leonardo da Vinci—who, in the late 15th century, conceptualized cutting-edge ideas like the aeroplane, the parachute, cranes, submarines, tanks, water pumps, canals, and drills.

25|$|The Confederate States of America (CSA or C.S.), {{commonly}} referred to as the Confederacy, was an unrecognized country in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865. The Confederacy was originally formed by seven secessionist slave-holding states – South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas – in the Lower South region of the United States whose regional economy was mostly dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a plantation system that relied upon <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> African-American slaves.|$|E
25|$|Men {{came into}} direct contact {{not only with}} Wapishana from other villages but also with Indians of other groups, and later, with non-Indians from the act of bartering.

Married daughters usually build their house close to their maternal house. They raise their children alongside their own mother, sharing food and labor.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln, the Republican, {{won with}} a {{plurality}} of popular votes {{and a majority of}} electoral votes. Lincoln, however, did not appear on the ballots of ten southern slave states. Many slave owners in the South feared that the real intent of the Republicans was the abolition of slavery in states where it already existed, and that the sudden emancipation of four million slaves would be problematic for the slave owners and for the economy that drew its greatest profits from <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> people who were not paid.|$|E
25|$|To give a {{concrete}} example of this, a worker making shoes in a shoe factory {{is not only}} producing shoes, but potential exchange-value. The shoes are commodities that can be sold for cash. In this way, the value of <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>of</b> the worker is the exchange-value of the shoes he or she produces minus his or her compensation. At the same time, however, the shoes produced have certain social or cultural values as well. In this way, the worker’s labor is mediating between the economic or exchange-value of the shoes, and their social or cultural, or symbolic value.|$|E
