2500|$|The Russian {{government}} awarded Youzhny {{the title}} Honoured Master of Sports in 2003 for {{his participation in}} Russia's Davis Cup victory the previous year. Youzhny began studying for a degree in philosophy at the University of Moscow in 2005, specializing in the philosophy and attitudes of tennis. He obtained his PhD in December 2010. His thesis was entitled [...] "Professional Tennis Players on the Court" [...] and [...] "was about other players and how they compared up against one another". When asked about his thesis, he said [...] "I wrote it slowly when I had the time...You find out about other players and try to compare <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You {{look at what you}} have to do against them or what changes they may make before their matches or during your match with them." [...] Youzhny married Yulia on 22 November 2008 in Moscow; the couple have two sons, Maxim born 4 December 2009 and Igor born 4 July 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The young priestess enters, {{concerned}} at how pale Norma looks. Norma makes her swear {{to do everything}} she asks and, upon her agreement, tells her that she is entrusting the two children to her care and states {{that they should be}} taken to the Roman camp to their father Pollione, a man whom she hopes will make a better mate for Adalgisa than he was for her. [...] Adalgisa is aghast. Norma: [...] "I beg you for his children's sake." [...] (Duet, first Norma: Deh! con te, con te li prendi, Li sostieni, li difendi / [...] "Please, take <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> support them and protect them; I don't ask you for honour or power, let that be kept for your own children.") Adalgisa tells her that she'll never leave Gaul and only agreed to the request in order to do what was good for Norma. (Duet, Adalgisa: Vado al campo, ed all'ingrato Tutti io reco i tuoi lamenti.) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma's grief but her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: Mira, o Norma / [...] "O Norma, look at your dear children of yours on your knees. Be moved by pity for them, even if you have no pity for yourself.") They sing together, each expressing her own thoughts and feelings until Norma realises that Adalgisa will give up Pollione and remain with her: (Cabaletta: Duet, Norma and Adalgisa: Si fino all'ore estreme, compagna tua m'avrai / [...] "Yes, you will have me as your friend until your last hour; the world is large enough to be a shelter to both of us together.") ...|$|E

6000|$|CZAR. A Nihilist! If <b>you</b> have sown <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> shall reap <b>with</b> <b>them!</b> If <b>you</b> {{have talked}} <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> shall rot <b>with</b> <b>them!</b> If <b>you</b> have lived <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>you</b> shall die! ...|$|R
6000|$|V:3:66 [...] ALAR. [...] Go--kiss them. [...] Thou canst {{not take}} <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>thee.</b> To thy chamber-- [...] Quick to thy chamber.|$|R
5000|$|<b>You</b> dont treat <b>them</b> <b>with</b> contempt, <b>you</b> treat <b>them</b> <b>with</b> respect - and I didnt {{see that}} from the Aussies ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{she would}} have said, [...] "I'll trouble you to leave this garden {{as quickly as you}} entered it and take <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I'm not that sort of girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|P. S. If Southey {{should send}} {{a couple of}} bottles, one of the red sulphate, {{and one of the}} {{compound}} acids for me, will you be so good as to bring <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Fred. Meet me {{within this}} half hour, at our monastery; and if, {{in the mean}} time, {{you can pick up}} a dozen of good fellows, who dare venture their lives bravely, bring <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{have not}} seen the John Bull or any of the Sunday papers except The Spectator. If you have any of <b>them,</b> bring <b>'em</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> on Tuesday. I am afraid that for [...] "dirty Cummins'" [...] allusion to Hogarth I shall be reduced to the {{necessity}} of being valorous the next time I meet him.|$|R
60|$|Cand. My crimes both {{great and}} many needs must shew, Since heaven will punish <b>them</b> <b>with</b> losing <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|CHAR. But did <b>you</b> not, <b>with</b> your vain life, hinder {{all that}} you by words used by way of persuasion to bring <b>them</b> away <b>with</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of the circulars are to go there, {{and also}} back to Hopeville. Supposing you take <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> now, and start out distributing them from your home, instead of coming here? It will save time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'"Martin, there's your instruments. I won't {{trouble you}} to take <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> because they're heavy and you're not going {{straight}} home, but I'll bring them to you day after to-morrow, when I shall be goin' your way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} them, Bertha, to lay for three. I {{thought that it}} would be pleasanter for you to have Anna with you at meals, as I suppose she has taken <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> since you were carried off." ...|$|E
60|$|Be yours the pay: be theirs the praise: We {{will not}} rob {{them of their}} due, Nor vex the ghosts of other days By naming <b>them</b> along <b>with</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Miriam, [...] "if <b>you</b> treat <b>them</b> <b>with</b> reverence <b>you</b> don't do {{them any}} harm. It {{is the spirit}} you pluck them in that matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go and fetch him, Giuseppi; {{and if you}} {{can find}} one or two old {{fishermen}} of Chioggia, bring <b>them</b> also <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> I want to gain as much information as possible regarding the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{have them}} all packed up,--as small as you can; never mind about wool and cases and all that. Have them close to your hand {{so that if you}} have to move you can take <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Do you understand?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I am {{with you}} heart and soul. As you {{go by the}} 10:30 train, you will {{not have time to}} read them, but I shall get the bundle of papers. You can take <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and read them in the train." ...|$|E
60|$|I shall {{of course}} observe the strictest silence, at present, in {{reference}} to your resolutions. It will be a most acceptable occupation to me to go over <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and I have not a doubt of their producing a strong effect out of doors.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Humph! {{the folly}} of girl is unfathomable! Oh! you may say what you like--you who have thrown {{yourself}} into your daughters and kept <b>them</b> one <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You little know in your innocence {{the product of an}} ill- managed boarding-school!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Nye {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} [...] "soft power" [...] in the late 1980s. For Nye, power {{is the ability to}} influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want. There are several ways one can achieve this: <b>you</b> can coerce <b>them</b> <b>with</b> threats; <b>you</b> can induce <b>them</b> <b>with</b> payments; or <b>you</b> can attract and co-opt them to want what you want. This soft power - getting others to want the outcomes you want - co-opts people rather than coerces them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, I thought I heard <b>them</b> giggling <b>with</b> <b>you</b> down there. What did {{you call}} me? Royal Son of the Sun? That is Pharaoh's name! Have the stars shown you----?" [...] {{and he looked at}} him eagerly.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{few days}} ago, Mr. Jarvis," [...] he said slowly, [...] "Mr. Weatherley placed certain {{documents}} in that safe {{and gave me}} the key. My instructions from him were to open and examine <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> if he should be, for any unexplained cause, absent from business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{read the}} bills anyway, Mr. Flint, and I'll {{come and go}} over <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You can't fail to see my arguments, and all I ask is that you throw the weight of your {{organization}} at the State capital for them when they come up." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bertram nodded assent. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, with grave gentleness. [...] "You {{may bring}} <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> And {{as soon as}} you like, too. Remember, dearest, every night you pass under that creature's roof, you commit the vilest crime a woman can commit against her own purity." ...|$|E
60|$|CUTHBERTSON. Besides, if {{you don't}} want to dine <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> needn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then. Go and see Jutley at once. See the {{reinforcements}} {{start off}} for the patrol duty, then ask the captain to let you have a half-a-dozen more men and bring <b>them</b> here <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You can be back in ten minutes. Go--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take <b>them</b> all <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> You {{may tell}} them why {{when you are}} out. I must have the house quiet. I shall get Margaret out into the shade, and prepare her, as best I can, before he comes at three o'clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! the beauties of Nature--I feel <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Monsieur Trudaine; I {{feel them}} here." [...] Saying this, Lomaque laid {{one hand on}} his heart, {{and with the other}} pulled his stick out of the grass. He had looked as little at the {{landscape}} or the setting sun as Monsieur Justin himself.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he hurried}} back to the stables, and the horse said to him: 'There is one thing more you must do. In the cupboad {{you will find a}} looking-glass, a brush and a riding-whip. Bring <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> mount on my back, and ride as hard as you can, for now the house is burning merrily.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have? Then take <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and escape, and {{remember}} Lot's wife. Eudaimon, come with me. You must {{lead me to}} your house, to the lodging of Miriam the Jewess. Do not deny! I know that she is there. For the sake of her who is gone I will hold you harmless, ay, reward you richly, if you prove faithful. Rise!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is that Scripture?' asked Eustacie. 'Ah! sir, sir, tell me more! You {{are giving}} me all--all--my child! I will be--I am--a Huguenot like her father! and, when my vassals come, I will make <b>them</b> ride <b>with</b> <b>you</b> to La Rochelle, and fight in your cause!' ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE (surprised). Why not? I used to {{be pretty}} chummy <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> know,--smoke a pipe <b>with</b> <b>them</b> {{occasionally}} in the noon hour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou shalt feed <b>them</b> <b>with</b> what <b>you</b> {{list for}} me," [...] said Roland, laughing; [...] "I am not many months older than when I left the Castle, but I trust I have {{gathered}} wit enough to cross no man of skill {{in his own}} vocation." ...|$|R
