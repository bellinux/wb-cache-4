5|$|Several Einsatzgruppen leaders, {{including}} Ohlendorf, claimed at {{the trial}} to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews. To date no evidence {{has been found that}} such an order was ever issued. German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the Einsatzgruppen leaders as accomplices to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the Einsatzgruppen had committed mass murder without orders, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have been convicted as perpetrators of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.|$|E
5|$|Since Du Tertre {{wrote that}} the macaws were prone to sickness, an {{outbreak}} of a disease, along with hunting, {{may have contributed to}} its demise. In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson quoted a letter by French writer M. de la Borde, which stated that macaws had become very rare in the Antillean islands because they were hunted for food. By <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only be found in areas not frequented by humans, and were probably extinct soon afterwards. Parrots are often among the first species to be exterminated from a given locality, especially islands.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant due to death, resignation, or conviction of impeachment, the lieutenant governor assumes the title of governor. Should {{the office of}} lieutenant governor also become vacant, {{the president of the}} senate becomes the acting governor. If the vacancy of both offices took place during the first twenty months of the term, a special election is to be held on the next even-numbered year to elect new officers to serve out the current term. Prior to 1851, the speaker of the senate acted as governor for the term. Since 1978, the governor and lieutenant governor have been elected on the same ticket; prior to <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be (and often were) members of different parties.|$|E

5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made for and against Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If the missiles were already fuelled, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. The missiles then needed six hours to thaw out. It was impractical to base them underground, but being above ground made them very vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E

25|$|Mount Allison's origins however {{go back to}} a boys' academy {{founded in}} June 1839 by a local Methodist merchant, Charles Frederick Allison. Charles Allison's {{grandfather}} had emigrated from Ireland to Canada in the late 18th century because of the after effects of a dinner with the local government tax collector. Wanting to impress the man, the family had set the table with their one valuable possession: silver spoons. After entertaining their guest, the Allisons were informed by the tax collector that if they could afford silver spoons, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> certainly afford to pay more taxes. The Allisons left Ireland shortly thereafter. The offending spoons are now on display in the university library.|$|E
500|$|Producer Bob Ezrin {{had worked}} with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed, and Kiss, as well as {{producing}} Peter Gabriel's debut solo album. At the suggestion of Waters's then-girlfriend Lady Carolyne Christie, who had worked as Ezrin's secretary, the band hired him to co-produce the album. From the start, Waters {{made it very clear}} who was in charge: [...] "You can write anything you want. Just don't expect any credit". [...] Ezrin, Waters, and Gilmour read Waters's concept, keeping what they liked, and discarding what they thought was not good enough. Waters and Ezrin worked mostly on the story, improving the concept. [...] A 40-page script was presented {{to the rest of the}} band, with positive results: [...] "The next day at the studio, we had a table read, like you would with a play, but with the whole of the band, and their eyes all twinkled, because <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> see the album." [...] Ezrin broadened the storyline, distancing it from the autobiographical work Waters had written, and instead basing it on a composite, or gestalt character named Pink. Engineer Nick Griffiths later said of the Canadian producer, [...] "Ezrin was very good in The Wall, because he did manage to pull the whole thing together. He's a very forceful guy. There was a lot of argument about how it should sound between Roger and Dave, and he bridged the gap between them." [...] Waters wrote most of the album's material, with Gilmour co-writing [...] "Comfortably Numb", [...] "Run Like Hell", and [...] "Young Lust", and Ezrin co-writing [...] "The Trial".|$|E
500|$|Toyota, {{discovering}} that the Australian public wanted {{something that was}} modern and designed with consideration to the Australian market, began full-scale planning work on its Avalon replacement in 2002. Toyota Australia realised that no other model being developed at the time for Japan or North America {{was going to be}} suitable, and due to the size limitations of the Australian market, a completely indigenous model was unrealisable. However, at that time, Toyota Australia did not have any designers of its own. As a result, the company recruited Paul Beranger in August 2002 to set up Toyota Style Australia (TSA) in an industrial complex located in Dingley Village, Victoria. TSA first developed the X-Runner and Sportivo Coupe concepts, and in 2003, Nick Hogios, who had previously worked for Ford Australia on designing the XR performance models of the BA Falcon, was appointed chief designer. TSA's next venture was more significant—a privately developed model based on the Camry XV30—a car that signalled the beginning of the Aurion programme. Codenamed [...] "380L" [...] and developed during the course of 2003, this one-off model was forged by stripping panels and interior components from the donor Camry, and substituting these for TSA-developed versions. Total cost was approximately million. Focus groups conducted by Toyota in early 2003 had ranked the Avalon {{at the bottom of the}} list when compared to the competing Holden Commodore, Ford Falcon, and Mitsubishi Magna. Later on in the year, the same focus groups were called back and the Avalon was exchanged for the 380L. Overall, the groups ranked the Toyota as their first preference, and according to Beranger, [...] "didn't see the car as a Camry". As such, Toyota Australia deduced that if the 380L was available for purchase there and <b>then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> sell it alongside the regular Camry as a six-cylinder car under a different name.|$|E

500|$|With the US 2nd Infantry Division, the Turkish Brigade and the ROK II Corps out of action, the US Eighth Army {{was reduced}} to just two corps, {{composed}} of four divisions and two brigades. Meanwhile, the over-extended Chinese logistics system had also left the victorious 13th Army half-starved and incapable of any further offensive operations. On December 2 Chinese general Peng Dehuai ordered his soldiers to halt fighting and regroup due to exhaustion. If the U.S. forces had decided to stop and form defensive lines rather than retreat completely <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have easily held part of central and southern North Korea around the Pyongyang area. The communist forces had only small arms weapons and no tanks and no air cover. [...] But during the chaotic UN retreats, no reconnaissance was conducted to determine {{the state of the}} Chinese forces. As a result, Walker ordered the Eighth Army to abandon North Korea on December 3, much to the surprise of the Chinese commanders. The following [...] withdrawal to the 38th parallel {{is often referred to as}} [...] "the longest retreat in US military history." [...] Aside from extremely low morale after the battle, the entire Eighth Army was also gripped with [...] "bug out fever" [...] during the retreat, and a song called the [...] "Bugout Boogie" [...] was composed to commemorate the Eighth Army's defeat. Walker died two days before the Christmas of 1950 when a truck driven by a South Korean soldier collided with his jeep, and Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway assumed the command of the US Eighth Army. At the UN, all hopes for a unified Korea were abandoned, and a ceasefire at the 38th parallel was proposed to China on December 11, 1950.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2008, a {{man from}} Sydney was convicted of {{possessing}} child pornography after sexually explicit pictures of children characters from The Simpsons were found on his computer.

Controversy arose over the perceived ban on small-breasted women in pornography after a South Australian court established that if a consenting adult in pornography were [...] "reasonably" [...] deemed to look {{under the age of}} consent, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be considered depictions of child pornography. Criteria described stated [...] "small breasts" [...] as one of few examples, leading to the outrage.

2500|$|In Spain's {{overseas}} expansion to the New World, {{the practice}} of cannibalism in was observed by Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean islands, and the Caribs were greatly feared because of their practice of it. Queen Isabel of Castile had forbade the Spaniards to enslave the indigenous, but if they were guilty of cannibalism <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be justifiably enslaved. Cannibalism became a pretext for attacks on indigenous groups and justification for the Spanish conquest. In Yucatán, shipwrecked Spaniard Jerónimo de Aguilar, who later became a translator for Hernán Cortés, witnessed fellow Spaniards sacrificed and eaten, but escaped from captivity where he was being fattened for sacrifice himself. [...] In the Florentine Codex (1576) compiled by Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún from information provided by indigenous informants has abundant evidence of Mexica (Aztec) cannibalism, including a specific Nahuatl word for the practice, tlacatlacualli ("people-food"). Franciscan friar Diego de Landa reported on Yucatán instances, {{and there have been}} similar reports by Purchas from Popayán, Colombia.|$|E

Thomas Lovejoy, former chief biodiversity advisor to the World Bank, has suggested that [...] "the acidity of the oceans will more than double in the next 40years. He says this rate is 100 times faster than any changes in ocean acidity in the last 20million years, making it unlikely that marine life can somehow adapt to the changes." [...] It is predicted that, by the year 2100, If co-occurring biogeochemical changes influence the delivery of ocean goods and services, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> also have a considerable effect on human welfare. for those who rely heavily on the ocean for food, jobs, and revenues. .|$|E

2500|$|Before the 1920s, {{regulation}} in Britain {{was controlled by}} the pharmacists. Pharmacists that {{were found to have}} prescribed opium for illegitimate causes and anyone found to have sold opium without proper qualifications would be prosecuted. Due to the passing of the Rolleston Act in Britain in 1926, doctors could prescribe opiates such as morphine and heroin on their own accord if they felt their patients demonstrated a medical need. Because addiction was viewed as a medical problem rather than an indulgence, doctors were permitted to allow patients to wean themselves off opiates rather than cutting off any opiate use altogether. The passing of the Rolleston Act put the control of opium use in the hands of medical doctors instead of pharmacists. Later in the 20th century, the addiction to opiates, especially [...] in young people, continued to rise and so the sale and prescription of opiates was limited to doctors in treatment centers. If these doctors were found to be prescribing opiates without just cause, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> lose their license to practice or prescribe drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Edmund Bergler was {{the most}} {{important}} psychoanalytic theorist of homosexuality in the 1950s. He was vociferous in his opposition to Alfred Kinsey. Kinsey's work, and its reception, led Bergler to develop his own theories for treatment, which were essentially to [...] "blame the victim", in the evaluation of Jennifer Terry, associate professor of Woman's Studies. Bergler claimed that if gay people wanted to change, and the right therapeutic approach was taken, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be cured in 90% of cases. Bergler used confrontational therapy in which gay people were punished in order to make them aware of their masochism. Bergler openly violated professional ethics to achieve this, breaking patient confidentiality in discussing the cases of patients with other patients, bullying them, calling them liars and telling them they were worthless. He insisted that gay people could be cured. Bergler confronted Kinsey because Kinsey thwarted the possibility of cure by presenting homosexuality as an acceptable way of life, which was the basis of the gay rights activism of the time. Bergler popularised his views in the United States in the 1950s using magazine articles and books aimed at non-specialists.|$|E
