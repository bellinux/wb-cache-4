25|$|Commercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg {{replacer}} and Ener-G egg replacer, {{are available}} for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one <b>tablespoon</b> of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a <b>tablespoon</b> of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one <b>tablespoon</b> of soy flour and one <b>tablespoon</b> of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a <b>tablespoon</b> of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a <b>tablespoon</b> of baking powder.

25|$|The J.M. Smucker Company, American {{manufacturer}} of Crisco (the original partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening), in 2004 released a new formulation made from solid saturated palm oil cut with soybean oil and sunflower oil. This blend yielded an equivalent shortening {{much like the}} previous partially hydrogenated Crisco, and was labelled zero grams of trans fat per 1 <b>tablespoon</b> serving (as compared with 1.5grams per <b>tablespoon</b> of original Crisco). As of 24 January 2007, Smucker claims that all Crisco shortening products in the US have been reformulated to contain less than one gram of trans fat per serving while keeping saturated fat content less than butter. The separately marketed trans fat free version introduced in 2004 was discontinued.|$|E

A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|E

Results A total of 71 teaspoons and 49 <b>tablespoons</b> were provided from the 25 female (mean age 48. 0 years) study participants. When these utensils were filled with water, the volume capacity of the 71 teaspoons ranged from 2. 5 to 7. 3 ml; mean volume was 4. 4 ml; median was 4. 4 ml. When the standardized teaspoon was used, the volume ranged from 3. 9 to 4. 9 ml among the total of the 25 study participants. When a subset of 5 study participants filled this teaspoon with paracetamol syrup, mean volume was 4. 8 ml. Conclusions Teaspoons and <b>tablespoons</b> are unreliable dosing devices and thus their use should no longer be recommended...|$|R
