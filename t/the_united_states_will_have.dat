25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 1 in 25,000 babies born in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> some form of the mucopolysaccharidoses. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that only individuals inheriting the defective gene from both parents are affected. (The exception is MPS II, or Hunter syndrome, in which the mother alone passes along the defective gene to a son.) When both people in a couple have the defective gene, each pregnancy carries with it a one in four chance that the child will be affected. The parents and siblings of an affected child may have {{no sign of the}} disorder. Unaffected siblings and select relatives of a child with one of the mucopolysaccharidoses may carry the recessive gene and could pass it to their own children.|$|E

2500|$|The Constitution presupposes {{that courts}} in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the {{authority}} to issue the writ as they historically did at common law. [...] See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289 (2001); Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 666 (1996).

[...] U.S. Const. art. [...] 1, § 9m cl.2. [...] As some commentators have noted, [...] "the text does not explicitly confer a right to habeas relief, but merely sets forth when the Privilege of the Writ may be suspended".|$|E
2500|$|De Grey {{and other}} {{scientists}} in the general field {{have argued that the}} costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky et al. 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of Alzheimer's disease in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050. [...] "Consider what is likely to happen if we don't [...] Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example." ...|$|E
