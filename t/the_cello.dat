50|$|The symphony is scored for 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. The edition by H. C. Robbins Landon for Verlag Doblinger has <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> and basses on {{the same}} staff {{for most of the}} work even though <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> {{occasionally}} are independent of the bassoons and basses in the first movement. Close {{to the beginning of the}} third movement it becomes necessary to split <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> and basses on to different staves as <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> switch to tenor clef and double the violas, leaving the bass to the bassoons and basses.|$|R
50|$|The first {{theme is}} {{introduced}} by <b>the</b> <b>cellos.</b> By <b>the</b> fifth {{bar of the}} melody (m. 7), a chromatic note (C) is introduced, thus introducing the harmonic tension of the work. The melody is finished by the first violins, with a syncopated series of Gs (which forms a tritone with C of <b>the</b> <b>cellos).</b> <b>The</b> first theme is then played again by the various instruments.|$|R
50|$|An introduction, {{which starts}} with a stormy Presto passage. It then briefly quotes {{all three of the}} {{previous}} movements in order, each dismissed by <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> and basses, which then play in an instrumental foreshadowing of the vocal recitative. At the introduction of the main theme, <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> and basses take it up and play it through.|$|R
5|$|Chopin's public {{popularity}} as a virtuoso {{began to}} wane, {{as did the}} number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. In February 1848, with the cellist Auguste Franchomme, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of <b>the</b> <b>Cello</b> Sonata Op. 65.|$|E
5|$|The Second Symphony, and Livre pour orchestre and <b>the</b> <b>Cello</b> Concerto which followed, were {{composed}} during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His {{mother died in}} 1967, and in 1967–70 {{there was a great}} deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production Dziady, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly <b>the</b> <b>Cello</b> Concerto of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, <b>the</b> <b>Cello</b> Concerto was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.|$|E
5|$|The form of {{the second}} {{movement}}, an Andante in B-flat major, is indefinable. The movement involves elements of a theme and variations, but also has characteristics of both a ternary form movement and a rondo. Unlike a conventional theme and variation movement, the minor mode variation is placed immediately after the statement of the theme; normally, the minor mode theme would be held back for later in the movement. The second variation involves very little actual variation, and is closer to a literal re-statement of the theme that one would see in ternary form or a rondo. Also unconventionally, {{the second and third}} so-called variations are separated by an eight-measure free-form passage. <b>The</b> <b>cello</b> enjoys a prominent role throughout the movement, with the viola often substituting as the bass accompaniment. <b>The</b> <b>cello</b> also presents the movement's opening theme.|$|E

50|$|The symphony is scored for two oboes, two bassoons, two {{horns and}} strings. In {{contemporary}} orchestras, it was usual to not {{write in the}} parts for the bassoons and harpsichord, and they would simply double <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> and double basses if they were available in the orchestra to reinforce the bass line and act as the continuo; however, the bassoons in this symphony do not simply double <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> and double basses. The duration is approximately 13 minutes.|$|R
5|$|The set's dedicatee, King Frederick William II, was {{a capable}} amateur cellist. The set {{contains}} {{a number of}} striking passages for <b>the</b> <b>cello,</b> including in its opening of the first movement of No. 1 and its leading passages in the slow movements of Nos. 2 and 3.|$|E
5|$|Graves was {{a pillar}} of the Los Alamos community. He was {{an active member of}} the non-denominational Protestant Community Church. With the {{encouragement}} of Elizabeth, who played the violin, he learned to play <b>the</b> <b>cello,</b> hoarding his petrol ration stamps so that he could travel to Santa Fe, New Mexico, for lessons. He played in the Los Alamos Symphony, accompanying local performances of Gilbert and Sullivan and Handel's Messiah. He was chairman of the board of the local bank, and a member of the local school board.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1949 {{he wrote}} his Cello Sonata in C, Op. 119, for the 22-year-old Mstislav Rostropovich, who gave the first {{performance}} in 1950, with Sviatoslav Richter. For Rostropovich, Prokofiev also extensively recomposed his Cello Concerto, transforming it into a Symphony-Concerto, his last major masterpiece and a landmark in <b>the</b> <b>cello</b> and orchestra repertory today. The last public performance he attended was the première of the Seventh Symphony in 1952. The music was written for the Children's Radio Division.|$|E

50|$|The second {{movement}} in F major is scored for strings sotto voce with divided violas {{and a single}} bassoon doubling <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> and bass.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cellos</b> {{and double}} basses {{introduce}} the Adagio section in a serene, unison cantabile, {{before the rest}} of the string section joins. Again, however, <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> and double basses descend before the piano joins, in una corda. The piano uses the string theme and develops it further, playing in a nocturne-like style with soft, flowing left hand arpeggios and a cantibile melody in the right hand. The section reaches a climax where a strong fortissimo is played followed by a descending diminuendo scale.|$|R
5|$|The first {{movement}} is in cut common (2/2) time. It starts with <b>the</b> <b>cello,</b> alone, playing eight quarter {{notes on the}} same B-flat. It is not until the third measure of the movement that the violins and viola enter. The cello's eight throbbing notes act as more than an introduction. They reappear at critical junctures throughout the movement, including {{at the beginning of}} the development and recapitulation sections, illustrating that they are part of the movement's primary thematic material. The melody that follows the eight cello notes is echoed in Beethoven's String Quartet No. 1 (Op. 18, No. 1).|$|E
5|$|The last opus {{number that}} Chopin himself used was 65, {{allocated}} to <b>the</b> <b>Cello</b> Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At {{the request of}} the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published in 1855. In 1857, 17 Polish songs that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which {{defending}} champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a cello. Jarrett went to hit Nash with <b>the</b> <b>cello,</b> however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello {{and placed it on}} the canvass. He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto <b>the</b> <b>cello</b> to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, which led to a fight between the two. After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them. A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force his face into the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the Stroke. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

50|$|From this point, {{the music}} gently winds down. Then, a {{succession}} of woodwind instruments recall <b>the</b> second <b>cello</b> melody over soft string scales, which repeatedly recall {{the opening of the}} movement. The tension grows and finally explodes into the opening theme, underscored by timpani, and the violins flit their way over a pulsating cushion of brass-and-woodwind chorales and offbeat pizzicatos in <b>the</b> <b>cellos.</b> <b>The</b> flute theme is once again recalled, and <b>the</b> second <b>cello</b> theme is finally brought to life by the entire orchestra; played in the string section, the timpani and woodwind provide rhythmic material while more brass chorales are sustained throughout the section.|$|R

5|$|Walton himself, {{although}} a reluctant conductor, conducted {{many of the}} EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the Façade Suites, the Partita, Belshazzar's Feast, and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few. Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including <b>the</b> <b>Cello</b> Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the film}} {{featured}} {{a number of}} pieces of classical music, as the main Bond girl, Kara Milovy, is a cellist. Mozart's 40th Symphony in G minor (1st movement) is performed by the orchestra at the Conservatoire in Bratislava when Koskov flees. As Moneypenny tells Bond, Kara is next to perform Alexander Borodin's String Quartet in D major, and the finale to Act II of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (in Vienna) also features. Before Bond is drugged by Kara, she is practising <b>the</b> <b>Cello</b> solo from the first movement of Dvořák's cello concerto in B minor. At {{the end of the}} film, Kara and an orchestra (conducted onscreen by John Barry) perform Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations to rapturous applause.|$|E
5|$|After sitar player Ravi Shankar {{successfully}} {{performed in}} Western countries, Narayan followed his example. He recorded solo albums {{and made his}} first international tour in 1964 to America and Europe with his older brother Chatur Lal, a tabla player who had toured with Shankar in the 1950s. The European tour included performances in France, Germany, sponsored by the Goethe-Institut, and at the City of London Festival, England. Beginning in the 1960s, Narayan often taught and gave concerts outside of India. On his Western tours he encountered interest in the sarangi because of its similarity to <b>the</b> <b>cello</b> and violin. The tabla player Suresh Talwalkar became a frequent accompanist for Narayan in the late 1960s. Narayan continued to perform and record in India and abroad for the next decades and his recordings appeared on Indian, American, and European labels. During the early 1980s he typically spent months each year visiting Western nations. Narayan performed less frequently in the 2000s and rarely in the 2010s.|$|E
50|$|The cadenza {{stands as}} a {{movement}} in itself. It begins by developing the material from <b>the</b> <b>cello's</b> second theme of the second movement, twice broken {{by a series of}} slow pizzicato chords. After the second time this is repeated, <b>the</b> <b>cello's</b> first theme of the second movement is played in an altered form. After the third time the chords are repeated, a continual accelerando passes through allegretto and allegro sections to a piu mosso section. These sections are frequented by the first DSCH motive. The piu mosso section features fast ascending and descending scales.|$|R

5|$|By the 1940s {{there were}} a few more Fauré works in the catalogues. A survey by John Culshaw in December 1945 singled out {{recordings}} of piano works played by Kathleen Long (including the Nocturne No. 6, Barcarolle No. 2, the Thème et Variations, Op. 73, and the Ballade Op. 19 in its orchestral version conducted by Boyd Neel), the Requiem conducted by Ernest Bourmauck, and seven songs sung by Maggie Teyte. Fauré's music began to appear more frequently in the record companies' releases in the 1950s. The Record Guide, 1955, listed the Piano Quartet No. 1, Piano Quintet No. 2, the String Quartet, both Violin Sonatas, <b>the</b> <b>Cello</b> Sonata No. 2, two new recordings of the Requiem, and the complete song cycles La bonne chanson and La chanson d'Ève.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{fluctuating}} critical {{assessment of}} the various works over the years, Elgar's major works {{taken as a whole}} have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. The Record Guide in 1955 could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of <b>the</b> <b>Cello</b> Concerto, two of the Enigma Variations, one of Falstaff, and none of The Dream of Gerontius. Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, {{and more than a dozen}} of The Dream of Gerontius. Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed. The Elgar Society's website, in its diary of forthcoming performances, lists performances of Elgar's works by orchestras, soloists and conductors across Europe, North America and Australia.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} seventeenth music became less an {{accomplishment}} of the gentle classes and increasingly a skill pursued by professionals. It was enjoyed in otherwise silent concert rooms {{rather than as}} incidental entertainment in the houses of royalty and nobles. The German flute was probably introduced into Scotland {{towards the end of}} the seventeenth century. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing <b>the</b> <b>cello</b> to the country and then developing settings for Lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was also a noted composer, violinist and harpiscordist. The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.|$|E

5000|$|As well, the woodwinds {{and brass}} {{instruments}} can effectively carry a melody, {{depending on the}} effect the composer/orchestrator desires. The trumpets can perform a melody in a powerful, high register. Alternatively, if the trombones play a melody, the pitch will be lower than the trumpet, and the tone will be heavier, which may change the musical effect that is created. While <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> are often given an accompaniment role in orchestration, there are notable cases where <b>the</b> <b>cellos</b> have been assigned the melody. In even more rare cases, the double bass section (or principal bass) may be given a melody (e.g., the high-register double bass solo in Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kije Suite).|$|R
