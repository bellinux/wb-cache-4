40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} the effects of 6 g of <b>ground</b> <b>cinnamon</b> added to farina (Cream of Wheat) cereal on blood glucose levels between obese and normal weight individuals. Thirty students, aged 19 - 30 years, were recruited to participate in this study. During study visits, participants were given one of two test meals (74 g of farina with and without 6 g of cinnamon) followed by seven blood glucose measurements over a two-hour period. A significant difference was seen in glycemic response between the two dietary conditions, but not between the two BMI groups (normal and obese). The two BMI groups were combined for analysis of dietary conditions. Ingestion of the cinnamon cereal resulted in significantly lower blood glucose responses at minutes 15, 30, 45 and 60 compared to the plain cereal.
