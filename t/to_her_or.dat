25|$|A person {{perceives}} {{something that}} provokes anxiety. The person tries {{to reduce the}} anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>or</b> his attachment. The attachment responds positively to the request for closeness, which reaffirms {{a sense of security}} and reduces anxiety. The person returns <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>or</b> his everyday activities.|$|E

25|$|The events {{begin the}} same way as the security-based strategy. A person {{perceives}} something that triggers anxiety, and the person tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>or</b> his attachment. But the attachment is either unavailable or rebuffs the request for closeness. The lack of responsiveness fuels insecurity and heightens anxiety. The person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment, suppresses her or his anxiety, and distances herself or himself from the attachment.|$|E

25|$|Following a brief move to Salt Lake City, Utah, Underwood {{returned}} to Los Angeles, where she found {{work as a}} waitress at the Pig ‘n Whistle restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. One day in April 1920, she was lamenting to Harry Underwood, a co-worker, that her Hollywood relative had resurfaced and demanded that Underwood live with her again and relinquish her paychecks <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>or</b> she would turn the underage girl over to the authorities. Harry {{told her that the}} relative could not do that if he and Underwood were married. The couple married three weeks later on April 28, 1920.|$|E
25|$|In November 1994, Irving had {{his first}} {{encounter}} with Lipstadt at DeKalb College in Atlanta, where Lipstadt was lecturing on Holocaust denial. Irving had listened to the lecture while sitting in the lecture hall {{and when it was}} over, did his best to disrupt Lipstadt by challenging her to a debate, waving about a large amount of money in his hands, and announcing he had $1,000 to give <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>or</b> anyone who could find a written order from Hitler for the Holocaust. Lipstadt ignored Irving, despite his repeated attempts to draw her into a debate. After Lipstadt's lecture had ended, Irving announced that Lipstadt's refusal to debate him or produce a written order from Hitler for the Holocaust despite his promise to pay $1,000 on the spot proved that her criticism of him in Denying the Holocaust was invalid, and he proceeded to hand out free copies of his Göring biography to Lipstadt's students.|$|E
25|$|According to the Nazi family value attitude, {{the husband}} was {{regarded}} {{the head of}} a family. Thus people living in a mixed marriage were treated differently according to the sex of the Aryan spouse and according to the religious affiliation of the children, their being or not being enrolled with a Jewish congregation. Nazi-termed mixed marriages were often not interfaith marriages, because in many cases the classification of one spouse as non-Aryan was only due <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>or</b> his grandparents being enrolled with a Jewish congregation or else classified as non-Aryan. In many cases both spouses had a common faith, either because the parents had already converted or because at marrying one spouse converted to the religion of the second (marital conversion). Traditionally the wife used to be the convert. However, in urban areas and after 1900, actual interfaith marriages occurred more often, with interfaith marriages legally allowed in some states of the German Confederation since 1847, and generally since 1875, when civil marriage became an obligatory prerequisite for any religious marriage ceremony throughout the united Germany.|$|E

25|$|The Geek Chorus {{enters and}} informs the {{audience}} that Spider-Man has defeated his ultimate enemy, so their story is complete. Miss Arrow is convinced {{that they are not}} finished, because Spider-Man's real ultimate enemy should be unbeatable. So they introduce several villains which Spider-Man dispatches: Carnage, Swarm, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, The Lizard, and Swiss Miss (whom Miss Arrow invents on the spot). Throughout this super villain parade, we also learn that Peter and MJ have formed a relationship. With all of these villains afoot, Peter is exhausted and not paying much attention <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>or</b> anyone else in his life ("Spider-Man Rising"). As Peter sleeps one night, Arachne invades his dreams. She realizes that she will no longer be alone now that there is another spider to share her darkness ("Turn Off the Dark"). She begins to weave illusions in his mind, and Peter can't tell the difference between the dream and reality when he awakes. MJ becomes completely fed up with Peter's constant lateness and disregard for her after he does not show up for her new play ("Walk Away"). That night, he decides to abandon Spider-Man forever.|$|E
500|$|While at Sabrina's house, Carly Beth {{is shocked}} to find she is unable to remove the mask and that the mask has, in fact, become her face. She returns {{to the store and}} finds the owner waiting for her. The store owner tells her that the [...] "mask" [...] is {{actually}} a real living face. All the masks in the back room are deformed, monstrous, living faces. The store owner made them, but they started out beautiful but then became hideous. Every so often, a person puts one on and the mask possesses them. It can only be removed by a [...] "symbol of love", but if it attaches itself <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>or</b> another person again, it will be forever. Carly Beth screams in horror, and the other masks begin to pursue her. While running away from the masks, she realizes that the mold her mother made is a symbol of love. Carly Beth finds the mold and uses it to deter the masks and remove the mask from her face. She returns home to her mother, tossing the mask away. Noah later bursts in and asks her, [...] "How do I look in your mask?" ...|$|E
500|$|A new storyline {{began in}} August 2016 when Babe became {{the victim of}} a revenge attack, having {{accumulated}} several enemies over {{the months leading up to}} the attack. Several media outlets suggested a range of suspects, with the most prominent suspects being Claudette, Les and Pam, Abi and Sylvie. Other suspects included: Linda, Lee, Whitney, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) and Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). The episode that aired in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2016 saw Babe argue with Claudette, Les, Abi and Sylvie with each suspect later seen going out, before someone confronts Babe in the Vic, locking her in the freezer. The scene where Babe is locked in the freezer received the episode's [...] "duff-duff". Episodes following the attack showed Babe tell her family that Sylvie was responsible for the attack, but have a conversation with Abi revealing her as the true culprit. Badland said that the attack [...] "takes Babe by surprise" [...] as [...] "she clearly didn't know there was somebody out there capable of doing this <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>or</b> else she'd have seen it coming." [...] She opined that [...] "Babe doesn't think for a minute that Abi could ever get the better of her." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Chelsea Girl is well-regarded {{by music}} critics, Nico was {{dissatisfied}} with it: [...] "The first time I heard the album, I cried. I still cannot listen to it, because everything I wanted for that record, {{they took it}} away." [...] Jim Morrison, whom Nico later called [...] " [...] soul brother", encouraged her to write her own songs; this was [...] "a key breakthrough for [...] ". They were together in California in July and August 1967, often driving into the desert and experimenting with peyote. Morrison, who encouraged Nico to write down her dreams, read Mary Shelley, William Blake and Samuel Taylor Coleridge to her. He recorded his chemical visions and dreams, using the material for his songs as he imagined the opium-addicted Coleridge had worked. In 1986 Nico said, [...] "He taught me to write songs. I never thought that I could... He really inspired me a lot. It was like looking in a mirror then." [...] She began writing her own material and performing it to an intimate audience at Steve Paul's club, the Scene. Nico composed her music on a harmonium bought, according to Richard Witts, from a San Francisco hippie; manager Danny Fields recalled, [...] "I think Leonard Cohen may have given it <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>or</b> {{had something to do}} with her getting it." [...] With that instrument, [...] "she discovered not only her own artistic voice but a whole new realm of sound." [...] The droning pump organ became her trademark.|$|E
