5|$|At 0000UTC on September20, the {{depression}} made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast.

5|$|Although {{the centre}} {{and the eastern}} {{parts of the country}} are mostly flat, the west is mountainous. Both the Andes and Sierras Pampeanas affect the climate of Argentina, leading to {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, and spatial distribution of precipitation depending on the topography and altitude. Here, the Andes exert an important influence on the climate. Owing to the higher altitudes of the Andes north of 40oS, they completely block the normal westerly flow, preventing low pressure systems containing moisture from <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean</b> from coming in. Thus, much of Argentina north of 40oS is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. South of 40oS, the Andes are lower in altitude, allowing much of Patagonia to be dominated by westerly winds and air masses from <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> However, the north–south orientation of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses originating from <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> <b>Ocean.</b> This is because they force these air masses upwards, cooling adiabactically. Most of the moisture is dropped on the Chilean side, causing abundant precipitation and cloudiness while on the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically, causing it to become drier as it descends. Thus, an extensive rain–shadow is present in much of Patagonia, causing it to receive very little precipitation. The Sierras Pampeanas influences the climate on a much smaller scale than the Andes.|$|E
