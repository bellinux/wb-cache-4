5|$|Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a {{separate}} furnace, the oil shale gas from <b>these</b> <b>technologies</b> is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another advantage {{is that there is}} no limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is that more water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.|$|E
5|$|Markets for second-generation {{technologies}} have been strong and growing {{over the past}} decade, and <b>these</b> <b>technologies</b> have gone from being {{a passion for the}} dedicated few to a major economic sector in countries such as Germany, Spain, the United States, and Japan. Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics. These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of <b>these</b> <b>technologies</b> is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of ethylenediamine dihydroiodide, provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock, consumes {{a large portion}} of available iodine. Another significant use is a catalyst for the {{production of}} acetic acid by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In <b>these</b> <b>technologies,</b> which support the world's demand for acetic acid, hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{combustion}} {{technologies such}} as the Paraho Direct are thermally efficient, since combustion of char on the spent shale and heat recovered from the shale ash and evolved gases can provide all the heat requirements of the retort. <b>These</b> <b>technologies</b> can achieve 80-90% of Fischer assay yield. Two well-established shale oil industries use internal combustion technologies: Kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in Estonia since the 1920s, {{and a number of}} Chinese companies operate Fushun process facilities.|$|E
50|$|The Digital Firm is {{a general}} term for {{organizations}} that have enabled core business relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, and other external partners through digital networks. These digital networks are supported by enterprise class technology platforms that have been leveraged within an organization to support critical business functions and services. Some examples of <b>these</b> <b>technology</b> platforms are Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Supply Chain Management (SCM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Knowledge Management System (KMS), Enterprise Content Management (ECM), and Warehouse Management System (WMS) among others. The purpose of <b>these</b> <b>technology</b> platforms is to digitally enable seamless integration and information exchange within the organization to employees and outside the organization to customers, suppliers, and other business partners.|$|R

30|$|Another {{significant}} {{aspect of}} the problem is the insufficient exposure to computer technologies, which deters full utilization of computer technology devices by many Saudi EFL learners. Most students have minimal or no experience in using computers and those who know how to use computers employ these merely for entertainment and communication. Information communication technology (ICT) implementation without preparation and training on how to deal and use <b>these</b> <b>technology</b> tools properly might affect the learning process. The successful use of technologies can be largely detected in the attitudes and willingness of students to use <b>these</b> <b>technology</b> tools, which could lead to the successful utilization of these tools in the classroom. Albirini (2006) supports this view and states that the attitudes and willingness of learners toward using technology mainly value the successful use of technology in the educational settings.|$|R

HPMI personnel also established Florida's first National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC).|$|E
5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power and wind power {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in <b>these</b> <b>technologies</b> declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and wind power investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. <b>These</b> <b>technologies</b> soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E

5|$|Pottery {{produced}} locally in East Africa {{was shaped}} by hand, unglazed, and assumed to be open fired, {{but it has been}} proposed that the absence of evidence for kilns {{may be the result of}} mistaking their remnants for metal furnaces. However, the absence of glazed and wheeled pottery illustrates that the inhabitants of the Swahili Coast did not adapt <b>these</b> <b>technologies</b> as a result of Indian Ocean trade, but were primarily the recipients of finished products in exchange for other local produce. Conversely, fifteen different potters' marks have been found at Gedi on pottery found on or near the surface of the site dating to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which has been used to suggest the site may have had a communal kiln at that time. The pots inscribed with the potters marks show the variation of different types and styles of ceramics over time, which were influenced by local production, as well as, the adaption of foreign design elements. Prior to the diversification of local styles and types, early ceramics at Gedi were more uniform and contained similarities with ceramics found at other coastal sites. Despite the increase of imported ceramics in the fifteenth century, local varieties continued to be present in later levels of the sites occupation.|$|E
