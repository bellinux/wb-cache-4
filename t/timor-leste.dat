Australian forces {{were involved in a}} number skirmishes during this time, including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by Alfredo Reinado at Same on 4 March 2007. However, by early-2010 the security situation had been stabilised and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force. Following a drawdown, the International Stabilisation Force commenced withdrawing from <b>Timor-Leste</b> in November 2012, a process which was completed in April 2013.|$|E

5|$|The F-FDTL {{was formed}} from the {{national}} liberation movement guerrilla army known as FALINTIL (Portuguese acronym for Forças Armadas de Libertação de <b>Timor-Leste</b> or Armed Forces for the Liberation of East Timor). During the period before 1999 some East Timorese leaders, including the current President José Ramos-Horta, proposed that a future East Timorese state {{would not have a}} military. The widespread violence and destruction that followed the independence referendum in 1999 and the need to provide employment to FALINTIL veterans led to a change in policy, however. Following the end of Indonesian rule, FALINTIL proposed the establishment of a large military of about 5,000 personnel.|$|E
25|$|Brazil – East Timor {{relations}} {{refer to}} the bilateral relations between Brazil and <b>Timor-Leste.</b> Brazil has an embassy in Dili and East Timor has its own only South American embassy in Brasilia. Both countries are members of Community of Portuguese Language Countries. Due to their shared history as a Portuguese colony, Brazil and <b>Timor-Leste</b> have had formal relations since before <b>Timor-Leste</b> became an independent state in 2002. The predominant avenues for their relations are via economic capacity building programs provided by Brazil in <b>Timor-Leste</b> and {{as a part of}} both countries participation in the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. Brazil has been supportive of Timor-Leste’s development as an independent democracy, and the two have cooperated on programs as diverse as technological training programs, Portuguese language instruction, and football.|$|E

40|$|Oil and gas exports {{provide more}} than 93 % of <b>Timor-Leste’s</b> state {{revenues}} and three-fourths of GDP, making the young nation {{one of the most}} petroleum-dependent countries in the world. Although this fuelled ‘double-digit’ annual growth in non-oil GDP from 2007 through 2011, poverty and inequality are also increasing. Current development plans are unlikely to rescue <b>Timor-Leste’s</b> people from the ‘resource curse’, which distorts planning, governance, decision-making and politics, leading to neglect of non-petroleum investments, especially agriculture and human resources. Income from exporting non-renewable petroleum wealth is channelled through a Petroleum Fund which contains over US$ 16 billion. Although <b>Timor-Leste’s</b> currently active oil and gas fields may be dry by 2020, many believe that earnings from Petroleum Fund investments will continue to pay for state activities. Unfortunately, La’o Hamutuk’s model shows that the Petroleum Fund may be empty within five years after that. The prospect that the Petroleum Fund could be gone in a decade underscores the urgency to develop <b>Timor-Leste’s</b> non-oil economy, increase domestic revenue and use public money wisely. In the end, the Petroleum Fund may have created an illusion of financial security that allowed <b>Timor-Leste’s</b> leaders to defer difficult decisions and challenging tasks...|$|R
