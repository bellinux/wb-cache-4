5|$|The monarch's {{official}} flag in the United Kingdom is the Royal Standard, which {{depicts the}} Royal Arms in banner form. It is flown only from buildings, vessels and vehicles {{in which the}} Sovereign is present. The Royal Standard is never flown at half-mast because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> sovereign: when one dies, his or her successor becomes the sovereign instantly.|$|E
5|$|At any time, {{there are}} four or five people working at the control center: two monitor the ATC system, one {{monitors}} passenger information, and one is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> team of linemen that can be dispatched to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards at stations and on most trains that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|Important {{buildings}} {{include the}} Roman Baths; neoclassical architect Robert Adam's Pulteney Bridge, {{based on an}} unused design for the Rialto Bridge in Venice; and Bath Abbey in the city centre, founded in 1499 {{on the site of}} an 8th-century church. Of equal importance are the residential buildings designed and built into boulevards and crescents by the Georgian architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger– well-known examples being the Royal Crescent, built around 1770, and The Circus, built around 1760, where each of the three curved segments faces one of the entrances, ensuring that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> classical facade facing the entering visitor.|$|E

5|$|The anteroconid—the cusp at {{the front}} of m1—is usually divided in two by a central {{indentation}} (the anteromedian fossettid) in A.donovani, but this fossettid is absent in A.praeuniversitatis. Behind the anteroconid is the protoconid—metaconid pair of cusps. There is an anterolabial cingulum—a crest {{at the front}} labial margin, in front of the protoconid. There is a long crest behind the metaconid, a mesolophid. There is usually no corresponding crest (an ectolophid) behind the protoconid. Another pair of cusps—the hypoconid and the entoconid—is located {{at the back of the}} tooth. The entoconid, the lingual cusp of the two, is oriented forwards. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> large root {{at the front of}} the tooth and another at the back. A.donovani usually has a small labial root between the two large roots and often also another small root at the lingual side, but only one of four A.praeuniversitatis m1s even has the labial rootlet.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} repairs are the {{grinding}} of the wheels; more complicated repairs {{are made by}} replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer. By having components in reserve, trains can have shorter maintenance times. The center also has the system's work trains, including a diesel locomotive that can fetch broken trains. At any time, there are four people working at the control center. Two monitor the ATC system, one monitors passenger information, while the last is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> team of technicians who {{can be sent to}} perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} use of heuristics {{for multiple}} alignment means that for an arbitrary set of proteins, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>a</b> {{good chance that}} an alignment will contain errors. For example, an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24% of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned. These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences, or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone. As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made {{simply because of the}} heuristic nature of MSA algorithms. Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed, often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences. Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these (usually minor) errors, in order to obtain an optimal 'curated' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} of this metre {{is different from the}} iambic senarius or trochaic septenarius. In Plautus there almost always a break (diaeresis) {{in the middle of the}} line.
