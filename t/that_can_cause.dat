5|$|Armillaria is a genus of fungi {{commonly}} known as honey mushrooms. First treated by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, and later assigned generic rank by Friedrich Staude in 1857, Armillaria is classified in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales, the gilled mushrooms. The majority of species in Armillaria are saprotrophic and live mainly on dead wood, but some are parasites <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> root and butt rot in over 600 species of woody plants. Some Armillaria species form mycorrhizae with orchids; others, such as A.gallica, A.mellea, and A.tabescens, are bioluminescent.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} two playable characters: Jeremy, {{a vampire}} hunter, and Alysa, a vampire that Jeremy became ritually bound to, {{on a quest}} to retrieve an artifact <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> cataclysms. The game features both single player and local cooperative gameplay (co-op) modes, but {{does not allow for}} online co-op. Blood Knights received generally negative reviews upon release, with a large number of critics faulting the game for showing a lack of creativity and having uninteresting gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The main {{inert gas}} in air is {{nitrogen}}, but nitrogen {{is not the}} only gas <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> DCS. Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium, which can also cause decompression sickness. Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen, so different decompression schedules are required, but, since helium does not cause narcosis, it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} types of {{inflammation}} <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> knee pain, including sprains, bursitis, and injuries to the meniscus. A diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis can be made based on a physical examination {{and the presence of}} risk factors in the person's medical history; swelling and tenderness {{at the front of the}} knee, combined with a profession that requires frequent kneeling, suggest prepatellar bursitis. Swelling of multiple joints along with restricted range of motion may indicate arthritis instead.|$|E

5|$|To {{distinguish}} between OHS {{and various other}} lung diseases <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> similar symptoms, medical imaging of the lungs (such as a chest X-ray or CT/CAT scan), spirometry, electrocardiography and echocardiography may be performed. Echo- and electrocardiography may also show strain {{on the right side}} of the heart caused by OHS, and spirometry may show a restrictive pattern related to obesity.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{root rot}} {{caused by the}} fungus Helicobasidium purpureum {{sometimes}} affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a powdery mildew <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor {{the development of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species {{are the primary}} causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but {{they are less likely}} than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E

5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} (BHD), also Hornstein–Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, Hornstein–Knickenberg syndrome, and fibrofolliculomas with trichodiscomas and acrochordons {{is a human}} {{autosomal dominant}} genetic disorder <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> susceptibility to kidney cancer, renal and pulmonary cysts, and noncancerous tumors of the hair follicles, called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas {{are the most common}} manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%), but only 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14–34% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.|$|E
