50|$|For {{the first}} half of its life the Liberal Party was {{comparatively}} conservative, and saw its task primarily in terms of changing the minds of the white electorate. It leaned towards a qualified franchise. This changed in 1959-1960. The Progressive Party, formed in 1959 occupied the political ground that the Liberal Party had occupied up till then. In 1960 the Sharpeville massacre and consequent State of Emergency, during which several Liberal party members were detained, changed the outlook of the party.

50|$|As is {{the case}} in Marathon, Marathon 2 uses {{computer}} terminals to advance the plot and allow the player to communicate with various artificial intelligences. The player communicates with Durandal and Tycho, both of whom were artificial intelligences aboard the UESC Marathon in the original game (Leela is almost entirely absent from Marathon 2). Because of the <b>translation</b> <b>equipment</b> installed in the player's character's suit, the player can also access S'pht and Pfhor terminals, which function {{in the same manner as}} standard terminals. Terminals in Marathon 2 can change level dynamics by means such as opening or closing doors or altering the tide of liquids, and are capable of teleporting the player not only out of a level but to other locations throughout. The mission of some levels is to access and read certain terminals. Unlike Marathon, Marathon 2 does not pause the game when a player accesses a terminal, leaving him open to attack while reading, in which case the game immediately stops him from reading.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} EVA {{results of}} the STS- 37 mission that flew in April 1991, with emphasis on the unscheduled EVA to free the Compton GRO antenna. The EVA Development Flight Experiment (EDFE) objectives and equipment description are also presented. The EDFE consisted of three experiments conducted during STS- 37 to evaluate both designs of crew <b>translation</b> <b>equipment</b> and loads imparted by crew members while performing typical EVA work site tasks for Space Station Freedom. The experiments were used to evaluate static and dynamic loads and ease of operation of four separate translation systems operating on a fixed track. Various measures of performance of the crew equipment and translation aids are discussed. The rates and accelerations experienced during translation aided by the manipulator foot restraint and remote manipulator system {{were found to be}} comfortable...|$|E

5000|$|The MBS also {{supports}} astronauts during extra-vehicular activities. It has locations to store tools and equipment, foot-restraints, handrails and safety tether attachment points {{as well as}} a camera assembly. If needed, it is even possible for an astronaut to [...] "ride" [...] the MBS while it moves at a top speed of about 1.5 meters per minute. On either side of the MBS are the Crew and <b>Equipment</b> <b>Translation</b> Aids. These carts ride on the same rails as the MBS. Astronauts ride them manually during EVAs to transport equipment and to facilitate their movements around the station.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a noncontacting motion sensing system designed to monitor the movement of a cart along a track in the low earth orbit space environment is described. The system uses Hall effect sensors to detect the position of small permanent magnets located along the track. The measurement criteria are described, the system design is discussed, and estimates of the system error are given. The system will be used on the Crew and <b>Equipment</b> <b>Translation</b> Aid (CETA) experiment scheduled for the STS 37 flight in November 1990.

25|$|The first spacewalk of the STS-134 {{mission was}} {{completed}} on flight day 5. Drew Feustel and Greg Chamitoff completed {{the installation of}} {{a new set of}} MISSE experiments, and also started installing a new wireless video system, but were stopped when a CO2 sensor failed in Chamitoff's suit. After the failure, the pair were told to install an ammonia jumper between the Port 3 (P3) and Port 6 (P6) truss segments. The spacewalkers furthermore installed a new light on the Crew <b>Equipment</b> <b>Translation</b> Aid (CETA) cart on the Starboard 3 (S3) truss segment, and a cover on the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ). The installation of the wireless video system was completed during the third EVA. While the 6-hour-and-19-minute-long spacewalk was in progress, members of the STS-134 crew completed more equipment transfers between Endeavour and the ISS. Expedition 27 crew members also prepared for the departure of Dmitri Kondratyev, Paolo Nespoli and Cady Coleman.|$|R
40|$|A newly {{developed}} technique for enhanced data reduction provides an improved procedure that allows least squares minimization to become possible between data sets with an unequal number of data points. This technique was {{applied in the}} Crew and <b>Equipment</b> <b>Translation</b> Aid (CETA) experiment on the STS- 37 Shuttle flight in April 1991 to obtain the velocity profile from the acceleration data. The new technique uses a least-squares method to estimate the initial conditions and calibration constants. These initial conditions are estimated by least-squares fitting the displacements indicated by the Hall-effect sensor data to the corresponding displacements obtained from integrating the acceleration data. The velocity and displacement profiles can then be recalculated from the corresponding acceleration data using the estimated parameters. This technique, which enables instantaneous velocities to {{be obtained from the}} test data instead of only average velocities at varying discrete times, offers more detailed velocity information, particularly during periods of large acceleration or deceleration...|$|R

40|$|The Crew and <b>Equipment</b> <b>Translation</b> Aid (CETA) {{is a human}} powered cart {{that will}} aid astronauts in {{conducting}} extra-vehicular activity (EVA) maintenance on the International Space Station (ISS). There are two critical EVA tasks relevant to the successful operation of the CETA. These are {{the removal of the}} launch restraint bolts during its initial deployment from the Space Shuttle payload bay and the manual deceleration of the cart, its two onboard astronauts, and a payload. To validate the launch restraint and braking system designs, the hardware engineers needed to verify their performance in an environment similar to that in which it will be used. This environment includes the vacuum of low earth orbit and temperatures as low as - 11 O F and as high as + 200 F. The desire for quantitative data, as opposed to subjective information which could be provided by a suited astronaut, coupled with test scheduling conflicts resulted in an unmanned testing scenario. Accommodating these test objectives in an unmanned test required a solution that would provide remotely actuated thermal vacuum compatible torque sources of up to 25 ft-lbs at four horizontally oriented and four vertically oriented bolts, a variable input force of up to 125 lbs at the four brake actuators, and thermal vacuum compatible torque and force sensors. The test objectives were successfully met in both the thermal Chamber H and the thermal vacuum Chamber B at NASA's Johnson Space Center...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Space Station Freedom (SSF) program the concept of on-orbit servicing of user hardware has been {{an integral part of the}} program implementation. The user servicing system architecture has been divided into a baseline and a growth phase. The baseline system consists of the following hardware elements that will support user servicing - flight telerobotic servicer, crew and <b>equipment</b> <b>translation</b> aid, crew intravehicular and extravehicular servicing support, logistics supply system, mobile servicing center, and the special purpose dextrous manipulator. The growth phase incorporates a customer servicing facility (CSF), a station-based orbital maneuvering vehicle and an orbital spacecraft consumables resupply system. The requirements for user servicing were derived from the necessity to service attached payloads, free flyers and coorbiting platforms. These requirements include: orbital replacement units (ORU) and instrument changeout, National Space Transportation System cargo bay loading and unloading, contamination control and monitoring, thermal protection, payload berthing, storage, access to SSF distributed systems, functional checkout, and fluid replenishment. The baseline user servicing capabilities accommodate ORU and instrument changeout. However, this service is limited to attached payloads, either in situ or at a locally adjacent site. The growth phase satisfies all identified user servicing requirements by expanding servicing capabilities to include complex servicing tasks for attached payloads, free-flyers and coorbiting platforms at a dedicated, protected Servicing site. To provide a smooth evolution of user servicing the SSF interfaces that are necessary to accommodate the growth phase have been identified. The interface requirements on SSF have been greatly simplified by accommodating the growth servicing support elements within the CSF. This results in a single SSF interface: SSF to the CSF...|$|R
5000|$|The two crews awoke at 05:08 UTC, {{and began}} {{preparing}} for the second EVA. Parazynski and Tani began the spacewalk at 09:32 UTC, a half-hour ahead of the planned timeline. The pair started with the P6 truss, removing the attachments to the Z1 truss, which allowed Wilson and Wheelock to use the station's robotic arm to move the truss to a position where it was [...] "parked" [...] for the night. Joking to Wilson [...] "Don't drop it!", Parazynski then moved on and installed handrails onto Harmony, while Tani went to inspect some items requested by the managers, including handrails on a Crew and <b>Equipment</b> <b>Translation</b> Aid (CETA) cart, that was considered as a possible cause of Rick Mastracchio's glove tear on STS-118. Tani noted the handrail appeared to be intact, with no obvious sharp edges. Tani {{then moved on to}} the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) that has had an intermittent vibration for over a month. After removing the cover from the joint, Tani called down to the team to let them know he saw some metal shavings, and some wear patterns and discoloration on one of the rings inside the joint. [...] "It's like the result that you get with the metal, iron filings and you put a magnet under it and they stand straight up." [...] Tani collected some of the shavings onto some tape, which returned to Earth with the shuttle for further analysis. Managers decided to add a task to Tuesday's EVA, having Parazynski inspect the port (left side) SARJ, using photography and video to compare it to the starboard SARJ inspected by Tani.|$|R
40|$|On {{the fourth}} day of STS- 112, its crew (Jeffrey Ashby, Commander; Pamela Melroy, Pilot; David Wolf, Mission Specialist; Piers Sellers, Mission Specialist; Sandra Magnus, Mission Specialist; Fyodor Yurchikhin, Mission Specialist) onboard Atlantis and the Expedition 5 crew (Valery Korzun, Commander; Peggy Whitson, Flight Engineer; Sergei Treschev, Flight Engineer) onboard the International Space Station (ISS) are seen {{preparing}} for {{the installation of the}} S 1 truss structure. Inside the Destiny Laboratory Module, Korzun and other crewmembers are seen as they busily prepare for the work of the day. Sellers dons an oxygen mask and uses an exercise machine in order to purge the nitrogen from his bloodstream, in preparation for an extravehicular activity (EVA). Whitson uses the ISS's Canadarm 2 robotic arm to grapple the S 1 truss and remove it from Atlantis' payload bay, with the assistance of Magnus. Using the robotic arm, Whitson slowly maneuvers the 15 ton truss structure into alignment with its attachment point on the starboard side of the S 0 truss structure, where the carefully orchestrated mating procedures take place. There is video footage of the entire truss being rotated and positioned by the arm, and ammonia tank assembly on the structure is visible, with Earth in the background. Following the completion of the second stage capture, the robotic arm is ungrappled from truss. Sellers and Wolf are shown exiting the the Quest airlock hatch to begin their EVA. They are shown performing a variety of tasks on the now attached S 1 truss structure, including work on the Crew <b>Equipment</b> <b>Translation</b> Cart (CETA), the S-band Antenna Assembly, and umbilical cables that provide power and remote operation capability to cameras. During their EVA, they are shown using a foot platform on the robotic arm. Significant portions of their activities are shown from the vantage of helmet mounted video cameras. The video closes with a final shot of the ISS and its new S 1 truss...|$|R
40|$|The Crew <b>Equipment</b> <b>Translation</b> Aid (CETA) {{experiment}} is an extravehicular activity (EVA) Space Transportation System (STS) based flight experiment which will explore various modes of transporting astronauts and light equipment for Space Station Freedom (SSF). The {{basic elements of}} CETA are: (1) two 25 foot long sections of monorail, which will be EVA assembled in the STS cargo bay to become a single 50 ft. rail called the track; (2) a wheeled baseplate called the truck which rolls along the track and can accept three cart concepts; and (3) the three carts which are designated manual, electric, and mechanical. The three carts serve as the astronaut restraint and locomotive interfaces with the track. The manual cart is powered by the astronaut grasping the track's handrail and pulling himself along. The electric cart is operated by an astronaut turning a generator which powers the electric motor and drives the cart. The mechanical cart is driven by a Bendix type transmission and is similar in concept to a man-propelled railroad cart. During launch and landing, the truck {{is attached to the}} deployable track by means of EVA removable restraint bolts and held in position by a system of retractable shims. These shims are positioned on the exterior of the rail for launch and landing and rotate out of the way {{for the duration of the}} experiment. The shims are held in position by strips of Velcro nap, which rub against the sides of the shim and exert a tailored force. The amount of force required to rotate the shims was a major EVA concern, along with operational repeatability and extreme temperature effects. The restraint system was tested in a thermal-vac and vibration environment and was shown to meet all of the initial design requirements. Using design inputs from the astronauts who will perform the EVA, CETA evolved through an iterative design process and represented a cooperative effort...|$|R
