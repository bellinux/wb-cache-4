5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> single line, so making the frontage {{of the army}} as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where the river was the easiest to ford, and at one moment, Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} that the sarcophagus was installed on or shortly before May 2, 1426, when the Calimala contracted for two chaplains <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> daily mass for Cossa's soul. The records of the Duomo workshop indicate that on January 28, 1427 Valori bought four white marble blocks for the tomb.|$|E
5|$|The {{bird was}} also kept by Māori as a pet, {{and like the}} tui, it could be trained <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> few words. There is also a record of a tame huia kept by European {{settlers}} in a small village in the Forty-Mile Bush in the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The gymnasia have forms which {{operate on}} a unit-credit system, that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> term is divided into course units, {{each of which is}} worth a certain number of credits. Students are {{consequently}} able to regulate the speed of their education based on their personal circumstances. This system is used in most upper secondary institutions in Iceland.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> licence {{in the form of}} a warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{arriving}} at the hospital with Bailey and Zola, Grey is informed by the surgeons that they tried everything to save her husband's life. Grey points out {{that they should have}} ordered a head CT, much to Blake's dismay. She reviews all of her options with the doctor in-charge of Shepherd's case, before signing the papers to authorize the removal of his life support. Blake tearfully apologizes to a forbearing Grey, who then returns to his hospital room <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> final goodbye to Shepherd. This is accompanied by a montage of the happy moments from their relationship.|$|E
60|$|The poet {{intended}} no {{allusion to}} the word “Erota” itself; but says that her very name, “the proud Erota,” became a character and adage;—as we <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> Quixote or <b>a</b> Brutus: so <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>an</b> “Erota,” expressed female pride and insolence of beauty.|$|R

5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the Ménagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E
25|$|A Gallup poll {{released}} on March 11, 2011, showed that nationwide, Americans {{were more likely}} to give unions a negative word or phrase when describing them (38%) than a positive word or phrase (34%). 17% were neutral and 12% didn't know. Republicans were much more likely <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> negative term (58%) than Democrats (19%). Democrats were much more likely <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> positive term (49%) than Republicans (18%).|$|E
25|$|Briefly, a densely defined linear {{operator}} A on a Hilbert space is self-adjoint if it equals its adjoint. That is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>A</b> is self-adjoint if (1) {{the domain of}} A coincides with {{the domain of the}} adjoint, and (2) the operator A agrees with its adjoint on this common domain.|$|E

25|$|In the Convention {{session of}} 27 July 1794 (9 Thermidor of Year II), Robespierre {{and his allies}} hardly managed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> word as they were {{constantly}} interrupted by a row of critics such as Tallien, Billaud-Varenne, Vadier, Barère and acting president Thuriot. Finally, even Robespierre's own voice failed on him: it faltered at his last attempt to beg permission to speak.|$|E
25|$|Chang met {{his wife}} Ann Simmons in 1966. He was the on-call {{emergency}} physician at St. Anthony's Hospital in North Cheam, London, where Ann took herself after being taken unwell at a party. They had three children: Vanessa, Matthew, and Marcus. Chang had two younger siblings: sister Frances and brother Anthony. He was irreligious but was known to ask Sister Bernie <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> prayer for his patients and {{was known for his}} compassion.|$|E

25|$|REM sleep {{has been}} {{observed}} in the pilot whale, a species of dolphin. Whales {{do not seem to}} have REM sleep, nor do they seem to have any problems because of this. One reason REM sleep might be difficult in marine settings is the fact that REM sleep causes muscular atony; that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> functional paralysis of skeletal muscles that can be difficult to combine with the need to breathe regularly.|$|E
25|$|Total CO2 {{emissions}} from energy use were 5% below their 1990 level in 2007. Over the period 1990–2007, CO2 {{emissions from}} energy use have decreased on average by 0.3%/year although the economic activity (GDP) increased by 2.3%/year. After dropping until 1994 (−1.6%/year), the CO2 emissions have increased steadily (0.4%/year on average) until 2003 and decreased slowly again since (on average by 0.6%/year). Total CO2 emissions per capita decreased from 8.7 t in 1990 to 7.8 t in 2007, that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> decrease by 10%.|$|E
25|$|Unami {{phonology}} {{is extremely}} complex, with various morphophonological rules, which is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>a</b> theoretical form will undergo {{a set of}} predictable phonological processes to produce the true form found in speech (there are some exceptions to these rules, however.) There are about 17 such rules common to both Munsee and Unami, and another 28 unique to Unami, though this analysis ignores predictable exceptions, such as the class of static words which may skip many of these rules. These rules govern things such as consonant lengthening/shortening, vowel syncopation, metathesis, vowel coloring, etc.|$|E

25|$|On May 17, 1928, while {{six years}} old, Kerouac {{had his first}} Confession. For penance he was told <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> rosary, during which he heard God {{tell him that he}} had a good soul, that he would suffer in life and die in pain and horror, but would in the end receive salvation. This experience, along with his dying brother's vision of the Virgin Mary (as the nuns fawned over him, {{convinced}} he was a saint), combined with a later study of Buddhism and an ongoing commitment to Christ, solidified the worldview which would inform Kerouac's work.|$|E
25|$|I {{would say}} that this problem of AIDS cannot be {{overcome}} merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it {{a new way of}} behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, William {{returned}} to London {{with his wife}} and two children (Frederick and Louise), on the occasion of The Great Exhibition. For the first time, Victoria met her future husband and, despite the age difference (she was eleven years old and he was nineteen), they got along very well. To promote the contact between the two, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert asked their daughter to guide Frederick through the exhibition, and during the visit the princess was able to converse in perfect German, while the prince was only able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> few words in English. The meeting was therefore a success, and, years later, Prince Frederick would recall the positive impression that Victoria made on him during this visit, with her mixture of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity.|$|E
50|$|Ayer defines {{truth as}} the {{criterion}} by which empirical propositions are validated. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> that <b>a</b> proposition is true {{is simply to}} assert it, and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>a</b> proposition is false is simply to assert a contradictory proposition. Thus, truth and falsehood are simply signs of assertion or denial of empirically verifiable propositions.|$|R
