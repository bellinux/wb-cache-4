5|$|Macedonistics (Македонистика) is a term, {{generally}} {{synonymous with}} disciplines such as {{study of the}} origins of <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> language and history of <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> people conducted in the Republic of Macedonia and in former Yugoslavia. It is generally considered in Bulgaria {{to be a kind of}} pseudoscience.|$|E

5|$|According to Diodorus, <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> army {{numbered}} roughly 30,000 {{infantry and}} 2,000 cavalry, a figure generally accepted by modern historians. Philip took {{command of the}} right wing of <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> army and placed his 18-year-old son Alexander (the future conqueror of the Persian Empire) in command of the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip's experienced generals.|$|E
50|$|The next day, <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians</b> built another {{bridge and}} {{attacked}} {{in a similar}} manner. However, {{during the course of}} <b>the</b> attack <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians</b> managed to kill the leader of the mercenaries. Consequentially, the Assacenians decided to negotiate their surrender.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> Second <b>Macedonian</b> War against <b>the</b> Romans, {{the troops}} of Phillip V and Athenagoras of Macedon {{attempted}} {{to delay the}} Roman consul, Titus Quinctius Flamininus. <b>The</b> <b>Macedonians</b> had secured <b>the</b> passage and then blocked the Roman advance in 198 BC. A shepherd {{is said to have}} led the Roman troops through the mountains, so that they could attack <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians</b> in <b>the</b> narrow gorge of two sides and destroy them. <b>The</b> <b>Macedonians</b> had been decisively defeated a first time. Later, the Romans used the route through the gorge of modern Këlcyrë and built a small settlement.|$|R
50|$|Although the Epirote League {{remained}} {{neutral in}} <b>the</b> first two <b>Macedonian</b> Wars, it was ultimately dismantled in <b>the</b> Third <b>Macedonian</b> War (171-168 BC), with the Molossians siding with <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians</b> and <b>the</b> Chaonians and Thesprotians supporting the Roman Republic.|$|R
5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. <b>The</b> <b>Macedonian</b> army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule {{over most of the}} territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by years of hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E

The services sector produces 60% of the city GDP.|$|E

50|$|What <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians</b> {{thought of}} these marriages {{is evident from}} the fact that the nobles all {{divorced}} their wives after Alexander's death, except Hephaestion, who died before Alexander, and Seleucus. So in spite of Alexander's precedent, <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians</b> were no more inclined to share equally with the Persians than before.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the flight}} of their monarch, the Pergamese fleet withdrew north. However, having been bested by the Rhodians on the allied right wing, <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> left wing {{disengaged}} and retreated to join its victorious right flank. The withdrawal of <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> left permitted the Rhodians to sail unmolested back into Chios' harbour.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{initiative}} of Philip II, Macedonian kings continued to expand and equip the navy. Cassander maintained a small fleet at Pydna, Demetrius I of Macedon had one at Pella, and Antigonus II Gonatas, while serving as a general for Demetrius in Greece, used the navy to secure <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> holdings in Demetrias, Chalkis, Piraeus, and Corinth. The navy was considerably expanded during the Chremonidean War (267–261 BC), allowing <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> navy to defeat the Ptolemaic Egyptian navy at the 255 BC Battle of Cos and 245 BC Battle of Andros, and enabling Macedonian influence to spread over the Cyclades. Antigonus III Doson used <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> navy to invade Caria, while Philip V allegedly sent two-hundred ships, some of them captured from the Ptolemies, {{to fight in the}} (unsuccessful) Battle of Chios in 201 BC. <b>The</b> <b>Macedonian</b> navy was reduced to a mere six vessels as agreed in the 197 BC peace treaty that concluded the Second Macedonian War with the Roman Republic, although Perseus of Macedon quickly assembled some lemboi at the outbreak of the Third Macedonian War in 171 BC.|$|E
5|$|In 336 BC, whilst the {{invasion}} of Persia was in its very early stage, Philip was assassinated in Aegae by the captain of his bodyguard, Pausanias, whilst attending the wedding of his daughter by Olympias, Cleopatra, to Olympias's brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) Alexander I of Epirus.

As <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> squadron was retreating, the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet, which had followed Philip's ships across the Aegean, appeared from the allied base at Aegina and attacked the Macedonians. The allies defeated <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> fleet and recaptured the Athenian ships, which {{they returned to the}} Athenians. The Athenians were so pleased by the rescue that they replaced the recently abolished pro-Macedonian tribes, the Demetrias and Antigonis tribes, with the Attalid tribe in honour of Attalus as well as destroying monuments that had previously been erected in honour of Macedonian Kings. Attalus and the Rhodians convinced the Athenian assembly to declare war on the Macedonians.|$|E

50|$|The Battle of Chaeronea {{was fought}} in 338 BC, {{near the city}} of Chaeronea in Boeotia, between <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians</b> led by Philip II of Macedon and an {{alliance}} of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes. The battle was the culmination of Philip's campaign in Greece (339-338 BC) and resulted in a decisive victory for <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 179 BC Philip died. His {{talented and}} ambitious son, Perseus, took the throne and showed a renewed {{interest}} in conquering Greece. With her Greek allies facing a major new threat, Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting <b>the</b> Third <b>Macedonian</b> War. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans. However, Rome responded by sending a stronger army. This second consular army decisively defeated <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians</b> at <b>the</b> Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and <b>the</b> <b>Macedonians</b> duly capitulated, ending the war.|$|R
5|$|The {{symposium}} in <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> {{and wider}} Greek realm was a banquet for the nobility and privileged class, {{an occasion for}} feasting, drinking, entertainment, and sometimes philosophical discussion. The hetairoi, leading members of <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> aristocracy, were expected to attend such feasts with their king. They were also expected to accompany him on royal hunts for the acquisition of game meat {{as well as for}} sport.|$|E
5|$|Under <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> emperors, {{the city}} of Constantinople flourished, {{becoming}} the largest and wealthiest city in Europe, {{with a population of}} approximately 400,000 in the 9th and 10th centuries. During this period, the Byzantine Empire employed a strong civil service staffed by competent aristocrats that oversaw the collection of taxes, domestic administration, and foreign policy. <b>The</b> <b>Macedonian</b> emperors also increased the Empire's wealth by fostering trade with Western Europe, particularly through the sale of silk and metalwork.|$|E
5|$|Antigonus, who {{had brought}} with him a large force of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through Euboea towards the Peloponnese. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality {{at that point in}} the war. Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He chose this location to avoid facing <b>the</b> <b>Macedonian</b> phalanx head-on.|$|E
