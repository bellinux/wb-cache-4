25|$|In Ireland, Anzac Day {{is remembered}} by the {{expatriate}} New Zealand and Australian communities. In {{the absence of}} an official World War I remembrance, and in honour of Irish soldiers who fought and perished in the Dardanelles and elsewhere, Anzac Day commemorations are also attended by members of veterans groups and historical societies, including the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, O.N.E.T., the Royal British Legion, UN Veterans, and more. Since the mid-1980s, an evening service has been organised by the New Zealand-Ireland Association, which currently takes place in St Ann's Church, Dawson St, Dublin 2. For the 90th anniversary in 2005, a daylight service was held {{for the first time in}} the re-furbished Grangegorman Military Cemetery, Dublin 7. A <b>Turkish</b> <b>Hazel</b> tree, planted by the Ambassadors of Australia, New Zealand and Turkey, commemorates this occasion. It can be found to the south of the limestone Memorial Wall.

5000|$|Corylus colurna {{is widely}} {{cultivated}} as an ornamental tree in Europe and North America. It is very tolerant of difficult growing conditions in urban situations, which {{has increased its}} popularity in civic planting schemes in recent decades. <b>Turkish</b> <b>hazel</b> makes a wonderful shade tree sinceit produces very dense shade, and its narrow crown and ability to withstand air-pollution make it well suited {{for use as a}} street tree in urban areas. It makes a rather formal statement in the landscape due to the tight, consistently-shaped, narrow crown. It is well suited for areas which have restricted overhead. [...] Corylus colurna is also used in different sized parking lot islands and a variety of wide lawns. It is recommended for a buffer strip around parking lots or highways. Also it is used as a street tree, specimen tree, or in sidewalk cut outs. [...] Other landscape uses for Corylus colurna are for fruit, difficult and dry sites, naturalistic areas, and street trees.|$|E

50|$|The Saxon Garden, {{covering}} {{an area of}} 15.5 ha, {{was formally}} a royal garden. There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are {{a place to sit}} and relax. At the east end of the park, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated. In the 19th century the Krasiński Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: maidenhair tree, black walnut, <b>Turkish</b> <b>hazel</b> and Caucasian wingnut trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasiński Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. Łazienki Park covers an area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. Wilanów Palace Park dates back to {{the second half of the}} 17th century. It covers an area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, Baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Królikarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out during 2002 - 2005 in the Regional Centre of Scientific Applied Service in Kardjali, Bulgaria. Two-year {{seedlings}} of Corylus colurna L. forms 21 / 7 and 29 / 5 were used as rootstocks and Halsky and Almond's filbert varieties as grafts. The grafting processes were performed through chip budding in spring and in summer. The following conclusions can be drawn as results of this study: the <b>Turkish</b> <b>hazel</b> rootstocks of forms 21 / 7 and 29 / 5 are highly vigorous and they have comparatively even sizes in the seedling plot. Grafting in spring is a perspective graft method for the variety-rootstock combination of <b>Turkish</b> <b>hazel</b> form 29 / 5 and Halsky variety. A large number of standard trees (4767) which was obtained from one decare in the nursery showed that the variety-rootstock combination consisting of hazel form 29 / 5 and Halsky variety was the optimum one {{and it could be}} applied in practice. The seedlings' features of form 21 / 7 induce further research work extension including other combinations with grafts of new varieties. </div...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{treatment}} {{is often used}} to improve the dimensional stability of wood. In this study, the effects of heat treatment on the physical properties and surface roughness of <b>Turkish</b> <b>Hazel</b> (Corylus colurna L.) wood were examined. Samples obtained from Kastamonu Forest Enterprises, Turkey, were subjected to heat treatment at varying temperatures and for different durations. The physical properties of heat-treated and control samples were tested, and oven-dry density, air-dry density, and swelling properties were determined. A stylus method was employed to evaluate the surface characteristics of the samples. Roughness measurements, using the stylus method, were made in the direction perpendicular to the fiber. Four main roughness parameters, mean arithmetic deviation of profile (Ra), mean peak-to-valley height (Rz), root mean square roughness (Rq), and maximum roughness (Ry) obtained from the surface of wood were used to evaluate the effect of heat treatment on the surface characteristics of the specimens. Significant difference was determined (p = 0. 05) between physical properties and surface roughness parameters (Ra,Rz, Ry, Rq) for three temperatures and three durations of heat treatment. The results showed that the values of density, swelling and surface roughness decreased with increasing temperature treatment and treatment times. <b>Turkish</b> <b>Hazel</b> wood could be utilized successfully by applying proper heat treatment techniques without any losses in investigated parameters.

The phenolics in the leaves, bark, catkins and involucre of C. colurna possess notable scavenger activity on both DPPH and ABTS free radicals. The total polyphenol content shows significant correlation with the antioxidant activity of the samples.

40|$|Eight {{selections}} of European filbert and <b>Turkish</b> <b>hazel</b> each were {{singled out for}} their prominent characteristics in an examination in Eastern Serbia over the 1998 - 2003 period. Coarseness, form and weight of nuts and kernels, as well as kernel chemical content, were analysed. Yielding potential was investigated {{as a proportion of}} nuts in filbert and hazel inflorescences. Average nut coarseness of the C. avellana L. selections was 18. 0 x 14. 7 x 12. 6 mm, and of C. colurnaL. 16. 3 xl 4. 0 x 11. 0 mm, while average kernel coarseness was 13. 3 x 9. 1 x 7. 6 mm and 13. 9 x 9. 7 x 6. 5 mm, respectively. Nut weight of the former was 1. 01 - 1. 80 g, and of the latter 1. 00 - 1. 75 g, while kernel weight ranged 0. 30 - 0. 79 g, and 0. 31 - 0. 65 g, respectively. The respective kernel contents were 27. 9 - 46. 2 %, and 30. 7 - 40. 8 %. The occurrence of shriveled nuts was minimal, appearing in six {{selections of}} C. avellana (0. 8 - 3. 1 %), and five selections of C. colurna (1. 4 - 5. 7 %). The pest Balaninus nucum was observed in only three selections of C. colurna L., ranging from 1. 0 to 1. 6 %. Oil content in the nuts of the selected C. avellana L. trees was 44. 6 - 49. 9 %, and 48. 6 - 54. 4 % in those of C. colurna L. Crude proteins amounted to 12. 3 - 10. 8 % and 11. 7 - 10. 4 %, and mineral matter content to 2. 8 - 2. 4 % and 2. 6 - 2. 0 %, respectively. The selections of European filbert were found to have 4 - 6 nuts to an inflorescence. Predominating were two (29. 4 %), one (26. 7 %) and three (24. 5 %) nuts to a single inflorescence. C. colurna L. inflorescences were found to contain 8 - 13 nuts. Most inflorescences had five (26. 6 %), four (21. 5 %) and six nuts (20. 3 %).
