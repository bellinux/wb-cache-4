Lewis' Mere Christianity, which is a rebuttal to the book Mere Christianity by the Christian apologist C.S. Lewis. In 2014, the WUD published its third book, God Gave Us Reason, Not Religion, which describes the difference between God and religion, and promotes innate reason as God's greatest gift to humanity, other than life itself. It proposes that people can have belief in The Supreme Intelligence/God <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> a reasonable doubt.|$|E
25|$|The term {{procedural}} impropriety {{was used}} by Lord Diplock in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GHCQ case", 1984) to explain that a public authority could be acting ultra vires (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>beyond</b> the power given to it by statute) if it commits a serious procedural error. His Lordship regarded procedural impropriety as one of three broad categories of judicial review, the other two being illegality and irrationality. Procedural impropriety generally encompasses two things: procedural ultra vires, where administrative decisions are challenged because a decision-maker has overlooked or failed to properly observe statutory procedural requirements; and common law rules of natural justice and fairness. United Kingdom administrative law has {{played a significant role}} in helping to shape Singapore law in this area, given the weight accorded to UK cases by the courts in Singapore.|$|E

500|$|Because many of {{the primary}} {{accounts}} contradict each other at times, {{it is impossible to}} provide a description of the battle <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> dispute. The only undisputed facts are that the fighting began at 9am on Saturday 14 October 1066 and that the battle lasted until dusk. Sunset {{on the day of the}} battle was at 4:54pm, with the battlefield mostly dark by 5:54pm and in full darkness by 6:24pm. Moonrise that night was not until 11:12pm, so once the sun set, there was little light on the battlefield. William of Jumièges reports that Duke William kept his army armed and ready against a surprise night attack for the entire night before. The battle took place [...] north of Hastings at the present-day town of Battle, between two hills– Caldbec Hill to the north and Telham Hill to the south. The area was heavily wooded, with a marsh nearby. The name traditionally given to the battle is unusual– there were several settlements much closer to the battlefield than Hastings. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle called it the battle [...] "at the hoary apple tree". Within 40 years, the battle was described by the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis as [...] "Senlac", a Norman-French adaptation of the Old English word [...] "Sandlacu", which means [...] "sandy water". This may have been the name of the stream that crosses the battlefield. The battle was already being referred to as [...] "bellum Hasestingas" [...] or [...] "Battle of Hastings" [...] by 1087, in the Domesday Book.|$|E
500|$|In Yong Vui Kong, the Court {{described}} the clemency power in Singapore as vested {{exclusively in the}} executive, and thus not justiciable on the merits. Despite this, {{it is not an}} [...] "extra-legal" [...] power <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> any legal constraints. Agreeing with Tan Guat Neo Phyllis, the Court held that the clemency power is subject to judicial review if it can be shown to have been exercised unconstitutionally, in bad faith or for extraneous purposes. In addition, the fact that Article22P(2) of the Constitution stipulates specific procedural safeguards in death penalty cases indicates that the clemency power must be reviewable to ensure that these safeguards have been complied with. Article22P(2) requires documents from the trial judge and the appellate court, and the Attorney-General's opinion on the case, to be sent to the Cabinet for consideration so that it can advise the President on the exercise of the clemency power. These procedural requirements imply that Cabinet has a constitutional duty to consider the documents in good faith before advising the President. If evidence is adduced to show that the Cabinet did not consider the offender's case impartially and in good faith (for example, it never met to discuss the case, or tossed a coin instead of properly considering the materials transmitted to it), Cabinet would have breached Article22P(2). In such a situation, the courts must be able to review the clemency decision. This conclusion is also mandated by the guarantee in Article 9(1) of the Constitution that a person may not be deprived of either life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World gave it minor {{praise and}} short {{summary of the}} film, {{but it does not}} {{evaluate}} or describe the special camera effects used to produce the film. The reviewer states: [...] "To see the doll and the pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes the little girl to whom they belong surprise. The good times they have with the fairy's help will long remain in her memory, even though it is only a dream." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was critical of the production, stating [...] "This sounds as if it ought to be very clever, but aside from the work of the little heroine and the dance of the fairies it is entirely uninspired. It needs a drastic application of imagination. The broad idea is excellent, but the details of the management indicate impoverished resources. When the aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment, but this film doesn't get away from stolid realities. For example, nobody could imagine anything more earthly than the outside of the house from which the little girl escaped with the fairy queen and her comrades. That should have been treated fancifully. The events pictured don't amount to anything; there is a sameness about them, nothing surprising happens, and not very much that is pretty. Worst of all is the poetry(?), which is interpolated to explain the narrative; <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> criticism. The Thanhouser Company has missed good opportunities in this film." [...] The strange inclusion of the question mark after poetry is not a note by Bowers, for it was actually written into the review itself in the edition. Though no other review mentions poetry.|$|E
