5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there {{does not seem to have}} been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E

25|$|Ervin Nyiregyházi (January 19, 1903, BudapestApril 8, 1987, Los Angeles) was a Hungarian-born American {{pianist and}} composer. After several {{years on the}} concert stage in the 1920s, he descended into {{relative}} obscurity before briefly reemerging in the 1970s. His highly distinctive playing style, which has been seen {{by some as a}} link <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Romantic pianism associated with Franz Liszt, divided critical opinion.|$|E

25|$|In modern {{solid-state}} physics, it {{is common}} to classify systems according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> degrees of freedom they have available, like electron (metals) or spin (magnetism). In crystals that can display the JTE, and before this effect is realised by symmetry-breaking distortions, it is found that there exists an orbital degree of freedom consisting of how electrons occupy the local degenerate orbitals. As initially discussed by Kugel and Khomskii, not all configurations are equivalent. The key is the relative orientation of these occupied orbital, {{in the same way that}} spin orientation is important in magnetic systems, and the ground state can only be realised for some particular orbital pattern. Both this pattern and the effect giving rise to this phenomenon is usually denominated orbital-ordering.|$|E
25|$|The visible {{graphical}} interface {{features of}} an application are {{sometimes referred to}} as chrome or GUI (pronounced gooey). Typically, users interact with information by manipulating visual widgets that allow for interactions appropriate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> data they hold. The widgets of a well-designed interface are selected to support the actions necessary to achieve the goals of users. A model–view–controller allows a flexible structure in which the interface is independent from and indirectly linked to application functions, so the GUI can be customized easily. This allows users to select or design a different skin at will, and eases the designer's work to change the interface as user needs evolve. Good user interface design relates to users more, and to system architecture less.|$|E

25|$|Singapore {{was once}} the {{powerhouse}} of sophisticated Malay cultural production, until Kuala Lumpur took over in the 1970s. Although usually thought of as an essentially Chinese city, Singapore was nevertheless a Malay city. Contrary to the stereotype, Malays were the most urbanised of the island's three main races, {{and there was no}} such concentration of urbanised Malays anywhere else in the Malay world. Here were produced a high proportion of the modernist Malay writings, including novels and newspapers, that generated Malay nationalism. The emergence of Singapore-Malay community was added to by intermarriage with Arabs, Indian Muslims and Peninsula Malays immigrants, as well as the adoption of Chinese babies. In other words, Singapore's Malayness was a creolised culture, closer in character to the Pesisir (coastal) Malay culture that had developed elsewhere in the archipelago than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Malayness that characterised the Malay world proper of Peninsula and Sumatra. In Singapore itself, assimilation to Malayness was and is purely cultural, with no guiding hand to police it.|$|E
25|$|The {{merits of}} plaintiffs' claims pose {{important}} questions {{relating to the}} propriety of actions undertaken by our highest government officials. Defendants' motions, however, raise issues that the Court is obliged to address before it can consider the merits of plaintiffs' claims. As it turns out, the Court will not reach, and therefore expresses no views on, {{the merits of the}} constitutional and other tort claims asserted by plaintiffs based on defendants' alleged disclosures because the motions to dismiss will be granted...The alleged means by which defendants chose to rebut Mr. Wilson's comments and attack his credibility may have been highly unsavory. But there can be no serious dispute that the act of rebutting public criticism, such as that levied by Mr. Wilson against the Bush Administration's handling of prewar foreign intelligence, by speaking with members of the press is within the scope of defendants' duties as high-level Executive Branch officials. Thus, the alleged tortious conduct, namely the disclosure of Mrs. Wilson's status as a covert operative, was incidental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> conduct that defendants were employed to perform.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} {{how teachers}} {{can make a}} difference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> literacy young people take up. Increasingly, researchers and policy-makers see literacy as an ensemble of socio-cultural situated practices rather than as a unitary skill. Accordingly, the differences in what young people come to do with literacy, in and out of school, confront us more directly. If literacy development involves assembling dynamic repertoires of practices, it is crucial to consider what different groups of children growing up and going to school in different places have access to and make investments in over time; <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> literate communities from which some are excluded or included; and how educators make a difference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> literate trajectories and identities young people put together...|$|R
