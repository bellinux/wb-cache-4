50|$|CNC {{plunge milling}} {{is often called}} z-axis milling also. In this process, the feed is {{provided}} linearly along the <b>tool</b> <b>axis</b> while doing CNC processing. Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting force coefficient with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling. The cutting force and machine stability both are influenced by machining parameters. Frequency domain model can be used to estimate the machining stability.|$|E

40|$|The Rock Baller is {{a sample}} {{acquisition}} tool that improves sample retention. The {{basic elements of}} the Rock Baller are the <b>tool</b> rotation <b>axis,</b> the hub, the two jaws, and the cutting blades, which are located {{on each of the}} jaws. The entire device rotates about the <b>tool</b> rotation <b>axis,</b> which is aligned parallel to the nominal normal direction of the parent rock surface. Both jaws also rotate about the jaw axis, which is perpendicular to the <b>tool</b> rotation <b>axis,</b> at a rate much slower than the rotation about the <b>tool</b> rotation <b>axis.</b> This movement gradually closes the jaws into a nearly continuous hemispherical shell that encloses the sample as it is cut from the parent rock. When required the jaws are opened to release the sample. The hemispherical cutting method eliminates the sample retention problems associated with existing sample acquisition methods that employ conventional cylindrical cutting. The resulting samples are hemispherical, or nearly hemispherical, and as a result the aspect ratio (sample depth relative to sample radius) is essentially fixed. This fixed sample aspect ratio may be considered a drawback of the Rock Baller method, as samples with a higher aspect ratio (more depth, less width) may be considered more scientifically valuable because such samples would allow for a broader inspection of the geological record. This aspect ratio issue can be ameliorated if the Rock Baller is paired with a device similar to the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) used on the Mars Exploration Rovers. The RAT could be used to first grind into the surface of the parent rock, after which the Rock Baller would extract a sample from a depth inside the rock {{that would not have been}} possible without first using the RAT.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{deals with}} {{problems}} of <b>tool</b> <b>axis</b> inclination angles in ball-end milling. <b>Tool</b> <b>axis</b> inclination angle contributes to improvement of functional surface properties (surface integrity-surface roughness, residual stress, micro hardness, etc.), decreasing cutting forces and improving production. By milling with ball-end milling tool, using standard way of cutting, when work piece and cutting tool contain right angle, we have zero cutting speed on edge. At this point cutting tool only pushes material {{into the work}} piece. Here we can observe the following undesirable effects- chip contraction, increasing of cutting temperature, increasing vibrations or creation of built-up edge. These effects have negative results – low quality of surface and decreasing of tool life (in the worse case even it is pinching out). These effects can be eliminated with the tilt of cutting tool or tilt of work piece. Very important is direction of feed. If the feed is designated as pulled, the tool runs silently, and also the surface of work piece improves, as opposed to pushed tool [5]. These two ways {{can be used with}} the <b>tool</b> <b>axis</b> inclination angle in feed direction and also in pick feed direction.
