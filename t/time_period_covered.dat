25|$|Discussion {{regarding}} the historicity of the Book of Mormon often focuses on archaeological issues, {{some of which}} relate to the large size and the long time span of the civilizations mentioned in the book. A contemporary Mormon view is that these civilizations rose and fell in Mesoamerica. Civilizations of their magnitude and duration {{would be expected to}} leave extensive archaeological records. Several Mesoamerican civilizations did exist in the <b>time</b> <b>period</b> <b>covered</b> by the Book of Mormon, including the Olmec, Zapotec and Maya. The Olmec and Zapotec civilizations developed a writing system that may have served as the model for the later Mayan writing system, which became highly developed. The Maya developed a complex calendar and were advanced in astronomy and mathematics.|$|E

40|$|Using 59 studies, we {{perform a}} meta-regression {{analysis}} of studies examining {{the relationship between}} inflation and central bank independence (CBI).

We conclude that there is a significant publication bias. However, we also find a significant genuine effect of CBI on inflation.

50|$|The {{eruption}} {{that formed}} Mauna Ulu began on May 24, 1969 and continued until July 22, 1974.

Lava flowed {{down the sides of}} the feature and large lava fountains (Including one 539.5 meter high fountain) were witnessed.

The distributions of the parameters, except for the polar flow direction, are skewed, partially because of stream-stream interactions in the solar wind. The average values of the basic plasma parameters from the two spacecraft are different which could be due partially to different solar activity at the two times, and partially to sector and beam structure dependence...|$|R

40|$|This book chapter {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an empirical study of German and U. K. patent litigation involving patent assertion entities (PAEs).

We also present a variety of additional data {{on the characteristics of}} European PAE suits and PAE-asserted patents and, finally, consider what our findings suggest are the most important reasons PAEs tend to avoid European courts. We conclude that, while many factors likely contribute to the relative scarcity of PAEs in Europe, the continent’s fee-shifting regimes stand out as a key deterrent to patent monetization...|$|R
50|$|The major {{analysis}} of the Parian Chronicle is that of Felix Jacoby, written in the early 20th century. This appeared in two works: his book Das Marmor Parium published in 1904, and {{as a part of}} the Fragmente der griechischen Historiker, first published in 1929. There has been no major study devoted to the entire stele since that time, although a few authors have dealt with specific <b>time</b> <b>periods</b> <b>covered</b> in the tablet. Furthermore, there apparently have been no critical studies of the original text on the stele itself since the work of Jacoby, as evidenced by the fact that the display of the Greek text on the Ashmolean Web site is a photocopy of the text that Jacoby published in his Fragmente.|$|R

The <b>time</b> <b>period</b> <b>covers</b> a span, which begins in 1892 with the high school graduation of Elinor White and Robert Frost and ends shortly after her death. Mrs. Frost was a highly intelligent, sensitive woman whose nature complemented that of her husband, and interspersed throughout the narrative are critical analyses of poems that reflect her influence. Sources of information about Elinor include unpublished letters and interviews. ...|$|R
