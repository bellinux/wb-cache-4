500|$|The {{usage of}} an audio sample from Space Shuttle Challenger {{disaster}} {{at the beginning}} of the song was criticized by the families of the lost crew, NASA, and some media. Beyoncé released a statement saying that the song was intended <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have lost loved people in their lives and that the sample was included as a tribute to the Challenger crew.

50|$|Journalism analysts {{argue that}} the media has caused {{widespread}} compassion fatigue in society by saturating newspapers and news shows with often decontextualized images and stories of tragedy and suffering.

500|$|Electric {{toothbrushes}} are {{a popular}} aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, {{and with good}} motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: [...] "Electric toothbrushes tend <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are not as good at cleaning teeth {{and as a result}} have had oral hygiene problems." [...] The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

The team hoped to use the trailer as a piece of [...] "artwork", stating influence from the Carousel trailer from Philips. The trailer was also designed to showcase [...] "great zombie moments" [...] in an effort to attract the genre's supporters. The actual game development team used the trailer to build up the mood and atmosphere for the game, and they designed quests which required players <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had lost their families. They hoped that the mood would make players feel that they were the only hope existing on the island.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wider}} countercultural {{context of the}} time, with disillusion {{increasingly}} rife with each post-Woodstock rock event, commentators viewed the concerts as, {{in the words of}} Rolling Stone, [...] "a brief incandescent revival of all that was best about the Sixties". Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden likened it to a [...] "rediscovery of faith", adding: [...] "Harrison had put rock music back on course." [...] Among Harrison's biographers, Alan Clayson describes the 1971–72 period covering the concerts and their associated releases as [...] "the George Harrison Moment", while Gary Tillery has written: [...] "The Concert for Bangladesh sealed Harrison's stature as something more than just a major celebrity... He changed the perception of recording artists, making it clear they could be good world citizens too – willing to set aside their egos and paychecks in order <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were suffering." ...|$|E

50|$|The Valkenburg Resistance was the {{resistance}} movement in Valkenburg, Limburg, Netherlands, during World War II. Most {{of the activities}} were related <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had gone into hiding for various reasons. Going into hiding was dangerous, but so was keeping people in hiding. Especially hiding United States soldiers was risky {{because they had no}} sense of the danger and had a reputation of making too much noise. Hiding Jews was even punishable by death and one third of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> hid Jews did not survive the war.|$|R
50|$|We {{should have}} no talk of profit when it comes <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are sick. The profit motive should be nowhere {{involved}} in this. And you know what? It's not fair to the insurance companies either {{because they have a}} fiduciary responsibility to make as much money as they can for their shareholders. Well, the way they make more money is to deny claims or to kick people off the rolls or to not even let people on the rolls because they have a pre-existing condition. You know, all of that is wrong.|$|R

[...] Officials of Guangdong province, {{along with many}} lawyers and social workers, also held three days of meetings in the provincial capital of Guangzhou to discuss the case.

[...] Legal experts and the public are debating the idea ahead of discussions and a legislative push. On 1 August 2013, the nation's first good Samaritan law went into effect in Shenzhen.|$|E

2500|$|In Australia the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) {{is a joint}} Commonwealth {{and state}} {{government}} program [...] which provides funding for more than 1,200 organisations which are aimed to assist homeless people or those {{in danger of becoming}} homeless, as well as women and children escaping domestic violence. They provide accommodation such as refuges, shelters, and half-way houses, and offer a range of supported services. The Commonwealth has assigned over $800 million between 2000 and 2005 for the continuation of SAAP. The current program, governed by the Supported Assistance Act 1994, specifies that [...] "the overall aim of SAAP is to provide transitional supported accommodation and related support services, in order <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are homeless to achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence. This legislation has been established to help the homeless people of the nation and help rebuild the lives of those in need. The cooperation of the states also helps enhance the meaning of the legislation and demonstrates their desire to improve the nation as best they can. In 2011, the Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) program replaced the SAAP program.|$|E
2500|$|On April 29, 2008, McCain {{detailed}} {{his health}} care plan {{in the context of}} his campaign for president. His plan focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. At the heart of his plan are tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or {{do not have access to}} health care through their employer. He says the money could be used to purchase insurance and force insurance companies to be competitive with their costs in order to attract consumers. <b>To</b> <b>help</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain would work with states to create what he calls a [...] "Guaranteed Access Plan". He did not provide details, but pointed to states such as Florida and North Carolina where such systems are in place. His health care plan has an estimated annual cost of $7 billion, according to McCain's health-policy experts. On April 30, his campaign acknowledged that the health plan he had outlined would have the effect of increasing tax payments for some workers, primarily those with high incomes and expensive health plans.|$|E
