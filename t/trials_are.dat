5|$|Arlie R. Slabaugh, in his 1975 {{volume on}} commemoratives, {{noted that a}} uniface die trial of the reverse in brass was made. Swiatek in 2012 stated that both obverse and reverse die <b>trials</b> <b>are</b> known. The edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins {{published}} in 2015 lists the half dollar at between $130 and $650 depending on condition; a near-pristine specimen sold for $2,115 in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Baclofen, a GABAB {{receptor}} agonist, {{is under}} {{study for the}} treatment of alcoholism. A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of baclofen for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism.

5|$|Like all {{industrial}} processes, {{injection moulding}} can produce flawed parts. In {{the field of}} injection moulding, troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects with {{the design of the}} mould or the characteristics of the process itself. <b>Trials</b> <b>are</b> often performed before full production runs in an effort to predict defects and determine the appropriate specifications to use in the injection process.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Sell {{was found}} {{competent}} to stand <b>trial</b> and <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> scheduled. A {{week before the}} <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> to begin, the prosecution and defense claimed that he was mentally unfit for trial and the <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> continued.|$|R

The <b>trial</b> date of June 22, 2015 was subsequently restored. Vann's attorneys requested that the <b>trial</b> <b>be</b> delayed, and the <b>trial</b> <b>was</b> again delayed to January 25, 2016. In December 2015, Lake Superior Court Judge Diane Ross Boswell recused herself from hearing the case. Judge Samuel Cappas subsequently said {{he would take the}} case.

5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published <b>trials</b> <b>are</b> promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} {{after the end of the}} Battle of Vukovar, there were 2,000 detainees in the camp. Detainees usually spent several days in the camp, during which some of them were interrogated, beaten and killed. Up to 10,000 detainees passed through the camp before it was closed in March 1992, when the United Nations Protection Force {{deployed}} to the area. Anywhere between 15 and 800 inmates may have been killed at the camp, though the latter figure includes approximately 700 people who are missing and presumed dead. The events in the camp formed part of three indictments issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. , two of the <b>trials</b> <b>are</b> ongoing, while the trial of Slobodan Milošević was terminated following his death.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian {{criminal}} justice system, {{noted that the}} criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed {{of the crime of}} which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most <b>trials</b> <b>are</b> held in secret, that is, without the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E
