They noted the game's high difficulty level, saying that the game [...] "threw up an immense challenge even for the veteran gamer, and almost dared you to complete it mentally and physically intact".

After {{the release of}} Valkyria Chronicles II, the staff <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at both the popular response for the game and {{what they wanted to}} do next for the series. Like its predecessor, Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable: this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II, and they had not come up with the [...] "revolutionary" [...] idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3. Speaking in an interview, it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series' first true sequel: while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move, the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform. In addition to Sega staff from the previous games, development work was also handled by Media.Vision. The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe, while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii, Koichi Majima, Kishiko Miyagi, Seiki Nagakawa and Takayuki Shouji. Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor.|$|E
