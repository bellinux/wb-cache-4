5|$|The Maudsley–Bethlem {{study also}} {{hypothesized}} that schizophrenia {{was caused by}} a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis. Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment and chance elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. Molecular-biological studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of psychopathology. The researchers also examined how schizoids, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics. The researchers had hypothesized that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene, one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The <b>twin</b> <b>study</b> did not confirm this.|$|E

25|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>studies,</b> {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism. Evidence from <b>twin</b> <b>studies</b> show that concordance rates for alcoholism are higher for monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins—76% for monozygotic twins and 61% for dizygotic twins. However, female <b>twin</b> <b>studies</b> demonstrate that females have much lower concordance rates than males. Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers. <b>Twin</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that males {{are more likely to have}} a genetic predisposition for alcoholism. However, this does not suggest that a male who does have a genetic predisposition will become an alcoholic. Sometimes the individual may never encounter an environmental trigger that leads to alcoholism.|$|R

25|$|A <b>twin</b> <b>study</b> found {{evidence}} that genetics account for {{approximately half of the}} measurable differences in loneliness among adults, which was similar to the heritability estimates found previously in children.

Concordance rates between monozygotic twins vary in different studies, approximately 50%; whereas dizygotic twins was 17%. Some <b>twin</b> <b>studies</b> have found rates as low as 11.0% - 13.8% among monozygotic twins, and 1.8% - 4.1% among dizygotic twins, however.|$|R

Adjusting for the effects of education 79% of executive function can be explained by genetic contribution. A study combining twin and adoption studies found all cognitive functions to be heritable. Speed of processing had the highest heritability in this particular study.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 <b>twin</b> <b>study</b> {{found that}} one in three women {{reported}} never or seldom achieving orgasm during sexual intercourse, and only one in ten always orgasmed.

The study, examining 4000 women, was published in Biology Letters, a Royal Society journal. Elisabeth Lloyd has cited this as evidence for the notion that female orgasm is not adaptive.|$|E

25|$|It can be {{seen from}} the {{modeling}} above, the main assumption of the <b>twin</b> <b>study</b> is that of equal environments, also known as the equal environments assumption. This assumption has been directly tested. A special case occurs where parents believe their twins to be non-identical when in fact they are genetically identical. Studies of a range of psychological traits indicate that these children remain as concordant as MZ twins raised by parents who treated them as identical.|$|E
500|$|In {{discussing}} the neurobiological basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a seven-year <b>twin</b> <b>study,</b> {{it has been}} suggested that the roots of various forms of psychopathology, including RAD, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be found in disturbances in affect regulation. The subsequent development of higher-order self-regulation is jeopardized and the formation of internal models is affected. Consequently, the [...] "templates" [...] in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted. The potential for [...] "re-regulation" [...] (modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range) in the presence of [...] "corrective" [...] experiences (normative caregiving) seems possible.|$|E
500|$|Analyzing {{the results}} of the Maudsley–Bethlem study, Gottesman and Shields devised the multi-element, {{polygenic}} causation model for schizophrenia by modeling schizophrenia diagnoses using the recently introduced liability-threshold model. The book that summarized and expanded on the study, Schizophrenia and Genetics: A <b>Twin</b> <b>Study</b> Vantage Point, argued that schizophrenia is a product of several genes acting together, and introduced the techniques of precise analysis in the field of behavioral genetics.Gottesman and Shields introduced terms such as [...] "reaction ranges/surface", [...] "endophenotype" [...] and [...] "epigenetic puzzle" [...] into the behavioral sciences. The threshold model hypothesized that both genetic and environmental risks combined to produce schizophrenia, and pushed an individual into a diagnosable condition when their influence grew strong enough. The reaction range concept is the idea that the genes and the environment control behavior, but with separate upper and lower limits on the strength of that control in each case, a concept now part of basic psychology. Before the study, the prevailing opinion was that schizophrenia originated from bad parental relationships. The researchers showed identical twins were more likely to either have or not have schizophrenia together, concluding the disorder was the [...] "outcome of a genetically determined developmental predisposition".|$|E

2500|$|While the <b>twin</b> <b>study</b> {{tells us}} only how genes and {{families}} affect behavior within the observed range of environments, {{and with the}} caveat that often genes and environments will covary, this is a considerable advance over the alternative, which is {{no knowledge of the}} different roles of genes and environment whatsoever.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the major <b>twin</b> <b>studies</b> {{of eating disorders}} in order to consider the empirical standing of the suggestion that these disorders, notably bulimia nervosa, are largely genetically determined. METHOD: Examination of the relevant <b>twin</b> <b>studies</b> and the methods used. RESULTS: The findings of the <b>twin</b> <b>studies</b> are inconsistent and difficult to interpret, with estimates for the heritability of liability to bulimia nervosa ranging from 0 % to 83 %, and from 0 % to 70 % for anorexia nervosa. Methodological reasons for this variability include issues of definition of phenotype, diagnostic reliability, violation of the equal environments assumption, and small sample sizes. Many of these issues also apply to <b>twin</b> <b>studies</b> of other psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The heritability of eating disorders remains unknown. A broad view on the etiology of eating disorders should be maintained, {{with a focus on}} environmental mechanisms and gene-environment interactions, as well as continuing genetic studies...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>twin</b> <b>study</b> method, scholars have used gene association studies to analyze voter turnout.
