They come to the castle and urge Robin to renounce his life of crime. When Robin asserts {{that he has done}} no wrong yet, <b>they</b> <b>remind</b> him that he is morally responsible for all the crimes Despard had done in his stead. Realising the extent of his guilt, Robin resolves to defy his ancestors.|$|E
500|$|The songs {{featured}} in the episode from the actual Sweeney Todd musical are [...] "The Ballad of Sweeney Todd", [...] "Johanna", and [...] "By the Sea". Erin accidentally references The Baby-Sitters Club, a series of novels by Ann M. Martin, when talking about breaking into the babysitting business in Scranton. Michael brings balloons to the musical, Phyllis notes that <b>they</b> <b>remind</b> her of the 2009 Pixar film Up. Jim mentions that trying to put CeCe to sleep reminds him of the 2008 war film The Hurt Locker. The ending scene features Michael auditioning for the musical by re-acting an entire episode of the American police procedural and legal drama television series Law & Order, complete with opening monologue, theme music, and the show's notable [...] "Clang" [...] sound effect. Andy sings Macy Gray's single [...] "I Try" [...] {{with the rest of}} the office to cheer himself up at the end of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Bianca Castafiore is {{an opera}} singer of whom Haddock is terrified. She was first {{introduced}} in King Ottokar's Sceptre and seems to appear wherever the protagonists travel, along with her maid Irma and pianist Igor Wagner. She is comically foolish, whimsical, absent-minded, and talkative, and seems unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud. Her speciality is the Jewel Song ( [...] / Ah! My beauty past compare, [...] these jewels bright I wear) from [...] opera, Faust, which she sings at the least provocation, much to Haddock's dismay. She is often maternal toward Haddock, of whose dislike she remains ignorant. She often confuses words, especially names, with other words that rhyme with them or of which <b>they</b> <b>remind</b> her; [...] "Haddock" [...] is frequently replaced by malapropisms such as [...] "Paddock", [...] "Stopcock", or [...] "Hopscotch", while Nestor, Haddock's butler, is confused with [...] "Chestor" [...] and [...] "Hector". Her own name means [...] "white and chaste flower": a meaning to which Professor Calculus once refers when he breeds a white rose and names it for the singer. She was based upon opera divas in general (according to Hergé's perception), Hergé's Aunt Ninie (who was known for her [...] "shrill" [...] singing of opera), and, in the post-war comics, on Maria Callas.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} several months, the ship was {{upgraded}} with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four Mk 141 quad cell launchers for 16 RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Mk 143 Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close In Weapon System Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. During the modernization Missouris [...] bell, which {{had been removed from}} the battleship and sent to Jefferson City, Missouri for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning. Missouri was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986. [...] "This is a day to celebrate the rebirth of American sea power," [...] Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger told an audience of 10,000 at the recommissioning ceremony, instructing the crew to [...] "listen for the footsteps of those who have gone before you. They speak to you of honor and the importance of duty. <b>They</b> <b>remind</b> you of your own traditions." [...] Also present at the recommissioning ceremony was Missouri governor John Ashcroft, U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein, and Margaret Truman, (who christened the ship in 1943) gave a short speech especially aimed at the ship's crew, which ended with [...] "now take care of my baby". [...] Her remarks were met with rounds of sincere applause from the crew.|$|E
500|$|When he escapes the {{building}} and enters the mall, Hall feels he is disturbed by advertisements calling to him by name {{not only because they}} will give away his presence, but also because <b>they</b> <b>remind</b> him of his lost place in society, and he begins [...] "to see through the false consciousness his (illusory) previous position as fixed subject had allowed him." [...] Spielberg said that Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern for anything but the effectiveness of the PreCrime program. [...] "He's dirtied {{by the fact that he}} doesn't spend much time thinking about the moral consequences. It's just like a sporting event almost — and then suddenly that whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball." [...] His doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself according to Hall. He runs through his role in the PreCrime system, and his son's disappearance [...] "to reconstruct his past." [...] After Leo Crow in fact kills himself, Anderton becomes healed, and later has [...] "recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer." [...] Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self-image, Anderton is not the same person, as he not longer believes in the PreCrime system. Hall says that Burgess' final dilemma; namely, his desire to keep PreCrime running, his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton, and his desire to live, drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide. [...] "Burgess has been left truly alone by events," [...] argues Hall. [...] "His wife fainted when she saw the images of the murder and Anderton has been the cause of this rupture." ...|$|E
500|$|In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo's furious manhood overpowers {{everything}} [...] "feminine" [...] in his life, {{including his}} own conscience. For example, when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son, he asks himself: [...] "When did you become a shivering old woman?" [...] It is also argued that one’s chi, or personal god, is the ‘mother within’. This understanding further demonstrates how Okonkwo’s hypermasculinity corrupts his conscience, as his contempt for his own mother and other women prevents him from being in harmony with his chi. He views all things feminine as distasteful, in part because <b>they</b> <b>remind</b> him of his father's laziness and cowardice. His father was considered an agbala—a word that refers to a man without title, but is also synonymous with ‘woman’. Thus, Okonkwo not only regrets his father’s lack of success, but attributes it {{to a lack of}} masculinity. Okonkwo’s feminization of all things lacking success or power is a common theme throughout the novel. His obsession with maleness is fuelled by an intense fear of femaleness, which he expresses through physical and verbal abuse of his wives, his violence towards his community, his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough, and his wish that his daughter Ezinma had been born a boy. The women in the novel, meanwhile, are obedient, quiet, and absent from positions of authority– despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership. Nevertheless, the need for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani, the earth goddess, and the extended discussion of [...] "Nneka" [...] ("Mother is supreme") in chapter fourteen. Ekwefi’s perseverance and love for Ezinma, despite her many miscarriages, is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood, which is typically defined by motherhood. Okonkwo's defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos. Some have also argued that all of Okonkwo’s failures are tied to his contempt and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life—his wives, his children, and his own mother. Achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point, saying that [...] "I want to sort of scream that Things Fall Apart {{is on the side of}} women... And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women; that all his problems, all the things he did wrong, can be seen as offenses against the feminine." [...] Indeed, it is argued that Okonkwo’s violent and vehement anti-women position is the exception, not the norm, within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society. Still, post-colonial African writing is intensely male-centred, a phenomenon that is not alleviated by the frequent trope of the African woman as the [...] "embodiment of the male writer’s vision for the new Africa". It is argued that even when women and their lives are more centrally depicted in literature, the male writer continues to be the visionary while the woman is the [...] "sign" [...] of changes to come.|$|E

2500|$|Before opening night, {{the third}} and fourth yeomen's couplets in the Act I finale – in which <b>they</b> <b>remind</b> [...] "Leonard" [...] of his brave deeds – were cut, though they {{remained}} in the vocal score until around the 1920s. The third yeoman had also joined Fairfax when he tells the Lieutenant that the prisoner has escaped. When the solo couplets were cut, the third yeoman was deleted from this passage as well, leaving it a trio for Fairfax and two other yeomen.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2015, Washington Post {{associate}} editor and investigative journalist Bob Woodward, {{when asked about}} Clinton's handling of her emails, said <b>they</b> <b>remind</b> him of the Nixon tapes from the Watergate scandal. On March 9, 2015, liberal columnist and Clinton supporter Dana Milbank wrote that the email affair was [...] "a needless, self-inflicted wound" [...] brought about by [...] "debilitating caution" [...] in [...] "trying to make sure an embarrassing e-mail or two didn't become public", which led to [...] "obsessive secrecy." [...] Milibank pointed out that Clinton herself had justifiably criticized the George W. Bush administration in 2007 for its [...] "secret" [...] White House email accounts.|$|E

[...] They demand that Paramount revoke the changes, and when he refuses, <b>they</b> <b>remind</b> him of their power over his life ("If you think that when banded in unity"). [...] But the King points out that they cannot blow up a limited company. [...] Scaphio and Phantis plot with Tarara on how to reverse the course of events and retire ("With wily brain").|$|E

2500|$|Bordwell {{has called}} the film opaque with {{characters}} {{that are difficult to}} interpret, unexplained conflicts, and major plot points that occur off-camera. Godard also sometimes frames characters to make them unrecognizable to the audience, films scenes with overlapping dialogue of characters on and off screen, and uses ellipses in scenes to create gaps in time. He also sometimes cuts to black frames, objects in the scene, or landscapes while dialogue from the scene is still heard. These techniques make the film both difficult to interpret and to comprehend. Bordwell believes [...] "we ought to find problems of comprehension fascinating. <b>They</b> <b>remind</b> us of storytelling conventions we take for granted, and they push toward other ways of spinning yarns, or unraveling them." [...] Bordwell believes that [...] "blocking or troubling our story-making process serves to re-weight the individual image and sound. When we can't easily tie what we see and hear to an ongoing plot, we're coaxed to savor each moment as a micro-event in itself, like a word in a poem or a patch of color in a painting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Portugal, {{children}} go {{from house to}} house in All Saints day and All Souls Day, carrying pumpkin carved lanterns called coca, asking every one they see for Pão-por-Deus singing rhymes where <b>they</b> <b>remind</b> people why they are begging, saying [...] "...It is for me and for you, and to give to the deceased who are dead and buried" [...] or [...] "It is to share with your deceased [...] " [...] If a door is not open or the children don't get anything, they end their singing saying [...] "In this house smells like lard, here must live someone deceased". In the Azores the bread given to the children takes the shape of the top of a skull. The tradition of pão-por-Deus was already recorded in the 15th century. After this ritual begging, takes place the Magusto and big bonfires are lit with the [...] "firewood of the souls". The young people play around smothering their faces with the ashes. The ritual begging for the deceased used to take place all over the year as in several regions the dead, those who were dear, were expected to arrive and take part in the major celebrations like Christmas and a plate with food or {{a seat at the table}} was always left for them.|$|E
