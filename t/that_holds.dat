5|$|Classically, {{algebraic}} {{functions are}} defined by an algebraic equation, and transcendental functions (including those discussed above) {{are defined by}} some property <b>that</b> <b>holds</b> for them, such as a differential equation. For example, the exponential function is the function which is equal to its own derivative everywhere, and assumes the value 1 at the origin. However, one may equally well define an analytic function by its Taylor series.|$|E

5|$|Peano {{arithmetic}} is equiconsistent {{with several}} weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of general set theory (extensionality, {{existence of the}} empty set, and the axiom of adjunction), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property <b>that</b> <b>holds</b> for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.|$|E

5|$|Scarab beetles held {{religious}} and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality. In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to Odonata that signify the impossibility of immortality. Among the Aborigines of Australia of the Arrernte language groups, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems. In {{the case of the}} 'San' bush-men of the Kalahari, it is the praying mantis <b>that</b> <b>holds</b> much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.|$|E
5|$|Seed {{release in}} B.prionotes is {{promoted}} by repeated wetting of the cones. The seed separator <b>that</b> <b>holds</b> the seeds in place is hygroscopic; its two wings pull together then wet, then spread and curl inwards as it dries out again. In doing so, it {{functions as a}} lever, gradually prying seeds out of a follicle {{over the course of}} a wet-dry cycle. This adaptation ensures that seed release following fire is delayed until the onset of rain, when germination and seedling survival rates are higher.|$|E
5|$|Spiders have {{a narrow}} gut {{that can only}} cope with liquid food, and have two sets of filters to keep solids out. Some spiders pump {{digestive}} enzymes from the midgut into the prey and then suck the liquified tissues of the prey into the gut, eventually leaving behind the empty husk of the prey. Others grind the prey to pulp using the fangs and the bases of the pedipalps, while flooding it with enzymes; in these species the fangs and the bases of the pedipalps form a preoral cavity <b>that</b> <b>holds</b> the food they are processing.|$|E

However, there are restrictions imposed by the National Park Service on the numbers of vessels that can operate in a day to 2 cruise ships, 3 tour boats, 6 charter vessels, and 25 private vessels. According to National Park Service statistics for calendar year 2009, 444,653 people visited Glacier Bay, with 422,919 of those being cruise ship passengers.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of sirenians {{is characterized by}} the appearance of several traits, which are found in all sirenians (monophyly). The nostrils are large and retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the frontal bone, the sagittal crest is missing, the mastoid fills the supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of the}} skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony ring <b>that</b> <b>holds</b> the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and bulky) bones.|$|E
5|$|Without {{ultrasound}} {{or other}} special tools, determining if a sheep is pregnant is difficult. Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy {{about six weeks}} before giving birth, so shepherds often rely {{on the assumption that}} a ram will impregnate all the ewes in a flock. However, by fitting a ram with a chest harness called a marking harness <b>that</b> <b>holds</b> a special crayon (or raddle, sometimes spelled reddle), ewes that have been mounted are marked with a color. Dye may also be directly applied to the ram's brisket. This measure is not used in flocks where wool is important, since the color of a raddle contaminates it.|$|E
