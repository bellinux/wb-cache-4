40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} property tax limits have detrimental effects {{on state and}} local revenues during recessions. Property tax limits cause states to rely on income–elastic revenue sources, such as the income <b>tax</b> or <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>fees.</b> Greater reliance on these revenue sources results in greater revenue declines during economic downturns. We present analysis of time–series, cross–sectional data for the U. S. states {{for each of these}} conclusions. Our results suggest that states would have fewer and more modest financial problems during economic downturns if they did not enact property tax limitations...|$|R

The districts are established uponvoter petition to the circuit court and after hearing and local referendum. In the case of multicounty or multitownship districts, formation must be approved by the state environmental protection agency. A five-member board of trustees, appointed by the presiding officers of the governing bodies served by the district, administers each district. The district board may levy property <b>taxes,</b> <b>charge</b> <b>fees,</b> <b>and</b> with voter approval, issue bonds.|$|R

Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 requires that [...] "The final {{price to be}} paid shall at all times be indicated and shall include the applicable air fare or air rate as well as all applicable <b>taxes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>charges,</b> surcharges <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> which are unavoidable and foreseeable at the time of publication". In the early 2010s, many budget airlines sought to circumvent this requirement by adding surcharges for the most common means of payment. For example, Ryanair surcharged £6 per passenger per flight segment to process a single debit card payment whose cost was only a few pence. Article 19 of Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights has limited such payment surcharges to [...] "the cost borne by the trader" [...] since 13 June 2014, but because of the prevalence of these surcharges, the United Kingdom enacted the legislation earlier than required with effect from 6 April 2013 under the Consumer Rights (Payment Surcharges) Regulations 2012.|$|R

40|$|Economic {{efficiency}} of water protection means having {{a program to}} control and make water resources achieve water and environmental status targets. The goal {{of this paper is}} to point to the importance of economic {{efficiency of}} water protection which has a direct impact on the results of any environmentally friendly and integrated water resources management and produces effects measurable at the water-user side. In particular, this paper aims at specifying basic economic elements and limitations of water protection present in environmentally friendly and integrated water resources management systems. Achieved status targets of water resources are the basic parameters which contribute to full integrated management of waters in time and space. Economic efficiency is needed for water and environmental status targets to be achieved in a proper manner and with the right economic instruments and measures. The economic instruments and measures depend on economic policies that govern <b>taxes,</b> <b>charges,</b> <b>fees</b> <b>and</b> the like. Economic efficiency is more comprehensive than cost efficiency which, in environmentally friendly water management, pertains to institutional and operating costs of the measures imposed. The basis of economic efficiency is made of relationships between different offers that enable achieving specific environmental and water status of water resources. From an economic standpoint water protection comes down to achieving such status of water that allows efficient use of water in integrated water management and ecology...|$|R

Prohibits increasing other taxes except upon two-thirds vote of Legislature for state taxes and two-thirds vote of electorate for local governments.

Provides specified refunds including taxes attributable to assessed value inflation adjustments in assessment years 1976 - 1977 through 1978 - 1979. Makes other changes. Operative date for specified provisions is August 15, 1983. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact {{on state and}} local governments: There will be both one time and ongoing fiscal effects. One time fiscal effects: (1) A potential cost of approximately $ 1. 29 billion to pay property tax refunds. These would be paid by the state ($ 508 million), local property taxpayers through higher levies for debt service (up to $ 158 million), and local governments ($ 624 million). (2) The state will gain about $ 75 million over a two year period in increased state income tax revenues because the property tax refunds and interest will be taxable income. Ongoing fiscal effects: (1) Annual revenue losses of at least $ 41 million to local governments and $ 25 million to school districts resulting from the provisions regarding inflationary adjustments to assessed valuations. The revenue losses to schools would be offset by comparable increased state funding. (2) Unknown but probably major ongoing gains in state income tax revenues. (3) Unknown annual multimillion dollar costs and revenue losses {{to state and local}} governments due to tax rate limitations; assessments practices changes; voting requirements for tax legislation; and the definitions of taxes, <b>fees,</b> <b>and</b> assessments contained in the measure...|$|R
40|$|Municipalities in California {{are highly}} reliant on <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> to fund {{government}} services.   This paper tests whether their dependence can be causally attributed to Proposition 13.   We draw our conclusions by leveraging {{a component of}} the law that causes constraint from Proposition 13 to be heterogeneous among California municipalities.   Specifically, because home sales lead to property reassessments, municipalities with high homeowner stability are more constrained by Proposition 13 than those with low homeowner stability.   Our analysis shows that homeowner stability is associated with greater revenue per capita and increased reliance on <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> following the passage of Proposition 13.   We do not observe the same pattern for renter stability and conclude that Proposition 13 causes revenue substitution to <b>charges</b> <b>and</b> <b>fees...</b>|$|R
