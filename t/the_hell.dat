5|$|Further {{down the}} hill, along the Military Road, is a two-story house, known as The Stewards House or as Killakee House (not to be {{confused}} with the now-demolished Killakee House that served as the residence of the Massy family who owned the adjacent Killakee Estate). It was built around 1765 by the Conolly family as a hunting lodge. Over the years, it has served as a dower house and as a residence for the agent who managed the Killakee Estate. To the rear is a belfry; this was once a common feature of large farmhouses and was used to call the workers for meals. <b>The</b> <b>Hell</b> Fire Club held meetings here for a time following the fire that damaged Mount Pelier lodge. The house has a reputation for being haunted, particularly by a large black cat. Stories regarding the origin of this spectre either connect it with the account of the priest who exorcised a cat at <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Fire Club or with a cat that was doused in whiskey and set alight by members of <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Fire Club before escaping across the mountains with its fur aflame.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, John Scannella and Denver Fowler {{supported}} {{the separation of}} T. prorsus and T. horridus, and noted that the two species are also separated stratigraphically within <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Creek Formation, indicating {{that they did not}} live together at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Crowd {{management}} {{proved to}} be difficult, resulting in both spectator injury and death. Over the course of <b>the</b> day, <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels became increasingly agitated as the crowd turned more aggressive. At a later murder trial of Hells Angel Alan Passaro, a security guard testified he heard <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels being summoned over the loudspeakers when the helicopter bearing The Rolling Stones landed. Debate after the event was over whether <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels were to manage security for the entire concert or just for The Rolling Stones. Sam Cutler, the Stones' agent who had arranged to pay <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels said their role was as bodyguards to the Rolling Stones. This was denied by <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels {{as well as others}} connected to the event. During the opening act of Santana, <b>the</b> <b>Hells</b> Angels surged into the crowd numerous times to keep persons off stage.|$|R

5|$|Mammals are {{plentiful}} in <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Creek Formation. Groups represented include multituberculates, metatherians, and eutherians. The multituberculates represented include Paracimexomys, the cimolomyids Paressonodon, Meniscoessus, Essonodon, Cimolomys, Cimolodon, and Cimexomys; and the neoplagiaulacids Mesodma, and Neoplagiaulax. The alphadontids Alphadon, Protalphodon, and Turgidodon, pediomyids Pediomys, Protolambda, and Leptalestes, the stagodontid Didelphodon, the deltatheridiid Nanocuris, the herpetotheriid Nortedelphys, and the glasbiid Glasbius all represent metatherians of <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Creek Formation.

5|$|Ornithischians are {{abundant}} in the Scollard Lance, Laramie, Lance, Denver, and Hell Creek Formation. The main groups of ornithischians are ankylosaurians, ornithopods, ceratopsians, and pachycephalosaurians. Three ankylosaurians are known, Ankylosaurus, Denversaurus, and possibly a species of Edmontonia or an undescribed genus. Multiple genera of ceratopsians are known from the formation other than Triceratops, the leptoceratopsid Leptoceratops, and the chasmosaurine ceratopsids Torosaurus,Nedoceratops and Tatankaceratops. Ornithopods are common in <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Creek Formation, and are known from several species of the ornithopod Thescelosaurus, and the hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus, and a possible species of Parasaurolophus. Several pachycephalosaurians {{have been found in}} <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Creek Formation and in similar formations. Among them are the derived pachycephalosaurids Stygimoloch, Dracorex, Pachycephalosaurus, Sphaerotholus, and an undescribed specimen from North Dakota. The first two might be junior synonyms of Pachycephalosaurus.|$|E

It was where the Satya Yuga reached its pinnacle. Prithu liberated his father Vena, from <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> called Pūt, hence all sons are called Putras. Practicing detachment, Prithu ruled according to the Vedas and the Dandaneeti.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{then turned}} his sights to Heyman's other client, Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel. On September 15, Punk faced Axel and Heyman in a No Disqualication, Handicap {{elimination}} match at Night of Champions, {{in which he}} made Axel submit, leaving only Heyman left. In the process of attacking Heyman, Ryback attacked Punk and placed Heyman on top of Punk for the pinfall. A month later, at Battleground, Punk defeated Ryback after executing a low blow, while the referee was distracted by Heyman attempting to interfere in the match. On October 14, Punk defeated Axel in a Beat the Clock challenge match to determine the stipulation for his rematch with Ryback at <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> in a Cell pay-per-view, which Punk chose to be a two-on-one Handicap match in <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> in a Cell also involving Heyman. At the event on October 27, Punk defeated Heyman and Ryback.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hell</b> Creek, Lance and Scollard Formations {{represent}} different {{sections of}} the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway that divided western and eastern North America during the Cretaceous. They represent a broad coastal plain, extending westward from the seaway to the newly formed Rocky Mountains. These formations are composed largely of sandstone and mudstone, which {{have been attributed to}} floodplain environments. The regions where Ankylosaurus and other Late Cretaceous ankylosaurs have been found had a warm subtropical/temperate climate, which was monsoonal, had occasional rainfall, tropical storms, and forest fires. In <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Creek Formation, many types of plants were supported, primarily angiosperms, with less common conifers, ferns and cycads. An abundance of fossil leaves found at dozens of different sites indicates that the area was largely forested by small trees. Ankylosaurus shared its environment with dinosaurs including the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus, the hypsilophodont Thescelosaurus, the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus, an indeterminate nodosaur, the pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus, and the theropods Struthiomimus, Ornithomimus, Troodon, and Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Another Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Stan, {{in honor}} of amateur {{paleontologist}} Stan Sacrison, was found in <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota, {{in the spring of}} 1987. It was not collected until 1992, as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton. Stan is 63% complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996. This tyrannosaur, too, was found to have many bone pathologies, including broken and healed ribs, a broken (and healed) neck and a spectacular hole in the back of its head, {{about the size of a}} Tyrannosaurus tooth.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown, {{assistant}} {{curator of}} the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex in eastern Wyoming in 1900. H. F. Osborn originally named this skeleton Dynamosaurus imperiosus in a paper in 1905. Brown found another partial skeleton in <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Creek Formation in Montana in 1902. Osborn used this holotype to describe Tyrannosaurus rex in the same paper in which D. imperiosus was described. In 1906, Osborn recognized the two as synonyms, and acted as first revisor by selecting Tyrannosaurus as the valid name. The original Dynamosaurus material resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London.|$|E

Dubbed Jane, the find was initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed {{that it is more}} likely a juvenile Tyrannosaurus. It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of her age.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} to what extent, if any, <b>the</b> <b>Hell</b> Fire Club made use of the building.

However, numerous (and very doubtful) stories surrounding the building have become part of local folklore, some of which have spread to a wider audience through publication in the nineteenth century in books such as Robert Chambers' Book of Days (1864) and in The Gentleman's Magazine (1731–1922).|$|E
