50|$|The {{philosophy}} behind NDN was {{pioneered by}} Ted Nelson in 1979 {{and later by}} Brent Baccala in 2002. In 1999, the TRIAD project at Stanford proposed avoiding DNS lookups by using {{the name of an}} object <b>to</b> <b>route</b> <b>towards</b> a close replica of it. In 2006, the Data Oriented Network Architecture (DONA) project at UC Berkeley and ICSI proposed a content-centric network architecture, which improved TRIAD by incorporating security (authenticity) and persistence as first-class primitives in the architecture. Van Jacobson gave a Google Talk, A New Way to Look at Networking, in 2006 on the evolution of the network, and argued that NDN was the next step. In 2009, PARC announced their content-centric architecture within the CCNx project, which was led by Jacobson, at the time a research fellow at PARC. On September 21, 2009, PARC published the specifications for interoperability and released an initial open source implementation (under GPL) of the Content Centric Networking research project on the Project CCNx site. NDN is one instance of a more general network research direction called information-centric networking (ICN), under which different architecture designs have emerged. The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) established an ICN research working group in 2012.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Even in {{the absence}} of a {{physical}} network infras-tructure, it is important that mobile devices can take advantage of the opportunities presented to them to maintain communication. Opportunistic networks are a class of mobile networks that must rely on unscheduled sporadic meetings between nodes to achieve communication. The main challenge in these networks is <b>to</b> <b>route</b> messages <b>towards</b> a destination with high delivery probability, low average latency and efficient usage of network resources. Despite the numerous proposals for opportunistic rout-ing protocols, there are relatively few analytical characterizations of their behaviour. In this paper, we propose both centralized and decentralized message forwarding algorithms that, under relatively strong assumptions about the network’s behaviour, minimize the expected latency to a destination. After presenting proofs of the optimality of our proposed algorithms, we confirm their improvement in system performance through numerical simulation. I...|$|R

It uses limited scope proactive approach <b>to</b> maintain <b>routes</b> <b>towards</b> a surrounding zone and reactive approach to communicate with farther destinations. For a better exploitation of network capabilities, we propose a Binary Error Rate (BER) based approach of ZRP (BER-ZRP). With BER-ZRP, all phases of linkstate recording and routing tables calculation are under Quality of Service control so that better paths in terms of BER are preferred. The overhead induced by route maintenance and route discovery processes is better managed. This approach allows to improve ZRP Packet Delivery Ratio and Normalized Oversize Load...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — With {{the growing}} demand for real time {{services}} in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), quality of service (QoS) based routing has emerged as an interesting research topic. But offering some QoS guarantee in sensor networks raises significant challenges. The network needs to cope with battery constraints, while providing QoS (end-to-end delay and reliability) guarantees. Designing such QoS routing protocols that optimize multiple objectives is computationally intractable. Higher power relay nodes {{can be used as}} cluster heads in a two-tiered WSN and these relay nodes may form a network among themselves <b>to</b> <b>route</b> data <b>towards</b> the sink. In this model, the QoS guarantee is determined mainly by these relay nodes. In this paper a solution based on NSGA-II is proposed for energy efficient QoS routing in cluster based WSNs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol outperforms network performance by optimizing multiple QoS parameters and energy consumption...|$|R
