The paper focuses on researching the separation efficiency influenced by different inlet velocities, volume fraction values and the particle diameters.

Results of numerical simulation shows that with the inlet velocity range from 1 to 5 m/s and the particle diameters range from 2 to 5 um, the hydrocyclone separation efficiency is increasing. As the volume fraction value increased from 1 % to 15 %, the separation efficiency descended.

30|$|The first mode {{involved}} pretreatment {{by applying}} the pulse electric field–hydrocyclone field coupling unit. Subsequently, circulatory deep dehydration was performed through the vacuum heating unit. Particularly, {{at the beginning of}} experiment, vacuum pump worked until the pressure of vacuum chamber attained − 0.08  Mpa.

Meanwhile, the output of high-voltage pulsed power supply was 8000  v and 800  Hz. In addition, sampling and sending oil into vacuum chamber could be carried out by two valves installed in the 70  L tank. At last, the oil was drawn out the vacuum chamber by a pump installed behind the medium filter (shown in Fig.  1). The de-emulsifying oil was sampled by opening the valve in the end of system.

No need for a pump to provide adequate pressure to draw water for some applications as the gravity will do this job.|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} a homogeneous sandy soil and a layered soil of southern Quebec from 1988 to 1990. This was done in order to evaluate the yield response of indeterminate soybean to subsurface irrigation and to determine the performance of subsurface irrigation in a layered soil. It was found that indeterminate soybean varieties increase their yield by approximately 30 % for {{two out of three}} years. Soybean are very sensitive to competition between themselves as well as with weeds. This sensitivity is increased during subsurface irrigation. Weeds were more prominent in the irrigated area. It was concluded that the soybean yields are functions of water table depth, percent weed and plant population density. The minimum allowable water table depth for soybean was found to be 45 cm. At a water table depth greater than 95 cm no yield response was observed. Water table management is not only possible but very functional in the layered soils of southern Quebec. It was found that surplus water did not drain from the irrigated area until the water table anywhere in this area was 10 cm higher than the elevation of <b>the</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>pipe</b> in the control chamber.

30|$|In Fig.  1, the {{emulsified}} oil, which {{flows from}} <b>the</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>pipe</b> {{and then into}} the strainer through the filling valve, thereby filtering bulky mechanical impurities. The emulsified oil then flows into the vacuum separation chamber through the oil-taking control valve and the oil-taking solenoid valve. After the pressure is increased by the oil circulating pump, the emulsified oil is heated by the heater and the temperature gradually increases. After stabilizing temperature using the temperature controller, an oil mist cover is formed because of the positive pressure {{at the top of the}} vacuum chamber by the atomizer. This mist can prevent the rise of oil bubbles in the vacuum separation chamber and can avoid the injection of the vacuum pump of oil during the operation. Thus, antifoaming is automatically prevented. After atomization, the oil reenters the efficient separation tower, in which an oil film is again formed. The developed area of the oil film significantly increases. The water in the oil rapidly transforms from liquid into vapor. When nitrogen is at the bottom of the vacuum separation chamber, the water vapor in oil is removed and expelled from the top. Under the oil drain pump, the pressure of oil after dehydration changes from negative to positive, and the oil flows from the oil discharge outlet through the check valve and the fine filter. After one or more circulations, clean oil is generated.|$|E

40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was {{operated}} from June 1965 to December 1969. The {{objective of}} the experiment {{was to investigate the}} practicality of developing a power reactor consisting of a graphite lattice with circulating molten uranium salt as fuel for application in central power stations. When the experiment was terminated in 1969, approximately 4710 kg of salt containing approximately 36. 3 kg of uranium, 675 g of plutonium, and various fission products were transferred to two fuel drain tanks (FDTs). The almost 30. 5 kg of Uranium 233 in the salt is the primary fissile constituent, but about 0. 93 kg of Uranium 235 is also present. In April 1994, a gas sample from the MSRE off-gas system (OGS) indicated that uranium had migrated from the FDTs into the OGS. Further investigation revealed a likely accumulation of approximately 2. 6 kg of uranium in the auxiliary charcoal bed (ACB), which is located in the concrete-lined charcoal bed cell (CBC) below ground level outside the MSRE building. The nuclear criticality safety (NCS) situation was further complicated by the CBC being filled with water up to <b>the</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>pipe,</b> which completely submerged the ACB. Thus there was not only an increased risk of criticality because of water reflection in the ACB, but also because of potential moderation in the ACB in case of water inleakage.

When uranium was discovered in the ACB, a number of steps, detailed in this report, were immediately taken to try to understand and ameliorate the situation. After all the actions were completed, a validation of the results obtained for the ACB was performed...|$|E

This {{is a threat to}} the biodiversity of marine wildlife as it degrades/damages the marine habitat. Due to high amounts of excess nutrients and water disturbance, there are fewer number of benthic invertebrate species found near CSO outfalls. One of the nutrients found in excess amounts is Nitrogen, which can cause low oxygen level. Excess nitrogen can causes algae blooms which leads to low oxygen level which is dangerous for marine organism that need oxygen. Furthermore, at the outfall the output disturbs the soils, which makes the water more turbid. Turbid water can increase the number of pathogens in the water. [...] Many fishes and shellfish can be affected by some pathogens that are naturally found in the Puget Sound. High turbidity can decrease light penetration which can decrease food sources for fishes. [...] If the turbidity is high enough it can kill fishes and/or affect reproduction and growth. Other pollutants carried by the runoff can have direct harm on many marine organisms and pollute the soils. For example, heavy metal buildup can cause physiological and reproductive harm. For example, lead in river otters and spotted sandpiper affect their reproduction.
