5|$|When the Marines were {{surrounded}} by the Chinese Communist troops close to the Manchurian border, they were ordered to retreat and work {{their way back to}} Hungnam. The men of the 65th rushed to <b>their</b> <b>defense</b> and were ordered to stay behind and fight the enemy. As a result, the Marines were able to withdraw to their ships with the 65th holding the rear guard. The 65th, attached to the 1st Marine Division, was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for <b>their</b> <b>defense</b> and were among the last units to embark from Hungnam. Among the battles and operations in which the 65th participated was Operation Killer in January 1951, becoming the first regiment to cross the Han River in South Korea during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{fair use}} issue, Combs and Bad Boy never raised the legal {{concept of the}} fair use {{doctrine}} in <b>their</b> <b>defense.</b> This decision was questioned by some legal experts: Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs and Bad Boy for not defending the legality of sampling and suggested {{that they might have}} refused to raise such a defense because they feared it could later imperil their control over their own music.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the Giants {{were unable}} to build on their {{successful}} 1997 season, and needed a four-game winning streak to close out the season at 8–8. The Giants strength was <b>their</b> <b>defense,</b> which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense {{continued to be a}} disappointment. Brown had been jettisoned and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. Neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl caliber play, although Graham led the Giants to a 5–1 finish (including an upset of the then-undefeated Denver Broncos in Week 15).|$|E
5|$|On July 4, the {{defendants}} {{were informed that}} they would have to finish preparing <b>their</b> <b>defense</b> by July 9. They announced a hunger strike in response, saying that two working days was inadequate time to finish preparing their trial defense. On July 21, the court extended their pre-trial detention by a further six months.|$|E

Following the season, six Giants—defensive lineman Erik Howard, center Bart Oates, offensive guard William Roberts, linebackers Pepper Johnson and Lawrence Taylor and special teamer Reyna Thompson—were selected to the Pro Bowl.|$|E

5|$|In March 1971 South Vietnamese forces, {{supported}} by U.S. air power, launched Operation Lam Son 719, the long-awaited offensive {{to cut the}} Ho Chi Minh trail in southeastern Laos. However, {{the result was a}} failure. North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces had already begun to expand the trail system westward, pushing Royal Lao forces toward the Mekong, slowly extending the territory it controlled, moving west of the trail and creating a larger buffer zone between its logistical system and the South Vietnamese. After Lam Son 719, that process accelerated. Hanoi's effort was simplified {{by the fact that the}} Royalist forces in the south had little experience fighting PAVN and they were quickly overwhelmed. Inept and ineffective were terms utilized to describe <b>their</b> <b>defense.</b> On 30 April 1971 the key town of Attopeu was seized by the communists.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Fallout by Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment, the protagonist player character, the Vault Dweller, first encounters the feral Dogmeat in Junktown. Dogmeat's former owner (an unnamed man closely resembling Max Rockatansky) {{died at the}} hands of thugs hired by a local gangster named Gizmo. If the player character feeds Dogmeat or is wearing a leather jacket, Dogmeat will follow them and fight in <b>their</b> <b>defense.</b> According to the series' canon, Dogmeat was adopted by the Vault Dweller on 30 December 2161, and killed by a force field barrier during the Vault Dweller's assault on the Master's Military Base on 20 April 2162. Dogmeat was supposed to appear in the canceled film adaptation of the game as well.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, another front had opened. The Exarchate of Africa under Heraclius the Elder had revolted against Phocas. The {{situation}} in 609–610 was quickly becoming dire for Domentziolus and all Phocas loyalists. <b>Their</b> <b>defense</b> against the Sassanids had failed. There were Persian forces in Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria and the Anatolian provinces. Rebel Byzantine forces held Africa and Egypt. Slavs were occupying northern Illyricum. In Thessalonica and various towns of Anatolia and Syria, the Blues and Greens were settling their differences with open conflict. In areas of Syria, the Jews were revolting and lynching Christians. Even in Constantinople, the crowds taunted Phocas for {{his love of}} liquor, implying alcoholism.|$|E

50|$|In October 1265, Afonso III (1248-1279) {{confirmed}} the charter to the village. A new constructive phase in <b>their</b> <b>defenses,</b> however, will only {{have taken place}} from the confirmation of this title by King Dinis (1279-1325), on 27 October 1285.|$|R
5|$|Napoleon {{knew that}} the French fleet could not defeat the Royal Navy in a {{head-to-head}} battle, so he planned to lure {{it away from the}} English Channel through diversionary tactics. The main strategic idea involved the French Navy escaping from the British blockades of Toulon and Brest and threatening to attack the West Indies. In the face of this attack, it was hoped, the British would weaken <b>their</b> <b>defense</b> of the Western Approaches by sending ships to the Caribbean, allowing a combined Franco-Spanish fleet {{to take control of the}} channel long enough for French armies to cross and invade. However, the plan unraveled after the British victory at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in July 1805. French Admiral Villeneuve then retreated to Cádiz instead of linking up with French naval forces at Brest for an attack on the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July, the 169th Division {{reached the}} town of Kayraly, but was thrown back by strong Soviet counterattacks. All three Soviet {{divisions}} now formed a formidable defense line around Kayraly, incorporating the adjacent lakes Apa and Kuola into <b>their</b> <b>defense.</b> The German advance stalled, facing difficulties with arctic forest fighting. At {{the same time the}} Soviets managed to bring additional reinforcements to replace their losses. On 16 July, Falkenhorst arrived at the XXXVI Corps' headquarters and pressured Feige to renew the offensive. Feige relented and on 27 and 29 July the corps made two additional attacks separately against the Soviets which led to nothing. A stalemate had developed at the front line that the Germans could not break. Due the grim situation, and mounting losses (5,500 men in just one month), AOK Norwegen finally ordered Feige to halt the offensive.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1900, the 1st Regiment (Marines) {{attempted}} {{to take the}} city of Tientsin and failed. Then, on June 23, the Regiment, {{under the command of}} Major Waller, entered Tientsin in their second attempt after a Japanese blew open a gate to allow the Chinese to escape. Private Silva, who was seriously wounded and two sailors, Navy Seaman Axel Westermark and Chief Machinist Emil Peterson, were awarded the Medal of Honor for <b>their</b> <b>defense</b> of the civilian compound (legation) at Peking– they defended the walled city from June 28 until the fall of the city which occurred on August 17.|$|E

5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome is an action-adventure hack and slash {{game played}} in a third-person perspective. Players assume control of Marius Titus, a Roman general who is on a quest to avenge his murdered family. Throughout the game, players gain access to weapons {{that can be used}} to assault enemies or defend themselves. For instance, players are {{equipped}} with a sword {{that can be used to}} strike and kill enemies, and a shield that can be used to deflect enemies' attack and break <b>their</b> <b>defense.</b> The strength of each attack can be decided by players. In addition to melee-based combat, the game features spears and javelins, which serve as ranged weapons.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the San Francisco 49ers 49–3 in their opening playoff game. Favored by only three points, the Giants caught a break when 49ers WR Jerry Rice fumbled an apparent touchdown catch-and-carry off his knee {{early in the}} game, then dominated the Niners {{the rest of the}} way. <b>Their</b> <b>defense</b> held the 49ers to 29yards rushing, 184yards in total offense, and 2 of 14 on third-down conversions. The Giants did not commit a turnover and totalled 216 rushing yards. Jim Burt knocked 49ers quarterback Joe Montana out of the game in the second quarter, hitting him as he threw a pass which Lawrence Taylor intercepted and returned 34yards for a touchdown. The Giants defense also held the 49ers to only nine first downs, and 15 of 37 passing for zero touchdowns and three interceptions.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 1998. The {{strength}} of the team during the season was <b>their</b> <b>defense,</b> which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense continued to struggle. Dave Brown had been released before the season and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. However, neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl-caliber play. Before the 1999 season, the Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins had been the first–ever draft choice of the Carolina Panthers, and in his second season, {{led them to the}} NFC Championship game. However, problems with alcohol abuse, conflicts with his teammates, and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Although many people questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a $16.9 million contract, Accorsi was confident in Collins' abilities.|$|E
50|$|The Afghan {{government}} {{celebrated their}} victory, {{and though the}} success had proved costly, it served to alleviate the pressure on Khost, that was then under siege.

5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once picked out, and still more to track the Sprints {{on their way to the}} interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at <b>their</b> <b>Defense</b> Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center Data Processing System (DCDPS).|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct {{aim at the}} U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged {{on whether or not}} mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. <b>Their</b> <b>defense</b> attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E
