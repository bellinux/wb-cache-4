5000|$|Officially {{supported}} {{export credit}} may {{be connected to}} official development assistance (ODA) in two ways. First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export <b>credit</b> is <b>tied</b> to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a <b>tied</b> aid <b>credit,</b> even if the ODA part is untied aid. Second, <b>tied</b> aid <b>credits</b> are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time {{when there is no}} repayment of the principal) and terms of repayment. Such credits are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of [...] "softness". [...] "Softness" [...] is measured by a formula that compares the present value of the credit with the present value of the same amount at standardized [...] "commercial" [...] terms. This difference is expressed {{as a percentage of the}} credit and called [...] "concessionality level". Thus a grant has a concessionality level of 100%, a commercial credit scores zero per cent.

40|$|We use the 2007 credit {{crisis to}} gauge the effect of {{financial}} contracting on real corporate behavior. We identify heterogeneity in financial contracting {{at the onset of}} the crisis by exploiting ex-ante variation in long-term debt maturity. Our empirical methodology accounts for observed and unobserved time-invariant firm characteristics by employing a difference-in-differences matching estimator. We find that firms whose long-term debt was largely maturing right after the third quarter of 2007 reduced investment by 2. 5 % more (on a quarterly basis) than otherwise similar firms whose debt was scheduled to mature well after 2008. This relative decline in investment is statistically and economically significant, representing one-third of pre-crisis investment levels. A number of falsi…cation and placebo tests confirm our inferences about the effect of credit supply shocks on corporate policies. For example, in the absence of a credit shock (“normal times”), the maturity composition of long-term debt has no effect on investment. Likewise, maturity composition has no impact on investment in the crisis for firms for which long-term debt is not a major source of funding. Our study highlights the importance of debt maturity for corporate financial policy. It shows how financial contracting <b>ties</b> <b>credit</b> supply shocks and firm real decisions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTDeterminants of {{contractual}} arrangements in agricultural credit transactionsBecause of {{a reduction in}} the supply of subsidized agricultural credit in Brazil, the economic agents in the agro-industrial systems organized themselves to <b>tie</b> in <b>credit</b> and their buying and selling transactions with farmers. Different types of agreements appeared, characterized by different finance structures. In this study, the authors aimed at verifying the causal relation between the type of financing used by soy producers in Brazil and their possible determinants. Two arrangements were chosen for analysis: getting bank loans and getting loans tied to transactions with agro-industrial chain agents. The explanatory variables used were property size, guarantees provided and reputation, measured in terms of how long the relationship had existed for. As foreseen in the theory, results showed that property size is one of the determinants of credit transactions between farmers and agro-industrial chain agents. However, the relation with government banks and the guarantees did not turn out to be relevant elements for the analysis of the determinants in the choice of {{contractual arrangements}} for soy financing with agents of the agro-industrial system...|$|R
40|$|Livelihood {{systems of}} poor rural {{households}} are often so fragile {{that a small}} misfortune can destabilize households for years. Strategies for coping with risk include informal mutual aid agreements and/or formal microinsurance schemes. In developing countries, insurance markets are usually underdeveloped. Nevertheless, if the development path is supported by strong structures and institutions, anonymous markets will, over time, replace informal insurance networks as they are more efficient. In Vietnam, livestock is an important household income source and has additional non-economic functions in the households. For a long time, rural financial institutions in Vietnam financed only a small array of agricultural investments, but these frequently included livestock purchase. The absence of off-farm investment possibilities further promotes investment in livestock production. Failure of an investment, especially when loan-funded, can leave a household in an extremely vulnerable position. Livestock death {{is considered to be}} a major factor contributing to poverty. Farmers using credit to purchase livestock face two risks at once: (1) loss of the livestock due tovdisease and subsequently (2) failure of investment. Farmers would like to reduce the uncertainty, but a broad-based livestock insurance scheme does not exist in Vietnam. There are only a few formal and semi-formal schemes with very limited outreach. Thus, access to formal insurance is almost non-existent, and farm households have to rely mainly on informal mutual aid schemes within their social networks to reduce their risks. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the discussion on the general feasibility of a livestock insurance scheme in Vietnam. In this context, the demand for and supply of livestock insurance schemes is discussed. Quantitative (N= 322) and qualitative data collection took place between 2001 and 2004. The quantitative data comprise cross-sectional household-level data from three different districts in Northern Vietnam. Four different types of insurance providers were selected for analyzing the supply side: 1. Insurance <b>tied</b> to <b>credit</b> within a state-owned company; 2. Insurance <b>tied</b> to <b>credit</b> within a development project; 3. A state-owned insurance company (which collapsed); 4. A private insurance company. By selecting these different insurance providers, the range of livestock insurance types offered in Vietnam was covered. The main result is that provision of sustainable livestock insurance is hampered principally by unreliable data on livestock mortality and by premia that are set politically at a low evel...|$|R

40|$|Rating {{agencies}} face widespread criticism {{regarding the}} quality and timing of their opinions (i. e. credit ratings) especially after a crisis. Notwithstanding such widespread blame, rating agencies still {{play a crucial role}} in the financial markets. For example, credit ratings have a huge impact on credit spread, on firm returns and on financial institutions’ regulation that is <b>tied</b> to <b>credit</b> ratings. Ratings tend to be relatively stable over time. However, significant and unanticipated changes in the general conditions of the economy or the individual issuer will result in a rating review. Raters can issue a “watch”, which notifies investors that there is a reasonable probability of a rating change and the likely direction of such change (positive or negative). There two potential measures of the rating action timing: i) the time between the occurrence of new information and the issue of a credit watch, and ii) the time between a credit watch and a rating change. A “wrong” rating is essentially a rating that is not changed in a timely fashion. This is the most typical criticism addressed to ratings agencies, which, under certain circumstances, did not promptly downgrade issuers that then turned out to be insolvent (over-rating). Similarly, a rater might not upgrade an issuer despite its characteristics justify a better rating (under-rating). While it is true that the agencies’ approach always results in some delay between the emergence of the causes of a rating change and the change itself, it is unclear which factors explain such delay both in the cross-section and over time. Despite the importance of the timing of rating actions, this topic has received little attention by the literature. This project aims to fill this gap by addressing the following research questions:• Is the timing of both rating actions affected by issuer-specific and country-specific characteristics or by the length of the relationship between rater and issuer? • Does the timing of rating actions depend on the rating agency and the market structure? Is it affected by macro or financial market conditions? Our study will make several contributions to the literature because, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first to examine the timing of rating actions. Our analysis will provide empirical evidence that improves the understanding of the role of credit watches in the credit rating process and it will considerably help to shed light on whether credit watches increase default prediction accuracy and convey information to market participants. This is increasingly important because CRAs provide minimal information about their credit watch procedures. Furthermore, the understanding of the timeliness of rating action will improve the market perception of CRA’s opinions reliability and will affect investors’ asset allocation. Finally, our findings will have a significant impact on financial regulation that is widely <b>tied</b> to <b>credit</b> ratings (i. e. the Basel Accord) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} notion of a housing bubble as an {{equilibrium}} in which some investors hold houses only for resale purposes and not for the expectation of a dividend, either in the form of rents or utility. We provide a life-cycle model where households face collateral constraints that <b>tie</b> their <b>credit</b> capacity to the value of their houses and examine the conditions under which housing bubbles can emerge. In such equilibria, the total housing stock is held by owners that extract utility from their homes, landlords that obtain rents, and investors. We show that an economy with tighter collateral constraints is more prone to bubbles which, in turn, tend to have a larger size but are less fragile in face of funddraining shocks. Our environment also allows for pure bubbles on useless assets. We …nd that multiple equilibria in which the economy moves endogenously from a pure bubble to a housing bubble regime and vice versa are possible. This suggests that high asset price volatility may be a natural consequence of asset shortages (or excess funding) that depress interest rates su ¢ ciently so as to sustain an initial bubble. We also examine some welfare implications of the two types of bubbles and discuss some mechanisms to rule out equilibria with housing bubbles...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} excess cost which results from aid-tying in some {{development}} {{projects in the}} Sudan. Tying can be of two types, either by source or by end-use. In the former case, restrictions are placed on where the recipients can spend the assistance. In the latter case, assistance is limited to specific items or projects. Thus, aid can be deemed to be doubly tied. In addition, there are other unquantifiable costs of tying. For example, the project to which the assistance will be tied might not suit the recipient's development programme, or the technology used may be inappropriate. Eight foreign-aided projects, which were tied by source {{as well as by}} end-use, were analysed to estimate the excess cost which results from the tying of aid. The overall weighted average of tying these projects appears to be 74 percent higher than the international market. In addition, the analysis shows that the terms of borrowing for these projects were hard; consequently, the grant element was low. Thus, if one takes into account the estimated excess cost of the <b>tied</b> foreign <b>credits,</b> which was greater than the commercial cost of borrowing at which these credits could have been sought in the absence of aid, the real value of these credits, the paper shows by using a shadow grant element approach, was negative. ...|$|R
