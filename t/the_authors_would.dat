5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, and that <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> prefer a peace {{brought about by}} an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why {{it would be in}} their best interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E

2500|$|Pre-accepted {{articles}} or [...] "outcome-unbiased journals"/"early acceptance"/"advance publication review"/"registered reports"/"prior to results submission": extends study pre-registration to {{the point}} that journals accepted or reject papers based on the version of the paper written before the results or conclusions have been made (an enlarged study protocol), but instead describes the theoretical justification, experimental design, and statistical analysis. Only once the proposed hypothesis and methodology have been accepted by reviewers, <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> collect the data or analyze previously collected data. A limited variant of a pre-accepted article was The Lancet's study protocol review from 1997-2015 reviewed and published randomized trial protocols with a guarantee that the eventual paper would at least be sent out to peer review rather than immediately rejected.|$|E

[...] Dershowitz himself, claims to have written several critical pieces on specific Israeli policies. [...] Dershowitz disagrees with those who believe that the media is uncritical of Israel and cites the frequent New York Times editorials and even an editorial in The Jewish Daily Forward against some of Israel's more right of center policies as proof. [...] Dershowitz also denies that any significant, mainstream leader in the American Jewish community equates criticism of Israel with antisemitism.|$|E

2500|$|In honour of the 125th {{anniversary of}} her birth, 25 {{contemporary}} mystery writers and one publisher revealed {{their views on}} Christie's works. Many of the authors read Christie's novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still view her as the [...] "Queen of Crime", and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries, and find her books good to read now, nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Several of <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> be very pleased {{to have their own}} novels in print in 100 years. Just one of the 25 authors held with Edmund Wilson's views.

2500|$|In October 1962, {{the weekly}} news {{magazine}} Der Spiegel published {{an analysis of}} the West German military defense. [...] The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. [...] Ten days after publication, the offices of Der Spiegel in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized under the orders of the CSU Defense Minister Franz Josef Strauss. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the Bundestag that the article was tantamount to high treason and that <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> be prosecuted. [...] The editor/owner of the magazine, Rudolf Augstein spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of Franz Josef Strauss, Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis by his heavy-handed attempt to silence Der Spiegel for essentially running a story that was unflattening to him (which incidentally was true). The British historian Frederick Taylor argued that the Federal Republic under Adenauer retained many of the characteristics of the authoritarian [...] "deep state" [...] that existed under the Weimar Republic, and that the Der Speigel affair marked an important turning point in German values as ordinary people rejected the old authoritarian values in favor of the more democratic values that are today seen as the bedrock of the Federal Republic. Adenauer's own reputation was impaired by Spiegel affair and he announced that he would step down in the Fall of 1963. [...] His successor was to be the Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard, who was the man widely credited as the father of the [...] "economic miracle" [...] of the 1950s and of whom great things were expected.|$|E

[...] "I'm not wanted myself, at present, in the short stories; {{but in the last}} dozen or so where I had an engagement I certainly didn't meet you; and it is pleasant to be paired off in a story with a heroine who has the instincts and habits of a lady. Of course, a hero is only something in an author's fancy, and I've no right to be exacting; but it does go against me to love a girl who ropes cattle, or a woman who has a past, or a husband, or something of the kind. I always do my best for the author, but I can't forget that I'm a gentleman, and it's difficult to win a heroine when the very idea of her makes you shudder. I sometimes wonder how <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> like it themselves if they had to do what they expect of us in that way. They're generally very decent fellows, good husbands and fathers, who have married lady-like girls and wouldn't think of associating with a shady or ignorant person." ...|$|E
60|$|We doubtless {{find in the}} {{writings}} of the Fathers of the second century, and still more strongly in those of the third, passages concerning the Scriptures that seem to say the same as we Protestants now do. But then we find the very same phrases used of writings not Apostolic, or with no other difference than what the greater name of <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>would</b> naturally produce; just as a Platonist would speak of Speusippus's books, were they extant, compared with those of later teachers of Platonism;--'He was Plato's nephew-had seen Plato--was his appointed successor, &c.' But in inspiration the early Christians, as far as I can judge, made no generic difference, let Lardner say what he will. Can he disprove that it was declared heretical by the Church in the second century to believe the written words of a dead Apostle in opposition to the words of a living Bishop, seeing that the same spirit which guided the Apostles dwells in and guides the Bishops of the Church? This at least is certain, that the later the age of the writer, the stronger the expression of comparative superiority of the Scriptures; the earlier, on the other hand, the more we hear of the 'Symbolum', the 'Regula Fidei', the Creed.|$|E
