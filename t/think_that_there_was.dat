500|$|In The New York Times, book {{reviewer}} Geoffrey Wheatcroft {{said that}} A Moral Reckoning (2003) presents {{an indictment of}} the Roman Catholic Church comparable to Goldhagen's indictment of Germany in Hitler's Willing Executioners (1996), saying, [...] "both as an international institution {{under the leadership of}} Pope Pius XII (1939–58), and at national levels in many European countries, the Church was deeply implicated in the appalling genocide.... Just as Germans had been carefully taught to hate the Jews, {{to the point that they}} could readily torment and kill them, so had Catholics"; that author Goldhagen [...] "sees a deep vein of Jew-hatred ingrained within Catholic tradition; and he does not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any difference of kind, between that old religious Jew-hatred and the murderous racial antisemitism of the twentieth century".|$|E
500|$|The French Republic, {{established}} in 1792 {{at the height}} of the French Revolution, was by 1797 governed by a bicameral legislative assembly, with a five-member Directory acting as the national executive. [...] The Directory was undergoing both internal power struggles and struggles with the Council of Five Hundred, the lower chamber of the legislature. [...] Ministerial changes took place in the first half of 1797, including the selection in July of Charles Maurice de Talleyrand as foreign minister. [...] Talleyrand, who had recently spent a few years in the United States, was openly concerned about the establishment of closer ties between the U. S. and Britain. [...] The Directory, generally not well-disposed to American interests, became notably more hostile to them in September 1797, when an internal coup propelled several anti-Americans into power. [...] These leaders, and Talleyrand, viewed President Adams as hostile to their interests, but did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> significant danger of war. [...] In part based on advice imparted to French diplomats by Thomas Jefferson, Talleyrand decided to adopt a measured, slow pace to the negotiations.|$|E
500|$|After Hayes' falling-out {{with the}} Republican Party and a {{perceived}} desire {{on the part}} of the United States' electorate for a strong man in the White House, Grant returned to the United States ahead of schedule, in hopes of seeking a third term in office. With the backing of the Stalwarts and calls for a [...] "man of iron" [...] to replace the [...] "man of straw" [...] in the White House, Grant was confident that he would receive the Republican nomination for the presidency. Roscoe Conkling, the leader of the Stalwart faction, formed a [...] "triumvirate" [...] with J. Donald Cameron of Pennsylvania and John A. Logan of Illinois to lead the campaign for Grant's return to the White House. With a Grant victory, Conkling and other Stalwarts would have great influence in the White House. Grant knew he could count on the Stalwart leaders to solidify their respective states in order to guarantee a Grant victory. Conkling was so confident in Grant's nomination that he said, [...] "Nothing but an act of God could prevent Grant's nomination." [...] An aide to the ex-president, Adam Badeau, commented that Grant had become [...] "extremely anxious to receive the nomination" [...] and did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any chance of failure.|$|E

500|$|... "That's Not My Penguin" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television commentators. Matt Fowler of IGN gave an extremely positive review. He {{claimed that the}} story worked [...] "either way" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "awesome", mainly because of the hallucinations. Fowler stated that he had his [...] "mind blown" [...] and that {{the best part of the}} episode was [...] "when the show, for a little while, actually made me <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something to Gabriel's Dr. Wild story". Claiming that he was [...] "hooked" [...] to the show, Folwer concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9 out of 10" [...] classifying it as [...] "amazing". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club enjoyed the episode. In his [...] "A-" [...] review, he noted that the episode [...] "doesn't show any signs of imminent immolation". He thought that the morale of the episode was [...] "wanting something to be real doesn't make it easier to pretend, and the harder Michael has to work to keep this up, the better the odds that he’s going to lose his grip". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix [...] "loved" [...] the episode. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic gave the episode a [...] "5 out of 5" [...] as a perfect score and thought that the entry [...] "really used Awake concept to its advantage".|$|E
2500|$|At the zoo on 28 March he had {{his first}} sight of an ape, and was {{impressed}} at the orang-utan's antics [...] "just like a naughty child" [...] when the keeper held back an apple. In his notes he wrote [...] "Let man visit Ourang-outang in domestication, hear expressive whine, see its intelligence.... let him look at savage...naked, artless, not improving yet improvable & let him dare to boast of his proud preeminence." [...] Here Darwin was drawing on his experience of the natives of Tierra del Fuego and daring to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little gulf between man and animals despite the theological doctrine that only humanity possessed a soul.|$|E
2500|$|An {{examination}} of English cases led {{the judge to}} conclude that the [...] "real likelihood" [...] test no longer adopted this perspective. He considered that the case of R. v. Gough (1993) had shifted the perspective to be adopted– from that of the reasonable person, to that of the court. In Gough, the House of Lords held that {{there was no need to}} require courts to adopt the perspective of a reasonable person. This was because the court itself personified the reasonable person in such cases. Further, the court had to ascertain the circumstances from evidence available to it, even if that evidence might not be available to a member of the public at the relevant time. This stood in contrast to the holding in Metropolitan Properties Company (F.G.C.) Ltd. v. Lannon (1968), where Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, held that in applying the real likelihood test the inquiry was whether a reasonable man would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> bias, and not whether there was in fact bias. He added that [...] "confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away thinking ‘the judge was biased'".|$|E
