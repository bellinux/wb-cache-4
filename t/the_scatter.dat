5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to <b>the</b> <b>scatter</b> of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{tightness}} of the M–σ relation {{suggests that}} some kind of feedback acts to maintain the connection between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, in spite of processes like galaxy mergers and gas accretion that might be expected to increase <b>the</b> <b>scatter</b> over time.|$|E

40|$|A {{time-of-flight}} camera {{suffers from}} significant range distortion due to <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> artefact caused by secondary reflections occurring between the lens {{and the image}} plane. The reflected beam from the foreground objects undergoes multiple reflections within the camera device thereby introducing parasitic signals that bias the late-arrival, backscattered signals from the background targets. These additive signals cause degradation of the depth measurement for the background objects thus limiting the use of range imaging cameras for high precision close-range photogrammetric applications. So far <b>the</b> modelling of <b>scattering</b> distortion {{has been based on}} the linear system model using an inverse filtering approach. However, an experiment conducted for measuring the edgespread function using a two planar surfaces separated at some distance shows a non-linear and shift-variant behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> distortion. <b>The</b> non-linearity and the shift-variant behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> errors question <b>the</b> use of the linear shiftinvariant system for reversing <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> effect. Further experimentation using two planar surfaces at different distances with different surface areas of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> object was conducted to heuristically quantify the range and amplitude biases caused by <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> artefact. <b>The</b> range and amplitude biases were analysed {{as a function of the}} distance of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> object from <b>the</b> camera, the surface area of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> object and <b>the</b> integration time. The results show that <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> bias monotonically increases with surface area of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> object and monotonically decreases with distance of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> object from <b>the</b> camera. <b>The</b> <b>scattering</b> range bias is independent of the integration time while <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> amplitude bias monotonically increase...|$|R

40|$|The {{phase of}} <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> {{far-field}} from flaws is focused and the phase shift analysis {{is carried out}} to quantify <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> waveforms. <b>The</b> basic tool of the phase shift analysis is the integral representation of <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> wave field. <b>The</b> <b>scattering</b> amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> far-field is first defined. The phase shift of <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> far-field is then introduced by expanding <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> far-field into partial waves with spherical wave components and {{taking into account the}} energy relation. The phase shift introduced represents the shift of phase in <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> wave from <b>the</b> phase in an incident wave. The far-field integral representation for <b>the</b> <b>scattered</b> field is utilized to derive the explicit expression of the phase shift, and the integral representation of the phase shift is obtained as a surface integral over the flaw. This integral representation is true for arbitrary flaw shape and it relates to the flaw geometry and the boundary conditions on the flaw surface. The boundary element method is adopted for the determination of boundary quantities on the flaw surface.

25|$|In principle, {{since the}} number density of {{clusters}} {{as a function}} of mass and redshift is sensitive to the underlying cosmology, cluster counts derived from large weak lensing surveys should be able to constrain cosmological parameters. In practice, however, projections along the line of sight cause many false positives. Weak lensing {{can also be used to}} calibrate the mass-observable relation via a stacked weak lensing signal around an ensemble of clusters, although this relation is expected to have an intrinsic scatter. In order for lensing clusters to be a precision probe of cosmology in the future, the projection effects and <b>the</b> <b>scatter</b> in the lensing mass-observable relation need to be thoroughly characterized and modeled.|$|E
