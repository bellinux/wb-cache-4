5|$|On November 31, Smyth tried again, {{ordering}} his men {{to embark}} two hours before dawn {{in order to avoid}} enemy fire. This time, the embarkation was so slow that, <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> daylight, only 1,500 men were on board. Rather than attempt an amphibious landing in broad daylight, Smyth once again postponed the invasion. By this time, morale in Smyth’s command had plummeted: “all discipline had dissolved; the camp was a bedlam”. This, and widespread illness among the troops, persuaded a second council of war called by Smyth to suspend all offensive operations until the army was reinforced.|$|E

5|$|During the infection, {{rotavirus}} produces mRNA {{for both}} protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus {{as early as}} <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought {{to be made by}} two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.|$|E

5|$|Hernan rapidly {{weakened}} inland, and it {{was estimated}} that it had weakened to a tropical storm only <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> landfall. By 0000 UTC on October 4, Hernan weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression. Shortly thereafter, Hernan re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean, and the NHC noted that possibility for the depression to restrengthen into a tropical storm. Hernan weakened further as a large portion of its circulation remained on land, while the low-level center became difficult to locate. By 2100 UTC October 4, satellite images and surface reports indicated that Hernan had degenerated into a broad area of low pressure. Hernan finally dissipated at 0000 UTC the next day while centered over Nayarit.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to slow but grow in height. Either the trough or {{the crest of the}} tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into a bore.|$|E

5|$|Late on July13, a {{tropical}} depression developed near the Marshall Islands northeast of Kwajalein Atoll. The cyclone quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Fengshen just six hours after forming. On July14, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated warnings on Fengshen just <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> first monitoring the disturbance. By that time, the system {{consisted of a}} distinct circulation with developing convection, located {{in an area of}} weak wind shear. The storm initially moved northwestward, emerging from the monsoon trough as a small cyclone. Quick intensification followed, and an upper-level low to the northwest assisted in providing outflow. After a 13km (8mi) wide eye developed, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded Fengshen to a typhoon on July15 to the southwest of Wake Island; the JTWC also upgraded the storm the same day.|$|E
5|$|Omphalotus nidiformis is not edible. Although reputedly mild tasting, {{eating it}} {{will result in}} {{vomiting}} which generally occurs 30 minutes to <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> consumption and lasts for several hours. There is no diarrhea and patients recover without lasting ill-effects. Its toxicity was first mentioned by Anthony M. Young in his 1982 guidebook Common Australian Fungi. The toxic ingredient of many species of Omphalotus is a sesquiterpene compound known as illudin S. This, along with illudin M and a co-metabolite illudosin, {{have been identified in}} O.nidiformis. The two illudins are common to the genus Omphalotus and not found in any other basidiomycete mushroom. An additional three compounds unique to O.nidiformis have been identified and named illudins F, G and H.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began as}} a {{long-range}} gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced Tōgō to temporarily disengage. Over <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> {{the start of the}} battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck Retzivans forward turret near the gun ports, killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was forecast to strengthen slowly to reach peak winds of 45mph (75km/h). Within {{three hours of}} forming, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto. A small cyclone, the storm continued to organize quickly as it turned north-northeastward, while radar imagery suggested {{the formation of an}} eye by early on September 13. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, Humberto was upgraded to a hurricane at 0515UTC on September 13, while located about 15miles (20km) off the coast of Texas. The hurricane made landfall a few miles to the east of High Island at around 0700UTC. A well-defined eye was maintained with strong convection around it, and Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) about <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> landfall. However, post-storm analysis later determined that the winds were a bit stronger—about 90mph (150km/h).|$|E

5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the tunnel boring machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> the discovery of smoke in the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill.

5|$|François de Vergy, {{a member}} of the House of Vergy, had been {{informed}} of this attack by the townspeople, and he arrived in Besançon at dawn. He asked the soldiers if they were friendly, after which the insurgents responded with violence. After several exchanges of gunfire, the battle moved to the high street where the Protestants were armed with two pieces of artillery near the Battant. <b>Two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> the battle moved to the high street, de Vergy led a group of monks and priests to the battle, equipped with three cannons. The first two cannons did not fire, which caused doubt in the Catholic ranks, despite having over 300 men, many more than the Protestant forces. However, the third cannon fired, successfully causing panic among the Protestants. The Protestants continued their fight regardless, using cannons, firearms, and knives in an attempt to stop the Catholic forces and Claude de La Baume, their leader. The Protestant leader was severely injured and his horse was hit, causing disorder in the ranks of Huguenot troops, ultimately resulting in them attempting to retreat from the city.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Hernan was {{fourth and}} final {{tropical}} cyclone to strike Mexico at hurricane intensity during the 1996 Pacific hurricane season. The thirteenth tropical cyclone, eighth named storm, and fifth hurricane of the season, Hernan developed as a tropical depression from a tropical wave {{to the south of}} Mexico on September 30. The depression quickly strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Hernan later that day. Hernan curved north-northwestward the following day, before eventually turning north-northeastward. Still offshore of the Mexican coast on October 2, Hernan intensified into a hurricane. Six hours later, Hernan attained its peak as an 85mph (140km/h) Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). After weakening somewhat, on 1000 UTC October 3, Hurricane Hernan made landfall near Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, with winds of 75mph (120km/h). Only <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> landfall, Hernan weakened to a tropical storm. By October 4, Tropical Storm Hernan had weakened into a tropical depression, and dissipated over Nayarit on the following day.|$|E
