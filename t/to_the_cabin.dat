5|$|Alan and Alice {{arrive at}} a cabin on {{an island in the}} middle of Cauldron Lake. As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice {{arranged}} this trip to try to break his writer's block, scheduling him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter in the cabin for him. Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.|$|E
5|$|During the Voskhod 2 {{mission in}} March 1965, cosmonauts Pavel Belyayev and Alexey Leonov could not {{completely}} seal the spacecraft hatch after Leonov's historic first walk in space. The spacecraft's environmental control system {{responded to the}} leaking air by adding more oxygen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> causing the concentration level to rise as high as 45%. The crew and ground controllers worried {{about the possibility of}} fire, remembering Bondarenko's death four years earlier.|$|E
5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|In acquiescing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public {{campaign}} <b>to</b> save <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> <b>the</b> Board of Control for the Park {{insisted that}} they be allowed <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> as a shelter and reserved <b>the</b> right <b>to</b> remove <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> at any time. [...] <b>The</b> <b>cabin</b> was initially used as a shelter and dedicated on June 2, 1912 with ceremonies featuring members of California's congressional delegation and Senator Weldon B.

50|$|Although {{accounts}} differ as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exact {{details of}} the massacre and the numbers of Native Americans involved, there are common elements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> story. On September 10, 1812, Ruffner's servant (or his brother, Michael) was stopped {{by a group of}} four-six Native Americans and asked about the Zimmers. When Ruffner heard about this encounter, he was concerned and went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Zimmers' <b>cabin,</b> with his gun, to warn them. Ruffner arrived at the same time, or shortly before, the Native Americans and, fearing trouble, sent Philip Zimmer to warn nearby settlers and get assistance. Philip went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> of James Copus and John Lambright, and both men returned with Philip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Zimmers' <b>cabin.</b>|$|R
50|$|The DNR has {{a couple}} of {{abandoned}} <b>cabins</b> on <b>the</b> island that have not been used by the agency since at least 2008. The only remaining trail head that is not overgrown starts in close proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabins.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cabins</b> are named alpha and omega. They are in disrepair. The roofs leak, the windows/doors are not completely intact. Research teams spent time in <b>the</b> <b>cabins</b> years ago and there are some old remnants of that habitation which includes propane lights and appliances, some miscellaneous food and survival items.|$|R
5|$|Ellen {{encounters}} her possessed {{friend and}} flees into another room, grabbing knives to protect her. Something attempts {{to enter the}} room where Ellen is hiding, and she blindly lashes out with a knife - mistakenly stabbing Scotty who had just returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> While horrified, Ellen is then attacked by the possessed Bruce. Ellen manages to trap Bruce outside, stabbing Bruce's hand {{several times in the}} process. The bleeding Scotty tells Ellen to look into the cellar for the gun they brought along. While walking {{down the stairs to the}} cellar, she trips on a broken step and injures herself. After finding the gun, she goes back up stairs and discovers that Scotty had been stabbed to death while she was downstairs. The demonic Bruce then attacks her, but she manages to cut off his hand.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} {{arrive at the}} cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) proves to be an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail. Growing increasingly agitated, Ron agrees to a challenge that Leslie cannot shoot more birds than he can, and they split up. After {{a few hours of}} hunting, Ron screams and the others rush to his side and find he has been shot in the head. Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E
5|$|The first {{target of}} the WSGA was Nate Champion, {{who was at the}} KC Ranch (also known as Kaycee) at that time. They were tasked to perform the {{assassination}} that others had failed to carry out five months before. The group traveled to the ranch late Friday, April 8, 1892, quietly surrounded the buildings, and waited for daybreak. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men who were evidently going to spend the night on their way through were captured as they emerged from the cabin early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of the cabin. As the gunmen opened fire on the cabin, Champion grabbed the mortally wounded Nick Ray back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> The latter died hours later, and Champion was left besieged inside the log cabin alone.|$|E

5|$|By the 1840s, the {{boarding}} school {{had grown to}} 30 students. As the enrollment expanded, the Sibleys added new rooms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin.</b> The continued improvements created a financial strain on the school and Mary Sibley traveled to the East Coast to solicit additional funding. In the early 1850s, the school {{was on the brink}} of closing when the Sibleys offered the property to the Presbyterian Church. In 1853, the school was incorporated by special act of the Missouri Legislature and became known as the Lindenwood College for Women. The newly chartered college was placed under the control of 15 directors appointed by the Presbytery of St. Louis. On July 4, 1856, the cornerstone was laid for a new permanent brick building to replace the original log cabins. The new building, Sibley Hall, was completed in July 1857, and at the time contained the entire school. This event marked {{the beginning of a new}} era of significant growth for Lindenwood.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{decide not}} to get {{together}} officially until he breaks up with Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). On {{their way back to}} Scranton, they stop at Jessica's family's log cabin, where they encounter a bunch of Jessica's friends having a bachelorette party and drinking. Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from her morning run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into the kitchen where she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy told her he did not think Erin was relationship material. Andy does not deny saying that, instead opting to claim that he is gay and leaves awkwardly with Erin. In the car, Andy says he made those comments about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to head back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin back to the car. Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E

5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by <b>the</b> <b>cabin</b> rupture, <b>the</b> convective rush of air caused <b>the</b> flames <b>to</b> spread across <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> beginning <b>the</b> second phase. The third phase began {{when most of the}} oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> <b>cabin,</b> and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|R
