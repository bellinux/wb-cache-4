60|$|On {{these points}} {{no doubt the}} Baroness de Bernstein <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> communed with herself in her private apartment.|$|E
60|$|And {{his wife}} <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> looked at him, {{that she would}} like to see Mr. Parr try it, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is so seldom," [...] she <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{lifted the}} lid of her desk, [...] "that things can be {{arranged}} so as to please everybody." ...|$|E
50|$|Felicia Hemans' poem Arabella Stuart {{is about}} Arbella, imagining her <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> died in prison.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final chapter}} of Ulysses, often called [...] "Molly Bloom's Soliloquy", {{is a long}} and unpunctuated stream of {{consciousness}} passage comprising her <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lies in bed next to Bloom.|$|R
60|$|Tavernake glanced around. The {{young women}} whom {{she pointed out}} were all escorted by men who were {{scrupulously}} attired in evening dress. She seemed to read his <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> laughed at him.|$|R
60|$|Bella {{was amazed}} by the flush in his face, and by his sudden turning away. 'What can it mean?' she <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{accompanied}} him up stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] she <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> went away; [...] "but any fool {{could have}} told me that. This wise man is a fraud; even my husband is as wise as he." ...|$|E
6000|$|Susan {{shook her}} head. She disapproved entirely of such ejaculations. [...] "I hope {{he will not}} let his mother hear him talking like that," [...] she <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> stacked the hoes and rake away.|$|E
6000|$|... "It 'ud {{be wrong}} {{of me to}} say nothing 'ud turn her," [...] he answered. [...] "But if thee mean'st it about myself, I've given up all <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> can ever be my wife. She calls me her brother, and that's enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Comparing ornaments! Worthy {{of such a}} friendship,' <b>thought</b> <b>she,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> held back, {{and made}} them go down before her, Emma glad to hold by Violet's arm for protection.|$|R
50|$|Religion: Again a {{call back}} to colonial times, {{the theme of}} {{religion}} {{is present in the}} interactions between characters. Kambili's father rejects her Grandfather because of his animist beliefs. This is also present in Kambili's <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is always worried not to commit a sin and scared to anger her father.|$|R
6000|$|... "How fond {{that girl}} is of me!" [...] he <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> stood gazing at him. [...] "Shall I {{speak to her}} now? No--not now. I must have this absurd {{business}} with the Frenchman over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{handsome}} he is!" [...] {{the girl}} <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> studied his quiet face. [...] "His profile is especially fine, {{and the line}} {{of his neck and}} shoulders--" [...] an impulse seized her, and she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope she}} won't notice my eyes," [...] she <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> hastily plumped a big ugly dark-green shade, with an almond-eyed oriental leering from it, over the lamp, before {{going out to}} let Margaret in.|$|E
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} have {{forgotten}} all about her companion for a moment, and be busy with her own <b>thoughts,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> put away her treasures with a care which made it a pleasure to watch her tie knots, adjust covers, repack her little bag, and finally fold her hands over it, saying gravely,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|No melancholy gaps here! <b>thought</b> <b>she,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{helped her}} uncle to the easy chair {{prepared}} {{for him at}} the dinner-table; no spiritless curiosity, no forced attempts to display what no one felt! ...|$|R
40|$|A Night Walk is a {{collection}} of persona poems from the viewpoint of of one character, a woman on the fringes of society who is a fairly recent transplant in New York. She is having a crisis of faith, struggling with whether God is out there or listening. These are her <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> walks from dusk until daybreak...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{him talking}} to my old friend Tommy Tit the Chickadee, and I just know that Tommy will {{tell me all about}} him," [...] she <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> scampered along certain private little paths of her own.|$|E
60|$|She {{would like}} that, she <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> clambered {{up the steep}} paths; and perhaps she would meet these American girls again, or others like them, and make them her friends. She had never known a girl friend, as yet.|$|E
60|$|The {{gratitude}} of Mrs. Gisborne, {{now free}} from all anxiety, was touching. But Merton {{assured her that}} he knew nothing whatever of the stratagem, scarcely a worthy one, he <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> reported it, by which her uncle was disentangled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will begin}} at once, and show them that I don't mean to shirk my duty, though I do want to be nice," [...] <b>thought</b> <b>she,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat at supper one night and looked about her, {{planning}} her first move.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you {{can love}} him?" [...] Coming from Lady Persiflage this {{did seem to}} be romantic; {{but she had been}} stirred up to some serious <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> remembered that she was now {{surrendering}} to a husband the girl whom she had made, whom she had tutored, whom she had prepared either for the good or for the evil performance of the duties of life.|$|R
60|$|Did she wish {{to escape}} even? Juanna knew not; but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat {{there with a}} sphinx-like face, trouble and doubt, and many another fear and feeling, took so firm a hold of her that at length her mind, bewildered with its own tumult, lost its grip of present realities, and sought refuge in dreams which he could not disentangle. No wonder, then, that Leonard failed to guess her <b>thoughts,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> watched him go from the death-bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Miss Lowery," [...] {{broke in}} Tripp, loudly, and with much bad taste, I <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> hesitated with her word, [...] "you like this young man, Hiram Dodd, don't you? He's all right, and good to you, ain't he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{would be}} much to see, Fan <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> set out on her expedition. She had {{secretly}} planned it in her mind, and had thought about it by day and dreamed about it by night--how much there would be to see! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's {{the best}} place for such {{inflammable}} nonsense. I'd better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder," [...] she <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> watched the Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.|$|E
60|$|Needless to say, {{it did not}} cure him, {{although}} it sealed Lily Dallam's fate--and incidentally that of Quicksands. Honora's <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat now at the piano watching him, flew back unexpectedly to the summer at Silverdale when she had met him, {{and she tried to}} imagine, the genial and boyish representative of finance that he was then. In the midst of this effort he looked up and discovered her.|$|R
6000|$|... "What would Meg say to this?" [...] <b>thought</b> Jo, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was marched away, {{while her}} eyes danced with fun <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{imagined}} herself {{telling the story}} at home.|$|R
6000|$|Fanny spoke fast, {{and laughed}} uncomfortably, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{went back to}} the sofa, {{wondering}} if Polly had told her a lie. Polly seemed to guess at her <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> saw the card, and turning toward her, she held it up, saying, with a conscious look in her eyes, [...] "You thought Mr. Sydney sent them? Well, you are mistaken, and the next time you want to know anything, please ask straight out. I like it better than talking at cross purposes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Afraid?" [...] He <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{repeated}} the word, that his question had made her, a little, change colour; so that, lest {{he should have}} touched on a truth, he explained very kindly: [...] "You remember that that was what you asked me long ago--that first day at Weatherend." ...|$|E
6000|$|They parted, Farfrae {{returning}} {{into the}} dark Bowling Walk, and Elizabeth-Jane going up the street. Without any consciousness {{of what she was}} doing she started running with all her might till she reached her father's door. [...] "O dear me--what am I at?" [...] she <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> pulled up breathless.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} this magnanimity Dorothea was still smarting: perhaps as much from Celia's subdued astonishment as from her small criticisms. Of course all the world round Tipton {{would be out of}} sympathy with this marriage. Dorothea knew of no one who <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did about life and its best objects.|$|E
25|$|The book {{is framed}} and narrated by Liza's <b>thoughts</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{attempts}} to write Annie a letter, {{in response to}} the many letters Annie has sent her. This narration comes right before the winter break of both their colleges' and Liza is unable to write or mail the letter she had been working on. Instead she calls Annie, and the two reconcile and decide to meet together before going home for winter break.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Everybody says [...] "come on!" [...] here,' <b>thought</b> Alice, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> went slowly after it: 'I {{never was}} so ordered about {{in all my}} life, never!' ...|$|R
60|$|Worse {{than the}} Giant's Causeway, <b>thought</b> Albinia <b>as</b> <b>she</b> parted from him. Nothing is so hopeless as {{that sort of}} forgiveness, because it {{satisfies}} the conscience.|$|R
