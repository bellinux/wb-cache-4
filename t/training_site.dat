5|$|The castle {{was removed}} from active service in January 1945 and reopened to the public the {{following}} year. The Second World War gun battery was finally closed in 1956 {{after several years of}} use as a <b>training</b> <b>site.</b> Between 1945 and 1970, much of the Victorian earthwork and concrete defences were cleared from the Grand Sea Battery, and the 1941 battery was completely destroyed.|$|E
30|$|The {{supervised}} classification {{made use of}} 15 <b>training</b> <b>sites</b> per habitat identified on the image. As a rule {{there should be an}} adequate sample of pixels for each cover type for statistical characterization. A general rule of thumb is that the number of pixels in each training set (i.e., all the <b>training</b> <b>sites</b> for a single cover class) should not be less than ten times the number of bands. Hence, the use of three bands in the classification processes with 45 <b>training</b> <b>sites</b> in each cover type, each has fifteen classes.|$|R

5|$|Tinker {{ended his}} {{involvement}} in professional baseball, focusing instead on his real estate ventures during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. He developed a successful real estate firm, buying and selling land in Orange County and Seminole County. He purchased the Longwood Hotel, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1926. Tinker convinced Reds owner Garry Herrmann to use his stadium in Orlando for their spring <b>training</b> <b>site</b> in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Wendover Air Force Base is {{a former}} United States Air Force base in Utah now known as Wendover Airport. During World War II, it was a {{training}} base for B-17 and B-24 bomber crews.

5|$|The Palmach Cave {{is located}} in the {{outskirts}} of the kibbutz, near the forest. It was used by the Palmach unit of the Jewish militia during the Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine. The cave was chosen by the Palmach upon its establishment in 1941, as a <b>training</b> <b>site</b> for the Palmach's special undercover units. The cave was also used for meetings between the commanders of the Palmach. Before it was used by the Palmach it was used as a playground by the kibbutz' kids, and before that it was used as a shelter for Bedouin nomads during their voyages. Today the cave is a tourist attraction and educational site run {{by a member of the}} kibbutz.|$|E

40|$|A lot of {{habitats}} {{have declined}} or disappeared {{as the old}} cultural landscape changed to the modern agricultural landscape of today. Places such as power line corridors, racing tracks, gravel pits and military <b>training</b> <b>sites</b> have become refuges for many species associated with the old cultural landscape. These sites {{have been exposed to}} ecological disturbances that create the same type of habitats that were found in the old cultural landscape. The military <b>training</b> <b>sites</b> in Sweden has an impressive diversity of species. Disturbances from the military exercises have created habitats that are important {{for a wide range of}} species. The purpose of this thesis is to study some of the ecological disturbances occurring in the military <b>training</b> <b>sites</b> of the Swedish Armed Forces and examine how they affect different types of habitats. The thesis explains through litterateur and field studies the reason to the rich biodiversity often found at military <b>training</b> <b>sites.</b> The <b>training</b> <b>sites</b> and firing ranges of Skövde garrison were used as an example to show how the disturbances affect the environment. The study shows that military exercises (e. g. with combat vehicles) creates habitats that previously existed in the old cultural landscape. Soil damage from combat vehicles benefits insects and creates pools for amphibians. Damages on trees create snags and woody debris which favors a large amount of species. The military exercises also keep an open landscape...|$|R

5|$|All of SR 607 {{is located}} in central Morgan County, Ohio. The state route starts at the {{intersection}} of SR60 near McConnelsville. SR607 travels north {{for the majority of the}} length. SR 607 passes near an Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) county garage near the beginning of the road. Halfway through the route, SR607 meets Township Road 696 in a T-intersection, where the route moves slightly westward. After that, there is an Ohio Army National Guard <b>training</b> <b>site</b> at Hawk Drive. The route keeps moving north until it ends at SR78 at another T-intersection. The route goes through mostly forests and small hills. In 2012, ODOT calculated 1,975 vehicles traveling south of McGovern Lane. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. No part of SR607 is included within the National Highway System, a system of routes deemed most important for the economy, defense and mobility of the country.|$|E
5|$|Baden-Powell {{could not}} single-handedly advise all groups who {{requested}} his assistance. Early Scoutmaster training camps {{were held in}} London and Yorkshire in 1910 and 1911. Baden-Powell wanted the training to be as practical as possible to encourage other adults to take leadership roles, so the Wood Badge course was developed to recognize adult leadership training. The development of the training was delayed by World War I, so the first Wood Badge course was not held until 1919. Wood Badge is used by Boy Scout associations and combined Boy Scout and Girl Guide associations in many countries. Gilwell Park near London was purchased in 1919 on behalf of The Scout Association as an adult <b>training</b> <b>site</b> and Scouting campsite. Baden-Powell wrote a book, Aids to Scoutmastership, to help Scouting Leaders, and wrote other handbooks {{for the use of}} the new Scouting sections, such as Cub Scouts and Girl Guides. One of these was Rovering to Success, written for Rover Scouts in 1922. A wide range of leader training exists in 2007, from basic to program-specific, including the Wood Badge training.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale {{is served}} by Broward General Medical Center and Imperial Point Medical Center, which are {{operated}} by Broward Health, the third largest hospital consortium in the United States. Broward General is a 716-bed acute care facility which is designated as a Level I trauma center. It {{is also home to}} Chris Evert Children's Hospital and a Heart Center of Excellence. The hospital serves as a major <b>training</b> <b>site</b> for medical students from Nova Southeastern University's College of Osteopathic Medicine, as well as nursing and paramedic programs from throughout the area. Imperial Point Medical Center is a 204-bed facility with a hyperbaric medicine program. Holy Cross Hospital, a 571-bed hospital operated by the Sisters of Mercy, was named by HealthGrades as one of the 50 best hospitals in the country for 2007.|$|E

5|$|Germany: The {{species is}} known from two {{different}} areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-Württemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site. The species is also known from the Kyffhäuser hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest. The species was also recorded in deciduous forest at a former Soviet military <b>training</b> <b>site</b> in eastern Thuringia. M.alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water. However, the species was also recorded {{in the center of}} the city of Chemnitz in Saxony.|$|E
5|$|Kuntz was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} with the Marlins before spring training in 2002. The move {{was part of a}} mass firing of Marlins personnel in player development and scouting after the team's change in ownership. Kuntz, who was paid for the 2002 season in any case due to the terms of his contract, kept a job working on the grounds crew at the team's spring <b>training</b> <b>site.</b> He had performed ground crew duties at the site for several years in the offseasons. Late in the 2002 season, the Atlanta Braves hired Kuntz as a roving instructor. After the season, he was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates as a first-base coach. In October 2005, the Pirates offered minor league positions to Kuntz and fellow coaches Gerald Perry and Alvaro Espinoza. He spent the next two seasons coaching between the Class AAA Indianapolis Indians and the major league club.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, Parrish, {{who appears to}} have been fired from the FBI, is working a desk job as an analyst at the CIA while living with Shelby and {{continuing}} her relationship with Ryan, who later becomes her fiancé. Flashbacks reveal that she is working undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit. She is tasked with uncovering a rogue faction of the CIA called the AIC. At The Farm, she is joined with other recruits, including Harry Doyle (Russell Tovey), Dayana Mampasi (Pearl Thusi), Sebastian Chen (David Lim), León Velez (Aarón Díaz), Leigh Davis (Heléne Yorke), and Jeremy Miller (David Call). Ryan later joins the other recruits at the site, much to Alex's surprise. Some time after her recruitment, Alex has a meeting with Matthew Keyes and Miranda Shaw. It is revealed that she was recruited by the CIA as part of a covert mission to establish any potential threats within the agency. Ryan is also recruited by the agency for the same mission. Owen Hall (Blair Underwood) is confirmed to be the primary CIA instructor for the <b>training</b> <b>site</b> at TheFarm. In addition, Lydia Hall (Tracy Ifeachor) is later revealed to be another trainer on-site. Alex and the other recruits undergo a series of training assessments in order to become future case officers. After being kicked out of TheFarm by Lydia, Alex goes back to working as an analyst. In addition, she breaks off her engagement with Ryan some time before the 2018 G-20 hostage crisis in New York.|$|E
