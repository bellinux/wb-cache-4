With the aim to generalize transfers to input motions possibly very diverse with respect to the training sets, the method contributes with a new transfer model based on non-linear pose interpolation. Building on Gaussian process regression, this model intends to capture and preserve individual motion properties, and thereby realism, by accounting for pose inter-dependencies during motion transfers.

40|$|Movie {{and game}} {{production}} is very laborious, frequently involving hundreds of person-years {{for a single}} project. At present this work is difficult to fully automate, since it involves subjective and artistic judgments. Broadly speaking, in this thesis we explore an approach that works with the artist, accelerating their work without attempting to replace them. More specifically, we describe an “example-based” approach, in which artists provide examples of the desired shapes of the character, and the results gradually improve as more examples are given. Since a character’s skin shape deforms as the pose or expression changes, or particular problem will be termed character deformation. The overall goal of this thesis is to contribute a complete investigation and development of an example-based approach to character deformation. A central observation guiding this research is that character animation can be formulated as a high-dimensional problem, rather than the two- or three-dimensional viewpoint that is commonly adopted in computer graphics. A second observation guiding our inquiry is that statistical learning concepts are relevant. We show that example-based character animation algorithms can be informed, developed, and improved using these observations. This thesis provides definitive surveys of example-based facial and body skin deformation. This thesis analyzes the two leading families of example-based character deformation algorithms {{from the point of}} view of statistical regression. In doing so we show that a wide variety of existing tools in machine learning are applicable to our problem. We also identify several techniques that are not suitable due to the nature of the training data, and the high-dimensional nature of this regression problem. We evaluate the design decisions underlying these example-based algorithms, thus providing the groundwork for a ”best practice” choice of specific algorithms. This thesis develops several new algorithms for accelerating example-based facial animation. The first algorithm allows unspecified degrees of freedom to be automatically determined based on the style of previous, completed animations. A second algorithm allows rapid editing and control of the process of <b>transferring</b> <b>motion</b> capture of a human actor to a computer graphics character. The thesis identifies and develops several unpublished relations between the underlying mathematical techniques.

40|$|Robot motion can be {{described}} in several alternative representations, including joint configuration or end-effector spaces. These representations are often used for manipulation or navigation tasks but they are not suitable for tasks that involve close interaction with the environment. In these scenarios, collisions and relative poses of the robot and its surroundings create a complex planning space. To deal with this complexity, we exploit several representations that capture the state of the interaction, rather than the state of the robot. Borrowing notions of topology invariances and homotopy classes, we design task spaces based on winding numbers and writhe for synthesizing winding motion, and electro-static fields for planning reaching and grasping motion. Our experiments show that these representations capture the motion, preserving its qualitative properties, while generalising over finer geometrical detail. Based on the same motivation, we utilise a scale and rotation invariant representation for locally preserving distances, called interaction mesh. The interaction mesh allows for <b>transferring</b> <b>motion</b> between robots of different scales (motion re-targeting), between humans and robots (teleoperation) and between different environments (motion adaptation). To estimate the state of the environment we employ real-time sensing techniques utilizing dense stereo tracking, magnetic tracking sensors and inertia measurements units. We combine and exploit these representations for synthesis and generalization of motion in dynamic environments. The benefit of this method is on problems where direct planning in joint space is extremely hard whereas local optimal control exploiting topology and metric of these novel representations can efficiently compute optimal trajectories. We formulate this approach in the framework of optimal control as an approximate inference problem. This allows for consistent combination of multiple task spaces (e. g. end-effector, joint space and the abstract task spaces we investigate in this thesis). Motion generalization to novel situations and kinematics is similarly performed by projecting motion from abstract representations to joint configuration space. This technique, based on operational space control, allows us to adapt the motion in real time. This process of real-time re-mapping generates robust motion, thus reducing the amount of re-planning. We have implemented our approach as a part of an open source project called the Extensible Optimisation library (EXOTica). This software allows for defining motion synthesis problems by combining task representations and presenting this problem to various motion planners using a common interface. Using EXOTica, we perform comparisons between different representations and different planners to validate that these representations truly improve the motion planning...|$|E
40|$|Tendon-based {{transmission}} {{is a common}} approach for <b>transferring</b> <b>motion</b> and forces in surgical robots. In spite of design simplicity and compactness {{that comes with the}} tendon drives, there exists a number of issues associated with the tendon-based transmission. In particular, the elasticity of the tendons and the frictional interaction between the tendon and the routing result in substantially nonlinear behavior. Also, in surgical applications, the distal joints of the robot and instruments cannot be sensorized in most cases due to technical limitations. Therefore, direct measurement of forces and use of feedback motion/force control for compensation of uncertainties in tendon-based motion and force transmission are not possible. However, force/motion estimation and control in tendon-based robots are important in view of the need for haptic feedback in robotic surgery and growing interest in automatizing common surgical tasks. One possible solution to the above-described problem is the development of mathematical models for tendon-based force and motion transmission {{that can be used for}} estimation and control purposes. This thesis provides analysis of force and motion transmission in tendon-pulley based surgical robots and addresses various aspects of the transmission modeling problem. Due to similarities between the quasi-static hysteretic behavior of a tendon-pulley based da Vinci® instrument and that of a typical tendon-sheath mechanism, a distributed friction approach for modeling the force transmission in the instrument is developed. The approach is extended to derive a formula for the apparent stiffness of the instrument. Consequently, a method is developed that uses the formula for apparent stiffness of the instrument to determine the stiffness distribution of the tissue palpated. The force transmission hysteresis is further investigated from a phenomenological point of view. It is shown that a classic Preisach hysteresis model can accurately describe the quasi-static input-output force transmission behavior of the da Vinci® instrument. Also, in order to describe the distributed friction effect in tendon-pulley mechanisms, the creep theory from belt mechanics is adopted for the robotic applications. As a result, a novel motion transmission model is suggested for tendon-pulley mechanisms. The developed model is of pseudo-kinematic type as it relates the output displacement to both the input displacement and the input force. The model is subsequently used for position control of the tip of the instrument. Furthermore, the proposed pseudo-kinematic model is extended to compensate for the coupled-hysteresis effect in a multi-DOF motion. A dynamic transmission model is also suggested that describes system’s response to high frequency inputs. Finally, the proposed motion transmission model was used for modeling of the backlash-like hysteresis in RAVEN II surgical robot...|$|E
