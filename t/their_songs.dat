5|$|The band is {{organized}} quite simply with Paul and Joe playing <b>their</b> <b>songs</b> {{in a simple}} basic guitar-synth-and-drums indie pop style and they sing in the semi-deadpan way; a review found the vocal delivery {{similar to that of}} They Might Be Giants. The raison d’être of the band is to put enough energy and spirit into <b>their</b> <b>songs</b> to make them fun.|$|E

5|$|<b>Their</b> <b>songs</b> can be {{confused}} with the Kentucky warbler. The song patterns are similar, but is of a different quality, as the warbler's songs is described as richer, with more ringing and a hurried pace. Other bird species that have <b>their</b> <b>songs</b> described as akin to the wrens are the flicker, Baltimore oriole, gray catbird, and more specifically the peto, peto, peto calls of the tufted titmouse, and whistles of the northern cardinal.

5|$|Just {{like most}} punk songs, Girlschool’s lyrics usually have short and direct texts, often {{reflecting}} the wild rock 'n' roll lifestyle and treating sex and romance {{as seen from}} a feminine point of view, {{with the use of}} reverse sexism and tongue-in-cheek sense of humour. Some of <b>their</b> <b>songs</b> deal also with more serious matters, such as exploitation and abuse of women, murder, addiction, the destruction of the environment, social and political issues.|$|E

The cast recorded the vocal tracks for <b>their</b> <b>songs</b> as coached by Elaine Overholt in the weeks just before principal photography began in September.|$|E

5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of <b>their</b> <b>songs</b> explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|English {{rock band}} Led Zeppelin {{recorded}} 108 songs during their career. Between 1969 and 1980, they released eight studio albums, one live album, and sixteen singles.

25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{compilation}} albums of hits {{by multiple}} different artists became popular, and if artists and producers found <b>their</b> <b>song</b> was quieter than {{others on the}} compilation, they would insist that <b>their</b> <b>song</b> be remastered to be competitive.|$|R
5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release <b>their</b> <b>songs.</b> John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E
5|$|From the promoter's viewpoint, Simon and Garfunkel were ideal choices.

Music critic Stephen Holden pointed out that, unlike artists who had left in pursuit of lifestyles offered by other locales, the two {{had always been a}} part of New York City. Both gained {{inspiration}} from the cityscape and the cultural variety of New York, and spoke of these influences in <b>their</b> <b>songs.</b>|$|E

The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise <b>their</b> <b>songs</b> {{at the end of the}} programme.|$|E
