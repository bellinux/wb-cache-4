40|$|A <b>control</b> <b>room</b> {{is defined}} as a {{functional}} entity with an associated physical structure, where the operators carry out the centralized control, monitoring and administrative responsibilities. Emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> acts as an alternative <b>control</b> <b>room</b> for the purpose of shutting down or maintaining the facility in a safe shutdown state when the main <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is uninhabitable. The mission of emergency <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is to provide the resources to bring the plant to a safe shutdown condition after an evacuation of the main <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> An evacuation of the main <b>control</b> <b>room</b> is assumed when there is no possibility to accomplish tasks involved in the shutdown except reactor trip.
