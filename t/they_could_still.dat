5|$|Barcelona's UEFA {{coefficient}} {{placed them}} in the top eight seeds for the draw, meaning that they would avoid having to play against Internazionale, Liverpool, Chelsea or holders and their semi-final opponents from 2007–08, Manchester United. However, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> draw Bayern Munich, Roma or Juventus. In the end, Barcelona were drawn into Group C against Sporting CP, Basel and Shakhtar Donetsk.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{also had}} {{significant}} political repercussions, shaking the British Army's confidence. The {{fact that the}} siege had taken so long exposed the British forces' vulnerabilities and encouraged the native Indian states– in particular the old Maratha Confederacy in central India– to continue their resistance against British imperialism {{in the hope that}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be defeated.|$|E
5|$|As American fighters {{took over}} the {{long-range}} escorting of United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) daylight bombing raids, the Griffon-engined Spitfires progressively took up the tactical air superiority role, and {{played a major role}} in intercepting V-1 flying bombs, while the Merlin-engined variants (mainly the Mk IX and the Packard-engined Mk XVI) were adapted to the fighter-bomber role. Although the later Griffon-engined marks lost some of the favourable handling characteristics of their Merlin-powered predecessors, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> outmanoeuvre their main German foes and other, later American and British-designed fighters.|$|E

5|$|On 17 November 1994 the USAF {{announced}} that Colwell had recommended to Croker that Wang face court-martial and that Halcli receive nonjudicial administrative {{action on the}} dereliction of duty charges. Colwell recommended that the formal dereliction of duty charges be dropped against the other AWACS crew members, but that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> face nonjudicial action. Croker accepted Colwell's recommendation and ordered Wang to face court-martial and dismissed the criminal charges against the other AWACS crew members except Halcli, who was offered Article 15 action.|$|E
5|$|Four {{wins and}} a draw {{at home to}} Basel placed Barcelona {{on top of their}} group with a game to spare, and despite defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk on Matchday 6, they still had the third-best record amongst the qualifiers for the first {{knockout}} round. As group winners, Barcelona would avoid being drawn with other group winners, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Juventus and Bayern Munich, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be drawn against runners-up such as Chelsea, Internazionale and Arsenal. The draw eventually paired them with Olympique Lyonnais and, as group winners, they were given the right to play the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June {{the court}} acquitted nine medics and {{downgraded}} sentences against nine others. Ali Al-Ekri {{was sentenced to}} five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other doctors did not appeal their sentences of 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed the first case involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although the verdict is final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be pardoned by the king.|$|E

60|$|They were in {{the open}} road again, and John Willet was walking on behind his escort, as he had come, {{thinking}} very steadily {{of what he had}} just now seen, when Hugh drew him suddenly aside, and almost at the same instant three horsemen swept past--the nearest brushed his shoulder even then--who, checking their steeds as suddenly as <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> stood <b>still,</b> and waited for their coming up.|$|R
60|$|The {{realization}} {{that they might}} become snowbound {{on the way to}} Pepsico made Porton pause, and in the end he agreed to visit a drinking place several blocks away, which, by the light shining dimly through the window, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> see was <b>still</b> open.|$|R
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood {{strapped}} to the performers' bodies. Animal blood gathered from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|With Zaireeka, The Flaming Lips had {{overcome}} {{the loss of}} Ronald Jones and proved <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> work as a band. The situation at Warner Bros. Records was still dire, including a risk of being dropped from the label. However, songs had already been written for the next album, The Soft Bulletin, which would be both a critical hit for the band and their breakthrough into mainstream success. Following the release of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots in 2002, The Flaming Lips {{would return to the}} concept of surround sound with a DVD-Audio special-edition of that album in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Another {{source of}} crown income was {{represented}} by England's Jews. The Jews were the king's personal property, and {{he was free to}} tax them at will. By 1280, the Jews had been exploited to a level at which they were no longer of much financial use to the crown, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be used in political bargaining. Their usury businessa practice forbidden to Christianshad made many people indebted to them and caused general popular resentment. In 1275, Edward had issued the Statute of the Jewry, which outlawed usury and encouraged the Jews to take up other professions; in 1279, {{in the context of a}} crack-down on coin-clippers, he arrested all the heads of Jewish households in England and had around 300 of them executed. In 1280, he ordered all Jews to attend special sermons, preached by Dominican friars, with the hope of persuading them to convert, but these exhortations were not followed. The final attack on the Jews in England came in the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, whereby Edward formally expelled all Jews from England. This not only generated revenues through royal appropriation of Jewish loans and property, but it also gave Edward the political capital to negotiate a substantial lay subsidy in the 1290 Parliament. The expulsion, which was reversed in 1656, followed a precedent set by other European territorial princes: Philip II of France had expelled all Jews from his own lands in 1182; John I, Duke of Brittany, drove them out of his duchy in 1239; and in the late 1240s Louis IX of France had expelled the Jews from the royal demesne before his first passage to the East.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than anyone}} else, Lobby {{helped create the}} Australian guitar sound, long before Angus [...] or Billy Thorpe or The Angels or Rose Tattoo.

25|$|The judge {{instructed}} {{the jury that}} they could not find Mrs Gough guilty of manslaughter, since only Mr Gough was strong enough to have inflicted the trauma which killed Dennis, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> find her guilty of neglect.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Music Manager was {{discontinued}} {{and music}} uploaded {{to the site}} by musicians and record labels became totally inaccessible; post-Spotify integration <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be played and downloaded (where the option was given) but following this change not even the artists themselves are able to access their songs in the Last.fm catalogue.|$|E
25|$|Time {{passes and}} Papa starts leading the boycott against Wallace's store. Mr. Jamison visits and Big Ma signs papers {{transferring}} {{the land to}} Papa and Hammer.

Hammer returns to Chicago.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} school colour of {{navy blue}} was determined in the 1880s when SACS pupils purchased the only pattern available of alternating white, light- and dark-blue horizontal stripes from Porter Hodgson's Outfitters in Cape Town. Prior to this, the pupils wore what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> afford while <b>still</b> being presentable.|$|R
60|$|They milked {{entirely in}} the meads for coolness and convenience, without driving in the cows.

50|$|New survey projects, {{such as the}} Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) program under {{construction}} by the University of Hawaii, aim to greatly {{increase the number of}} small (approximately 10 m) impactors that are discovered before atmospheric entry—typically with days to weeks of warning, enabling evacuations of the affected areas and damage mitigation planning. This is in contrast to past and current surveys, which have focused on finding much larger (greater than 100 m) objects decades before any potential impacts, at times when <b>they</b> <b>could</b> potentially <b>still</b> be deflected.|$|R
25|$|June {{started with}} a draw against Leicestershire, before two losses in the one-day league - to Leicestershire and Kent. Despite the poor one-day form, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> pull off a four-wicket win against the Australians, however, widely {{recognised}} as {{the best in the}} world. Form eluded them in the league, though, as they whimpered to a 15-run defeat at the hands of Scotland at Taunton.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the Arabian oryx {{probably}} ranged {{throughout most}} of the Middle East. In the early 1800s, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be found in the Sinai, Palestine, the Transjordan, much of Iraq, and most of the Arabian Peninsula. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, their range was pushed back towards Saudi Arabia, and by 1914, only a few survived outside that country. A few were reported in Jordan into the 1930s, but by the mid-1930s, the only remaining populations were in the Nafud Desert in northwestern Saudi Arabia and the Rub' al Khali in the south.|$|E
25|$|Originally built without {{auxiliary}} propulsion, SuomenJoutsen was refitted {{with two}} Skandia hot bulb engines, each producing 200hp, coupled to three-bladed fixed pitch propellers. The twin-shaft propulsion arrangement was very uncommon at that time. In practice the engines were found {{out to be}} underpowered, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be used to assist manoeuvering in ports and in heavy weather. Two generators (5kW and 8kW) were added to produce electricity for about three hundred lights. While SuomenJoutsen had a steam boiler for central heating, {{she did not have}} steam winches — anchors and yards were lifted using a manual capstan.|$|E

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1968, a massive {{campaign}} began, aimed at promoting the already-adored Mao to god-like status. On July 27, 1968, the Red Guards' power over the army was officially ended and the central government sent in units to protect many areas that remained targets for the Red Guards. A year later, the Red Guard factions were dismantled entirely; Mao feared that the chaos <b>they</b> caused—and <b>could</b> <b>still</b> cause—might begin running its own agenda and be turned against {{what was left of}} the party organization. Their purpose had been largely fulfilled; Mao and his radical colleagues had largely consolidated their political power.|$|R
60|$|The {{roads in}} Holland, {{straight}} and level, and shaded {{all the way}} with trees, look, from the railway-carriage window, as {{if they would be}} good for cycling; but this is a delusion. I crossed in the boat from Harwich once, with a well-known black and white artist, and an equally well-known and highly respected humorist. They had their bicycles with them, intending to tour Holland. I met them a fortnight later in Delft, or, rather, I met their remains. I was horrified at first. I thought it was drink. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> not stand <b>still,</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not sit <b>still,</b> <b>they</b> trembled and shook in every limb, their teeth chattered when they tried to talk. The humorist hadn't a joke left in him. The artist could not have drawn his own salary; he would have dropped it on the way to his pocket. The Dutch roads are paved their entire length with cobbles--big, round cobbles, over which your bicycle leaps and springs and plunges.|$|R
25|$|Iron became {{increasingly}} common from the 13th century B.C. Before {{that the use}} of swords was less frequent. The iron was not quench-hardened although often containing sufficient carbon, but work-hardened like bronze by hammering. This made them comparable or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to bronze swords. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> bend during use rather than spring back into shape. But the easier production, and the better availability of the raw material for the first time permitted the equipment of entire armies with metal weapons, though Bronze Age Egyptian armies were sometimes fully equipped with bronze weapons.|$|E
25|$|Since Byzantine law was {{essentially}} based on Roman law, {{the legal status}} of women did not change significantly from the practices of the 6th century. But the traditional restriction of women in the public life as well as the hostility against independent women still continued. Greater influence of Greek culture contributed to strict attitudes about women'roles being domestic instead of being public. There was also a growing trend of women who were not prostitutes, slaves or entertainers to be entirely veiled. Like previous Roman law, women could not be legal witnesses, hold administrations or run banking but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> inherit properties and own land.|$|E
25|$|The cricket {{broadcasts}} {{take precedence}} over on-the-hour news bulletins, but not the Shipping Forecast, carried since its move to long wave in 1978 because that can be received clearly at sea. The station is the UK's national broadcaster in times of national emergency such as war, due to the wide coverage of the Droitwich signal: if all other radio stations were forced to close, it would carry on broadcasting. It has been claimed that the commanders of nuclear-armed submarines believing that Britain had suffered nuclear attack were required to check if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> receive Radio 4 on 198 long wave, and if they could not they would open sealed orders that might authorise a retaliatory strike.|$|E
50|$|When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, Tom Lynch and {{his fellow}} {{contractors}} John White decided {{to get out of}} Iraq while <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>could,</b> but were captured by Iraqi soldiers and taken to a notorious prison in Baghdad, where they must listen to inmates being tortured to death.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1980s major {{alterations}} and extensions took place. This {{was possible}} {{due to the}} acquisition of an old shop next door, which was incorporated into the theatre allowing the theatre to expand and add more facilities to a much better equipped theatre. During this period, the theatre's executive body also purchased land and houses that surrounded the theatre, as a result <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>still</b> remain able to, rent out the houses/apartments with the funds being used to support the theatre and allowing it to produce more challenging plays without the fear of making losses.|$|R
60|$|So Trot tied a small sofa cushion {{around the}} end of his wooden leg so it wouldn't make any noise {{pounding}} upon the floor, and then she quietly led the sailor through the room of the sleeping Boolooroo and through several other rooms until they came to the passage. Here a soldier was on guard, but he had fallen asleep for a moment in order to rest himself. They passed the Blueskin without disturbing him and soon reached the chamber opposite the suite of the Six Snubnosed Princesses, whom <b>they</b> <b>could</b> hear <b>still</b> quarreling loudly among themselves.|$|R
