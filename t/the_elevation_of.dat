5|$|After Celestine's death Theobald {{returned}} to England, stopping at St Denis Abbey in Paris to help Suger, the abbot, consecrate the newly rebuilt abbey church and its altars. Theobald {{was the only}} bishop present at the ceremony whose diocese was not in France. Meanwhile, Henry of Blois had arrived in Rome and begun negotiations with the new pope, Lucius II, over <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> the bishopric of Winchester to an archbishopric. It appears that Lucius appointed a legate, Cardinal Icmar, the Bishop of Tusculum, to travel to England and oversee the project, but Lucius died before anything was accomplished.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I {{appointed}} Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at Pipewell, with the consecration on 22 October 1189 at Westminster. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were Godfrey de Lucy to the see of Winchester, Richard FitzNeal to the see of London, and William Longchamp to the see of Ely. <b>The</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> so many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king's break with his father's habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the sees. At {{about the same time}} Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his power because of political manoeuvring over <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> King Richard's illegitimate half-brother Geoffrey to the see of York, which Walter had at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter's withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey's election.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on <b>the</b> <b>Elevation</b> <b>of</b> Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.|$|E

In 1927, Kongō underwent major modifications to her superstructure, rebuilding it into the pagoda mast style to accommodate {{the growing number of}} fire-control systems for her main guns. In May 1928, her steering equipment was upgraded, before she was placed in reserve in preparation for major modifications and reconstruction in 1929–31.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 9th century, Leo V reintroduced {{the policy of}} iconoclasm, but in 843 empress Theodora {{restored}} the veneration of icons {{with the help of}} Patriarch Methodios.

5|$|Nevertheless, Petro {{managed to}} improve his status by marrying the {{extremely}} wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upwards mobility of Petro's son Titus Flavius Sabinus I, Domitian's grandfather. Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible equestrian status through his services as tax collector in Asia and banker in Helvetia (modern Switzerland). By marrying Vespasia Polla he allied the Flavian family to the more prestigious gens Vespasia, ensuring <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> his sons Titus Flavius Sabinus II and Vespasian to senatorial rank.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 1920, Haruna was {{involved}} in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a breech explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No.1 turret, killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of the turret. A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse ignited the gunpowder bags in the breech, detonating the shell while still in the barrel. The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>of</b> her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.|$|E
