The first chapter of the Ph. D. thesis includes the review of the up-to-date scientific research bibliography, associated with the <b>transient</b> <b>behaviour</b> of grounding systems. The papers are grouped in this review, according to their content, as follows: a) the steady state b) the transient state, c) the resistivity and multi-layer structure of the ground, d) the ionisation of the soil and e) the methodologies of simulation of grounding systems. The experimental arrangements and the methods of tests and measurements, which have been used in the present thesis, are in detail described in its second chapter. These arrangements are used for the experimental study of a) the <b>transient</b> <b>behaviour</b> of grounding systems, b) the soil ionisation and c) the soil resistivity and the grounding resistance. The third chapter includes the presentation and {{the investigation of the}} experimental results and the arisen conclusions. The used experimental approaches (experiments in scale model, experiments in real grounding systems and experiments studying the soil ionisation) have essentially contributed in the elaboration, the inference and the verification of the suppositions of the present study. This verification is also proved through the convergence between experimental and computed (using the circuital and field approach) results of this Ph. D. thesis. The fourth chapter presents several simulation methods (circuital and field approach) of the <b>transient</b> <b>behaviour</b> of grounding systems and comparisons between the experimental and simulation results of this work, with relevant results of other researchers. The chapter also presents a proposed methodology, which uses a developed genetic algorithm (GA) for the calculation of the parameters of the multi-layer structure of the ground. In the end, a method of Monte-Carlo simulation is applied, which evaluates the grounding resistance of towers of a transmission line. The conclusions are summarized in the fifth chapter, showing clearly the contribution of the present study in the research of the <b>transient</b> <b>behaviour</b> of grounding systems. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to compare several {{hardening}} models and to show their relevance for the prediction of springback and deformation of an asymmetric aluminium alloy tube in multi-stage rotary draw bending process. A three-dimensional finite-element model of the process is developed using the ABAQUS code. For material modelling, the newly developed homogeneous anisotropic hardening model is adopted to capture the Bauschinger effect and <b>transient</b> hardening <b>behaviour</b> of the aluminium alloy tube subjected to non-proportional loading. The material parameters of the hardening model are obtained from uniaxial tension and forward-reverse shear test results of tube specimens. This work shows that this approach reproduces the <b>transient</b> Bauschinger <b>behaviour</b> of the material reasonably well. However, a curve-crossing phenomenon observed for this material cannot be captured by the homogeneous anisotropic hardening model. For comparison purpose, the isotropic and combined isotropic-kinematic hardening models are also adopted for the analysis of the same problem. The predictions of springback and cross-section deformation based on these models are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Friction {{loss and}} {{scuffing}} failure are two primary research subjects {{in improving the}} performance of spiral bevel gears. Aimed at improving the thermal characteristics with machine-setting parameter adjustment, a coupled thermo-elastic 3 D finite element model has been developed to analyse the frictional heat generation and <b>transient</b> thermal <b>behaviour</b> of spiral bevel gears. The heat fluxes due to friction effects are applied to the gear tooth to investigate thermal characteristics and prediction of transient temperature fields. The resulting thermal characteristics agree with earlier work, thus verifying the model and numerical approach. This study permits an in-depth understanding of the temperature fields, together with the frictional heat generation process. Furthermore, by investigating the <b>transient</b> thermal <b>behaviour</b> among different pinion machine-setting parameters, the tilted and extended tooth contact pattern achieved by adjusting the machine-setting parameters can result in an optimal tooth contact pattern that produces a uniform temperature field of much lower value, thereby achieving higher efficiency of transmission along with stronger anti-scuffing performance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a three-dimensional numerical model {{that is used}} to predict the <b>transient</b> thermal <b>behaviour</b> of the metal injection system of a hot chamber pressure die casting machine. The behaviour of the injection system is considered in conjunction with that of the die. The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is used to model the <b>transient</b> thermal <b>behaviour</b> of the injection system elements and the die blocks. A perturbation approach is adopted. By adopting this approach, only those surfaces over which a significant transient variation in temperature occurs need be considered. The model assumes that a corresponding steady-state analysis has first been performed so that time-averaged thermal information is available. A finite element based technique is used to model the phase change of the liquid metal in the die cavity and in the injection system. At injection the nozzle and die are assumed to be instantly filled with liquid metal, however, a procedure is presented that attempts to model the heat transfer associated with the flow through the nozzle, gate, and runner regions during injection. Model predictions are compared against thermocouple readings and thermal images obtained from experimental tests. Good agreement is obtained between predicted and measured temperatures. The <b>transient</b> thermal <b>behaviour</b> of an existing hot chamber injection system is investigated in detail and recommendations for improved performance are made. In an attempt to improve the solidification pattern of the casting and the thermal behaviour of the injection system, a redesign of the experimental die is considered.
