40|$|In this paper, an {{experimental}} setup {{to estimate the}} biomass of caged bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in the Spanish Mediterranean coast is presented. Aims are to monitor individual tuna during all stages of growth, to control the transfer of fish caught in purse seines to <b>towing</b> <b>cages</b> {{and to be able}} to estimate the total number of specimens and the biomass transferred. To do this, we propose a combined system of acoustic and optical techniques (both non-intrusive), in order to obtain direct values of acoustical target strength (TS) and information on the orientation of tuna inside the acoustic beam and their size. To achieve complete information, ventral and dorsal acoustic measurements are done using in a first attempt a multiplexed scientific echosounder with two 200 KHz split-beam transducers, while a stereoscopic video system provides optical information and allows estimating the size and the weight of the specimens. Preliminary results indicate that this combined use of techniques provides precise information to determine the TS as a function of fish orientation and for proper monitoring of tuna in floating cages.

40|$|Aquatic organisms under culture {{conditions}} {{are faced with}} an assortment of potential stressors that challenge the homeostatic state. The stress and immune responses of ranched southern bluefin tuna (SBT), Thunnus maccoyii were investigated. Quota restrictions by the CCSBT progressively had reduced Australia’s allocation of the SBT global TAC to 5, 265 tonnes per annum for the period 1989 to 2009. In response to quota reductions, SBT ranching developed as a capture-based aquaculture operation dependent on wild sourced stock. Other capture-based aquaculture operations exist in Japan and Mexico for Pacific bluefin tuna (PBT), Thunnus orientalis, and in numerous Mediterranean countries for Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT), Thunnus thynnus. Overseas operations initially used traditional catch methods, like set net traps and line hooking, to source wild bluefin, but in the mid 1990 s adopted the SBT model of purse seine capture and <b>tow</b> <b>cage</b> transport to grow-out sites. SBT capture/transport mortalities (0. 5...|$|R
40|$|Since 1995, {{bluefin tuna}} (Thunnus thynnus) {{have been caught}} by purse seine in order to place the live fish in {{floating}} cages, feed them during various months with fish and pelagic cephalopods and later kill them for shipment mainly to the Japanese market. As {{a result of this}} practice, the natural stocks of this species are in an overfished state and therefore it has been necessary to implement catch limits (TACs). Since the tunas cannot be manipulated {{at the time of their}} capture, the estimate of the biomass of tunas caught must be carried out by visual methods using video cameras that are placed at the time when the tunas are transferred from the purse seine net to the <b>towing</b> <b>cage.</b> Therefore, there are no direct data on the catch until the animals are killed some months later, when evidently there is a variation in their weight. On the other hand, the regulation of the fishery requires immediate knowledge of the catch in order to close the fishery when the quota has been reached. This paper proposes the development of a system that permits estimating the number and the biomass of bluefin tunas by acoustic means, both at the time of transfer as well as during their fattening in the floating cages.

40|$|Underwater stereo-video {{systems are}} widely used for {{counting}} and measuring fish in aquaculture, fisheries, and conservation management. Length measurements are generated from stereo-video recordings by a software operator using a mouse to locate the head and tail of a fish in synchronized pairs of images. This data {{can be used to}} compare spatial and temporal changes in the mean length and biomass or frequency distributions of populations of fishes. Since the early 1990 s stereo-video has also been used for measuring the lengths of fish in aquaculture for quota and farm management. However, the costs of the equipment, software, the time, and salary costs involved in post processing imagery manually and the subsequent delays in the availability of length information inhibit the adoption of this technology. We present a semi-automatic method for capturing stereo-video measurements to estimate the lengths of fish. We compare the time taken to make measurements of the same fish measured manually from stereo-video imagery to that measured semi-automatically. Using imagery recorded during transfers of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) from <b>tow</b> <b>cages</b> to grow out cages, we demonstrate that the semi-automatic algorithm developed can obtain fork length measurements with an error of less than 1 % of the true length and with at least a sixfold reduction in operator time in comparison to manual measurements. Of the 22 138 SBT recorded we were able to measure 52. 6 % (11 647) manually and 11. 8 % (2614) semi-automatically. For seven of the eight cage transfers recorded there were no statistical differences in the mean length, weight, or length frequency between manual and semi-automatic measurements. When the data were pooled across the eight cage transfers, there was no statistical difference in mean length or weight between the stereo-video-based manual and semi-automated measurements. Hence, the presented semi-automatic system can be deployed to significantly reduce the cost involved in a...|$|R
50|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment is transferring the affected fish to a freshwater bath {{for a period of}} 2 to 3 hours. This is achieved by <b>towing</b> the sea <b>cages</b> into fresh water, or pumping the fish from the sea cage to a tarp filled with fresh water. Mortality rates have been lowered by adding Levamisole to the water until the saturation is above 10ppm. Due to the difficulty and expense of treatment, the productivity of salmon aquaculture is limited by access to a source of fresh water. Chloramine and chlorine dioxide have also been used. Other potential in-feed treatments such as immunosupportive-based feeds, mucolytic compounds such as L-cysteine ethyl ester and the parasticide bithionol have been tested with some success although not developed for commercial use.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the role of matrix metallo-proteinases (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury induced by hyperoxia. Twenty-three pigs were exposed in sealed <b>cages</b> <b>tow</b> 80 % oxygen (for 24 – 120 h) or room air. Correlation between MMP- 2 /MMP- 9 activity, measured by gelatin zymo-graphy in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the histological findings and pathological parameters were examined in detail. Sources of these MMPs in the hyperoxic lung were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The histological progression of acute lung injury in this model ranged from the early exudative to the early proliferative phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). MMP- 2 and- 9 activities were elevated under prolonged hyperoxic exposure. MMP- 9 activity correlated significantly with the oxygen tension in arterial blood/inspiratory oxygen fraction, the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and the number of neutrophils in BALF, whereas MMP- 2 activity did not correlate at all with these factors. MMP- 9 activity correlated more closely with the pathological findings of DAD than did MMP- 2 activity. Strong MMP- 9 expression was observed in neutrophils, alveolar macrophages as well as alveolar lining epithelial cells. These results suggest that matrix metalloproteinase, which may derive from neutrophils recruited into airspaces, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxic diffuse alveolar damage...|$|R
