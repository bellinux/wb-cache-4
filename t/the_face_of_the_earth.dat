5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney, where Sitriuc {{convinced}} Sigurðr to ally {{himself against}} Brian {{on the condition}} that Sigurðr would gain Gormlaith in marriage. In April 1014, the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf. Although Brian's forces ultimately won the day, and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain, Brian lost his life as well. As for Gilli, he appears in a chapter of Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict. In one instance, a Caithnessman is said to have witnessed valkyrie-like apparitions singing songs for the slain, whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands. Priests in Iceland are stated to have encountered paranormal phenomena, whilst an Orcadian is said to have encountered the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing off <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> As for Gilli, the saga asserts that he dreamt of a song that foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr. There is reason to suspect that the aforesaid supernatural manifestationsarguably somewhat detached from the saga's general narrativeare actually interpolations of separate material. Elsewhere in the narrative, however, there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs. For example, the episode concerning Gilli's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man, the Icelander Flosi Þórðarson, is depicted dreaming of the burning of the saga's eponym, Njáll Þorgeirsson.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges to mankind always has been eradicating the presence of debilitating disease. Until just thirty years ago poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands in our own country each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped from <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E

As people migrated from the east, they settled {{in the land of}} Shinar.

God came down to look at the city and tower, and remarked that as one people with one language, nothing that they sought would be out of their reach. God went down and confounded their speech, so that they could not understand each other, and scattered them over <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> and they stopped building the city.

500|$|At Mantinea, Thebes {{had faced}} down the {{combined}} {{forces of the}} greatest states of Greece, but the victory brought it no spoils. With Epaminondas removed from the scene, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, {{and within a few}} years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek political system. [...] No Greek state ever again reduced Boeotia to the subjection it had known during the Spartan hegemony, but Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece. Finally, at Chaeronea in 338 BC, the combined forces of Thebes and Athens, driven into each other's arms for a desperate last stand against Philip of Macedon, were crushingly defeated, and Theban independence was put to an end. Three years later, heartened by a false rumor that Alexander the Great had been assassinated, the Thebans revolted; Alexander squashed the revolt, then destroyed the city, slaughtering or enslaving all its citizens. A mere 27 years after the death of the man who had made it preeminent throughout Greece, Thebes was wiped from <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> its 1,000-year history ended {{in the space of a}} few days.|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster.

[...] Historian Louis Asher wrote, [...] "It hardly seems arguable that Dr. Clarke was the first one to bring democracy to the New World by means of Rhode Island." [...] Bicknell also asserted that Clarke was the [...] "recognized founder and father of the Aquidneck Plantations, the author of the Compact of Portsmouth and leading spirit in the organization and administration of the island towns. [...] Historian Edward Peterson wrote that Clarke was a man [...] "whose moral character has never been surpassed, and his piety never been questioned." [...] Asher made this final assessment of Clarke: [...] "As a man, Clarke lived for others. [...] Like many men of the past, he was selfless and uncomplaining. [...] Despite his sectarian religious views, he gave more for his fellow man than he received." ...|$|E
