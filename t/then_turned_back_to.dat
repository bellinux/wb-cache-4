5|$|Andres {{originated}} from a disturbance that slowly organized and formed into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm {{status as a}} second circulation formed north-northwest of the initial circulation. However, the former circulation became dominant, and Andres intensified slightly. After {{a brief period of}} a normal track to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten Central America. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the Caribbean Sea, Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since record-keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near San Salvador on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E

Maurice found his progress towards Tienen opposed by Francisco López de Mendoza, who was strongly entrenched - he refused to be tempted out while Maurice refused to engage or pass while leaving a large force in his rear. Maurice <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the north with the intention of besieging Grave or Venlo; the former was chosen.|$|E

US25 <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the north-northeast and followed Monroe Street next to Lake Monroe and through downtown Monroe over the River Raisin. North of town, Dixie Highway turned due north and terminated at an intersection with US24; US25 merged onto Telegraph Road, and the two highways ran concurrently northeasterly through rural Monroe County. At the crossing of the Huron River, US24/US25 entered Flat Rock and Wayne County.|$|E

500|$|Lafayette {{successfully}} eluded engaging Cornwallis {{for about}} one month, who used his numerical advantage to detach forces for raids against economic, military, and political targets in central Virginia. [...] Cornwallis <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the east, marching for Williamsburg. [...] Lafayette, whose force grew to number about 4,000 {{with the arrival}} of Continental Army reinforcements under General Anthony Wayne and additional experienced militiamen under William Campbell, followed Cornwallis. Buoyed by the increase in his troop strength, Lafayette also became more aggressive in his tactics, sending out detachments of his force to counteract those that Cornwallis sent on forage and raiding expeditions. These detachments were composed of select units taken from a variety of regiments. [...] Among those that were commonly in the army's advance guard were a combined cavalry and infantry unit from Pennsylvania under Captain William McPherson, and companies of Virginia riflemen under Majors Richard Call and John Willis.|$|E
500|$|After the Smyth Report {{was officially}} released, Smith {{immediately}} offered to publish it. Smyth patiently explained that anyone {{was free to}} publish it, but Princeton University Press was only willing to do so on the understanding {{that this would be}} [...] "Smyth's edition". Meanwhile, Smyth approached McGraw-Hill about publishing it. The editors at McGraw-Hill found the manuscript dull and somewhat technical for a general audience and suggested a rewrite. Smyth balked at this, as it would have meant going through the censorship process again. James S. Thompson, the president of McGraw-Hill, pointed out the U.S. Government Printing Office would be putting out an edition, probably more cheaply than he could, and there would likely be little profit in a McGraw-Hill edition. Smyth <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Princeton University Press. He had only one condition: that he receive no royalties. Princeton University Press agreed, but added a stipulation of its own: that Groves's approval be secured. Smyth obtained this in a letter dated August 25, 1945.|$|E

500|$|The race {{started in}} the Market Square in Bruges with a neutralised zone, leaving the town to the south. The racing started outside the city and took the riders {{southwest}} through Torhout to Roeselare, then east through Ardooie and Tielt, then south-east to Oudenaarde, passing across the first cobbled sector of the day, the flat Huisepontweg. After Oudenaarde, the route continued {{into a series of}} circuits through the hilly area to the south and east.

The first section of three torpedo-bombers pressed on through the destroyer screen and Esmonde's aircraft was shot down before he could drop the torpedo. The other two continued and managed to launch torpedoes despite flak damage and wounds and then ditched; the second section of three were seen to cross the destroyer screen and disappear. While the German fighter escorts were absent, two sections (eight aircraft) of 452 Squadron RAAF strafed several German ships and silenced the return fire of a destroyer, for a cracked perspex hood to one Spitfire.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two main}} {{problems}} facing Parnall when given an Air Ministry contract to produce such an aircraft were to ensure that, {{so far as}} possible the behaviour of the wing was unaffected by interference with the flow over the fuselage or by prop wash, and to devise a way of measuring lift and drag forces whilst in flight. [...] They decided on a parasol wing design, since this would avoid complications like wing root interference, and made the wing mounting structure into a single unit with some freedom to deflect internally so that the force could be measured. [...] A typical parasol wing aircraft has lift struts from the lower fuselage to the wing plus some upper fuselage struts to support the wing near the centre line. The Parasol had two lift struts under each wing, with their lower ends joined within the fuselage to a horizontal rectangular frame. Two inverted V members were also attached to this frame, one at the front and one at the back, rising almost vertically {{to the front and}} rear wing spars. [...] The V-struts were hinged top and bottom, allowing the wing to move parallel to the horizontal frame under aerodynamic loads. The force was measured by a dynamometer ahead of the front cockpit, via a linkage which ran down and forward from the wing at an angle of about 22°, <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the instrument via a crank.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match of}} the event was the encounter between The Undertaker and Kane. After Kane made his entrance, he was seen looking toward the entrance ramp saying, [...] "You're not coming back tonight. You're not coming back, I buried you alive." [...] After this, {{the lights in the}} arena went out and Paul Bearer, Undertaker's former manager and Kane's (storyline) father, was heard screaming [...] "oh yes!". Blue light began to fill the arena as Bearer, carrying the Undertaker's former trademark urn, led a group of Druids, all chanting and carrying torches, onto the entrance ramp. As the Druids made a formation {{at the top of the}} ramp, Bearer walked to ringside, turned and said to Kane, [...] "my son...you're no son of mine." [...] He <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> face the entryway and raised the urn to summon The Undertaker. As Kane continued to watch in the ring, refusing to believe his brother was back, Undertaker entered the arena in his [...] "Deadman" [...] persona, wearing a long black trenchcoat and hat, and walked through the Druid formation. Bearer met him at ringside and directed him to the ring steps, where Undertaker raised his arms to bring the arena lights back up. Before the match officially got underway, a now visibly shaken and distressed Kane began shouting at his brother repeatedly, saying things like [...] "I killed you!", [...] "I buried you alive!", and [...] "you're not real!", while Undertaker simply stood staring stoically at Kane. Eventually, Kane decided to see if Undertaker was indeed standing in front of him by slowly inching forward with his hand outstretched. Undertaker responded by punching Kane, knocking him down, and the match got underway. The two continued brawling until Kane delivered a Chokeslam to Undertaker, which he sat up from shortly afterward while Kane was taunting Paul Bearer. The Undertaker then retaliated with a Chokeslam and Tombstone piledriver to win the match and remaining undefeated at WrestleMania with a 12–0 record.|$|E
