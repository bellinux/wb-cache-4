500|$|The {{concept of}} Grey and Shepherd's fight was {{described}} by Buchman as having [...] "no more taboos", {{compared to the other}} story lines developed in the episode: [...] "Even though it was a minor fight, it's very revealing for Meredith. This is probably the longest relationship she's every been in, and the first with someone she feels a genuine connection with. We might know Derek will come back, but she doesn't." [...] The last scene of them in the episode has been deemed [...] "a milestone of sorts for Meredith", with the goal to determine her to admit how new to this romantic development in her personal life she actually is, after years of being known as the woman with habitual excessive drinking and sexual relationships with inappropriate men. Also noted was the aftermath of Alex and Addison's kiss in the previous episode: [...] "What's most painful about that scene? Not that Alex effectively shut Addison down in such a cold and direct manner. But that it seems like such a waste of chemistry. When they went into that closet, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> wanted to see them do is pour water on their fire", stated Buchman, noting how the scene was written to be [...] "frustrating, shocking, and therefore unexpected" [...] for the audience.|$|E

Duncan Smith told The Daily Telegraph that pension reforms were intended to [...] "reinvigorate retirement". [...] "People are living longer and healthier lives than ever, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> want is to lose their skills and experience from the workplace due to an arbitrary age limit," [...] he said. [...] "Now is absolutely {{the right time to}} live up to our responsibility to reform our outdated pension system and to take action where the previous government failed to do so. If Britain is to have a stable, affordable pension system, people need to work longer, but we will reward their hard work with a decent state pension that will enable them to enjoy quality of life in their retirement." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{band members}} grew their hair long and allied {{themselves}} to the glam rock movement of the early 1970s. Hill's stage costumes also became notable during this period. Many of Holder's costumes during this period, including the trademark mirror top hat, were made by Dorothy [...] "Dolly" [...] Annakin—a sister of Holder's friend Ron Annakin. Chandler now demanded the band write a follow-up single themselves which led to Lea and Holder writing [...] "Coz I Luv You". The song was written {{in half an hour}} and started a writing partnership which would continue throughout Slade's career. Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one. While recording, the band felt the song's sound to be too soft, and so clapping was added. The song's misspelled title also became a trademark for Slade while causing a furor among British school teachers. The attendant appearance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops brought Slade to a wider audience as well as pushing [...] "Coz I Luv You" [...] to number one in the UK charts. In November 1971, NME reported that Slade had turned down a multimillion-dollar campaign, including a television series and a heavily promoted tour of the US. [...] "But", commented Holder, [...] "acceptance would have meant the cancellation of many commitments here – and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> {{want to do is to}} mess around the people who have put us where we are".|$|E

Fuzzy logic is also a kind of probability theory, but of considerably more mathematical and axiomatic complexity than the standard account. Fuzzy logic purp orts to model the human capacity for reasoning with inexact concepts. It does this by exploring the assumption that when we argue in inexact terms and draw inferences in imprecise vocabularies, we actually make computations about the embedded imprecision s. I argue that this is in fact <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>we</b> do, and indeed that we do the opposite...|$|R

Now, I am very ready to confess that William's dealings with his debtors, and with one creditor, are wholly unlike what I should expect from {{the author of the}} plays. Moreover, the conduct of Shelley in regard to his wife was, in my opinion, very mean and cruel, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>we</b> could have expected from one who, in verse, was such a tender philanthropist, and in life was--women apart--the best-hearted of men.

As a member of the Scottish Bar it was inconsistent with his honour to be the secret proprietor of a publishing and a printing business. This is the unexplained moral paradox in the career of a man of chivalrous honour and strict probity: but the fault did not prevent Scott from writing his novels and poems. Why, then, should the few bare records of Shakspere's monetary transactions make HIS authorship impossible? The objection seems weakly sentimental.|$|R

I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication. I just sort of wrote that guitar part, the chord progression and the changes and stuff and Brandon just sort of responded to it. We kind of just put it aside and then when we started working on new music for this album, I think we always knew that we wanted to record it in the studio and make it really great.

It had somehow the effect of a furious beast addressing you in your native tongue, and telling you it was [...] "Wary poordy wedder;" [...] and it made us cling to his good-nature with the trembling solicitude of Little Red-Riding-Hood, when she begins to have the first faint suspicions of her grandmother. However, our boatman was no wild beast, but took our six cents of buonamano with the base servility of a Christian man, when he had put our luggage in the cabin of the steamer. I wonder how he should have known us for Americans? He did so know us, and said he had been at New York in better days, when he voyaged upon higher seas than those he now navigated.|$|E

When I put my life in danger on that memorable night, by putting my foot on the trellis-work, I absolutely thought of the never-dying Lady Malkinshaw plunged in refreshing slumber, and of the frantic exclamations Mr. Batterbury would utter if he saw what her ladyship's grandson was doing with his precious life and limbs at that critical moment.

Should any of you doubt this, you have but to read the [...] "Address to the King" [...] of our Congress, then sitting in Philadelphia. The quarrel was so petty, and so easy of mending, that you of this generation may wonder why it was allowed to run.

King George the Third is alone to blame for that hatred of race against race which already hath done so much evil.

We made the southern passage home and anchored in Hampton Roads, in the winter of 1831. I believe the whole crew of the Delaware was sorry when the cruise was up. There are always a certain number of long-shore chaps in a man-of-war, who are never satisfied with discipline, and the wholesome restraints of a ship; but as for us old salts, I never heard one give the Delaware a bad name. We had heard an awful report of the commodore, who was called a [...] "burster," [...] and expected sharp times under him; and his manner of taking possession was of a nature to alarm us. All hands had been called to receive him, and the first words he said were [...] "Call all hands to witness punishment." [...] A pin might have been heard falling among us, for this sounded ominous. It was to clear the brig, only, Captain Downes having left three men in it, whom he would not release on quitting the vessel. The offences were serious, and could not be overlooked. These three chaps got it; but there was only one other man brought regularly to the gang-way while I was in the ship, and he was under the sentence of a court, and belonged to the Warren. As soon as the brig was cleared, the commodore told us we should be treated as we treated others, and then turned away among the officers. The next day we found we were to live under a just rule, and that satisfied us. One of the great causes of the contentment that reigned in the ship, was the method, and the regularity of the hours observed. The men knew on what they could calculate, in ordinary times, and this left them their own masters within certain hours. I repeat, she was the happiest ship I ever served in, though I have always found good treatment in the navy.|$|R
