5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental illnesses and took, by <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E

40|$|Dispute {{settlement}} in the WTO is a sensitive issue and subject to a lively debate among trade scholars and engaged citizens. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to focus on one particular aspect of judicial review within <b>the</b> WTO: <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> review. This legal concept determines how much deference international adjudicators should give to the national fact-finding and to legal determinations. In other words, it reflects the relationship between supranational adjudication and national sovereignty. The paper will, firstly, analyse <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> review's legal basis and the relevant case law. Next, a broad contextual discussion will explore the full significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> review within <b>the</b> global trading regime: it will be argued that <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> review is an important "constitutional" feature of WTO law, framing and limiting the exercise of national sovereignty as well as judicial power. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> review plays a crucial role in resolving disputes involving sensitive non-economic (national) policies within the WTO system. Ultimately, this paper is concerned with the important issue of strengthening the legitimacy of the dispute settlement system, and a possible role for <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> review herein. For this purpose, the author argues for a strong proceduralist bias for <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> review, which could include a so-called "deliberation test".
