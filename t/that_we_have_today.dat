25|$|Two {{subspecies}} of F. vesca were identified: F. sylvestris alba and F. sylvestris semperflorens. The {{introduction of}} F. virginiana from Eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century {{is an important}} part of history because this species gave rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712, it introduced the strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today</b> and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of the 12th century Jewish scholar Maimonides: [...] "The Torah <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today</b> is the one dictated to Moses by God". The Prophets, such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Jonah are said to have heard and reported the word of God, while the Writings (the category that includes books such as Psalms, Lamentations and Chronicles) [...] "were excluded from the prophetic collection because their inspiration appeared to be human rather than Divine". However, [...] "In the broadest sense, the Scriptures taken as a whole, and subsequently the totality of Jewish spiritual teaching, fall within the connotation of God's word." [...] Many modern Jewish scholars have an accommodating view {{of the nature of the}} Torah, not necessarily viewing it as strictly internally consistent.|$|E

50|$|After the {{completion}} of the Reconquista and the conversion to the Cabildo an adjacent house was annexed to enlarge the building. The octagonal Mudéjar Sala de Cabildos was constructed in this era; its 1513 decoration included an inscription alluding to the Christian conquest of the city. Eventually the pool was filled in and converted to other uses, although even after the modifications of 1554-1556, Francisco Henríquez de Jorquera describes a patio with a pool and a garden. The building was subject to major modifications, especially in the 1722-1729 {{at the height of the}} Baroque, so <b>that</b> what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today</b> is essentially an 18th-century building with elements of older buildings.

40|$|Experts {{agree that}} the {{exascale}} machine will comprise processors that contain many cores, which in turn will necessitate a much higher degree of concurrency. Software will require a minimum of a 1, 000 times more concurrency. Most parallel analysis and visualization algorithms today work by partitioning data and running mostly serial algorithms concurrently on each data partition. Although this approach lends itself well to the concurrency of current high-performance computing, it does not exhibit the appropriate pervasive parallelism required for exascale computing. The data partitions are too small and the overhead of the threads is too large to make effective use of all the cores in an extreme-scale machine. This paper introduces a new visualization framework designed to exhibit the pervasive parallelism necessary for extreme scale machines. We demonstrate {{the use of this}} system on a GPU processor, which we feel is the best analog to an exascale node <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> available <b>today...</b>|$|R

30|$|Some {{believed}} that the US was in a decline even in the late 1980 s (Miller and Yetiv 2001). In the recent past, American decline has been more evident. Its economic growth rate has been stagnating below three percent. This is comparable to what was once called the “Hindu rate of growth.” 1 Unavoidably, the economic troubles {{of the country are}} impacting its military capabilities as well. According to Gertz (2014), a security analyst for the Washington Times, American military power is diminishing due to the constant budget cuts. Reflecting on this general trend, Admiral Samuel of the US military pointed out that the “historic dominance (of the US)…is diminishing” (Quoted in Gertz 2014, p. 33). A stagnated middle class, increasing national debt, deteriorating working culture and growing public opinion against employing American men and women as foot soldiers, for example, have seriously dented the surviving superpower’s capacity to sustain the status as the undisputed leader of the new world. Some observers argue <b>that</b> what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>today</b> is a “post-American world” (Brooks and Wohlforth 2009, p. 50).|$|R

Like many other things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> discussed <b>today</b> it seems to involve a sort of balancing act.
