5|$|In the 1930s, as he {{was writing}} Parts II and IV, Joyce's {{progress}} slowed considerably. This was due {{to a number of}} factors including {{the death of his father}} John Stanislaus Joyce in 1931; concern over <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> his daughter Lucia; and his own health problems, chiefly his failing eyesight.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of a 2016 interdepartmental report into the issue of mental health in the justice system, McEntee stated her belief that it is unacceptable to send people with mental health issues to prison, and that {{this is an issue that}} must be tackled by the government. She also believes the government should address concerns about <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> unemployed young people.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the American Library Association rewarded {{her with}} its highest tribute, {{lifetime}} honorary membership. She also earned the first John E. Fryer Award from the American Psychiatric Association in 2006 with Frank Kameny. The award goes {{to people who}} have made a significant impact on <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> gays and lesbians. In October 2006, The Smithsonian Institution acquired a sign she carried in her picketing in 1965, donated by Frank Kameny. In 2007, readers of The Advocate included Gittings on a list of their 40 favorite gay and lesbian heroes.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{is expected to}} produce secondary <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects that may increase suicide and alcohol death rates. However, <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{economic crisis}} can be offset by social welfare and other policy measures. For example, active labour market programmes aimed at helping people retain or regain jobs counteract <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic crisis. Family support programmes contribute to counteracting <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis. Increasing alcohol prices and restricting alcohol availability reduce the harmful effects on <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> and save lives. Debt relief programmes will help to reduce <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic crisis and accessible and responsive primary care services support people at risk and prevent <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> effects...|$|R

5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first {{two parts of the}} book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{extermination}} {{activities of}} the Einsatzgruppen generally followed a standard procedure, with the Einsatzgruppen chief contacting the nearest Wehrmacht unit commander to inform him of the impending action; this was done so they could coordinate and control access to the execution grounds. Initially the victims were shot, but this method proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. Also, after Himmler observed the shooting of 100 Jews at Minsk in August 1941, he grew concerned about the impact such actions were having on <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> his SS men. He decided that alternate methods of killing should be found, which led to introduction of gas vans. However, these were not popular with the men, because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma.|$|E
5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|Swimming is {{primarily}} a cardiovascular/aerobic exercise due to the long exercise time, requiring a constant oxygen supply to the muscles, except for short sprints where the muscles work anaerobically. As with most aerobic exercise, swimming is believed to reduce {{the harmful effects of}} stress. Swimming is also effective in improving health for people with cardiovascular problems and chronic illnesses. It is proven to positively impact <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> pregnant women and mothers. Swimming can even improve mood.|$|E

25|$|The general {{effectiveness}} of psychotherapy and psychological intervention is partly {{explained by the}} theory of cognitive dissonance. In that vein, social psychology proposed that <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific therapy and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance. That effective phenomenon was indicated in {{the results of the}} study Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding {{research}} {{focuses on}} diverse aspects such as prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes. Factors related to <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> the nursing mother in the perinatal period have been studied. While cognitive behavior therapy may be the treatment of choice, medications are sometimes used. The use of therapy rather than medication reduces the infant's exposure to medication that may be transmitted through the milk. In coordination with institutional organisms, researchers are also studying the social impact of brestfeeding throughout history. Accordingly, strategies {{have been developed to}} foster the increase of the breastfeedingrates in the different countries.|$|E
25|$|Psychotherapy is an interpersonal, {{relational}} intervention used {{by trained}} psychotherapists to aid s in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual {{sense of well-being}} and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change and {{that are designed to}} improve <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a family). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken conversation, though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, art, drama, narrative story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained therapist and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with psychoanalysis; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.|$|E

500|$|In August 1941, Himmler {{attended}} {{a demonstration of}} a mass-shooting of Jews in Minsk arranged by Nebe after which he vomited. Regaining his composure, Himmler decided that alternative methods of killing should be found. He told Heydrich that he was concerned for <b>the</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> the SS men. Himmler turned to Nebe to devise a more [...] "convenient" [...] method of killing, particularly one that would spare executioners elements of their grisly task. Murder with carbon monoxide gas, already in use in the Reich {{as part of the}} euthanasia program, was contemplated, but deemed too cumbersome for the mobile killing operations in the occupied Soviet Union.|$|E

The Victorian state government established a Board of Inquiry into Scientology in November 1963. Its report, published in October 1965, condemned every aspect of Scientology and Hubbard himself. He was described as being of doubtful sanity, having a persecution complex and displaying strong indications of paranoid schizophrenia with delusions of grandeur. His writings were characterized as nonsensical, abounding in [...] "self-glorification and grandiosity, replete with histrionics and hysterical, incontinent outbursts".
