5|$|Two realignments in 1963 and 1964 rerouted {{the western}} end of the highway again. This time it was realigned to run from Hesperia to New Era, {{bypassing}} Ferry. A larger change around 1969 reconfigured the highway designations in Oceana County. M-20 replaced M-82 west of Hesperia, to end at New Era instead of Muskegon. The new M-120 designation replaced M-20 south of Hesperia. M-82 now ran from Hesperia to Newaygo only. The length of the highway was increased in 1973 when the eastern end was moved back <b>to</b> <b>Howard</b> City. M-46 was rerouted to follow the US131 freeway south of Howard City to Cedar Springs, and replaced M-57 between Cedar Springs and Casnovia. This freed up the Newaygo <b>to</b> <b>Howard</b> City highway for a return to the M-82 designation. The last change came in 1978 when the concurrency with M-120 was eliminated in favor of M-120. The M-82 designation was truncated at this time to the junction west of Fremont, resulting in the current highway routing.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the book's publication, Bachelard was a {{journalist}} for The Age newspaper. He began investigating the organisation in his capacity as a newspaper journalist.

Bachelard received Melbourne Press Club Quill Award for Best News Report in 2008, for his reporting on WorkChoices. After discovering that prior to the 2007 election the Exclusive Brethren organisation in Australia had close access to John Howard, Bachelard became interested in writing a book about the group. He researched the organisation's history, and focused on the version of the group in Australia; analysing its ties to the Liberal Party of Australia and <b>to</b> <b>Howard.</b> He spent over two years researching the organisation.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{immediately}} sent messengers {{to summon}} reinforcements from the III Corps (Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles) and the XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum). Howard's first XI Corps division to arrive, under Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz, was sent north {{to take a}} position on Oak Ridge and link up with the right of the I Corps. (The division was commanded temporarily by Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig while Schurz filled in for Howard as XI Corps commander.) The division of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow was placed on Schurz's right to support him. The third division to arrive, under Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr, was placed on Cemetery Hill along with two batteries of artillery to hold the hill as a rallying point if the Union troops could not hold their positions; this placement on the hill corresponded with orders sent earlier in the day <b>to</b> <b>Howard</b> by Reynolds just before he was killed.|$|E

50|$|This {{film was}} {{followed}} by a less popular sequel, Conan the Destroyer in 1984. This sequel was a more typical fantasy-genre film and was even less faithful <b>to</b> <b>Howard's</b> Conan stories, being just a picaresque story of an assorted bunch of adventurers.|$|R
5|$|Just {{across the}} town line, NY33A intersects {{the east end}} of the Airport Expressway (NY204). At this point, NY204 leaves the highway and turns to follow NY33A eastward. While most of NY33A west of Gates is a two-lane highway, the portion of Chili Avenue that carries both NY33A and NY204 is a four-lane roadway. The two routes soon enter Tressmar, a hamlet that has been {{transformed}} into a major commercial destination. The development is mostly centered on Westgate Plaza, a large shopping plaza anchored by a Walmart. As NY33A passes south of the plaza, it connects <b>to</b> <b>Howard</b> Road (unsigned NY940L and formerly part of NY47) and Brooks Avenue. NY204 leaves NY33A at Brooks Avenue to follow the road eastward toward the Greater Rochester International Airport.|$|E

After a close win over Glenn Howard in the round robin, Martin dropped a 4–5 decision <b>to</b> <b>Howard</b> after he missed a crucial shot in the 3 vs. 4 game of the playoffs, and he lost the bronze medal game to Brad Gushue 10–5, playing without second Marc Kennedy, because Kennedy and his wife were expecting a child. Martin finished the 2010–11 season by winning his record 7th Players' Championship.|$|E
5|$|The early {{settlers}} of Minnesota were anxiously seeking railroad transportation, but insufficient {{capital was}} available after the Panic of 1857. Rails were finally built in Minnesota in 1862, when the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad built its first ten miles (16km) of track from the Phalen Creek area in St. Paul {{to a stop}} just short of St. Anthony Falls. The railroad continued building track from Minneapolis to Elk River in 1864 and to St. Cloud in 1866, and from Minneapolis west <b>to</b> <b>Howard</b> Lake in 1867 and Willmar in 1869. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Central, an early predecessor of the Milwaukee Road, built a line from Minneapolis to Fort Snelling in 1865. The railroad gradually extended to Faribault, Owatonna, and Austin. It crossed the Iowa border and met up with the McGregor & Western line. This connection gave Minneapolis rail service to Milwaukee via Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, with through service beginning on October 14, 1867.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 12 December that Howard {{formally}} conceded defeat, with the Electoral Commission formally declaring McKew the winner by 44,685 votes (51.4 percent) <b>to</b> <b>Howard's</b> 42,251 (48.6 percent). The final tally indicated that McKew had won victory on the 14th count due to a large flow of Green preferences to her; 3,793 (78.84 percent) of Green voters listed McKew as their second preference.

5|$|The evening draw also {{consisted}} of skins play. Jennifer Jones and Mirjam Ott {{played in the}} women's skins game, in which Jones dominated, scoring four skins and winning four points for Team North America. Glenn Howard and Thomas Ulsrud played in the men's skins game. Ulsrud played a fairly open game, forcing carryovers for five ends until a misfire from Ulsrud led <b>to</b> <b>Howard</b> making the cup-winning shot, scoring three points with a tap for two points. Ulsrud won the remaining points in the game on a draw to the button. A mixed team of Kevin Martin, Heather Nedohin, Marc Kennedy, and Laine Peters played Eve Muirhead, Greg Drummond, Vicki Adams, and Michael Goodfellow in the mixed skins game. Martin skipped against Muirhead and controlled most of the game, securing four points on four skins before Muirhead took the last skin. Team North America took a 10½–4½ point edge {{in the second round}} of skins play, giving them a CAD$13,000 bonus for winning the skins rounds.|$|E
