5|$|By early July 1724 Bach {{was more}} than a month into his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. BWV10 is the fifth of 40 chorale cantatas he started that year. The outer {{movements}} of the cantata are set for mixed choir and an orchestra consisting of trumpet, two oboes, strings and continuo. Luther's translation of Luke1:46–48 is the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the first movement. The canticle's doxology is the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the last movement. The five middle movements are a succession of arias and recitatives, with, between the fourth and sixth movement, a duet for alto and tenor. Soprano and bass each have one aria, and the two recitatives are sung by the tenor. The <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the arias and recitatives is paraphrased and expanded from Luke1:49–53 and 55. The <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the duet is Luther's translation of Luke1:54. The melody associated with Luther's German Magnificat appears in movements 1, 5 and 7.|$|E

5|$|Textual {{critics have}} had a {{challenging}} task in classifying the Codex, the exact relationship to other known texts and families is still disputed. The Greek <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the codex is of mixed text-types. It is {{a representative of the}} Byzantine text-type in the Gospels - the oldest examples of the type - {{and the rest of the}} New Testament books are of the Alexandrian text-type, with some Western readings. Kurt Aland placed it in Category III in the Gospels, and in Category I in rest of the books of the New Testament. The Byzantine <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the Gospels has a number of Alexandrian features, it has some affinities to the textual Family Π. Soden associated the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the gospels with Family Π, though it is not a pure member of this family. According to Streeter, it is the earliest Greek manuscript which gives us approximately the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> Lucian the Martyr, but a small proportion of the readings seem to be earlier.|$|E
5|$|The codex was {{prepared}} for liturgical use with marginalia (text's division), and has almost completely survived; it was used by Erasmus for his Novum Instrumentum omne.

5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, The New Testament in the Original Greek (1881), and it was the basis for their text. All critical editions of the New Testament published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus was the basis for the translation.|$|E
