40|$|CHDS State/LocalApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt has been thirty-three {{months since the}} United States was attacked by terrorists on September 11 th 2001. Yet, in distributing grants to States and localities to build their capacity for homeland security, the Nation continues to rely on funding formulae that are deeply flawed. Many grants are distributed in ways that ignore need-driven criteria, such as where terrorists {{are most likely to}} strike and which targets are most critical. This thesis develops an alternative formula that takes need into account (and therefore is much more likely to send funds where they are required). After reviewing need-driven formulae from a range of fields that might be applied to homeland security, I use the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to break the objectives of homeland security capacity-building into discreet, measurable components. Then, I analyze the criteria that should be used to build a grant allocation process to accomplish <b>those</b> <b>objectives,</b> <b>including</b> population density, criticality of infrastructure, the threat to a municipality, vulnerability to that threat, and terrorism prevention. The resulting formula is far better structured than the current system to put homeland security grant funds where the Nation most needs them.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between quality‐based manufacturing strategy and the use of different types of performance measures, as well as their separate and joint effects on performance. A key part of our investigation is the distinction between financial and both objective and subjective nonfinancial measures. Our results support the view that performance measurement diversity benefits performance as we find that, regardless of strategy, firms with more extensive performance measurement systems—especially <b>those</b> that <b>include</b> <b>objective</b> and subjective nonfinancial measures—have higher performance. But our findings also partly support the view that the strategy‐measurement “fit” affects performance. We find that firms that emphasize quality in manufacturing use more of both objective and subjective nonfinancial measures. However, there is only a positive effect on performance from pairing a qualitybased manufacturing strategy with extensive use of subjective measures, but not with objective nonfinancial measures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFollowing the 2006 Chikungunya {{disease in}} La Reunion, {{questions}} were raised concerning the monitoring survey of Aedes albopictus populations and the entomological indexes {{used to evaluate}} population abundance. The objectives {{of the present study}} were to determine reliable productivity indexes using a quantitative method to improve entomological surveys and mosquito control measures on Aedes albopictus. Between 2007 and 2011, 4 intervention districts, 24 cities, 990 areas and over 850, 000 houses were used to fulfil <b>those</b> <b>objectives.</b> Four indexes <b>including</b> the classical Stegomyia index (House Index, Container Index, Breteau Index) plus an Infested Receptacle Index were studied in order to determine whether temporal (year, month, week) and/or spatial (districts, cities, areas) heterogeneities existed. Temporal variations have been observed with an increase of Ae. albopictus population density over the years, and a seasonality effect with a highest population during the hot and wet season. Spatial clustering was observed at several scales with an important autocorrelation at the area scale. Moreover, the combination among these results and the breeding site productivity obtained during these 5 years allowed us to propose recommendations to monitor Aedes albopictus by eliminating not the most finding sites but the most productive ones. As the other strategies failed in La Reunion, this new approach should should work better...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Open chest surgery (thoracotomy) is {{considered}} the most painful of surgical procedures. Forceful wound retraction, costochondral dislocation, posterior costovertebral ligament disruption, intercostal nerve trauma and wound movement during respiration combine to produce an acute, severe postoperative pain insult and persistent chronic pain many months after surgery is common. Three recent systematic reviews conclude that unilateral continuous paravertebral blockade (PVB) provides analgesia at least equivalent to thoracic epidural blockade (TEB) in the postoperative period, has a lower failure rate, and symptom relief that lasted months. Crucially, PVB may reduce the development of subsequent chronic pain by intercostal nerve protection or decreased nociceptive input. The overall aim is to determine in patients who undergo thoracotomy whether perioperative PVB results in reducing chronic post-thoracotomy pain (CPTP) compared with TEB. This pilot study will evaluate feasibility of a substantive trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS TOPIC is a randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of TEB and PVB in reducing CPTP. This is a pilot study to evaluate feasibility of a substantive trial and study processes in 2 adult thoracic centres, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust (HEFT) and University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust (UHSM). The primary objective is to establish {{the number of patients}} randomised as a proportion of <b>those</b> eligible. Secondary <b>objectives</b> <b>include</b> evaluation of study processes. Analyses of feasibility and patient-reported outcomes will primarily take the form of simple descriptive statistics and where appropriate, point estimates of effects sizes and associated 95...|$|R
