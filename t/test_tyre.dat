ABSTRACT:This paper summarises {{the results of a}} study in which the maximum vertical contact stresses of the 1 / 3 rd scale test tyres of the Model Mobile Load Simulator (MMLS 3) were compared with those measured for three types of full-scale test tyres of the Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS). The comparative tests were done using the Stress-In-Motion (SIM) device designed to capture three-dimensional (3 D) tyre-pavement contact stresses on a relatively rough-textured test surface. As it is generally accepted that these stress conditions within the moving tyre contact patch are quite complex, a single parameter of the vertical stresses measured for the different test tyres was selected for the comparison. This parameter, referred to as the Maximum Vertical Contact Stress (MVCS) indicated, on average, that it increased linearly with tyre inflation pressure for both types of the 1 / 3 rd scale MMLS 3 test tyres and full-scale test tyres. However, {{it was found that the}} MVCSs for the Diamond patterned square profile 1 / 3 rd scale tyres of the MMLS 3 were, on average, much lower than those of the full-scale test tyres as they represented, at most, only 52. 5 per cent of those measured for the 11 R 22. 5 (full-scale HVS) <b>test</b> <b>tyre,</b> 37. 5 per cent for the single 315 / 80 R 22. 5 (full-scale HVS) <b>test</b> <b>tyre,</b> and 12. 5 per cent and 20 per cent respectively respectively for the smooth and rough-texture tests on the 12 R 22. 5 (full-scale HVS) <b>test</b> <b>tyre.</b> Earlier studies of vertical contact stresses of the test tyres of the MMLS 3 by Sime M & Ashmore SC, (1999), Epps Martin et al (2000) and Doupal et al (2002) that were conducted with different stress measuring devices reported higher vertical contact stresses at the upper level of tyre inflation pressures. It is therefore recommended that the influence of test surface characteristics and the impact on SIM measurements of HVS and MMLS 3 tyres be investigated in greater detail in future similar studies. It is nevertheless strongly recommended that the foregoing be incorporated into MMLS 3 and HVS comparative and/or individual testing programs (and protocols) to permit a more rational interpretation of test data from both these devices relative to structural road pavement performance issues, especially on the surface of flexible road pavements.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a detailed finite element (FE) model of an aircraft <b>test</b> <b>tyre</b> in order to investigate its performance and assess its safety criteria. It is noticed that rubber and fabric composite materials are the major components of this tyre model and their characterization requires tests and correlation. The characterization of such materials is of great importance in the model development process. Due to its complicated mechanical behaviour that exceeds the linear elastic theory, rubber is generally considered as hyperelastic material in FE analysis. It can be defined by a stored energy function with various coefficients that need to be determined by a series of experimental test data. The key issue is to define an appropriate energy function that can provide good fit with the experimental test data. Initially, a full-scaled LS-Dyna FE model has been development to replicate the actual geometry of the target <b>test</b> <b>tyre.</b> The material properties of each individual component have been characterized and correlated with industrial uniaxial tension test data. The inflation and static load simulations have been analyzed basing on the characterized tyre model, indicating its reliability. The dynamic simulations that aim to duplicate tyre load upon aircraft landing scenarios have also been analyzed. Following the comments and guidelines from aircraft industrial data, the dynamic simulations have covered the tyre loading scenarios from normal (soft) landing, hard landing to crash landing under different aircraft landing weights and vertical speeds. The tyre deflection rate and the contact load have been chosen as the safety criteria. The simulation analysis, results and comments have been discussed in detail. The modelling and correlation processes described in this paper aim to demonstrate the importance of hyperelastic material characterization in developing a detailed FE tyre model. Such a predictive model can be effectively used during tyre design process to allow manufacturers to assess its availability, and also add to the general drive towards the use of more virtual prototypes in an area traditionally reliant on experimental testing...|$|E

To reduce the traffic noise nuisance, low noise road surfaces and tyres have been adopted in noise sensitive areas. The durability and persistency of these low noise road surfaces and tyres are of great concerns. This study aims to quantify the effects of road and tyre deterioration on tyre/road noise. The {{results show that the}} tyre/road noise measured on five types of low noise surface material increased by 1. 2 - 1. 5 dB(A) per year. The tyre rubber hardness increased by 0. 6 shore-A value per month. The tyre/road noise level increased by 0. 08 - 0. 48 dB(A) for every unit of shore-A value increase, depending on the road surface material.

40|$|Multi-dimensional forces (and stresses) {{inside the}} contact patch of a free-rolling {{pneumatic}} rubber tyre generally {{occur as a}} direct result of a complex interaction between flexible rubber and a rigid test surface or road surface.

40|$|When {{measuring}} tyre/road noise by the Close-ProXimity (CPX) method, microphones are fitted {{close to}} a <b>test</b> <b>tyre</b> mounted on a trailer or self-propelled vehicle, and the system is driven at speeds up to 110 km/h. When the trailer is covered by an enclosure, wind noise in the microphones {{is believed to be}} reduced. However, for uncovered systems, wind noise may contaminate tyre/road noise measurements. Wind induced noise was measured for two types of uncovered equipment, a test vehicle and an open trailer. For the latter, wind speeds were measured in running conditions at the microphone positions and wind induced noise levels were estimated from data provided by the microphone manufacturer. The S/N ratio at 80 km/h on a AC 11 d surface was estimated to be 23 dB in the one-third-band octave at 315 Hz and 36 dB for overall A-weighted noise levels. For the test vehicle, wind speeds and induced noise levels were measured directly on the whole system in an anechoic wind tunnel. Overall wind noise levels at speeds up to 90 km/h were at least 10 dB lower than tyre/road noise on porous asphalt 0 / 10.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{investigation}} into the modelling and simulation of an aircraft tyre and wheel assembly in finite element environment. The finite element simulations basing on aircraft tyre test and operational scenarios could predict the loads transferred from tyre and the stresses distributed to the wheel rim. The virtual analysis could assess the safety criteria of different tyre structures, which would lead to the cost and time circle reduction in tyre R&D process. An H 41 x 16. 0 R 20 radial ply aircraft <b>test</b> <b>tyre</b> and its corresponding test wheel, provided by Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Limited, are adopted as the subject of this research. The material properties, especially the rubber and fabric materials, have been investigated. The finite element hyperelastic models have been utilized to represent rubbers and been correlated to experimental data. The 2 D and 3 D finite element tyre models, along with the finite element wheel models are created in the commercial finite element code, LS-Dyna. The finite element models have been validated with either industrial standardised simulation results or experimental data. Basing on the validated models, simulations that duplicating static test and dynamic operational scenarios have been developed. The researches have provided knowledge in comparing single and double bead tyre designs with respect to wheel loading mechanisms. The computational model also allowed manufacturers to assess the performance and safety criteria of a particular tyre at its design stage.

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} establish tyre-road noise models {{by using a}} Data Mining approach that allowed to build a predictive model and assess {{the importance of the}} tested input variables. The data modelling took into account three learning algorithms and three metrics to define the best predictive model. The variables tested included basic properties of pavement surfaces, macrotexture, megatexture, and uneven- ness and, for the first time, damping. Also, the importance of those variables was measured by using a sensitivity analysis procedure. Two types of models were set: one with basic variables and another with complex variables, such as megatexture and damping, all as a function of vehicles speed. More detailed models were additionally set by the speed level. As a result, several models with very good tyre-road noise predictive capacity were achieved. The most relevant variables were Speed, Temperature, Aggregate size, Mean Profile Depth, and Damping, which had the highest importance, even though influenced by speed. Megatexture and IRI had the lowest importance. The applicability of the models developed in this work is relevant for trucks tyre-noise prediction, represented by the AVON V 4 <b>test</b> <b>tyre,</b> at the early stage of road pavements use.

The process is demonstrated by a programme of <b>tyre</b> <b>testing</b> carried out using the Calspan TIRF <b>tyre</b> <b>testing</b> facility in the USA, and it is shown here how the GS 2 MF Flat-Trac® <b>tyre</b> <b>test</b> procedure can be used more efficiently to parameterise the pure lateral and self-aligning moment components for the well-known ‘magic formula’ tyre model.
