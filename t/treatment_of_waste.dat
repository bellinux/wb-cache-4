25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{disinfection}} in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> water is to substantially {{reduce the number}} of microorganisms in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking, bathing, irrigation, etc. The effectiveness of disinfection depends {{on the quality of the}} water being treated (e.g., cloudiness, pH, etc.), the type of disinfection being used, the disinfectant dosage (concentration and time), and other environmental variables. Cloudy water will be treated less successfully, since solid matter can shield organisms, especially from ultraviolet light or if contact times are low. Generally, short contact times, low doses and high flows all militate against effective disinfection. Common methods of disinfection include ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite. Chloramine, which is used for drinking water, is not used in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> water because of its persistence. After multiple steps of disinfection, the treated water is ready to be released back into the water cycle by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture. Afterwards, the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses.|$|E

2500|$|Waste {{management}} in cities with developing economies and {{economies in transition}} experience exhausted waste collection services and inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites. The problems are worsening. [...] Problems with governance complicate the situation. Waste management, in these countries and cities, is an ongoing challenge and many struggle due to weak institutions, chronic under-resourcing and rapid urbanization. All of these challenges, along {{with the lack of}} understanding of different factors that contribute to the hierarchy of waste management, affect the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> {{became a}} vital demand to {{maintain}} the environment as clean as possible. The <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> and reuse <b>of</b> their constituents in industry will be helpful for this trend {{as well as for}} economy. Flotation technique is one of the important separation techniques that can be applied for <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> efficiently. The filter cake of El-Maghara coal washing plant was one <b>of</b> these <b>wastes</b> which contains a considerable amount of clay. This filter cake was treated in a previous work by flotation in order to clean it from the contained fine coal. The residual clay was tested as a raw material to produce brick models with acceptable mechanical properties. Improvement of the mechanical properties of such brick models by mixing such clay with sand is exactly the main objective of this work. The effect of different factors such as, weight percent of sand and its particle size on the mechanical properties of the brick models was investigated. It was found that 20 % and 60 % of sand sample characterized by size distribution of- 1500 + 0 µm and- 500 + 0 µm respectively are enough to achieve a considerable extent of improvement in the mechanical properties of the clay brick produced.

2500|$|The Congo has {{important}} oil reserves but {{remains one of}} the poorest countries {{and one of the most}} indebted countries in the world per capita, despite the cancellation by international institutions of half of its debt, benefiting in 2010 of the HIPC regime (heavily indebted poor countries). Meanwhile, the oil windfall extracted from Pointe-Noire does not benefit this one. The infrastructure does not follow the rapid evolution of the population of the coastal city.

2500|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is {{the biological}} treatment of liquid animal waste using bacteria {{in an area}} absent of air, which promotes the decomposition of organic solids. [...] Hot water is used to heat the waste {{in order to increase}} the rate of biogas production (Cornell University Manure Waste Management). The remaining liquid is nutrient rich and can be used on fields as a fertilizer and methane gas that can be burned directly on the biogas stove or in an engine generator to produce electricity and heat. Methane is about 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, which has significant negative environmental effects if not controlled properly. [...] Anaerobic <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> is the best method for controlling the odor associated with manure management.|$|E
2500|$|Low-level {{radioactive}} waste has been discharged into the Irish Sea {{as part of}} operations at Sellafield since 1952.
