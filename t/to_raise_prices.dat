In 1996 it produced 58,000 tonnes out of a world production of 81,000, followed by India at 13,000 tonnes. Japanese production is now marginal, at only 2500 tonnes. Between 1995 and 1997 Chinese silk production went down 40% in an effort <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>prices,</b> reminiscent of earlier shortages.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{raised its}} prices for coal haulage. All coal hauled on the Tramway needed {{to pass along}} the A from Verney Junction or Aylesbury and Jones had <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> to cover the {{surcharge}} or keep prices stable despite the loss of profits. Road-hauled coal from Bicester was already undercutting the Tramway and the unreliable engines had given the Tramway a poor reputation. Jones kept prices fixed and absorb the increased costs, wrecking the Tramway's already declining business.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E

Whether these payments strengthen the duty’s ability <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>price</b> depends crucially on market structure. In {{a competitive market}} where domestic and imported goods are imperfect substitutes, the payments are akin to a production subsidy and thus undermine the duty’s ability <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>price.</b> Applying the theory to antidumping duties imposed by the United States on catfish imports from Vietnam, a three-equation model estimated using monthly data from January 1999 to August 2006 showed the duties {{to have had a}} modest yet positive effect on the US price.

5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an economy would be expected only <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>prices,</b> not to create more goods.|$|E

40|$|Will an {{industry}} with no antitrust policy converge to monopoly, competition or somewhere in between? We analyze this question using a dynamic dominant firm model with rational agents, endogenous mergers and constant {{returns to scale}} production. We find that perfect competition and monopoly are always steady states of this model and {{that there may be}} other steady states with a dominant firm and a fringe co-existing. Mergers are likely only when supply is inelastic or demand is elastic, suggesting that the ability of a dominant firm <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>price</b> through monopolization is limited. Additionally, as the discount rate increases, it becomes harder to monopolize the industry, because the dominant firm cannot commit <b>to</b> not <b>raising</b> <b>prices</b> in the future.

25|$|As {{economic}} difficulties worsened, Iowa farmers sought to find local solutions. Faced with extremely low farm prices, including corn at ten cents a bushel and pork at three cents a pound, some farmers in western Iowa formed the Farmers Holiday Association. This group, {{which had its}} greatest strength {{in the area around}} Sioux City, tried to withhold farm products from markets. They believed this practice would force up farm prices. The Farm Holiday Association had only limited success as many farmers did not cooperate and the withholding itself did little <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>prices.</b> Farmers experienced little relief until 1933 when the federal government, as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, created a federal farm aid program.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the primary}} {{concerns}} was the price of coffee, Colombia's largest export and {{the main source of}} its foreign exchange. The American Office of Price Administration (OPA) attempted to have the maximum price of coffee frozen at the level existing on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, Colombia objected on the basis that the cost of producing and transporting coffee had increased due to wartime conditions, and, if the price was not adjusted to factor in these conditions, the economy would decline. The OPA relented, and agreed <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> immediately and to adjust them in the future based on increased production and transportation costs.|$|E

In early 1999, Benefis {{announced it was}} suffering serious financial losses that were imperiling its ability to provide health care. In January 1999, the company reported a loss of $3 million on revenues of $128 million in 1998, and projected a doubling of that loss in 1999 with no appreciable growth in revenues. Benefis claimed its COPA agreement did {{not account for the}} costs of consummating the merger of Columbus and Deaconess hospitals, and did not provide for adjustments to the agreement in the event competition forced changes to its business plan. The company cut costs by $17 million, saw construction costs increase by $17 million, and had not yet implemented any staff reductions. Benefis predicted losses totaling $25.7 million by 2003 unless changes to the COPA were made. After two months of negotiations, the state amended the COPA to allow Benefis <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>prices</b> faster than originally permitted (generating $12 million in revenues), and reduce cost savings returned to the community by $39.5 million. The term of the COPA (its initial terms were to end in 2006) was not changed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} into the profitability of audit engagements. The study is motivated by the frequently expressed concern regarding the lack of competitiveness on the audit market, based on trends of increasing concentration of suppliers in this market. The argument is that increasing concentration facilitates collusion and monopoly behavior, allowing firms <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>price</b> above cost. A direct test of this argument would be to test the effect of elements of market structure on the ratio between price and costs (i. e. profitability). Industrial organization and industrial economics research has seen studies on this issue for a multitude of industries, but not for the audit industry. Due to unavailability of data particularly on audit costs, audit market research has attempted investigate the competitiveness of the market mainly by examining audit fees and audit production data. The current study attempts to investigate directly whether higher market concentration allows firms <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>price</b> above cost. Based on insights from the audit fee and production literature, the economics of industrial organization, and the relatively recent studies on local (rather than national) audit markets, a model for explaining audit engagement profitability is constructed. This model is tested empirically on a sample of 114 audit engagements conducted by one of the (then) Big 6 audit firms. The results show that the audit market structure differs across local audit markets, and that this local structure has a significant influence on audit engagement profitability. In addition, some factors that have shown to be important determinants in prior audit fee and production studies are also significant in this study’s profitability model. These relate to client risk and financial distress, the length {{of the relationship between the}} auditor and the client, and client complexity. The results for local audit market structure suggest that, as expected, higher market share in local markets allows the audit firm <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>price</b> above cost. This can be interpreted as a sign of market power. However, some alternative explanations for the empirical results of the paper are also suggested. business administration and economics;...|$|R
