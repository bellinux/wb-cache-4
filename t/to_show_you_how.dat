500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the common experience. You need someone <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Gavin {{said that}} “the show {{we are putting}} on is very shiny, it's very colourful. We don't want to bang on about our culture. We {{just want to have}} fun.” [...] Es Devlin added that it [...] "has to make sense in Bognor and Bogotá." [...] She said that the creators had happily indulged in the chance to [...] "visually draw on everything" [...] that British {{imagination}} can offer. David Arnold said “It's going to be beautiful, cheeky, cheesy, camp, silly and thrilling", and added that [...] "we could have done this 15 times over, and not had the same show, and it would still have been full of amazing British music". He thought that it should be the [...] "greatest after party" [...] and was “really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [...] the arts". Arnold himself had devoted two years working on the ceremony and had turned down all other work including Skyfall, but said that it was the [...] "most fun" [...] he had [...] "ever had in music". In the handover section Rio aimed to express [...] "multicultural embrace." [...] Daniela Thomas stated that Rio [...] "want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> sophisticated we mix things, what we do with the things you believe we are, how we mix with pop culture." ...|$|E
500|$|Stewart, {{who earned}} $270,136 for the victory, {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the season, and his first at Talladega Superspeedway, {{in front of a}} crowd of 145,000. He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "It's one thing to get back to Victory Lane, but to do it at Talladega wow." [...] "I've wanted to win here for so long. This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem to be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Iraq Study Group Report: The Way Forward – A New Approach is {{the report}} of the Iraq Study Group, as {{mandated}} by the United States Congress. It is an assessment {{of the state of the}} war in Iraq as of December 6, 2006, when the ISG released the report to the public on the Internet and as a published book. The report was seen as crucial by Bush, who declared: [...] "And truth of the matter is, a lot of reports in Washington are never read by anybody. <b>To</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> important this one is, I read it, and [...] read it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A video {{accompanying}} the track [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] {{was released on}} 3 October 2012 to promote the album's release.

According to music magazine NMEs website, in {{an open letter to}} his fans The Weeknd posted on his website in regards to the [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] video, [...] "Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolising story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E
