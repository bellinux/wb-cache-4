5|$|In 1877, McClellan was {{nominated}} by the Democrats for Governor of New Jersey, {{an action that}} <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> surprise because he had not {{expressed an interest in}} the position. He accepted the nomination, was elected, and served a single term from 1878 to 1881, a tenure marked by careful, conservative executive management and minimal political rancor. The concluding chapter of his political career was his strong support in 1884 for the election of Grover Cleveland. He sought the position of secretary of war in Cleveland's cabinet, for which he was well qualified, but political rivals from New Jersey were able to block his nomination.|$|E
5|$|In his {{autobiography}} Belgrano {{declared that he}} did not have any previous knowledge of being included in the junta, and that his appointment <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> surprise. Nevertheless, he accepted the role. He was part of the political line of Mariano Moreno; they were expecting to use the government to make big changes in the social order. One of his first rulings was the making of a Maths Academy, located in the building of the Consulate and with the purpose of instructing the military. Belgrano was appointed its protector. He supported the banishment of Cisneros and the members of the Real Audience, and the execution of Liniers and other counter-revolutionaries defeated in Córdoba. Some historians suggest that he would have promoted the creation of the Operations plan, a secret document written by Moreno that set harsh ways for the junta to achieve its goals, while others consider the whole document a literary forgery done by royalists to discredit the junta. A few others suspect that some paragraphs or the whole document may have been the result of collaborative writing between Moreno, Belgrano, and Hipólito Vieytes.|$|E
25|$|At the {{invitation}} of the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos he submitted a plan on 20 October 1919 {{for the creation of}} a new University at Smyrna in Asia Minor, to be named Ionian University of Smyrna. In 1920 Carathéodory was appointed Dean of the University and took a major part in establishing the institution, touring Europe to buy books and equipment. The university however never actually admitted students due to the War in Asia Minor which ended in the Great Fire of Smyrna. Carathéodory managed to save books from the library and was only rescued at the last moment by a journalist who <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> rowing boat to the battleship Naxos which was standing by. The present day University of the Aegean claims to be a continuation of Carathéodory's original plan.|$|E

500|$|... "Dwight's Speech" [...] was {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, making it his second directing credit after the earlier second season episode [...] "Christmas Party". [...] "Dwight's Speech" [...] was written by Paul Lieberstein, who plays human resources director Toby Flenderson. Lieberstein later revealed that Jim never went on his trip to Australia, noting [...] "The whole Pam thing <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> surprise, he transferred and then wasn’t really up for vacation. Unless, of course, we find a good joke in his vacation.” ...|$|E

Ethan Phillips had appeared as Neelix, a main cast character in , as well as the Ferengi doctor Farek in The Next Generation episode [...] "Ménage à Troi". The third alumnus was Jeffrey Combs who had appeared as several characters such as Weyoun and the Ferengi [...] in [...] Combs had already previously in Enterprise as the Andorian Shran, and would continue to do so {{for the rest of the}} series. He said that being asked to appear as a Ferengi once again <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> surprise, but that Krem was [...] "a world's away" [...] from the Brunt character, which pleased him.|$|E
500|$|In April 1916 {{he wrote}} scathingly [...] in The New York Times about militant [...] Irish nationalism: [...] "In point of {{learning}} nothing and forgetting nothing these fellow-patriots of mine leave the Bourbons nowhere." [...] Total independence, he asserted, was impractical; alliance with a bigger power (preferably England) was essential. [...] The Dublin Easter Rising later that month <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> surprise. After its suppression by British forces, he expressed horror at the summary {{execution of the}} rebel leaders, but continued to believe {{in some form of}} Anglo-Irish union. In How to Settle the Irish Question (1917), he envisaged a federal arrangement, with national and imperial parliaments. Holroyd records that by this time the separatist party Sinn Féin was in the ascendency, and Shaw's and other moderate schemes were forgotten.|$|E

500|$|Parliament held Charles {{under house}} arrest at Holdenby House in Northamptonshire until Cornet George Joyce <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> threat of force from Holdenby on 3 June {{in the name of}} the New Model Army. By this time, mutual {{suspicion}} had developed between Parliament, which favoured army disbandment and Presbyterianism, and the New Model Army, which was primarily officered by Independent non-conformists who sought a greater political role. Charles was eager to exploit the widening divisions, and apparently viewed Joyce's actions as an opportunity rather than a threat. He was taken first to Newmarket, at his own suggestion, and then transferred to Oatlands and subsequently Hampton Court, while more ultimately fruitless negotiations took place. By November, he determined that it would be in his best interests to escape – perhaps to France, Southern England or to Berwick-upon-Tweed, near the Scottish border. [...] He fled Hampton Court on 11 November, and from the shores of Southampton Water made contact with Colonel Robert Hammond, Parliamentary Governor of the Isle of Wight, whom he apparently believed to be sympathetic. Hammond, however, confined Charles in Carisbrooke Castle and informed Parliament that Charles was in his custody.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene the two girls are {{returning}} from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning attribute, a lamb with a cruciform halo, and carrying a martyr's palm. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the Prefect of Rome, who has {{fallen in love with}} Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ {{on the inside of the}} cover. Agnes [...] rejects him, with the words Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. [...] The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a brothel for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess Vesta. Caxton's Legend fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all abashed, he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", [...] ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to local}} tradition, Gwalior owes {{its name to}} a sage of former times. Suraj Sen, a prince of the gurjar-pratihar clan of the eighth century, {{is said to have}} lost his way in the forest. On a secluded hill, he met an old man, the sage Gwalipa, whose {{influence}} almost <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> surprise. Upon asking the sage for some drinking water, he was led to a pond, where the waters not only quenched his thirst but cured him of leprosy. Out of gratitude, the prince wished to offer the sage something in return, and the sage asked him to build a wall on the hill to protect the other sages from wild animals which often disturbed their yajnas (or pujas). Suraj Sen later built a palace inside the fort, which was named [...] "Gwalior" [...] after the sage, and eventually the city that grew around the fort took the same name.|$|E
2500|$|After a few years, he {{was sent}} to St. Paul's School, which was run by Alexander Gil, William Sound, and Oliver Smythe. Gil had a {{reputation}} for scholarship in Greek, Latin, and theology. He was also a proponent of English grammar structures and relied on poetry, including that written by Edmund Spenser and Philip Sidney, to discuss the English language. Milton travelled each day between school and home, and his path <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> St Paul's. It is possible that he listened to the sermons put on during this time by John Donne. John Aubrey, in Brief Lives, quotes his brother Christopher to describe how Milton spent his time: [...] "When he went to school, when he was very young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night; and his father ordered the main to sit up for him". Milton later attributed his blindness, in his Defensio Secunda, to the rigorous study that he undetook during this time.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley {{was still}} {{required}} daily {{to report to}} police but reported {{for the last time}} on 1 April and an arrest warrant was issued. Stanley, it appears, drove to Ramsgate, where a personal friend <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> sea to a port near Boulogne in France, possibly Dunkirk. He was taken from there by car to Abbeville. On 13 April, Israel announced that it would accept Stanley's application for an immigration visa and admit him to the country on the eve of Passover as [...] "an act of grace and mercy". After about a month in France, Stanley travelled to Marseilles, where he boarded the Israeli ship Atzmaut. On 9 May, he arrived in Haifa aboard the Atzmaut together with about 2,000 other immigrants to Israel. He then held a press conference announcing that his name was now Shlomo Ben-Chaim. He made various claims regarding his disappearance, including that he had been kidnapped and held in France for a month, that he had escaped from Britain disguised as an admiral, and then as a military officer who became a passenger on a British destroyer. His lawyer, Max Seligman, said he was a [...] "psychological case". Sometime later in 1949, Stanley returned to France with some thoughts of re-establishing himself in business, but moved back to Israel in 1950, where he spent the remainder of his life in obscurity, save for the wild allegations and stories that he continued to press on the newspapers. Stanley died in Tel Aviv in 1969.|$|E

2500|$|De Gaulle {{hosted a}} superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms {{limitation}} talks and détente {{efforts in the}} wake of the 1960 U-2 incident between United States President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: [...] "Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan." [...] When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, [...] "De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and <b>took</b> <b>him</b> <b>by</b> the arm. He took me also by the elbow and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support". General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's [...] "unconditional support" [...] of the United States during that [...] "crucial time". De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the Élysée Palace to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved {{in the wake of}} the U-2 incident.|$|E
