40|$|This paper {{uses the}} methods of social network {{analysis}} to discover the structural patterns of cooperation that arose {{in response to a}} global traditional security problem.

By mapping the relationships at the system level of world politics, including individual states as well as intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), transnational nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and transnational corporations (TNCs), this paper finds a third relation among these actors, namely, structural power. It also demonstrates how a network approach to the constitution of system level world politics can produce knowledge not available to traditional methods...|$|R
