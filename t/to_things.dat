5|$|Dynasty Warriors 4 expands on its {{predecessors}} by adding new characters, new modes {{of play and}} a completely new 'Edit Mode.' Instead of having strict routines to follow during battle, officers, to some extent, will have a greater reaction to the events taking place on the battlefield {{in the game and}} may react <b>to</b> <b>things</b> more often.|$|E
5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment effect has found that people ascribe more value <b>to</b> <b>things</b> merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect {{is just one example}} of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E

5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction <b>to</b> <b>things,</b> rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
5|$|The rampant and {{unsustainable}} hunting was {{not just}} financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior <b>to</b> <b>things</b> European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.|$|E
5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as the author of a work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply <b>to</b> <b>things</b> such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E

5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony <b>to</b> <b>things.</b> A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of the psyche lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{is an important}} mechanism through which children learn to map words-to-world, and vice versa. Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child. Joint {{attention is}} often accompanied by physical co-presence, since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment. As well, conversational co-presence is likely to occur; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention. Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors, who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to {{in the world at}} the same time. The co-variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer <b>to</b> <b>things</b> that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants. For instance, caregivers among the Kaluli, a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea, rarely provide labels {{in the context of their}} referents. While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver's role in the meaning-making process, some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning, actively avoiding mapping errors. When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker, they seek out information about the speaker's focus, and then use that information to establish correct word-referent mappings. Joint attention can be created through infant agency, in an attempt to gather information about a speaker's intent.|$|E

25|$|Numbers {{can count}} (3nbsp&apples), order (the 3rdnbsp&apple), or measure (3.5nbsp&feet high); as {{the history of}} {{mathematics}} has progressed from counting on our fingers to modelling quantum mechanics, multiplication has been generalized to more complicated and abstract types of numbers, and <b>to</b> <b>things</b> that are not numbers (such as matrices) or do not look much like numbers (such as quaternions).|$|E
25|$|Without {{going outside}} his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; without looking {{out from his}} window, one sees the Tao of Heaven.

25|$|The Tale's satire is most {{consistent}} in attacking misreading of all sorts. Both {{in the narrative}} sections and the digressions, the single human flaw that underlies all the follies Swift attacks is over-figurative and over-literal reading, both of the Bible and of poetry and political prose. The narrator is seeking hidden knowledge, mechanical operations of things spiritual, spiritual qualities <b>to</b> <b>things</b> physical, and alternate readings of everything.|$|E

They are essentially limited {{only to the}} number of Power Points the Game Master gives them, although this may make characters unbalanced. Some d20 System players who believe classes and levels are too restrictive have looked to the structure of M for making their own classless and level-less d20 games.|$|E
25|$|Theophrastus {{seems to}} have carried out still further the {{grammatical}} foundation of logic and rhetoric, since in his book on the elements of speech, he distinguished the main parts of speech from the subordinate parts, and also direct expressions (κυρία λέξις kuria lexis) from metaphorical expressions, and dealt with the emotions (πάθη pathe) of speech. He further distinguished a twofold reference of speech (σχίσις schisis) <b>to</b> <b>things</b> (πράγματα pragmata) and to the hearers, and referred poetry and rhetoric to the latter.|$|E
25|$|Here Descartes {{notes that}} automata {{are capable of}} {{responding}} to human interactions but argues that such automata cannot respond appropriately <b>to</b> <b>things</b> said in {{their presence in the}} way that any human can. Descartes therefore prefigures the Turing Test by defining the insufficiency of appropriate linguistic response as that which separates the human from the automaton. Descartes fails to consider the possibility that future automata might be able to overcome such insufficiency, and so does not propose the Turing Test as such, even if he prefigures its conceptual framework and criterion.|$|E
