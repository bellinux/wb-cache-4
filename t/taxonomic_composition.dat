40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of the studies on the Coleoptera fauna from Vila Velha, Ponta Grossa, Parana {{gathered}} through malaise and pitfall traps in sites with different floristic conditions. The present study deal with the data of pitfall trap captures, installed close to the malaise traps. The data were obtained weekly (52 samples), from September 1999 to August 2000. This survey was carried out on five areas, three of them with different plant succession stages (initial, intermediate, and advanced). The other two sites were: in Araucaria angustifolia plantation area, with the understory invaded by native forest vegetation and in the edge area. In the last one, two pitfall traps were installed, one inside the forest and other in the field vegetation. The Coleoptera communities were analyzed according the abundance, family richness, and the floristic conditions of the sites. The total of specimens collected was 13, 093 belonging to 35 families. The most abundant site was the one in initial stage of succession; the abundance was lowest in the edge area. The beetle faunal composition of the five sites, including all the families, were not significantly different. However, when listed only the seven dominant families, the results showed the outside edge fauna composition significantly different from the other sites. Among the most abundant families in the Vila Velha litter are Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae, Nitidulidae, Scarabaeidae, Scolytidae, Hydrophilidae and Endomychidae, eventually substituted by Latridiidae, Corylophidae, Curculionidae, Carabidae and Histeridae. Several comparisons were made with the data from malaise and pitfall traps data obtained in Vila Velha, and from other studies in several world regions. From these comparisons was possible to highlight: the beetle family richness is higher when captured by malaise than pitfall trap; the family <b>taxonomic</b> <b>compositions</b> in the litter from several regions of the world are more similar among themselves than the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>compositions</b> from malaise captures in the same region; a small number of beetle families (five to seven) is liable by approximately 60 % of the total abundance in the malaise, and about 90 % in the litter; the majority litter faunal surveys showed non-herbivorous families as dominants, while in the malaise trap the herbivorous families are dominants; there are evidences that certain taxa are substituted by others of the same trophic group by ecologic reasons when in the same region, and by zoogeographic reasons in different regions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStudies on {{the effects}} of {{biodiversity}} on ecosystem functioning have generally revealed a positive asymptotic relationship between biodiversity and single functions, suggesting species redundancy with respect to these functions. Yet, most research was performed on specific processes and did not consider ecosystem ‘multifunctionality'. There is also little information on the relationship between genetic and functional diversity. To analyze this relationship, we performed a microcosm experiment on a complex lake assemblage of decomposers, {{in the presence of the}} green alga Scenedesmus obliquus, which acted as carbon source for decomposers. By manipulating nutrient enrichment and the N: P input ratio, we observed that the structures of particle-associated and free bacterial assemblages were highly predictable in response to stoichiometric constraints.

We then assessed the impact of three aquatic invasive species on the plants and macroinvertebrates: Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, Ludwigia grandiflora and Myriophyllum aquaticum. Our research on 32 ponds in Belgium indicated that the reduction in the native plant species richness was a common pattern to invasion. However, the magnitude of impacts were species specific. A strong negative relationship to invasive species cover was found, with submerged vegetation the most vulnerable to the invasion. Invertebrate richness, diversity and abundance were measured in sediments of invaded and uninvaded ponds along a gradient of H. ranunculoides, L. grandiflora, and M. aquaticum species cover. We found a strong negative relationship between invasive species cover and invertebrate abundance, probably due to unsuitable conditions of the detritus for invertebrate colonization. <b>Taxonomic</b> <b>compositions</b> of aquatic invertebrate assemblages in invaded ponds differed from uninvaded ponds.
