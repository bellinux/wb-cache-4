40|$|Abstract. The {{principle}} of polyrepresentation offers {{a theoretical framework}} for handling multiple contexts in Information Retrieval (IR). This paper presents an empirical study of polyrepresentation of the information space with focus on inter and intra-document features. The Cystic Fibrosis test collection indexed in a best match system constitutes the experimental setting. Overlaps between four functionally and/or cognitively different representations are identified. Supporting the {{principle of}} polyrepresentation, results show that in general overlaps generated by three or four representations have higher precision than those generated from one or <b>two</b> overlaps <b>both</b> in <b>structured</b> and unstructured search mode. It is concluded that a highly structured query language is necessary when implementing the principle of polyrepresentation in a best match IR system because the principle is inherently Boolean. Finally a re-ranking test shows promising results when search results are re-ranked according to precision obtained in the overlaps. Symposium themes. Document structure in contextual IIR 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The ribose-binding protein (RBP) is a sugar-binding {{bacterial}} periplasmic protein whose {{function is}} associated with a large allosteric conformational change from an open to a closed conformation upon binding to ribose. The open (ligand-free) and closed (ligand-bound) forms of RBP have been found. Here we investigate the conformational motions and residue fluctuations of the RBP by analyzing the modes of motion with two coarse-grained elastic network models, the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) and Anisotropic Network Model (ANM). The calculated B-factors in both the calculated models are in good agreement with the experimentally determined B-factors in X-ray crystal structures. The slowest mode analysis by GNM shows that both forms have the same motion hinge axes around residues Ser 103, Gln 235, Asp 264 and the <b>two</b> domains of <b>both</b> <b>structures</b> have similar fluctuation range. The superposition of the first three dominant modes of ANM, consisting of the rotating, bending and twisting motions of the two forms, accounts for large rearrangement of domains from the ligand-free (open) to ligand-bound (closed) conformation and thus constitutes a critical component of the RBP’s functions.

We develop succinct data {{structures}} to represent (i) a se-quence of values to support partial sum and select queries and update (changing values) and (ii) a dynamic array {{consisting of a}} sequence of elements which supports insertion, deletion and access of an element at any given index. For the partial sums problem on n non-negative integers of k bits each, we support update operations in O(b) time and sum in O(logb n) time, for any parameter b, lg n / lg lg n ≤ b ≤ n for any fixed positive < 1. The space used is kn+o(kn) bits and the time bounds are optimal. When b = lg n / lg lg n or k = 1 (i. e., when {{we are dealing with}} a bit-vector), we can also support the select operation in {{the same time as the}} sum operation, but the update time becomes amortised. For the dynamic array problem, we give <b>two</b> <b>structures</b> <b>both</b> using o(n) bits of extra space where n is the number of elements in the array: one supports lookup in constant worst case time and updates in O(n) worst case time, and the other supports all operations in O(lgn / lg lg n) amortized time.

For a commutative standard table algebra, we show that there exists exactly one character with nontrivial multiplicity if and only if the table basis is the wreath product of a two-dimensional subalgebra and an abelian group.
