2500|$|The USAF Air Materiel Command {{reactivated}} the JB-2 as Project EO-727-12 on 23 April 1948, at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, {{the former}} Alamogordo Army Air Field. The JB-2 {{was used for}} development of missile guidance control and seeker systems, testing of telemetering and optical <b>tracking</b> <b>facilities,</b> and as a target for new surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles (fulfilling the V1's covername, Flakzielgerät— anti-aircraft target device). The JB-2 project used the North American Aviation NATIV (North American Test Instrument Vehicle) Blockhouse and two launch ramps at Holloman: a , two-rail ramp on a 3° earth-filled slope, and a [...] trailer ramp. The trailer ramp {{was the first step}} toward a system which would eventually be adapted for the forthcoming Martin MGM-1 Matador, the first operational surface-to-surface cruise missile built by the United States. The program at Holloman was terminated on 10 January 1949 after successful development of a radio guidance and control system that could control and even skid-land a JB-2 under the control of an airborne or ground transmitter.|$|E
