25|$|Most of Chile {{and parts}} of Argentina saw a partial eclipse at sunset. In some places over half the sun was obscured. In Chile, Valdivia in Los Ríos saw 63% obscured, Quellón in Los Lagos saw 54% obscured. Chilean coastal {{locations}} were ideally situated to observe an eclipsing sunset over the Pacific Ocean. Points further north, up to about La Serena, saw the eclipse begin as <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... "Here Comes the Moon" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison {{from his}} 1979 album George Harrison. Harrison wrote the song while on holiday on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978. His inspiration for the composition was {{the appearance of the}} moon in the evening sky, just as <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> <b>setting.</b> Although the lyrics focus on this natural occurrence rather than on the symbolism it suggests, in the manner of Harrison's Beatles track [...] "Here Comes the Sun", the song is seen as a sequel to that similarly titled piece.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{her other}} {{photographs}} containing her nude or hurt children caused controversy. For example, in [...] "The Perfect Tomato," [...] the viewer sees a nude Jessie, posing on a picnic table outside, bathed in light. Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming {{of one of his}} movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, and she tried to capture the image in a rush because <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> <b>setting.</b> This explains why everything is blurred except for the tomato, hence the photograph's title. This image was likely criticized for Jessie’s nudity and presentation of the adolescent female form. While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann’s children were often naked because “it came natural to them.” This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she used to walk around her house naked when she was growing up. Cox states that “the own artist’s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children’s lives.” One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides [...] "naked play", Jessie's Cut, shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye. The cut is stitched and the blood is dry and stains her skin. As painful as the image looks, there are a great number of viewers who could relate to Jessie when they think about the broken bones and stitched up cuts they had during childhood.|$|E
