50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1928 after Vermont's devastating 1927 floods, which {{destroyed}} more than 1,200 bridges. The state embarked on a massive construction program, in which largely standardized designs and construction methods were used to build replacement bridges. This bridge was designed by H.L.

Furthermore, the trusses are typically placed within demising walls {{and it is possible}} that the necessary fire rating can be entirely by enclosing the trusses with gypsum wallboard. Finally, if spray-on protection is desired, the applied thickness can be kept to a minimum due to the compact nature of the <b>truss</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|E

40|$|New finite {{elements}} which {{allow for the}} analysis and optimization of adaptive structures are presented. In {{the first part of}} this paper two {{finite elements}} accounting for integrated piezo-electric devices are formulated: a shell element for the analysis of shallow shell structures with piezo-electric polymers bonded to the surfaces and a <b>truss</b> <b>element</b> with an integrated piezo-electric ceramic. Test cases are presented to illustrate the potential of the finite elements. The shell element is used to compute the vibration excitation of a thin plate as well as the vibration control of a cantilever beam. The <b>truss</b> <b>element</b> is applied to the problem of optimal actuator placement in adaptive truss structures. For the solution of this problem, objective functions for the minimization of the control effort and the spillover energy are formulated. The second part of this paper is concerned with the finite element analysis of the behavior of shape memory alloys. A non-linear one-dimensional finite <b>truss</b> <b>element</b> and a non-linear beam element are used for the analysis of a composite beam with embedded shape memory alloy wires, of which the temperature is varied in order to tune the eigenfrequencies...|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1929 to a state-approved design by L.H. Shoemaker, and the <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> were {{fabricated}} by the Lackawanna Steel Construction Company of Buffalo, New York. The crossing site probably {{had a number of}} timber-frame bridges, the earliest definitively dated to the 1870s. The bridge {{was built in}} the wake of floods that washed away more than 1,200 bridges in Vermont, and accelerated the standardization of bridge construction in the state. This is one of a small number of surviving truss bridges on the Missisquoi River.|$|E

When the bridge was built in 1887, it crossed on Harris Street, which is now dead-ended on the south {{bank of the river}} to the east. The bridge is a single-span Pratt truss 100 ft long, 35 ft wide, and 35 ft tall, with a span of 95 ft. The <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> are wrought iron and are fastened together by pins.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1890 by the Berlin, Connecticut-based Berlin Iron Bridge Company, {{one of the major}} {{providers}} of iron and later steel bridges in the northeastern United States. Of the company's many bridges built in Connecticut, this was in 2001 one of seventeen surviving lenticular truss bridges, and one of a smaller number that remain in service in any form. It is distinctive for its use of pins in connecting the <b>truss</b> <b>elements.</b> It was built as part of a town program to upgrade all of its wood-frame bridges. The town paid the company $625 for the trusses and its portion of the bridge construction effort.|$|E
2500|$|This method can be {{used when}} the <b>truss</b> <b>element</b> forces {{of only a few}} members are to be found. This method is used by {{introducing}} a single straight line cutting through the member whose force wants to be calculated. However this method has a limit in that the cutting line can pass through a maximum of only 3 members of the truss structure. This restriction is because this method uses the force balances in the x and y direction and the moment balance, which gives us a maximum of 3 equations to find a maximum of 3 unknown <b>truss</b> <b>element</b> forces through which this cut is made.

40|$|Abstract: Beam string {{structure}} (BSS), {{which is}} {{a new kind of}} semi-rigid hybrid system, composed of arch, strut and string, has been developed rapidly in long-span steel structures in recent years. Based on the principle of virtual work and Updated Lagrange, the formulas of geometric nonlinear F. E. M. for spatial beam element, cable <b>element</b> and <b>truss</b> <b>element</b> are derived respectively in this paper. Taking the one-way BSS model of the steel roof in Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center as a computational example by using both linear and nonlinear analysis method, the analytical results show that it is appropriate when adopting the straight <b>truss</b> <b>element</b> with two joints and equivalent elastic modulus to simulate the cable element with small sag. Although the linear analysis can meet the requirement of practical engineering due to its weak nonlinearity of BSS, the nonlinear method is also important to improve the precision theoretically. The conclusions obtained may be helpful for the designers in similar projects...|$|R

The total width of the bridge is 18 ft, and has a single lane road. [...] The bridge rests on stone abutments. The bridge passes 12 ft over the water.

40|$|Large space {{structures}} are normally characterized by high order finite element models. In this thesis, long slender truss {{structures are}} modeled with both continuous beams and equivalent beam finite elements using an equivalent energy approach. The Timoshenko equivalent beam, {{which accounts for}} shear and rotary inertia effects, models the beam-like behavior of the truss better than the Bernoulli-Euler equivalent beam. The finite element equivalent beam has an even more accurate approach and maps the contributions of each <b>truss</b> <b>element</b> to the stiffness of the truss. If the structure is jointed, the joints may display nonlinear force-displacement behavior. The behavior of a multi-degree of freedom structure may be modeled using describing functions as a quasi-linearization of the force-displacement relation in the joint. The results of this method agree very well with those of time integration of the nonlinear equations for a simple two-beam one joint structure. Describing functions are calculated for the force-displacement relation across an entirejoint-strut-joint <b>truss</b> <b>element.</b> The resulting coefficients are used as the nonlinear stiffness and damping terms of the nonlinear truss...|$|R

5000|$|Spars are moored to {{the seabed}} like TLPs, but whereas a TLP has {{vertical}} tension tethers, a spar has more conventional mooring lines. Spars have to-date been designed in three configurations: the [...] "conventional" [...] one-piece cylindrical hull; the [...] "truss spar", {{in which the}} midsection is composed of <b>truss</b> <b>elements</b> connecting the upper buoyant hull (called a hard tank) with the bottom soft tank containing permanent ballast; and the [...] "cell spar", which is built from multiple vertical cylinders. The spar has more inherent stability than a TLP since it has a large counterweight {{at the bottom and}} does not depend on the mooring to hold it upright. It also has the ability, by adjusting the mooring line tensions (using chain-jacks attached to the mooring lines), to move horizontally and to position itself over wells at some distance from the main platform location. The first production spar was Kerr-McGee's Neptune, anchored in 590 m in the Gulf of Mexico; however, spars (such as Brent Spar) were previously used as FSOs.|$|E
