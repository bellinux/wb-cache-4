5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of <b>that</b> <b>degree</b> secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} pre-visualized rough drafts to sketch ideas {{for others to}} advance. For example, the introductory airplane level was pre-visualized two years prior to its creation as a demonstration for the development team and publisher. Levels were built in Volition's Core Technology Group (CTG) editor, which was continually built {{in the four years}} preceding release. Like the other two titles, Saints Row: The Third was built in the Havok physics engine with customizations. The engine let the team build vehicle drifting physics and the VTOL aircraft. The studio considered the Red Faction series' Geo-Mod 2 engine but chose against it due to the implementation's difficulty and not wanting <b>that</b> <b>degree</b> of destruction. Phillips gave a game development postmortem at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, where he advised studios to let development team members run with their ideas. Volition began to add modding support to the title and series in mid 2013.|$|E

25|$|In the Bayesian (or epistemological) interpretation, {{probability}} measures a “degree of belief.” Bayes’ theorem then {{links the}} degree of belief in a proposition before and after accounting for evidence. For example, suppose it is believed with 50% certainty that a coin is {{twice as likely to}} land heads than tails.

We also consider Low(M,Kurtz), the class of <b>degrees</b> a such <b>that</b> every element of M is a-Kurtz random. These are characterised when M is the class of Martin-Löf random, computably random, or Schnorr random reals.

25|$|Depending on its {{enabling}} legislation, a tribunal's decisions may {{be reviewed}} {{by a court}} through an appeal or a process called judicial review. The reviewing court {{may be required to}} show some deference to the tribunal if the tribunal possesses some highly specialized expertise or knowledge that the court does not have. The degree of deference will also depend on such factors as the specific wording of the legislation creating the tribunal. Tribunals whose enabling legislation contains a privative clause are entitled to a high degree of deference, although a recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9) has arguably lowered <b>that</b> <b>degree</b> of deference.|$|E
25|$|There are uncountably many {{sets that}} are not recursively enumerable, and the {{investigation}} of the Turing degrees of all sets is as central in recursion theory as {{the investigation of the}} recursively enumerable Turing degrees. Many degrees with special properties were constructed: hyperimmune-free degrees where every function computable relative to <b>that</b> <b>degree</b> is majorized by a (unrelativized) computable function; high degrees relative to which one can compute a function f which dominates every computable function g in the sense that there is a constant c depending on g such that g(x) < f(x) for all x > c; random degrees containing algorithmically random sets; 1-generic degrees of 1-generic sets; and the degrees below the halting problem of limit-recursive sets.|$|E

Its proponents vacillated whether and to <b>that</b> <b>degree</b> it should be applied against the contemporary plight. Opinions ranged from the strictly Orthodox Azriel Hildesheimer, who subjugated research to the predetermined sanctity of the texts and refused to allow it practical implication over received methods; via the Positive-Historical Zecharias Frankel, who did not deny Wissenschaft a role, but only in deference to tradition, and opposed analysis of the Pentateuch; and up to Abraham Geiger, who rejected any limitations on objective research or its application.

25|$|After the May 1 attacks, the Mexican {{government}} placed significant {{attention on}} El Mencho. In other violent {{events in the}} Mexican Drug War, the government had swiftly responded against sensationalist acts of violence. The large efforts often led to the arrests and/or deaths of drug kingpins. Peña Nieto said after the attacks that the CJNG {{was going to be}} attacked in similar fashion. CNS chief Rubido García also told reporters that the government was concentrating efforts to capture El Mencho. The reaction from the government was intensive because the attacks were unprecedented in the Mexican Drug War; before the attacks, the government had not seen <b>that</b> <b>degree</b> of aggressive responsiveness from organized crime. According to investigators, the CJNG was able to carry out the attacks because they had territorial knowledge and control, and because they were able to manage resources, logistics, and intelligence information in their favor. In addition, the CJNG was suspected of having well-trained foot soldiers, likely with former police and military training, that were useful in employing paramilitary tactics during the May 1 attacks.|$|E

500|$|During six flybys of Titan from 2006 to 2011, Cassini {{gathered}} radiometric {{tracking and}} optical navigation data from which investigators could roughly infer Titan's changing shape.

Filitti was also sent on regular missions to France, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Serbia and Italy. The missions allowed Filitti to expand his activity as a historiographer and archivist. The main stimulus of this activity was, according to Filitti's son Manole, a sense of filial duty: [...] "since destiny wished for his parents to have such assets as {{would allow him to}} study in Paris for a couple of years, [...] felt compelled to repay them by publishing works which would live up to <b>that</b> <b>degree</b> of education."

Hordern, who had heard positive things of Miller from theatrical friends, likewise thought highly of the director, and was quick to take up location filming in Norfolk that year. [...] He came to like Miller's way of working, such as having the freedom to improvise instead of adhering to the strict rules of a script; the actor wrote in his autobiography that he had never experienced <b>that</b> <b>degree</b> of professional freedom. The programme was released towards the end of 1968 and was a hit with audiences and critics. Mark Duguid of the British Film Institute called it [...] "a masterpiece of economical horror that remains every bit as chilling as the day it was first broadcast", while a journalist for The Telegraph, writing in 2010 about that year's remake starring John Hurt, reminded readers of the [...] "brilliant Sixties production by Jonathan Miller [...] Michael Hordern made a fine, crusty Parkin". The year ended with a role in Peter Hall's production of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance at the Aldwych Theatre.
