5|$|After the French {{defeat at}} Waterloo, the works' former owners sought their return. The Louvre's administrators were loath to comply and hid many works {{in their private}} collections. In response, foreign states sent emissaries to London <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help,</b> and many pieces were returned, even some that had been {{restored}} by the Louvre. In 1815 Louis XVIII finally concluded agreements with the Austrian government for the keeping of pieces such as Veronese's Wedding at Cana which was exchanged for a large Le Brun or the repurchase of the Albani collection.|$|E
5|$|Aratus took {{advantage}} of this incident, and began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis {{had been sent to}} Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was a sacrifice that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from Macedon.|$|E

Bok went to the local police {{department}} <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help,</b> and asked the police to help him find his people. Instead of helping him, the police made him their slave for two months. Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well, tying them, and leaving them behind as {{he walked into the}} crowded marketplace.|$|E

The purpose of this study about adolescents was to examine: 1) the relationship between contextual factors and awareness of signs and symptoms of cancer and barriers (including emotional barriers) <b>to</b> <b>seeking</b> medical <b>help,</b> and 2) associations between anxiety and endorsed barriers <b>to</b> <b>seeking</b> medical <b>help.</b> Interpretation of data is informed by the common sense model of the self-regulation of health and illness...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{sovereign}} debt having risen substantially {{in only a}} few eurozone countries, with the three most affected countries Greece, Ireland and Portugal collectively only accounting for 6% of the eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP), it has become a perceived problem for the area as a whole, leading to speculation of further contagion of other European countries and a possible break-up of the eurozone. In total, the debt crisis forced five out of 17 eurozone countries <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from other nations by the end of 2012.|$|E

Results indicated that generally, the students had moderate intentions of <b>seeking</b> psychological <b>help.</b> Multiple regression analysis revealed that of the three predictors, only ATSPPH and SSRPH significantly predicted intentions <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> psychological <b>help.</b> The current study is important because while it has been established that university students are a high-risk population for mental health problems, there is close to nothing documented on university students in Botswana. Findings {{of the current study}} will undoubtedly increase knowledge relating to psychological help-seeking and its predictors in Botswana and may inform interventions that aim to encourage young people <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> psychological or counseling help...|$|R

Meanwhile, Dwight, Jim, and Harry rush to the company in an attempt to win the client, only to hear that the company has gone with Andy. After Andy wins the client, he calls Robert and offers him the client if Robert will re-hire him. Robert is furious at his attempt to blackmail him, and hangs up on Andy. This leads Andy <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from David Wallace (Andy Buckley), the former Chief Financial Officer of Dunder Mifflin who has become a multi-millionaire. Andy tells David that, despite being in poor shape, Dunder Mifflin could be worth twice its net worth if the company's management is restructured.

Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded {{the last of his}} shore party and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.|$|E

The following morning, and with Romney fast breaking up, Colvill supervised the construction and launching {{of a number of}} rafts. As the final raft was being launched, seven boats approached from shore. On reaching Romney, the Dutch commander of the boats called on Colvill to surrender, promising that he would endeavour to save the British sailors. Colvill agreed and the Dutch rescued the remaining members of the crew. The total loss of life in the wreck was between nine and eleven men.|$|E
5|$|ZANLA {{had planned}} for four attacks {{to take place}} {{simultaneously}} but in the event only Nhongo's men did so. According to historian Elaine Windrich, Nhongo was a former employee of the tobacco farm's 37-year-old owner, Marc de Borchgrave, and held a grudge against him. The cadres shot up the farm house with AK-47 assault rifles and threw grenades through the windows, then retreated and hid amongst the local population. Nobody {{was killed in the}} attack but the farmer's eight-year-old daughter, Jane, was wounded in the foot. The isolated house had no telephone or any other means of contacting neighbours, and de Borchgrave was wary of being ambushed should he drive his car out, so after a short time comforting the children he set out across country on foot <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> and alert the authorities. This done, he returned and took his wife and children to another farm nearby, Whistlefield, which was owned by Archie Dalgluish and his family.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Serbs and Bosniaks in the Battle of Kosovo on 15 June 1389, Ivan Shishman had <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from Hungary. During the winter of 1391–1392, he entered into secret {{negotiations}} with the King of Hungary Sigismund, who was planning a campaign against the Turks. The new Ottoman sultan Bayezid I pretended to have peaceful intentions in order to cut off Ivan Shishman from his alliance with the Hungarians. However, in the spring of 1393 Bayezid gathered a large army from his dominions in the Balkans and Asia Minor and attacked Bulgaria. The Ottomans marched to the capital Tarnovo and besieged it. The defence of the capital was led by Patriarch Evtimiy because Ivan Shishman was located in Nikopol, presumably for better communication with Sigismund. After a three-month siege, Tarnovo fell on 17 July. According to the contemporary Bulgarian scholar and cleric Gregory Tsamblak, the city was not captured because of the Ottoman military strength but due to treason. The Ottoman campaign of 1393 devastated Bulgaria; in the wake of that invasion, the lands of Ivan Shishman were limited to Nikopol and several towns along the Danube. Upon his return from Wallachia after the Battle of Rovine in 1395, Bayezid I attacked and captured Nikopol and, according to the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle, murdered Ivan Shishman on 3 June 1395. A Byzantine chronicle gives the date as 29 October. However, some sources suggest that the Bulgarian ruler was captured and died in prison.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Greek advance, the fortresses of Bizani and Kastritsa were cut off by 16h and isolated {{from the rest of the}} Ottoman army and its headquarters in Ioannina. As night fell, the forts ceased firing, and their garrisons abandoned them, trying to cut through the rather loose Greek encirclement to Ioannina. In their attempt to withdraw towards Ioannina, a significant number of Ottoman troops, totaling 35 officers and 935 soldiers, were captured by the Greek units positioned on the city's southern outskirts. Several Ottoman positions capitulated the next morning, although Bizani and Kastritsa continued to resist until after the surrender. Meanwhile, Esat Pasha realized that the battle was lost, and tried to evacuate as many troops and wounded as he could to the north. As the Greeks pressed their advance however, he contacted the city's foreign consulates <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> in negotiating a surrender. At 23:00 on , he agreed upon the unconditional surrender of Ioannina and the Ottoman garrison to the Greeks. The following day the Greek forces under Crown Prince Constantine were parading through the flag-covered streets of the city. On the other hand, Esat Pasha upon arriving in Turkey was welcomed as a national hero.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1960, in {{response}} to requests by Prime Minister Lumumba, the UN Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 143. This called upon Belgium to remove its troops and for the UN to provide 'military assistance' to the Congolese forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from the Soviet Union {{if they did not}} leave within two days. The UN reacted quickly and established the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's mandate. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba wanted to use the UN troops to subdue Katanga by force. Referring to the resolution, Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, 'From these texts it is clear that, contrary to your personal interpretation, the UN force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.' Secretary General Hammarskjöld refused. To Hammarskjöld, the secession of Katanga was an internal Congolese matter and the UN was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. Disagreements over what the UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} 1911, where former outlaw John Marston (Rob Wiethoff) {{is taken from}} his family by the Bureau of Investigation, and will only be granted amnesty when he brings the {{remaining}} members of his old gang to justice. Marston sets off to track down Bill Williamson (Steve J. Palmer), who now runs his own gang. Marston confronts Williamson at his stronghold, Fort Mercer, only to be shot and left for dead. Local rancher Bonnie MacFarlane (Kimberly Irion) finds him critically wounded and takes him to her ranch for recovery. Several days later, Marston begins repaying the MacFarlanes for their help {{in the form of}} odd-jobs around the ranch. During this time he works with U.S. Marshal Leigh Johnson (Anthony De Longis) and his deputies, con artist Nigel West Dickens (Don Creech), treasure hunter and grave robber Seth Briars (Kevin Glikmann), and an unreliable alcoholic arms dealer known only as Irish (K. Harrison Sweeney). Marston performs various tasks and favours in exchange for their help with organizing an attack on Fort Mercer. Marston and his group then breach the fort and defeat Williamson's gang only to find that Williamson had fled to Mexico <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>help</b> from Javier Escuella (Antonio Jaramillo), another member of Marston's former gang.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To assess {{depression}} recognition, {{barriers to}} accessing help from health professionals and {{potential sources of}} help for depression among rural adolescents. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Two rural secondary schools in south-east South Australia. Participants: Seventy-four secondary school students aged 14 to 16 years. Main outcome measure(s) : Depression recognition was measured using a depression vignette. Helpfulness of professionals, barriers <b>to</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>help</b> and help-seeking behaviours for depression were assessed by self-report questionnaire. Results: Depression was identified in the vignette by 73 % (n = 54) of participants. Participants indicated {{that it would be}} more helpful for the vignette character to see other health professionals (98. 6 %, 95 % CI, 92. 0 - 100. 0 %) than a doctor (82. 4 %, 72. 1 - 89. 6 %). arriers <b>to</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>help</b> from doctors and other health professionals were categorised into logistical and personal barriers. Participants agreed more strongly to personal (mean = 86) than logistical barriers (mean = 2. 67, P. < 0. 05) for seeing a doctor. Boys and girls responded differently overall, and to personal barriers to seeing an other health professional. Sources of help were divided into three categories: formal, informal and external. Informal sources of help (mean = 4. 02) were identified as more helpful than both formal (mean = 3. 66) and external sources (mean = 3. 72, P < 0. 001). Gender differences were observed within and between the three sources of help categories. Conclusions: Recognising symptoms of depression was demonstrated in this study. Helpfulness of professionals, barriers <b>to</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>help</b> and potential sources of help for depression were identified. More work is required for improving depression literacy and providing effective interventions specifically for rural adolescents. © 2010 The Authors.
