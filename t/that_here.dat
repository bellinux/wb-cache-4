5|$|Historians have remarked <b>that</b> <b>here</b> Darwin {{anticipated}} the modern {{concept of an}} ecological niche. He did not suggest that every favourable variation must be selected, nor that the favoured animals were better or higher, but merely more adapted to their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|It's not my {{responsibility}} to draw (the audience) in, I just {{have to play the}} character. The way I would perform songs was always about the lyrics and always about trying to speak to everybody and make them watch and believe what I'm saying and I suppose I'm essentially doing <b>that</b> <b>here</b> but I'm not looking at the audience I'm obviously looking at the other actors.|$|E
5|$|An ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no {{pleasant}} {{assemblage of}} shelves, and pools, and creeks, about which a child might {{play for a}} whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No other life was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, <b>that</b> <b>here</b> ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself.|$|E

'I {{tell you}} what it is,' said the hangman, gravely; 'I'm afraid, my friend, that you're not in <b>that</b> <b>'ere</b> state of mind that's {{suitable}} to your condition, then; you're not a-going to be released: don't think it--Will you leave off <b>that</b> <b>'ere</b> indecent row? I wonder you an't ashamed of yourselves, I do.' ...|$|R

25|$|In 1985, the President's Commission on Organized Crime claimed <b>that</b> <b>HERE</b> {{was one of}} {{the four}} most corrupt unions in the United States. Hanley denounced the allegation.|$|E
25|$|Al-Idirisi (1100-1165/1166) testifies {{that until}} {{as late as}} the 12th century, a {{contract}} of investiture for every Hindu Shahi king was performed at Kabul and <b>that</b> <b>here</b> he was obliged to agree to certain ancient conditions which completed the contract.|$|E
25|$|Days 9 through 13 are dedications to five yazatas of the litanies (Niyayeshes): Fire (Atar), Water (Apo), Sun (Hvar), Moon (Mah), {{the star}} Sirius (Tištrya) <b>that</b> <b>here</b> perhaps {{represents}} the firmament in its entirety. Day 14 {{is dedicated to}} the soul of the Ox (Geush Urvan), linked with and representing all animal creation.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, I know,' said Sam; 'them as {{hangs up}} in the linen-drapers' shops, with beggars' {{petitions}} and all <b>that</b> <b>'ere</b> upon 'em?' ...|$|R

'If I don't get {{no better}} light than <b>that</b> <b>'ere</b> moonshine o' yourn, my worthy creetur,' said the elder Mr. Weller, 'it's wery likely as I shall continey to be a night coach till I'm {{took off the}} road altogether. Now, Mrs. We, if the piebald stands at livery much longer, he'll stand at nothin' as we go back, and p'raps <b>that</b> <b>'ere</b> harm-cheer 'ull be tipped over into some hedge or another, with the {{shepherd}} in it.' ...|$|R
25|$|Note that, {{contrary}} to the rules for proceeding along the reduction tree presented above, the following rules are for moving in the opposite directions, from axioms to theorems. Thus they are exact mirror-images of the rules above, except <b>that</b> <b>here</b> symmetry is not implicitly assumed, and rules regarding quantification are added.|$|E
25|$|While {{glucokinase}} {{has been}} shown to occur in certain cells (enterocytes) of the small intestine and stomach, its function and regulation have not been worked out. It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>here,</b> also, glucokinase serves as a glucose sensor, allowing these cells to provide one of the earliest metabolic responses to incoming carbohydrates. It is suspected that these cells are involved in incretin functions.|$|E
25|$|In some respects, Thabit is {{critical}} of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, particularly regarding motion. It would seem <b>that</b> <b>here</b> his ideas are based on an acceptance of using arguments concerning motion in his geometrical arguments. Another important contribution Thabit made to geometry was his generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, which he extended from special right triangles to all triangles in general, along with a general proof.|$|E

25|$|An {{estimator}} can be unbiased but not consistent. For example, for an iid sample {x,..., x} {{one can use}} T(X) = x as the estimator of {{the mean}} E. Note <b>that</b> <b>here</b> the sampling distribution of T {{is the same as}} the underlying distribution (for any n, as it ignores all points but the first), so E = E and it is unbiased, but it does not converge to any value.|$|E
25|$|I will, however, {{tell you}} {{just one thing}} about the war, my first story and my last. I was asked by some American friends to search out the grave of their son near Bastogne. I found it where they told me I would, but it was among 27,000 others, and I told myself <b>that</b> <b>here,</b> Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should keep your mouth shut after the war.|$|E
25|$|Urbs antiqua fuit—there was {{an ancient}} city which, 'tis said, Juno loved {{above all the}} lands. And it was the goddess's aim and {{cherished}} hope <b>that</b> <b>here</b> should be the capital of all nations—should the fates perchance allow that. Yet in truth she discovered that a race was springing from Trojan blood to overthrow some day these Tyrian towers—a people late regem belloque superbum—kings of broad realms and proud in war who would come forth for Libya's downfall.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This action, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'is {{expected}} to come on, on the fourteenth of next month.' 'Remarkable coincidence <b>that</b> <b>'ere,</b> sir,' replied Sam.|$|R

25|$|The Revd R. W. Enraght of Portslade {{has given}} notice of his {{intentions}} {{to hold a}} “Retreat”-our readers will not have forgotten what sort of things these “retreats” are - at Lancing College in August next. The rev. gentleman’s name appears in the roll of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament for 1872, so <b>that</b> <b>here</b> we get another peep into the interior economy of those notorious “Woodard Schools”, of which Lancing College is the headquarters.|$|E
25|$|The House by the Churchyard (1863), {{the last}} of Le Fanu's novels to be set in the past and, as {{mentioned}} above, the last with an Irish setting. It is noteworthy <b>that</b> <b>here</b> Le Fanu's historical style is blended with his later Gothic style, influenced by his reading of the classic writers of that genre, such as Ann Radcliffe. This novel, later cited by James Joyce in Finnegans Wake, is set in Chapelizod, where Le Fanu lived in his youth.|$|E
25|$|In Sydney Mason {{worked for}} the Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis. He had a success in winning first and second prizes for a new Mechanics' Institute, {{submitting}} Gothic and Classical designs, {{a sign of the}} rising competition between these styles. He built wheat silos on Cockatoo Island, a task requiring engineering ingenuity. It seems <b>that</b> <b>here</b> he acquired his acquaintance with verandas. A new Government House was then under construction which had been designed by Edward Blore while Mason had still been on his staff in 1835. He may have worked on the drawings.|$|E

25|$|After foraging, pharaoh ants will wash {{themselves}} when a worker enters the cell. Pharaoh ants will also wash {{after a long}} feed. It has been proposed that washing has a hygienic value, keeping the nest area clean, staving off disease and disorder. Right before workers leave to forage, they also may wash themselves. However, in this instance the behavior is extremely violent, often causing the ants to fall over. It is thought <b>that</b> <b>here,</b> the washing behavior has no hygienic value and instead may be a displacement activity, {{a sign that the}} ants are deliberating whether or not to exit the nest.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{capitalist}} system thus {{appears as a}} hierarchical structure of different levels of productivity, and as {{the outcome of the}} uneven and combined development of states, regions, branches of industry and firms, unleashed by the quest for surplus-profit. It forms an integrated unity, but it is an integrated unity of non-homogeneous parts, and it is precisely the unity <b>that</b> <b>here</b> determines the lack of homogeneity. In this whole system development and underdevelopment reciprocally determine each other, for while the quest for surplus-profits constitutes the prime motive power behind the mechanisms of growth, surplus-profit can only be achieved at the expense of less productive regions and branches of production.|$|E
25|$|A {{separate}} monument {{features a}} tablet with the French inscription Passant... va dire à la Belgique et à la France qu'ici 550 belges se sont sacrifiés pour la défense de la liberté et le salut du monde ("Passer by... go say to Belgium and France <b>that</b> <b>here</b> 550 Belgians sacrificed {{themselves for the}} defense of freedom and the salvation of the world"), attributed to the French general Malleterre, based on the epitaph by Simonides for the Spartan dead at the Battle of Thermopylae. A number of other commemorative monuments were placed at the site, including the flamme du souvenir, a figure of a man thrusting a torch from under the earth.|$|E
