40|$|Background and Aims: The {{resurgence}} of malaria, {{particularly in the}} developing world, is considerable and exacerbated {{by the development of}} single-gene multi-drug resistances to chemicals such as chloroquinone. Drug therapies, as recommended by the World Health Organization, now include the use of antimalarial compounds derived from Artemisia annua – in particular, the use of artemisinin-based ingredients. Despite our limited knowledge of its mode of action or biosynthesis {{there is a need to}} secure a supply and enhance yields of artemisinin. The present study aims <b>to</b> determine how <b>plant</b> biomass can be enhanced while maximizing artemisinin concentration by understanding the plant’s nutritional requirements for nitrogen and potassium. Methods: Experiments were carried out, the first with differing concentrations of nitrogen, at 6, 31, 56, 106, 206 or 306 mg L 21 being applied, while the other differing in potassium concentration (51, 153 or 301 mg L 21). Nutrients were supplied <b>in</b> irrigation water <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> and after a growth period biomass production and leaf artemisinin concentration were measured. These data were used to determine optimal nutrient requirements for artemisinin yield. Key Results: Nitrogen nutrition enhanced plant nitrogen concentration and biomass production successively up to 106 mg N L 21 for biomass and 206 mg N L 21 for leaf nitrogen; further increases in nitrogen had no influence. Artemisinin concentration in dried leaf material, measured by HPLC mass spectroscopy, was maximal at a nitrogen application of 106 mg L 21, but declined at higher concentrations. Increasing potassium application from 51 to 153 mg L 21 increased total plant biomass, but not at higher applications. Potassium application enhanced leaf potassium concentration, but there was no effect on leaf artemisinin concentration or leaf artemisinin yield. Conclusions: Artemisinin concentration declined beyond an optimal point with increasing plant nitrogen concentration. Maximization of artemisinin yield (amount per plant) requires optimization of plant biomass via control of nitrogen nutrition...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Civil Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2003 South Africa is {{experiencing}} great movements {{of people from}} rural areas to towns {{mainly because of the}} need to find work. Accommodation is limited and expensive, forcing many to live in informal homes. The municipalities, in an attempt to accommodate as much as they can, provide small plots, which basically can only accommodate a house and a very small garden. This country like other countries of the world has also embarked on numerous low-cost housing schemes to accommodate the homeless. Because of economic realities and because high-rise options are not considered acceptable, the most practical solution has resulted in large-scale low-density urban and suburban housing developments. Low-pitched metal-sheet roofs are provided because they are the most cost-effective. Lack of space within the homes and tiny surround-gardens are major problems to residents seriously limiting lifestyle. Other problems associated with these developments concern environmentally intrusive effects, the need for better security and other social concerns, and storm water runoff. This thesis discusses a usable flat urban and suburban roofing for existing and new houses by means of a system known as 'C-beam'. A usable greened concrete flat roof replaces the traditional pitched metal-sheet. The new roof provides sitting space for family members and is used <b>to</b> grow <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> <b>pots.</b> A construction manual is to be developed by which the constructors will build the roofing without the use of cranes and other expensive sophisticated construction machinery. The house owner can construct their own flooring/roofing; that is, the process will provide additional jobs, and hence positively affect economy. The manual includes the means of effective control by municipal authorities to ensure adequate and safe standards. Greening of the roofs will not only provide the potential for growing food from the plants, but it will also improve the environment of the area, including the reduction of storm water run-off, by retaining some water in the soil on rooftops...|$|R

Sixty-eight endophyte isolates were co-cultivated with N. benthamiana seedlings on either damp filter paper or on agar medium before being subjected to water deprivation. Seventeen isolates were selected for further testing under water deprivation conditions in a sand-based test in a glasshouse. Only two fungal isolates, Cladosporium cladosporioides (E- 162) and an unknown fungus (E- 284), significantly enhanced seedling tolerance to moisture deprivation consistently in both in vitro and sand-based tests. Although a strongly significant correlation was observed between any two screening methods, the result of filter paper test was more strongly reflected (r = 0. 757, p < 0. 001) in results of the glasshouse test, indicating its relative suitability over the agar-based test.

40|$|In {{enclosed}} environments {{such as a}} {{plant growth}} chamber, thermal radiation {{plays an important role}} in determining heat balance and therefore the resultant temperature regimes. In artificially illuminated chambers, a significant level of thermal radiation is emitted from the lamps and/or the lamp house surface. Though there are both shortwave and longwave components in thermal radiation, our measurements in two different chamber designs, with and without thermal radiation filters, showed the longwave component being 2 - 3 times larger than the shortwave one. The increased thermal radiation, in particular the longwave component, caused differences in the temperatures of the plant and soil compared to that of the air. The differences were greater with increasing exposure to thermal radiation. Because of greater exposure to thermal radiation, both plant and soil temperatures were higher than the air temperature when <b>plants</b> were grown <b>in</b> isolated <b>pots</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> mutually shaded <b>pots</b> arranged <b>in</b> a block. In field-use chambers under natural light conditions, the longwave component of thermal radiation is modified to a large extent by the transmittance of the cover film. The temperature gradient chamber used in this study was covered with PVC film having low transmittance to longwave radiation and it showed a greater soil temperature relative to the air temperature when compared to a chamber covered with polyethylene film having high transmittance. As a result, across the two chambers and outdoors, the rice plant responses were correlated to the soil temperatures but not to the air temperatures...|$|R

Paclobutrazol, a chemical growth retardation compound, is often used <b>to</b> dwarf <b>plant</b> <b>in</b> producing <b>potted</b> lilies. However, <b>in</b> recent years, the plants with inherited dwarf traits by using genetic engineer breeding technology are being developed. The studies on molecular basis of lily dwarfism will offer some target genes which have profound dwarf effect for genetic engineer breeding. Here, we confirmed that paclobutrazol inhibited plant height and leaf size in Lilium Longiflorum-Asiatic hybrid, and then RNA-Seq technique was employed to analyze gene transcripts of Lilium Longiflorum-Asiatic hybrid leaves by paclobutrazol treatment {{in order to get}} a deeper insight into dwarfism mechanism of lily. Approximately 38. 6 Gb data was obtained and assemble into 53, 681 unigenes. Annotation, pathways, functional classification and phylogenetic classification of these data were analyzed based on Nr, Nt, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG and GO databases. 2, 704 differentially expressed genes were screened by comparing paclobutrazol-treated samples with untreated samples and quantitative real-time PCR was performed to validate expression profiles.

40|$|The {{cover crop}} Vicia villosa {{suppresses}} Fusarium wilt of watermelon but {{the mechanisms of}} disease suppression are unknown. Possible mechanisms were examined in field, greenhouse, and in vitro experiments. The effects of cover crop treatments (V. villosa, Trifolium incarnatum, Secale cereale, Brassica juncea) and the biocontrol treatment Actinovate (Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 108) on Fusarium wilt of watermelon and its causal pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON) were evaluated. In four of five field experiments there were significant elevations in soil microbial respiration. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of watermelon roots following cover crop amendments of V. villosa and T. incarnatum, were significantly higher compared to bare ground. The elevation in respiration was significantly positively correlated with disease suppression of Fusarium wilt induced by V. villosa and T. incarnatum (both cover crops reduced Fusarium wilt as much as 21 %). In greenhouse experiments using infested field soil, Fusarium wilt suppression was observed <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> amended with V. villosa and T. incarnatum. However, {{there was an increase}} in Fusarium wilt of watermelon <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> that were amended with V. villosa and T. incarnatum which were also inoculated with FON when compared <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> nonamended, inoculated <b>pots.</b> These leguminous cover crops may have served as a nutrient source for the pathogen. In addition, in vitro growth experiments showed that media amended with V. villosa leachate significantly stimulated the in vitro growth rates of FON and Trichoderma harzianum compared to nonamended plates. It was hypothesized that V. villosa stimulation of nonpathogenic F. oxysporum spp., which provides cross protection against FON, {{may have contributed to the}} wilt suppression. Cover crop leachate amendments did not significantly influence colony forming units of S. lydicus. In both field and greenhouse trials Actinovate applications either had little or no effect on Fusarium wilt of watermelon. However, S. lydicus significantly inhibited in vitro growth of FON. These studies demonstrate that both general and specific disease suppression play a role in V. villosa suppression of Fusarium wilt of watermelon and that T. incarnatum is a viable alternative biocontrol...|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1967. Bibliography: leaves [105]- 110. viii, 110 l illus., tablesField {{screening}} {{trials in}} Hawaii showed ametryne (2 -methylmercapto- 4 - ethylamino- 6 -isopropylamino-s-triazine) to be a potentially important herbicide for bananas. Ametryne exhibited more effective weed control than atrazine (2 -chloro- 4 -ethylamino- 6 -isopropylamino-s-triazine). Furthermore, atrazine caused injury to bananas in 2 of 3 locations used. Investigations {{were conducted to}} explain the differential selectivity of the 2 closely related s-triazine herbicides to bananas. Sand culture experiments-showed that both herbicides at concentrations of 0. 4, 4, and 16 ppm in 2 liters of nutrient solution injured the <b>plants.</b> <b>Plants</b> grown <b>in</b> <b>pots</b> containing soils from the experimental fields showed increasing phytotoxicity to the herbicides in the fo 1 lowing order: Poamoho soil, Waimanalo soil, and Kauai soil. Ametryne was less injurious than atrazine but differences were not as pronounced as that under field conditions where ametryne did not exhibit phytotoxicity. Phytotoxicity was directly related to leachability of the herbicides and negatively related to adsorption capacity of each soil for the herbicides. Organic matter content seemed to partly explain the response observed. Selectivity appeared to be largely attributed to differential position of roots of banana <b>plants</b> <b>in</b> relation <b>to</b> herbicide placement rather than to inherent selectivity. Apparently, atrazine being less adsorbed by soil and more readily leached, moved to a greater depth upon receipt of a given amount of water resulting in crop injury. Laboratory studies confirmed results of greenhouse experiments that absorption, translocation and degradation of the herbicides by the plants did {{not account for the}} selectivity observed. Both of the herbicides were partly metabolized by the <b>plants</b> <b>to</b> their common hydroxy derivative and 2 other unidentified metabolites after 3 and 7 days of exposure to nutrient solutions containing C 14 -labelled ametryne and atrazine. When applied to the leaves with a surfactant the herbicides were absorbed and translocated in an acropetal direction to a very limited extent. Higher leaf content of free ammonia, free nitrate, and non-protein nitrogen, and lower chlorophyll content, were associated with plants receiving phytotoxic concentrations of ametryne and atrazine after 1 and 4 weeks from treatment. It appears that phytotoxic concentrations of these herbicides resulted in disturbance of the incorporation of nitrogen into more complex nitrogen containing plant constituents as proteins. In these experiments atrazine at 2 and 10 lb/A and ametryne at 10 lb/A applied to soil were phytotoxic <b>to</b> banana <b>plants</b> grown <b>in</b> <b>pots.</b> Ametryne at 2 lb/A did not injure the plants...|$|R
