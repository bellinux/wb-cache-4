5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebuilding}} and remodelling {{occurred in the}} late Middle Ages. A chantry chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was founded in 1271 by the merchants Thomas Blount and John de Bucham, who endowed it with lands around Old and New Sleaford, and several surrounding villages. The chapel {{is located on the}} north aisle, and the chaplain was instructed to pray there for the founders at his daily mass. The chantry priest's house is recorded in the 1440s as one of the oldest buildings in Sleaford; located in the churchyard, it became the Vicarage. The tower was probably accompanied by a nave of a similar date, which was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style in the mid to late 14th century; the transept followed <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> years later, according to Trollope. A clerestory was added in around 1430 and the chancel was remodelled at this time.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the more}} grandiose Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments found {{elsewhere}} in Scotland, the recumbent stone circles of Aberdeenshire {{do not appear}} to have been intended to overshadow or overawe other more modest works. Even considering their geographical clustering, they are also well-spread out. Clive Ruggles and Aubrey Burl suggest that this indicates that they were constructed to serve as local ritual centres for groups of subsistence farmers each inhabiting territories of about , living on an egalitarian basis without powerful leaders and possibly numbering no more than about <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> people per group.|$|E

25|$|Murphy, then {{faced with}} the {{charging}} gang members, raised the rifle toward them and took aim. Gang member W. H. Jackson pointed his revolver at Tanner, who testified that Jackson was “possibly <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> feet” away. Tanner was unarmed and could do nothing. Jackson probably noticed Murphy was aiming his now-dead boss' rifle in his direction. This, coupled with the fast-approaching men from the Citizen's Committee, who prematurely ended their meeting {{with the sound of}} gun fire, perhaps convinced Jackson not fire his pistol at Tanner. Someone yelled out towards the men who were with Smith, “They have killed Soapy, and if you don’t clear out quick they will kill you too.” Not wanting to engage in a gun battle in which they were vastly outnumbered, the gang fled.|$|E
25|$|The Guaraní, the Cario, Tapé, Itatine, Guarajo, Tupí, {{and related}} subgroups, were generous people who {{inhabited}} an immense area {{stretching from the}} Guyana Highlands in Brazil to the Río Uruguay. The Guaraní were surrounded by hostile tribes, and were frequently at war. They believed that permanent wives were inappropriate for warriors, so their marital relations were loose. Some tribes practiced polygamy intended {{to increase the number}} of children. Chiefs often had <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> concubines, whom they shared freely with visitors, yet they treated their wives well. At the same time, they often punished adulterers with death. Like the area's other tribes, the Guaraní were cannibals. As part of a war ritual, they ate their most valiant foes captured in battle in the hope that they would gain the bravery and power of their victims. The Guaraní accepted the arrival of Spaniards and looked to them for protection against fiercer neighboring tribes. The Guaraní also hoped the Spaniards would lead them against the Incas.|$|E
25|$|There were 15 guests (at Poutrincourt's table), {{each of whom}} in his turn, became steward and caterer of the day. At the dinner, the steward, with napkin on shoulder, {{staff of}} office in hand, and the collar of the order round his neck, led the van. The other guests in {{procession}} followed, each bearing a dish. After grace in the evening, he resigned the insignia to his successor, and they drank {{to each other in}} a cup of wine. It was the steward's duty, to look to supplies, and he would go hunt or fish a day or two before his turn came, and add some dainty to the ordinary fare. During the winter they had fowl and game in abundance, supplied by the Indians and by their own exertions. These feasts were often attended by Indians of all ages and both sexes, sometimes <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> being present. The Sagamore, or chief, Membertou, the greatest Sagamore of the land, and other chiefs, when there, were treated as guests and equals.|$|E

500|$|According to the Regnal List, Ceol was {{a son of}} Cutha, who was a son of Cynric; and Ceolwulf, his brother, reigned for {{seventeen}} years after him. [...] It {{is possible that some}} fragmentation of control among the West Saxons occurred at Ceawlin's death: Ceol and Ceolwulf may have been based in Wiltshire, as opposed to the upper Thames valley. [...] This split also may have contributed to Æthelberht's ability to rise to dominance in southern England. [...] The West Saxons remained influential in military terms, however: the Chronicle and Bede record continued military activity against Essex and Sussex within <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> years of Ceawlin's death.|$|E
500|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater (Caligavis chrysops) is a medium-small {{bird in the}} honeyeater family, Meliphagidae. [...] It takes {{both its}} common name and {{scientific}} name from the distinctive yellow stripes {{on the sides of}} its head. Its loud clear call often begins <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and south eastern Australia, in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and woodlands along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants such as Banksia and Grevillea, and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as gleaning them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.|$|E

5000|$|On June 9, {{the trial}} {{came to a}} {{standstill}} after three jurors were dismissed by the judge for violating their orders to not talk about news reports regarding the trial: [...] "Juror No. 872", a white woman in her <b>twenties</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirties</b> with three children; [...] "Juror No. 412", a white woman in her <b>twenties</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirties</b> who is employed with a mental health company; and [...] "Juror No. 495", a white woman {{in her late twenties}} to early thirties. Juror No. 872 had begun discussions about sensitive details of the case with the other two jurors outside of the court on at least two occasions. Two days later, Holmes's attorneys requested the dismissal of a fourth juror after her brother-in-law was shot during a robbery the previous day, and other jurors had seen her crying. Judge Carlos Samour responded that he would consider it, and agreed to the motion by dismissing her on June 15. On June 17, a fifth juror was dismissed after Judge Samour was advised that she personally knew a wounded victim of the shooting.|$|R

500|$|Baxter {{notes that}} Barry Lyndon was the film which made Kubrick notorious for paying scrupulous {{attention}} to detail, often demanding <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> retakes {{of the same}} scene to perfect his art. Often considered to be his most authentic-looking picture, [...] the cinematography and lighting techniques that Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott used in Barry Lyndon were highly innovative. Most notably, interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7 Zeiss camera lens originally developed for NASA {{to be used in}} satellite photography. The lenses allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional, diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings. Cinematographer Allen Daviau states that the method gives the audience a way of seeing the characters and scenes as they would have been seen by people at the time. Many of the fight scenes were shot with a hand-held camera to produce a [...] "sense of documentary realism and immediacy".|$|E
500|$|By the First World War, {{music hall}} {{entertainment}} {{had fallen out}} of favour with audiences. Theatrical historians blame the music hall's decline on the increasing salaries of performers and the halls' inability to present profitably the <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> acts that the audiences expected to see. [...] Revue appealed to wartime audiences, and Robey decided to capitalise on the medium's popularity. Stoll offered Robey a lucrative contract in 1916 to appear in the new revue The Bing Boys Are Here at the Alhambra Theatre, London. Dividing his time between three or four music halls a night had become unappealing to the comedian, and he relished the opportunity to appear in a single theatre. He was cast as Lucius Bing opposite Violet Loraine, who played his love interest Emma, and the couple duetted in the show's signature song [...] "If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)", which became an international success.|$|E
500|$|More than a {{thousand}} young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying [...] "she had her head down, she was reading out of the script... she didn't present herself all that well. But {{there was something about}} the way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." [...] Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but kept coming back to Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E

500|$|Mating {{takes place}} at {{different}} times of the year {{in different parts of the}} manta's range. Courtship is difficult to observe in this fast-swimming fish, although mating [...] "trains" [...] with multiple individuals swimming closely behind each other are sometimes seen in shallow water. The mating sequence may be triggered by a full moon and seems to be initiated by a male following closely behind a female while she travels at around [...] per hour. He makes repeated efforts to grasp her pectoral fin with his mouth, which may take <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> minutes. Once he has a tight grip, he turns upside-down and presses his ventral side against hers. He then inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca where they remain for sixty to ninety seconds. The clasper forms a tube which channels sperm from the genital papilla; a siphon propels the seminal fluid into the oviduct. The male continues to grip the female's pectoral fin with his teeth for a further few minutes as both continue to swim, often followed by up to twenty other males. The pair then part. For some reason the male almost always grasps the left pectoral fin, and females often have scars that illustrate this.|$|E
500|$|In {{the face}} of the rock, south from the town, is the famous stone, known by the name of the mistress-stone; it resembles a door exactly; and is in the very front of this rock, which is <b>twenty</b> <b>or</b> <b>thirty</b> fathom [...] {{perpendicular}} in height, the figure of it being discernible about the distance of a mile; upon the lintel of this door, every bachelor-wooer is by an ancient custom obliged in honour to give a specimen of his affection for the love of his mistress, and it is thus; he is to stand on his left foot, having the one half of his sole over the rock, and then he draws the right foot further out to the left, and in this posture bowing, he puts both his fists further out to the right foot; and then after he has performed this, he has acquired no small reputation, being always after it accounted worthy of the finest mistress in the world: they firmly believe that this achievement is always attended with the desired success.This being the custom of the place, one of the inhabitants very gravely desired me to let him know the time limited by me for trying of this piece of gallantry before I design’d to leave the place, that he might attend me; I told him this performance would have a quite contrary effect upon me, by robbing me both of my life and mistress at the same moment.|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to growing crime, the British government began to issue harsh punishments such as public hangings or exile.
