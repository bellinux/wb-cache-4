25|$|In the New Testament, Jesus {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of Christians forgiving or showing mercy towards others. Jesus used the parable of the unmerciful servant (Matthew 18:21-35) <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should forgive without limits. Parable of the Prodigal Son is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God's forgiveness for his people.|$|E
25|$|Since {{we started}} from an {{arbitrary}} partition {{and ended up}} {{as close as we}} wanted to either zero or one, it is false <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are eventually trapped near some number , so this function is not Riemann integrable. However, it is Lebesgue integrable. In the Lebesgue sense its integral is zero, since the function is zero almost everywhere. But this is a fact that is {{beyond the reach of the}} Riemann integral.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, we have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, {{for it is}} things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame {{and that is a}} dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

It was not possible. We would have evidently been under the authority of Cardinal Ratzinger, President of the Roman Commission, which would have directed us; we were putting ourselves into his hands, and consequently putting ourselves into the hands of those who wish to draw us into the spirit of the Council and the spirit of Assisi. This was simply not possible." ...|$|E

Mills said that her father once threw her brother against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons. The window broke and her brother had to be taken to hospital, where their father {{explained}} that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: [...] "Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I'm not ashamed <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were forced to steal because when you are a young child, you'd rather do that than face a beating from your father".

"SIR:– Among {{the members}} of the Legislature of West Virginia there is a general desire to express to you in some formal way their {{appreciation}} of the great zeal, ability and untiring industry that have marked your course in the Legislature this session.

In the performance of these duties you have been so zealous, industrious, painstaking and conservative as to attract the attention and win the respect and confidence of the entire legislature and to deserve thanks and gratitude not only of your fellow members but of the people of the state at large. Permit us, therefore, to tender to you some expression of our appreciation of the benefit of the State derived from your earnest labors <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all feel that you have fully deserved not only our commendation but a right to the gratitude and respect of your fellow citizens throughout the State of West Virginia." ...|$|E
500|$|Quantico was {{designed}} with over a half-dozen core characters, {{in addition to}} Alex Parrish, for pacing reasons. It was intended to have a flashback narrative, shifting between [...] "the present day with Parrish navigating her way through a class of FBI New Agent Trainees to the near future as the truth and repercussions of the attack emerge". Safran also used flashforwards to spread out the series' plot points. He said in a 2015 interview that although the series is [...] "intricately plotted", it {{does not intend to}} overwhelm the viewer, saying: [...] "It is tightly structured and moves quickly between two, sometimes three, time periods, but we made sure that it's not so complicated that it just feels like too much. I like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a lot of tributaries, but they all lead to one ocean". The series' diverse cast has helped its writers create a variety of storylines and plot points. According to a Variety article on Safran and Quantico, [...] "The show delves below the surface into those disparate backgrounds to explore how each character’s personal stories influence their motivations for joining the FBI and in their perspective on the search for truth in the terrorism investigation. That offers a wealth of engaging material for writers to mine". Safran modeled Quantico on Buffy the Vampire Slayer in structure, with self-contained story arcs from season to season. Its producers said that each season would have a specific storyline, with Alex the series' focal point surrounded by a new cast.|$|E
