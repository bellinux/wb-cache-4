5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth differ from <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> tooth-based taxa.|$|E

5|$|The paws of the cheetah are {{narrower}} than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> felids. The slightly curved claws lack {{a protective}} sheath and are weakly retractable (semi-retractable). This {{is a major}} point of difference between the cheetah and the big cats, which have fully retractable claws, and a similarity to canids. Additionally, the claws of the cheetah are shorter as well as straighter than <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> cats. Absence of protection makes the claws blunt; however, the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp.|$|E

During this period, four episodes of magmatic eruptive activity have been recently recognized.|$|E
5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, like <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> insects, are centrolecithal in {{that the}} eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is enclosed by the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the chorion protects the egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E

A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E

40|$|While {{many with}} {{schizophrenia}} experience deficits in metacognition {{it is unclear}} whether those deficits are related to <b>other</b> features <b>of</b> illness. To explore this issue, the current study classified participants with schizophrenia as possessing a deficit in both awareness of their own emotions and <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (n = 30), aware of their own emotions but unaware of the emotions <b>of</b> <b>others</b> (n = 50) and aware of their own emotions and <b>of</b> <b>other’s</b> emotions (n = 17). Groups were compared on assessments of neurocognitive function, symptoms, and history of sexual trauma. ANCOVA controlling for education found that the group unaware of their own emotions and <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> demonstrated poorer verbal memory, processing speed, executive function, less emotional discomfort and higher levels of disorganization symptoms relative to the other groups. The group aware of their own emotions but not <b>those</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> had a significantly higher report of childhood sexual abuse...|$|R
