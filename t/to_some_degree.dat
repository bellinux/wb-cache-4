A poll in August 2006 by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 68% of the 1,002 Americans polled blamed Hezbollah, at least in part, for the civilian casualties in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War, compared to 31% who blamed Israel <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree.</b> Another August 2006 poll by CNN showed that 69% of the 1,047 Americans polled believed that Hezbollah is unfriendly towards, or an enemy of, the United States.|$|E

5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree.</b> This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|Although other breeds {{were being}} {{increasingly}} imported and bred, {{the numbers of}} the Finnhorse population also slowly began to recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed.

5|$|In 1916, Garran {{was made}} the first Solicitor-General of Australia (the office was then known as Commonwealth Solicitor-General) by Billy Hughes, who had since become Prime Minister.

5|$|India's Foreign Policy {{has also}} <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> been {{influenced}} by the DPSPs. India, in the past has condemned all acts of aggression and has also supported the United Nations' peace-keeping activities.

5|$|Law {{enforcement}} at {{the county}} level, and <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> at the state level, became notoriously tolerant of the illegal activities in Galveston, {{in no small part}} because of the prosperity they generated, and the bribery and influence peddled by the Maceos.

5|$|Many of the {{facets of}} Minnesota culture that are {{perceived}} as the area's early history in fact originated after this period. Notably, the heavy Scandinavian immigration for which the state is known, and the pioneering days chronicled by author Laura Ingalls Wilder occurred after statehood in the later 19th century. Unlike these later years, {{the first half of}} the 19th century was characterized by sparsely populated communities, harsh living conditions, and <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree,</b> lawlessness.|$|E

30|$|Let us {{tell the}} {{difference}} between the two panels of Fig.  10. To this end, a red broken line is drawn on each panel on the first quadrant.

Therefore, the rotational strength alters the handedness of circular polarization characteristics <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degrees.</b>|$|R
5|$|Of the 108 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree.</b> The initial Japanese attack {{did not succeed in}} neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses would be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{earliest}} history, {{from the}} time of its founding as a small tribal village, to the downfall of its kings, is the least well preserved.
