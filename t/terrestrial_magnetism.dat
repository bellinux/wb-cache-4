5|$|Sir John Henry Lefroy, {{a pioneer}} in the study of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism</b> served as {{director}} of the magnetic observatory from 1842 to 1853; In 1960, the Ontario Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Citizenship and Culture erected a Provincial Military Plaque in his honour on the University of Toronto campus.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bradbury became an {{assistant}} professor of physics at Stanford University in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became an expert on the electrical conductivity of gases, the properties of ions, and the behavior of atmospheric electricity, publishing in journals including the Physical Review, Journal of Applied Physics, Journal of Chemical Physics, and the Journal of Atmospheric Electricity and <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism.</b> He invented the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter, a type of electrical ion gate, widely used in mass spectrometry in both time-of-flight mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers.|$|E
25|$|L. Thomas Aldrich – (1817–1913) Geophysicist - {{was known}} {{worldwide}} {{for his work}} as a geophysicist and geochemist at the Carnegie Institute for Science's Department of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism</b> as part of a research team that pioneered the development of methods and instruments for determining the age of rocks through dating their constituent minerals.|$|E
50|$|The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA) is an {{international}} scientific association {{that focuses on the}} study of <b>terrestrial</b> and planetary <b>magnetism</b> and space physics.|$|R
40|$|Abstracts of 63 papers {{accepted}} for publication are presented. Topics cover geomagnetism {{in the context of}} planetary magnetism, lunar magnetism, the dynamo theory and nondynamo processes, comparative planetary <b>magnetism</b> (<b>terrestrial</b> and outer planets), meteoritic magnetism, and the early solar magnetic field. Author and subject indexes are provided...|$|R
25|$|In August 1927, Gunn {{accepted}} a {{position with the}} Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), becoming assistant superintendent of the Heat and Light Division in 1928. This was a prolific period for him. Between 1929 and 1933, he published 28 papers, including 13 in the Physical Review. He could choose his own topics of research, and chose to study natural phenomena such as cosmic rays and <b>terrestrial</b> and solar <b>magnetism.</b> In 1933, he became superintendent of the Mechanics and Electricity Division and technical adviser to the laboratory director.|$|R
25|$|Over {{a period}} of forty years, he {{periodically}} addressed {{the determination of the}} constants in Carl Friedrich Gauss's theory of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism.</b> Again, the calculations involved great labour, and were not published during his lifetime. They were edited by his brother, William Grylls Adams, and appear in the second volume of the collected Scientific Papers. Numerical computation of this kind might almost be described as his pastime. He calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant, perhaps somewhat eccentrically, to 236 decimal places and evaluated the Bernoulli numbers up to the 62nd.|$|E
25|$|In 1905 the Galilee was {{chartered}} by the Carnegie Institution's Department of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism</b> to {{be converted}} into a magnetic observatory. The amount of magnetic materials on the ship {{was reduced to a}} minimum. The steel rigging was replaced by hemp ropes and a new observation bridge was constructed to lift the observation point as far as possible above the remaining iron parts of the ship, principally bolts in the vessel's sides. Additional cabin space was also provided to accommodate the scientists. Although the converted Galilee had magnetic constants lower than any equivalent ship at the time, corrections were still required to take account of the remaining magnetic material.|$|E
25|$|While {{more than}} 40 presidents have {{provided}} scientific leadership for the AGU since 1919, operational leadership {{has been provided}} by just four individuals. The first was John Adam Fleming, who was elected Secretary in 1925 and changed {{the name of his}} position to General Secretary. He served as a volunteer while working at the Department of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism</b> at the Carnegie Institution. By 1943, with the membership nearing 2,000, AGU recognized the need for a full-time professional administrator. The post was renamed Executive Secretary and Waldo E. Smith was hired. He served until 1970 and then Athelstan Spilhaus, Jr. was hired as Executive Director. Christine McEntee replaced him in 2010. Medals have been named after Fleming and Smith.|$|E
25|$|In 1807 Hansteen {{began the}} {{inquiries}} in <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism</b> with which {{his name is}} especially associated. His first scientific publication was printed in Journal de Physique, following a contest on magnetic axes created in 1811 by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. In 1813 {{he was given a}} research scholarship by the recently established (in 1811) Royal Frederick University in Christiania, with a promise of a future academic position. After marrying Johanne Cathrine Andrea Borch in May 1814, they left for Norway in the summer. Due to the Swedish campaign against Norway in 1814, they opted to travel by sea, and was threatened by a Swedish privateer as well as seized by a British fregate en route. Reaching Norway after five days, they settled in the street Pilestredet.|$|E
25|$|Working as a {{lecturer}} from 1814, in 1816 Hansteen {{was promoted to}} professor of astronomy and applied mathematics. He was {{the editor of the}} official Norwegian almanac from 1815, manager of the city astronomical observatory from the same year and co-director of the Norwegian Mapping Authority (then known as Norges Geografiske Oppmåling) from 1817. In 1819 he published a volume of researches on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism,</b> which was translated into German under the title of Untersuchungen über den Magnetismus der Erde, with a supplement containing Beobachtungen der Abweichung und Neigung der Magnetnadel and an atlas. By the rules there framed for the observation of magnetical phenomena Hansteen hoped to accumulate analyses for determining the number and position of the s of the Earth. In 1822 he co-founded Norway's first journal on natural sciences, Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne. He sat as editor-in-chief for eight years.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{excelled at}} his studies (so much so, {{that he would}} often help his {{teachers}} teach science) and in 1826 was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at The Albany Academy by Principal T. Romeyn Beck. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism</b> led him to experiment with magnetism in general. He {{was the first to}} coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core {{in order to make a}} more powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for Yale. He also showed that, when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the telegraph feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz, however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.|$|E
500|$|Rubin held various {{academic}} appointments for {{the next}} eleven years. She served for a year as an Instructor of Mathematics and Physics at [...] Montgomery County Community College, then worked from 1955-1965 at Georgetown University, as a Research Associate Astronomer, Lecturer (1959-1962), and finally, Assistant Professor of Astronomy (1962-1965). She joined the Carnegie Institute in 1965, as a staff member in the Department of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism,</b> where she met her long-time collaborator, instrument-maker Kent Ford. Because she had young children, she did much of her work from home.|$|E
500|$|Philip H. Abelson {{was a young}} {{physicist}} who {{had been}} awarded his PhD from the University of California on 8 May 1939. He {{was among the first}} American scientists to verify nuclear fission, reporting his results in an article submitted to the Physical Review in February 1939, and collaborated with Edwin McMillan on the discovery of neptunium. Returning to the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., where had a position, he became interested in isotope separation. In July 1940, Ross Gunn from the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) showed him a 1939 paper on the subject by Harold Urey, and Abelson became intrigued by the possibility of using the liquid thermal diffusion process. He began experiments with the process at the Department of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism</b> at the Carnegie Institution. Using potassium chloride (KCl), potassium bromide (KBr), potassium sulfate (...) and potassium dichromate (...) , he was able to achieve a separation factor of 1.2 (20 percent) of the potassium-39 and potassium-41 isotopes.|$|E
500|$|In early 1941, with World War II {{raging in}} Europe but the United States {{not yet a}} belligerent, Neddermeyer joined {{a team led by}} Charles C. Lauritsen and William A. Fowler at the Department of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism</b> at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and [...] then at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., that worked on the {{photoelectric}} proximity fuze. After this work was successfully completed, Neddermeyer was recruited by Oppenheimer to work at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory. Neddermeyer was an early advocate for the development of an implosion technique for assembling a critical mass in an atomic bomb. Although implosion was suggested by Richard Tolman as early as 1942, and discussed in the introductory lectures given to Los Alamos scientists by Robert Serber, Neddermeyer {{was one of the first}} to urge its full development. [...] Unable to find much initial enthusiasm for the concept among his fellow Los Alamos scientists, Neddermeyer presented the first substantial technical analysis of implosion in late April 1943. Oppenheimer considered this to be the beginning of implosion research at Los Alamos.|$|E

2500|$|The AGU was {{intended}} to promote [...] "pure" [...] geophysics; exploration geophysics has its own society, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists. In a March 1919 report by a committee chaired by Robert S. Woodward of the Carnegie Institution, geophysics {{was defined as a}} collection of [...] "borderlands" [...] (closely related, mutually dependent subjects): astronomy, geodesy, geology, meteorology, [...] mareology (oceanography), seismology, <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism,</b> terrestrial electricity, tides, and volcanology. The AGU was organized under seven sections: Geodesy, Seismology, Meteorology, <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism</b> and electricity, Oceanography, Volcanology, and Geophysical chemistry. Hydrology was added in 1930 and Tectonophysics in 1940. In suggesting the latter name, Norman Bowen evoked a familiar theme: to [...] "designate this new borderline field between geophysics, physics and geology ... for the solution of problems of tectonics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally the Galilee headed {{northeast}} to San Francisco, {{arriving on}} May 21, 1908. Following a final set of 'swings' and shore observations, the vessel {{was returned to}} her owners on June 5, 1908. The final cruise had covered a distance of , giving a total distance {{for the period of}} her charter to the Department of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism</b> of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Galilee was a brigantine, {{built in}} 1891, {{designed}} by Matthew Turner. She {{started on the}} packet line between San Francisco and Tahiti and was reckoned a very fast ship. In 1905 she was chartered by the Carnegie Institution's Department of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism</b> and converted into a magnetic observatory. She was used to make observations of Earth's magnetic field on three cruises {{over a period of}} three years from 1905 to 1908 in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
2500|$|The ship then {{sailed to}} the north of the Hawaiian islands before {{returning}} to San Diego, arriving at her home port on December 9. A final set of 'swings' and shore observations were made at San Diego, finishing on December 18, to provide the necessary corrections. A distance of [...] was covered on the first cruise. The commander was J.F.Pratt, taken temporarily into the employ of the Department of <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>Magnetism.</b> J.P Ault, the future commander of the Carnegie, was one of the magnetic observers.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fame}} {{of his work}} on Neptune, Adams also did much {{important}} work on gravitational astronomy and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism.</b> He was particularly adept at fine numerical calculations, often making substantial revisions to the contributions of his predecessors. However, he was [...] "extraordinarily uncompetitive, reluctant to publish imperfect work to stimulate debate or claim priority, averse to correspondence about it, and forgetful in practical matters". It {{has been suggested that}} these are symptoms of Asperger syndrome which would also be consistent with the [...] "repetitive behaviours and restricted interests" [...] necessary to perform the Neptune calculations, in addition to his difficulties in personal interaction with Challis and Airy.|$|E
2500|$|He experimented on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism</b> and {{had taken}} part in medical {{experiments}} while at Wadham College, performing the first successful injection of a substance into the bloodstream (of a dog). In Gresham College, he did experiments involving determining longitude through magnetic variation and through lunar observation to help with navigation, and helped construct a [...] telescope with Sir Paul Neile. Wren also studied and improved the microscope and telescope at this time. He had also been making observations of the planet Saturn from around 1652 {{with the aim of}} explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in De corpore saturni but before the work was published, Huygens presented his theory of the rings of Saturn. Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and De corpore saturni was never published. In addition, he constructed an exquisitely detailed lunar model and presented it to the king. Also his contribution to mathematics should be noted; in 1658, he found the length of an arc of the cycloid using an exhaustion proof based on dissections to reduce the problem to summing segments of chords of a circle which are in geometric progression.|$|E
2500|$|When Humboldt {{first began}} his studies of organisms and the {{environment}} he claimed {{that he wanted to}} [...] "reorganize the general connections that link organic beings and to study the great harmonies of Nature". He is often considered one of the world's first genuine ecologists. Humboldt succeeded in developing a comprehensive science that joined the separate branches of natural philosophy under a model of natural order founded on the concept of dynamic equilibrium. Humboldt's work reached far beyond his personal expeditions and discoveries. Figures from all across the globe participated on his work. Some such participants included French naval officers, East India Company physicians, Russian provincial administrators, Spanish military commanders, and German diplomats. Furthermore, as was aforementioned, Charles Darwin carried a copy of Humboldt's Personal Narrative aboard H.M.S. Beagle. Humboldt's projects, particularly those related to natural philosophy, {{played a significant role in}} the influx of European money and travelers to Spanish America in increasing numbers in the early 19th century. Sir Edward Sabine, a British scientist, worked on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism</b> in a manner that was certainly Humboldtian. Also, British scientist George Gabriel Stokes depended heavily on abstract mathematical measurement to deal with error in a precision instrument; certainly Humboldtian science. Maybe the most prominent figure whose work can be considered representative of Humboldtian science, is geologist Charles Lyell. Despite a lack of emphasis on precise measurement in geology at the time, Lyell insisted on precision in a Humboldtian manner.|$|E

Upon {{using the}} power of one hundred pairs of plates (10.) with this ring, the impulse at the galvanometer, when contact was {{completed}} or broken, was so great as to make the needle spin round rapidly four or five times, before the air and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism</b> could reduce its motion to mere oscillation.|$|E
60|$|Then I feel a fan on my cheek, faint, so faint, that I {{can just}} sense it ere it is gone. But another comes, and another, until {{a real and}} just {{perceptible}} breeze is blowing. How the Snark's sails manage to feel it is beyond me, but feel it they do, as she does as well, for the compass card begins slowly to revolve in the binnacle. In reality, it is not revolving at all. It is held by <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism</b> in one place, {{and it is the}} Snark that is revolving, pivoted upon that delicate cardboard device that floats in a closed vessel of alcohol.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{progress}} of his discoveries he has been remarked for the extreme sagacity and the admirable justness with which he seized upon the phenomena of the exterior world. The variations, for instance, of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism,</b> the direction of currents, the groupings of marine plants, fixing one of the grand climacteric divisions of the ocean, the temperatures changing not solely with {{the distance to the}} equator, but also with the difference of meridians: these and similar phenomena, as they broke upon him, were discerned with wonderful quickness of perception, and made to contribute important principles to the stock of general knowledge. This lucidity of spirit, this quick convertibility of facts to principles, distinguish him from the dawn to the close of his sublime enterprise, insomuch that, with all the sallying ardor of his imagination, his ultimate success has been admirably characterized as a [...] "conquest of reflection." [...] [237] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{mathematical}} {{and experimental}} elucidation of the phenomena of electricity, {{and the study}} of the relations of this form of energy with chemical and thermal action, had made extensive progress before 1837. But the determination of the influence of magnetism on light, the discovery of diamagnetism, of the influence of crystalline structure on magnetism, and the completion of the mathematical theory of electricity, all belong to the present epoch. To it also appertain the practical execution and the working out {{of the results of the}} great international system of observations on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism,</b> suggested by Humboldt in 1836; and the invention of instruments of infinite delicacy and precision for the quantitative determination of electrical phenomena. The voltaic battery has received vast improvements; while the invention of magneto-electric engines and of improved means of producing ordinary electricity has provided sources of electrical energy vastly superior to any before extant in power, and far more convenient for use.|$|E
6000|$|This {{is the way}} out of {{the vicious}} circle. Not to rush round on the periphery, like a rabbit in a ring, trying to break through. But to retreat to the very center, and there to be filled with a new strange stability, {{polarized}} in unfathomable richness with the center of centers. We are so silly, trying to invent devices and machines for flying off from the surface of the earth. Instead of realizing that for us the deep satisfaction lies not in escaping, but in getting into the perfect circuit of the earth's <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetism.</b> Not in breaking away. What is the good of trying to break away from one's own? What is the good of a tree desiring to fly like a bird in the sky, when a bird is rooted in the earth as surely as a tree is? Nay, the bird is only the topmost leaf of the tree, fluttering in the high air, but attached as close to the tree as any other leaf. Mr. Einstein's Theory of Relativity does not supersede the Newtonian Law of Gravitation or of Inertia. It only says, [...] "Beware! The Law of Inertia is not the simple ideal proposition you would like to make of it. It is a vast complexity. Gravitation is not one elemental uncouth force. It is a strange, infinitely complex, subtle aggregate of forces." [...] And yet, however much it may waggle, a stone does fall to earth if you drop it.|$|E
