5|$|European music between 800 and 1100 {{became more}} sophisticated, more {{frequently}} requiring instruments capable of polyphony. The 9th-century Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that, in the Byzantine Empire, typical instruments included the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably {{a type of}} harp or lyre), salandj (probably a bagpipe) and the lyra. The Byzantine lyra, a bowed string instrument, is an ancestor of most European bowed instruments, including <b>the</b> <b>violin.</b>|$|E
5|$|For example, {{the unusual}} {{placement}} of the cadenza before the recapitulation is reflected in <b>the</b> <b>violin</b> concertos of Tchaikovsky (where the cadenza is similarly placed) and Sibelius (where the cadenza serves to extend the development section). Moreover, following this concerto it was very rare for a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten for the soloist to improvise as {{in the days of}} Mozart and Beethoven. The linking of the three movements also influenced other concertos, such as Liszt's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|Graves was {{a pillar}} of the Los Alamos community. He was {{an active member of}} the non-denominational Protestant Community Church.

He was chairman of the board of the local bank, and a member of the local school board.|$|E
5000|$|Among the {{instrument}} groups and within {{each group of}} instruments, there is a generally accepted hierarchy. Every instrumental group (or section) has a principal who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos. <b>The</b> <b>violins</b> are divided into two groups, first violin and second <b>violin,</b> with <b>the</b> second <b>violins</b> playing in lower registers than <b>the</b> first <b>violins,</b> playing an accompaniment part, or harmonizing the melody played by <b>the</b> first <b>violins.</b> <b>The</b> principal first <b>violin</b> is called <b>the</b> concertmaster (or [...] "leader" [...] in the UK) and is not only considered {{the leader of the}} string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the conductor. The concertmaster leads the pre-concert tuning and handles musical aspects of orchestra management, such as determining the bowings for <b>the</b> <b>violins</b> or for all of the string section. The concertmaster usually sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience. There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello and a principal bass.|$|R

5|$|In {{the absence}} of folk instruments, other bands in the genre resort to using {{keyboards}} to replicate the sound of folk instruments.

Bands that supplement a folk instrument like <b>the</b> <b>violin</b> with keyboards include Skyclad, Mägo de Oz, and Tuatha de Danann.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn {{originally}} {{proposed the}} idea of <b>the</b> <b>violin</b> concerto to Ferdinand David, a close friend and then concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not premiered until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. The work itself {{was one of the}} foremost violin concertos of the Romantic era and was influential on many other composers.|$|E

5|$|Ravel drew on {{many generations}} of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré {{and the more}} recent {{innovations}} of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert, Liszt and Chopin. He considered himself {{in many ways a}} classicist, often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary, to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies. The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and <b>the</b> <b>Violin</b> Sonata.|$|E
