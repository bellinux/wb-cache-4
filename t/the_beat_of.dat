5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button in time with <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E
5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E
5|$|The Karashishi is {{most notably}} found in Japan at the {{entrance}} of Shinto Shrines and are used to either ward-off bad spirits or welcome good spirits. The Karashishi dance in Ikata involves two persons dancing under a single guardian lion costume to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the drum of a young boy. Ikata's performers are especially well-known throughout most of the prefecture for their dedication to the dance.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} {{of music in}} the Royal Marines is inextricably linked with the evolution of British military bands. Lively airs and <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the drum enabled columns of marching men to keep a regular step. The drum was the normal method of giving signals on the battlefield or in camp. As long ago as the days of Drake and Hawkins the drummer's rhythm would advertise the changing watches or beat the men to quarters.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} march music began before the Gunpowder Age during which armies would {{maintain}} their troops' morale by marching with music playing, whether that be from <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> a drum or fife. American march music showed during the American Revolutionary and earlier wartime conflicts, {{in which a}} fife and snare drum would play while the troops marched to battle. This is why {{it can be said}} that march music is a military's music.|$|E
25|$|For example, if two musicians, one {{standing}} on the front sideline of the football field {{and one on the}} back sideline, begin playing exactly when they see <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the conductor's baton or hand, the sound produced by the musician on the front sideline reaches listeners in the stands noticeably before the sound played by the back musician, and the musicians is seen to move before the sound reaches the stands.|$|E

25|$|In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, {{marching to}} <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> drums, “took {{to the streets}} of Tokyo and other cities to mark six months since the March {{earthquake}} and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant”.

25|$|After {{singing the}} opening kriti, usually, the {{performer}} sings the kalpanaswaram of the raga to the beat. The performer must improvise {{a string of}} swaras in any octave {{according to the rules}} of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti. The violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of swara, the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga, have no awkward pauses or lapses in <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the song, and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow.|$|E
25|$|In {{many forms}} of music, the bass drum is used to mark or keep time. The bass drum makes a low, boom sound when the mallet hits the drumhead. In marches {{it is used to}} project tempo (marching bands {{historically}} march to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> the bass). A basic beat for rock and roll has the bass drum played on the first and third beats of a bars of common time, with the snare drum on the second and fourth beats, called back beats. In jazz, the bass drum can vary from almost entirely being a timekeeping medium to being a melodic voice in conjunction with the other parts of the set.|$|E
