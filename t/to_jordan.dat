5|$|East of Rochester, NY31 {{continued}} eastward <b>to</b> <b>Jordan,</b> {{utilizing the}} Rochester–Pittsford portion of legislative Route14, the Perinton–Jordan segment of Route20, and its current alignment between Pittsford and Perinton. From Weedsport <b>to</b> <b>Jordan,</b> NY31 used {{a slightly different}} routing. It initially exited the village on Clinton Road and followed that road <b>to</b> <b>Jordan,</b> where NY31 turned north and followed modern NY317 and NY31 north and east to modern CR84. NY31 turned north here, using what is now Old Route31, current NY31, and Downer Street to reach Baldwinsville. Within the village, NY31 followed Downer Street and what is now NY48 along Syracuse Street between Downer and Genesee Streets. Outside of Baldwinsville, NY31 remained on its current routing to Cicero, where it followed a more northerly alignment along Lakeshore Road. It rejoined its modern alignment near the eastern town line, and followed it east {{to what is now}} NY316 in Lenox. From here, NY31 went southeastward to NY5 in Oneida by way of modern NY316 and NY46.|$|E
5|$|In May, General Gaskin began {{planning}} to retake {{the city of}} Karmah, which sat astride a main supply route between Fallujah and Baghdad and was an important insurgent stronghold. Unlike other locales, Karmah had no definable perimeter, making it easy for outsiders to access, as when insurgents fled to Karmah after being pushed out of Baghdad. Gaskin sent one of his aides <b>to</b> <b>Jordan</b> to meet with Sheikh Mishan, head of Karmah's largest tribe, the Jumayli. Sheikh Mishan fled <b>to</b> <b>Jordan</b> in 2005 after receiving threats from AQI. Gaskin's aide was able to persuade the sheikh to return in June, partnered with 2nd Battalion 5th Marines.

5|$|The {{proportion}} of skilled workers in Jordan {{is among the}} highest in the region in sectors such as ICT and industry, due to a relatively modern educational system. This has attracted large foreign investments <b>to</b> <b>Jordan</b> and has enabled the country to export its workforce to Persian Gulf countries. Flows of remittances <b>to</b> <b>Jordan</b> grew rapidly, particularly during the end of the 1970s and 1980s, and remains an important source of external funding. Remittances from Jordanian expatriates were $3.8 billion in 2015, a notable rise in the amount of transfers compared to 2014 where remittances reached over $3.66 billion listing Jordan as fourth largest recipient in the region.|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{sector is}} {{considered}} a cornerstone of the economy, being a large source of employment, hard currency and economic growth. In 2010, there were 8 million visitors <b>to</b> <b>Jordan.</b> The result was $3.4 billion in tourism revenues, $4.4 billion with the inclusion of medical tourists. The majority of tourists coming <b>to</b> <b>Jordan</b> are from European and Arab countries. The tourism sector in Jordan has been severely affected by regional turbulence.

5|$|While some 700,000–1,000,000 Iraqis came <b>to</b> <b>Jordan</b> {{following}} the Iraq War in 2003, most have returned.

Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled <b>to</b> <b>Jordan</b> {{to escape the}} violence in Syria. The kingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the flux of Syrian refugees places on the country. The effects are largely affecting Jordanian communities, as {{the vast majority of}} Syrian refugees do not live in camps. The refugee crisis effects include competition for job opportunities, water resources and other state provided services, along with the strain on the national infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|On 19 January 1957, Jordan {{signed the}} Arab Solidarity Agreement (ASA) with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria which entailed those countries' {{financial}} assistance to replace the annual British aid <b>to</b> <b>Jordan</b> that ended with the abrogation of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty in November 1956 (the treaty was officially and mutually abrogated in March 1957). However, implementation of the ASA was hindered by Egypt and Syria's inability or unwillingness to subsidize the Jordanian army, whose budget rivaled that of their own armies. Furthermore, by then, Abu Nuwar was steadily losing Hussein's confidence due to dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar among the army brass and the negative effects that his anti-Western hostility was having on relations with Jordan's principal Western allies, the UK and US; Hussein viewed the latter two as much-needed alternatives of financial support <b>to</b> <b>Jordan</b> in lieu of his disappointment with the ASA.|$|E
