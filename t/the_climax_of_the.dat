5|$|As {{the chorus}} progresses, Harket's voice hits ever higher notes, {{reaching}} a falsetto {{and hitting the}} song's highest note (E5, the dominant note) at the end. There is a temporary change of markings in the drum pattern in the chorus, where for two bars the drums play in half time, returning to the same rhythm as before for <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vocal line. A mix of a drum machine, the LinnDrum, acoustic guitars and electronic instrumentation serves as the song's backing track.|$|E

25|$|The pair leave, {{and walk}} along the streets taking turns {{carrying}} the disguises and discussing how to split the money. This serves to introduce some levity and ease <b>the</b> narrative out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emotional <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene, helping to prepare the audience for the twists and emotion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following scene, <b>the</b> true <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play. Tamashima Ittō is invited into <b>the</b> back room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shop for a drink, perhaps in part in thanks for pointing out the thieves.|$|R

During this period, after an era of autonomy, the city-states of the area came under Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian hegemony. The occupying civilizations influenced Phoenician ceramics, jewelry and ivory work, statues, and sarcophagi.|$|E

50|$|After {{the film}} was released, Sakthivel changed <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{negative}} reaction to a scene in the film which was reminiscent of a real life incident where girls were burned on a bus.|$|R

Jason escapes {{from the bottom of}} Crystal Lake to resume his hunt for Ash, but is captured by the U.S. government.

Jason's soul is then absorbed by Freddy, who uses it to increase his own power.|$|E
50|$|After the mid-17th century, {{the state}} bed {{also came to}} provide <b>the</b> {{expected}} <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence <b>of</b> rooms in a Baroque apartment, following precedents established in France. Late-17th century Italian beds were usually grand in scale, often with elaborate wooden backs and fabric drapes. They were usually similar in style throughout the nation, but the textiles varied by region.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>climax,</b> <b>the</b> ostinato <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Passacaglia {{returns to}} D and the {{movement}} experiences a dénouement. It ends with a gradual recession of momentum and a brief recall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lyricism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous Adagio. Here, solo winds take brief melodies over a now fragmented ostinato, {{as seen in the}} English horn solo at mm. 101-103 (Example 14). The movement closes with a repeated figure in the bass, seen fragmented in mm. 101-105, with celli in imitation (Example 15).|$|R

5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because {{if she were to}} marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, both ships {{continued}} {{service in}} the eastern Mediterranean and Black seas. Waldeck-Rousseau joined the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and operated in support of the White Russians against the Red Bolsheviks; shortly after arriving, her crew mutinied over poor conditions but quickly resumed their duties. Edgar Quinet meanwhile remained in the Mediterranean during the Greco-Turkish War, and during the Great Fire of Smyrna, at <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict, she rescued 1,200 people from the city.|$|E
5|$|Archive {{footage from}} Captain America: The First Avenger, {{including}} the apparent death of Captain America {{from the end}} of that film, is used throughout the episode, and the macguffin of the episode, molecular nitramene, is based on Vita-Rays, which were used to transform Steve Rogers into Captain America in the film. The Vita-Ray detector that Carter uses in the episode belonged to Dr. Abraham Erskine, who was portrayed by Stanley Tucci in The First Avenger. The Oil Refinery featured at <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode belongs to Roxxon Oil, a company that has appeared throughout the MCU.|$|E

25|$|Fadrique was {{slightly}} wounded by a splinter, which proved his courage and tactical sense, {{and continued to}} demonstrate the his valor on many occasions during his long career, <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> it was <b>the</b> great success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hispano-Portuguese naval expedition to Brazil, that regained San Salvador de Bahia for the Spanish crown from the Dutch.|$|R
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event, a crate {{filled with}} disco records was blown {{up on the}} field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. Many of those in {{attendance}} {{had come to see}} the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was damaged both by the explosion and by the rowdy fans {{to the point where the}} White Sox were required to forfeit the second game of the doubleheader to the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, to Tommy's horror {{the tree}} finally dies {{just before a}}rrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final {{apparition}} of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy {{in the face of}} his accepted impending death and suggesting that they may share an afterlife now.

The traveler's body is absorbed, but the tree flourishes back to life being engulfed by the star dying inside the nebula. Izzi's apparition picks a fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.|$|E
5|$|During the voyages, Volsius reappears in {{the guise}} of Georges's heroes: Otto Lidenbrock {{at the center of the}} earth, Captain Nemo on a journey on the Nautilus to Atlantis, and Michel Ardan on a cannon-propelled trip to a distant planet, Altor. Ox and Volsius are in {{constant}} conflict throughout, with the former urging Georges toward hubris and the latter seeking to protect Georges from the influence. Ox appears to have won at <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play, when Georges—attempting to work for the benefit of Altor, where overconsumption has deprived the planet of soil and other natural resources—leads a massive technological project to save the planet from burning by redirecting its water channels. The project backfires, and the planet explodes.|$|E
50|$|Continuing {{straight}} after <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> Return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Overfiend, Jyaku and {{the survivors}} head for Osaka {{to help the}} Overfiend after his climatic battle.

5|$|In 1982, Shaw {{was chosen}} for the small but crucial role of unmasked and dying Anakin Skywalker in Return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jedi, {{the third and final}} film in the {{original}} Star Wars trilogy. Although David Prowse played the costumed scenes and James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader, just as they had in the first two films, Shaw was cast in a single scene with Mark Hamill, during the moment aboard Death Star II when Luke Skywalker unmasks his dying father. Since the scene was unquestionably <b>the</b> emotional <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film, the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role.|$|R
2500|$|Andersen's {{manuscript}} {{was at the}} printer's when he {{was suddenly}} inspired to change <b>the</b> original <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale from the emperor's subjects admiring his invisible clothes to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child's cry. [...] There are many theories about why he made this change. [...] Most scholars agree that from his earliest years in Copenhagen, Andersen presented himself to the Danish bourgeoisie as the naïvely precocious child not usually admitted to the adult salon. [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes" [...] became his expose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypocrisy and snobbery he found there when he finally gained admission.|$|R
5|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Steven Moffat wrote the episode as an introduction for Amy {{into the role}} of the Doctor's companion. The episode showcases her first adventure away from her home world and her first time in space. <b>The</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> episode, where the Doctor decides the best thing he can do is kill the Star Whale as painlessly as possible but Amy comes up with an alternative solution that is more humane, was designed to stand out in the Doctor's memory as a failure of a huge scale. It also reinforced the Doctor's need for a companion and showed how important Amy would be to him.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the final}} was {{broadcast}} by ITV Sport with commentary provided by Clive Tyldesley and Ron Atkinson. The broadcast attracted {{an average of}} 15.5million viewers, with a peak audience of 18.8million at 21:30, just as Manchester United scored their two goals. <b>The</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game was voted as the fourth-greatest sporting moment ever by Channel 4 viewers in a 2002 poll.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{ran from}} 18 July to 18 November 1988. Shooting began in Mexico, which mostly doubled for the fictional Republic of Isthmus: locations in Mexico City included the Biblioteca del Banco de Mexico for {{the exterior of}} El Presidente Hotel and the Casino Español for the interior of Casino de Isthmus whilst the Teatro de la Ciudad was used for its exterior. Villa Arabesque in Acapulco was used for Sanchez's lavish villa, and the La Rumorosa Mountain Pass in Tecate {{was used as the}} filming site for the tanker chase during <b>the</b> <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film. Sanchez's Olympiatec Meditation Institute was shot at the Otomi Ceremonial Center in Temoaya. Other underwater sequences were shot at the Isla Mujeres near Cancún.|$|E
40|$|From Shadow is a nine minute orchestral {{work which}} has three main sections. The fast first section is based around a {{repeated}} eighth note figure.

Melodic material that is presented late in the first section becomes the basis for the next two sections.

40|$|Genesis 1 - 11. Although {{much has}} been written on {{sexuality}} and marriage from <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old and New Testaments, little attention has been given to what is perhaps the most engaging and elusive expression relating to the whole topic, namely, the 2 ̆ 7 one flesh 2 ̆ 7 expression which occurs in <b>the</b> poetic <b>climax</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Genesis 2 account of creation and recurs as a technical expression in the New Testament writing. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to explore <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> this expression in the Old and New Testaments in <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> understanding more fully its content.
