5|$|Pietrangeli, in his {{foreword}} to The Sistine Chapel, written {{after the}} restoration of the lunettes, but prior to {{the restoration of}} the ceiling, commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.|$|E
5|$|Tapp is {{beginning}} to learn <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> all have a dark connection to him. He proceeds to {{the offices of the}} building and finds Oswald McGullicuty in the next Jigsaw trap. Jigsaw felt that Oswald was perverting his message, and so he was placed into a Folding Table Trap, which would snap his body in half if Tapp failed to save him. Tapp saves Oswald, but he is swiftly killed by a compacting metal slab before either have a chance to react.|$|E

50|$|The {{clothing}} used in {{the ancient}} world strongly reflects the technologies <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> mastered. Archaeology plays a significant role in documenting this aspect of ancient life, for fabric fibers, and leathers sometimes are well-preserved through time. In many cultures the clothing worn was indicative of the social status achieved by various members of their society.|$|R
25|$|This {{group has}} {{received}} some attention {{in recent years}} due to claims from the Republic of Macedonia <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> form an ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece.

25|$|Part of the {{cemetery}} space has been surrounded with a dry-stone wall. Some tumuli were built beyond that wall; 8 corpses were found there. Historians think <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were either Canarians deemed unworthy of burial in the proper ground, or foreigners having landed on the island before the Spanish conquest.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{aspect of}} the Kintampo complex is the {{creation}} of art and items of personal adornment. Archaeologists have found polished stone beads, bracelets and figurines in addition to typical stone tools and structures such as hand axes, and building foundations which suggests <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> had both a complex society and were well-learned in Later Stone Age technologies.|$|E
25|$|The Windust {{phase is}} dated between 10600 BC and 7100 BC. At the Lind Coulee Archaeological Site in east-central Washington, leaf-shaped {{projectile}} points and knives date between 8500-5500 BC. Based on archaeological evidence, {{it is suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were hunters, subsisting also from fishing and plant gathering. The presence of sea shells gives an indication that trading took place. A small oval shaped dwelling was also found at the Paulina Lake site in Oregon, dating to 7100 BC.|$|E

It follows one of Tian's {{favorite}} topics, Chinese minorities, a topic {{he touched}} upon in 1984's On the Hunting Ground and {{would return to}} in 2004's documentary, Delamu. Like these other films, The Horse Thief shows Tian's fascination with China's ethnic minorities, {{and in particular the}} Buddhist ceremonies <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> practice.|$|R

25|$|In 2015, {{two major}} {{studies of the}} DNA of living and ancient people detect in modern Native Americans a trace of DNA related to that of native people from Australia and Melanesia. Australo-Melanesian DNA in some living Native Americans, {{including}} those of the Aleutian Islands and the Surui people of Amazonian Brazil. Walter Neves and Mark Hubbe argue <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> descended from an early wave of migration that was separate from the one that gave rise to today’s Native Americans, and drew on a different source population in Asia.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{researchers}} first {{attributed the}} mound to the Adena culture (1000 BC - 1 AD). William Webb, noted Adena exponent, found evidence through carbon dating for Kentucky Adena {{as early as}} 1200 BC. As there are Adena graves near the Serpent Mound, scholars thought the same people constructed the mound. The skeletal remains of the Adena type uncovered in the 1880s at Serpent Mound indicate <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were unique among the ancient Ohio Valley peoples. It was more than 45 years before scholars paid sufficient attention to the Adena studies.|$|E
25|$|NASA's Payload Specialist {{program has}} been criticized for giving limited Shuttle flight {{positions}} to civilian aerospace engineers such as Cenker and Greg Jarvis (killed aboard Challenger), politicians such as Bill Nelson, and others civilians such as Teacher in Space Christa McAuliffe (also killed aboard Challenger). Even the flight of former Mercury astronaut and US Senator John Glenn was questioned. The concern was <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> had replaced career astronauts in very limited flight opportunities, and some may have flown without fully understanding the level of danger involved in a Shuttle mission.|$|E

25|$|PTSD became first evident due {{to those}} {{individuals}} who suffered extremely horrible experiences from war. Society noticed that those {{who took part in}} war, or had family members who took part in war, became distant from themselves and suffered terribly and found it very difficult to cope with the tragedies. Researchers took note of this and aimed to evaluate the situation and come to a conclusion with how to rehabilitate these victims, and while doing this they determined <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> had post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|The similar Hamitic hypothesis, which {{developed}} {{directly from the}} Asiatic Race Theory, argued that the Ethiopid and Arabid populations of the Horn of Africa were the inventors of agriculture and had brought all civilization to Africa, and asserted <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were Caucasians, not Negroid. It also rejected any Biblical basis despite using Hamitic as the theory's name. Charles Gabriel Seligman in his Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1913) and later works argued that the ancient Egyptians were among this group of Caucasian Hamites, having arrived in the Nile Valley during early prehistory and introduced technology and agriculture to primitive natives they found there.|$|E
25|$|Experimental finance aims to {{establish}} different market settings and environments to observe experimentally {{and provide a}} lens through which science can analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion and aggregation, price setting mechanisms, and returns processes. Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them, and attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions. Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior, and the way <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> act or react, of people in artificial competitive market-like settings.|$|E

25|$|Stauning {{remained}} {{prime minister}} {{until his death}} in 1942, as head of a coalition cabinet encompassing all major political parties (the exceptions being the tiny Nazi party, and the Communist Party, which was outlawed in 1941 as discussed). Vilhelm Buhl replaced him briefly, only to be replaced by foreign minister Erik Scavenius, who had been the main link to the Nazi authorities throughout the war. Scavenius was a diplomat, not an elected politician, and had an elitist approach to government. He was afraid that emotional public opinion would destabilize his attempts to build a compromise between Danish sovereignty and the realities of German occupation. Scavenius felt strongly that he was Denmark's most ardent defender. After the war there was much recrimination over his stance, particularly from members of the active resistance, who felt that he had hindered the cause of resistance and threatened Denmark's national honour. He felt <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were vain, seeking to build their own reputations or political careers through emotionalism.|$|E
25|$|After their {{experiences}} at the Eastern Front, having learned about mass murder in Poland and Russia, Hans Scholl and Alexander Schmorell {{felt compelled to}} take action. From end of June until mid of July 1942, they wrote the first four leaflets. Quoting extensively from the Bible, Aristotle and Novalis, as well as Goethe and Schiller, the iconic poets of German bourgeoisie, they appealed to what they considered the German intelligentsia, believing <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> would be easily convinced by the same arguments that also motivated the authors themselves. These leaflets were left in telephone books in public phone booths, mailed to professors and students, and taken by courier to other universities for distribution. From 23 July to 30 October 1942, Graf, Scholl and Schmorell served again at the Russian front, and activities ceased until their return. In autumn 1942, Sophie Scholl discovered that her brother Hans {{was one of the}} authors of the pamphlets, and joined the group. Shortly after, Willi Graf, and by the end of December 1942, Kurt Huber became members of the White Rose.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, the Dutch were contending {{with other}} problems. The {{excessive}} use of land for sugar cane plantation {{in the interior of}} West Java reduced the flow of water in Ciliwung River (which flows through the city of Batavia) and made the city canals an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, resulting in a series of malaria outbreaks in 1733–1795. This was aggravated by the fall of sugar price in European market, bringing bankruptcy to sugar factories in the areas around Batavia (the Ommelanden), which were mostly operated by Chinese labour. The unrest prompted VOC authorities {{to reduce the number of}} unlicensed Chinese settlers, who had been smuggled into Batavia by Chinese sugar factory owners. These labourers were loaded onto ships out of Batavia but the rumour <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were thrown into the sea as soon as the ship was beyond the horizon caused panic among the remaining Chinese. On 7 October 1740, several Chinese mobs attacked Europeans outside the city and incited the Dutch to order a massacre two days later. The Chinese settlement in Batavia was looted for several days, in which 10,000 Chinese were killed. The Chinese ran away and captured Bekasi, which was dislodged by VOC in June 1741.|$|E
50|$|Mowat's {{premise is}} that Iceland, Greenland and North America were visited and settled before the Vikings by Europeans from the {{northern}} British Isles. Mowat refers to <b>these</b> <b>people</b> as Albans, after the ancestral name for the British Isles, and believes that the Albans are descendants of the original Neolithic peoples of Britain and who were displaced by the Celts. He argues <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> were later pushed to the fringes of north-western Europe, in Northern Scotland, Orkney and Shetland by Armorican refugees fleeing the Romans, who constructed brochs along the coasts of Scotland and eventually {{became known as the}} Picts.|$|R
25|$|Both tribes {{traditionally}} spoke dialects of the Lushootseed language, {{a branch}} of the Salishan family. The Upper Skagit tribe occupied the land along the Skagit from what is now Newhalem to the mouth of the river at Puget Sound. The Lower Skagit tribe lived on northern Whidbey Island and have come to be known also as the Whidbey Island Skagit. Archaeological evidence reveals <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> collected their food from the natural resources, through fishing, hunting, and gathering.|$|R
