40|$|SummaryInformation on the {{prevalence}} {{and extent of}} degenerative morphological changes (DMC) in the joints of the lower extremity, including foot joints is sparse. In the present study, the first and fifth metatarsalphalangeal (MTP), <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal,</b> subtalar, talocrural, knee and hip joints of 50 cadavers were examined grossly and graded on a five-point scale for signs of DMC. Selected samples were examined histologically. Our results confirm clinical findings that severe DMC in foot joints are uncommon except in the first MTP joint where the plantar aspect is most affected. The knee joint displayed the most numerous and severe signs of DMC followed by the first MTP joint. The hip, talocrural, subtalar and <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> displayed comparatively moderate levels of DMC while the fifth MTP was rarely affected. The only joint to display significantly greater levels of DMC on the distal side of the joint {{as compared with the}} proximal side, when a difference was present, was the hip. There were significantly greater levels of DMC on the medial aspect of two or more joints within an extremity than on the lateral aspect. Radiographs often showed few or no signs of DMC even when erosion down to subchondral bone was observed upon gross examination...|$|R
40|$|To {{develop a}} {{classification}} of midtarsus deformities, clinical examination and weightbearing radiographs {{were used to}} evaluate 131 feet in 109 patients (average age, 59 ± 11 years) with those deformities. Patients were classified into four types based on anatomic location of the maximum deformity. Type I (N = 43) showed defor-mity at the metatarsocuneiform joints medially and {{the fourth and fifth}} metatarsocuboid joints laterally, with plantarmedial and/or medial prominence. Type II (N = 60) had deformity at the naviculocuneiform joint medially and the fourth and fifth metatarsocuboid joints laterally; plantarlateral prominence was characteristic, although one-third had isolated or additional medial prominences. Type III (N = 17) had major deformity in the perinavicular region, with a prominence plantarcentrally or plantarlat-erally. Type IV (N = 11) had deformity at the <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> with variable prominences. Each type was further subdivided into stages A, B, and C based on the severity of the deformity. In stage B, the midtarsus was coplanar with the metatarsocalcaneal plane. In stage A, the midtarsus was above this plane. In stage C, the midtarsus was below this plane. We concluded that mid-tarsus deformities can be classified as one of four types and one of three stages.

40|$|The earnest {{effort to}} {{understand}} {{the mechanics of the}} human foot and the mechanical origins of foot pathology did not begin until {{the first half of the}} twentieth century. In 1941, JT Manter’s article “Movement of the Subtalar and <b>Transverse</b> <b>Tarsal</b> <b>Joints</b> ” attempted to define a normal and relatively consistent motion of the human foot from which foot abnormalities could be defined. This was a quantum leap in thought from previous authors who usually categorized feet by external appearance or even national origin. Manter, his contemporaries, and Root truly started a paradigm that helped define human foot function and ultimately the mechanical source of pathology. Has the value of this information been validated by other researchers today in the medical literature? Do clinicians know enough about the theory to apply it effectively? Hicks, in 1953, followed Manter’s work and expanded on the concept that there were normal mechanics; abnormal mechanics and the different in between normal and abnormal could be defined as pathology. The theme of these papers was still focused on defining normal joint motion, so that we could better see how abnormal motion produced deformities. Elfman, in 1960, began to investigate the abnormal motions relative to the earlie...|$|R
50|$|The complex {{motion of}} the {{subtalar}} joint occurs in three planes and produces subtalar inversion and eversion. Along with the <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> (i.e. talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joint), the subtalar joint transforms tibial rotation into forefoot supination and pronation. The axis of rotation in the joint is directed upward 42 degrees from the horizontal plane and 16 degrees medially from the midline of the foot. However, together, the subtalar facets form a screw or Archimedean spiral, right-handed in the right foot, about which subtalar motion occurs. So, during subtalar inversion, the calcaneus also rotates clockwise and translates forward along the axis of the screw. Average subtalar motion is 20-30 degrees inversion and 5-10 degrees eversion. Functional motion during the gait cycle is 10-15 degrees (the heel strikes the ground in slight inversion followed by quick eversion).|$|E

40|$|The calcaneocuboid joint was {{studied in}} ligamentous {{specimens}} of ten human feet, and in skeletons of two gorillas (Gorilla gorilla beringei), six chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), three orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and 25 human feet. The {{movement of the}} <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> was further studied in a living foot on a walk-way with a glass plate inserted, and with an underlying mirror. In man the joint is shaped as an asymmetrical sector of one end of an hour-glass shaped surface of revolution with its main axis oriented longitudinally in the foot. The calcaneocuboid joint becomes close packed by a pronation of the forefoot {{in relation to the}} hind foot because of a congruency between the joint surfaces obtained in this position and because the calcaneus overhangs the cuboid dorsally and stops the movement. At low gear push off the foot is inverted and the calcaneocuboid joint loose packed. The stresses are absorbed across the fibular, postaxial border of the foot. At high high gear push off there is a functional pronation of the forefoot with a stabilization of the <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> and a more effective tightening of the plantar aponeurosis. The foot becomes a rigid lever for propulsion. In contrast to the human condition, the anthropoid calcaneus has an anteromedial extension associated with symmetry of the calcaneocuboid joint. The calcaneus does not overhang the cuboid and {{there appears to be no}} close packed position. Correspondingly, the anthropoid foot has a mid-tarsal break at each push off in addition to the metatarsophalangeal break...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of the posterior tibial (PT) tendon is to stabilize the hindfoot against valgus and eversion forces. It functions as the primary invertor of the foot and assists the Achilles tendon in plantar flexion. The PT tendon is a stance phase muscle, firing from heel strike to shortly after heel lift-off. It decelerates subtalar joint pronation after heel contact. It functions as a powerful subtalar joint supinator and as a support of the medial longitudinal arch. The action of the tendon travels to the <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints,</b> locking them and allowing the gastrocnemius to support heel rise. Acute injuries of the PT tendon are rare and mostly affect the active middle-aged patient or they {{are the result of}} complex injuries to the ankle joint complex. Dys{{function of}} the PT tendon following degeneration and rupture, in contrast, has shown an increasing incidence in recent years. To which extent changed lifestyle, advancing age, comorbidities, and obesity play a role has not yet been clarified in detail. Dys{{function of the}} PT tendon results in progressive destabilization of the hind- and midfoot. Clinically, the ongoing deformation of the foot can be classified into four stages: in stage 1, the deformity is distinct and fully correctable; in stage II, the deformity is obvious, but still correctable; in stage III, the deformity has become stiff; and in stage IV, the ankle joint is also involved in the deformity. Treatment modalities depend on stage: while conservative measures may work in stage I, surgical treatment is mandatory for the later stages. Reconstructive surgery is advised in stage II, whereas in stage III and IV correcting and stabilizing arthrodeses are advised. A promising treatment option for stage IV may be adding an ankle prosthesis to a triple arthrodesis, as long as the remaining competence of the deltoid ligament is sufficient. An appropriate treatment is mandatory to avoid further destabilization and deformation of the foot. Failures of treatment result mostly from underestimation of the problem or insufficient treatment of existing instability and deformity...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship of form and function in the foot of four species of hominoid; Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, and Pongo pygmaeus. The study is both analytic and comparative; that is, objectives include both analysis of the funtioning of the anatomical system of the foot, and comparison of this system in several closely related organisms exhibiting very different types of positional behavior. The investigation utilizes the joint-link approach of Dempster, and focuses on the functional complex rather than the single structure. Analysis of a particular complex, such as a joint, integrates anatomical data relating to muscle and ligament size and disposition and joint configuration, with osteometric data pertaining {{to the size of}} articular surfaces and the shape and proportions of the osseus structures. Several new osteometric measurements have been derived which are more relevant in assessing function than previously used linear measures. ^ The four species with which this study is concerned exhibit very different types of positional behavior. Chimpanzees exhibit the widest range of behavior, being at home in the trees or on the ground. Gorillas are more terrestrial but are also capable of arboreal activities. The foot of these African pongids is more 2 ̆ 2 generalized 2 ̆ 2 than that of humans or orangs. The mobile tarsus can be stabilized in certain positions, and the powerful hallux {{can be used in a}} wide range of prehensile and non-prehensile activities. ^ Humans use the foot as a base of support and as a propulsive organ in bipedal striding and running. The stabilized tarsus and adducted hallux are used as levers in raising the center of gravity and are unsuited for activities in which the foot is used as a prehensile organ. The high, narrow tarsus, which adds resiliency to this part of the foot, necessitates a number of 2 ̆ 2 balancing 2 ̆ 2 adaptations to maintain body weight over the base of support and prevent uncontrolled movement and consequent strain at the talo-crural joint, in particular. For similar reasons, the long axes of the tibiae are parallel, and the plane of the talo-crural and subtalar joints are perpendicular to the line of gravity during bipedal activities. ^ Orangs are highly arboreal, usually supporting the body using the limbs in tension in a small branch setting. The highly prehensile foot emphasizes the lateral digits rather than the hallux in grasping the substrate. The tarsus is extremely mobile, especially in inversion, in order to allow foot placement in a wide variety of positions. Increased mobility, which occurs at the talo-crural as well as the subtalar and <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints,</b> is a result of differences between this and the other species in both osseus and soft-part (especially ligamentus) morphology. As a consequence, the tarsus is ill-suited for compressive weight-bearing, or for use as a lever for the plantar flexors of the foot in this species. In keeping with the emphasis on digital prehension, the lateral metatarsals and phalanges are extremely elongated, and the hallux is reduced in the orang. ^ When the total morphological pattern of the foot is considered, it is apparent that humans and African pongids are more similar to each other than they are to orangs. Somewhat different conclusions may be drawn if single structures only are compared. Generalizations regarding both habitus and heritage are commonly made from limited comparisons of anatomical structures. Problems with this practice are discussed in this dissertation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{chimpanzee}} foot {{is flexible}} near its middle, it can bend {{about the axis}} of the <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> whereas the human foot is a comparatively rigid arched platform. Flexion at the transverse tarsal joint—the ‘‘midtarsal break’’—uncouples the functions of a grasping, or prehensile, forefoot and a propulsive hindfoot during grasp-climbing on vertical or inclined supports. At some point after the transition to habitual bipedalism, these grasp-climbing adaptations were compromised by {{the evolution of the}} longitudinal arch, which permits increased mechanical advantage of the flexors of the ankle and im-proved endurance for long-distance walking and running. Ape, human, and Plio-Pleistocene hominid footprints were examined for the effects of a midtarsal break. The human footprint reflects arched-foot architecture, combined with a stiff-legged striding gait. Pressure releases occur at particular locations behind the ball and the great toe, or hallux.

40|$|A {{description}} is given of the functional morphology of the intrinsic joints of the foot, with particular {{reference to the}} primates, and an attempt is made to define the key human derived features. In the human subtalar joint the compromise axis has become reoriented into a very elevated position and more nearly {{in line with the}} functional foot axis than it is in subhuman primates. This provides for torque of the talus, and so the supported body weight, about the axis, during the stance phase of gait. In the subhuman primates the very oblique subtalar axis is important in inverting the foot into a grasping attitude. In subhuman primates the <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> complex {{plays an important role in}} supination of the forefoot, which complements inversion at the subtalar joint complex in achieving the ideal grasping position.

In man the calcaneocuboid joint has been remodelled so as to bring the lamina pedis into a close-packed position during the latter part of the stance phase of gait.

40|$|SummaryThe {{talonavicular}} (TN) {{joint and}} the three subtalar (ST) joints are linked anatomically and functionally. Together they form the subtalar joint complex, where movement occurs between the calcaneopedal unit (CPU) (entire foot except the talus) and the talotibiofibular unit (talus held tightly by the ankle mortise). Many are unaware of the TN joint's dual membership: it is {{a component of the}} subtalar joint complex (talocalcaneonavicular joint) and also the <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> (with the calcaneal-cuboid joint). The anatomy of the articulating surfaces, movement of the CPU when unloaded, shifts and changes in CPU shape with weight bearing, application to clinical tests and X-ray interpretation, and the pathophysiology applications to pes cavovarus, pes planovalgus and congenital talipes equinovarus (club foot) will be reviewed here. The CPU concept corresponds to a horizontal segmentation of the foot. This is a useful supplement to the two other segmentation methods: frontal (hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot) and sagittal (medial and lateral columns). This horizontal segmentation solves the issues with the ST joint complex, which straddles the hindfoot and midfoot, and also the issues with the dual membership of the TN joint. This concept makes it easier to understand foot deformities, better interpret the clinical and radiological signs and deduce logical treatments...|$|E
40|$|In this {{preliminary}} reconstruction of Homo naledi’s gait {{we begin with}} the null hypothesis that it walked similarly to modern humans, as the overall anatomy of this extinct hominin’s lower limb, especially its foot, is mostly modern human-like. We note the following characters as modern-like: dorsally-canting metatarsophalangeal joints facilitating toe-off, locking <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> implying a rigid midfoot during stance, flat subtalar joint limiting ankle pro- and supination, talocrural joint oriented orthogonally to the substrate, valgus knee, thick patellae increasing the moment arm for quadriceps femoris, and well-developed thigh muscle attachment sites throughout the femur. These characters suggest Homo naledi was welladapted to a striding bipedal gait. However, we also note the following less modern-like characters: curved pedal phalanges, low sustentaculum tali and likely a low fundamental longitudinal arch, pronounced tubercular insertion of the pes anserinus tendon on the proximomedial tibia, long femoral neck with a marked medial encroachment of the obturator externus, posteriorly positioned ilium relative to the acetabulum, flared iliac blades, broad lower ribcage, and characters of the lower thoracic vertebrae and lower rib suggesting robust hypaxial muscles. We offer our initial functional interpretations of the cumulative postcranial morphology, which suggests different trunk stabilization from modern humans but is consistent with orthogrady and an obligate bipedal locomotor regime.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{dependence}} of {{the movements of the}} calcaneus, cuboid, navicular, and talus on each other have been described as the tarsal gearbox. To provide a basis of its modeling, data on transmissions between <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> rotations within this gearbox are required. The feasibility of tibiocalcaneal rotations to predict <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> rotations is of interest because a meaningful relation would allow the use of common motion analysis with skin markers to investigate rearfoot kinematics. METHODS: We performed linear regression analyses between <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> and tibiocalcaneal rotations on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging of tibia and tarsal bone positions during quasi-static foot pronation and supination. RESULTS: In the frontal plane and transverse planes, linear models were found to predict <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> rotations quite well (r(2) = 0. 83 - 0. 97 for the frontal plane and r(2) = 0. 73 - 0. 95 for the transverse plane). For each degree of talocalcaneal rotation, there was 1. 8 degrees of talonavicular rotation in the frontal plane and 1. 6 degrees in the transverse plane; each degree of talocalcaneal rotation resulted in 0. 6 degrees of calcanealcuboid rotation in the frontal plane and 0. 7 degrees in the transverse plane; each degree of calcaneocuboid rotation resulted in 3 degrees of talonavicular rotation in the frontal plane and 2. 8 degrees in the transverse; each degree of tibiocalcaneal rotation resulted in 0. 9 degrees of talocalcaneal rotation in the frontal plane and 0. 9 degrees in the transverse plane; and each degree of tibiocalcaneal rotation resulted in 1. 6 degrees of talonavicular rotation in the frontal plane and 1. 3 degrees in the transverse plane.

40|$|Potential {{interest}} of dual-energy computed tomography in gout: focus on anatomical distribution and clinical association SIR, Gout is a chronic inflammatory arthritis resulting from long-standing hyperuricaemia, and {{is characterized by}} monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposits in joints and periarticular soft tissues [1]. Recently dual-energy CT (DECT) techniques have been introduced as a sensitive, non-invasive and reproducible imaging technique for de-tecting MSU deposits in clinical studies of gout patients [24]. The newly developed imaging modality, DECT, can provide more extensive information about the location of gouty MSU deposits and their association with clinical variables. The main goals of our study were to identify the anatomical distribution of urate crystals in affected foot and ankle joints and to define the relationships be-tween MSU crystal deposits and clinical parameters in gout patients using DECT. We consecutively enrolled a total of 101 gout patients (male, n = 96) who fulfilled the preliminary criteria for the classification of primary gout proposed by the ACR [5]. Patients with present symptoms or a previous history of gout in the ankles and feet {{were included in the}} study sample. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee at the Catholic University of Daegu. Informed consent was obtained at the time of study enrolment. Seventeen arbitrary locations were defined to identify anatomical locations of urate crystal deposits in the foot and ankle (see Fig. 1 A). The most clinically affected foot/ankle region was scanned in each patient. DECT scans were performed following Nicolaou et al. [3]. We identified 39 patients (38. 6 %) among a total of 101 gouty patients with urate crystal deposits in affected feet and ankles. Regardless of the volume or size of the de-posited crystals, a total of 82 urate crystal deposits from 39 gouty patients with crystals were identified (Fig. 1 B). The most frequent locations for urate crystal deposits were at the first MTP joint of the great toe (n = 18, 22. 0 %), around or at the junction of the ankle (n = 16, 19. 5 %), around the first IP joint (n = 12, 14. 6 %) and in the <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> (n = 12, 14. 6 %).

40|$|During {{normal weight}} bearing the ankle, sub talar and mid <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> {{function}} as a kinematic chain and their motions are interdependent. This chain has three important characteristics. Firstly, the motion {{in one of the}} components (joints) produces motion at the other components (joints). Secondly, the three joints are interdependent because the function of each is dependent on the position and motion at the other joints. Thirdly, the pattern of motion between the joints during weight bearing motion is fixed. The aim of this investigation was to determine the functional characteristics of the combined ankle, sub talar and mid <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> (the rearfoot complex). A non invasive in vivo kinematic assessment was conducted to determine the relative rotations at the ankle/sub talar complex, the mid <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> and the rearfoot complex, during weight bearing internal and external rotation of the leg in 25 subjects. The results confirm that the rearfoot joints operate as a kinematic chain. The motion at the ankle/sub talar complex suggests that the ankle is capable of a considerable range of transverse plane motion. The axes of rotation for the mid <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> described in this thesis are the first for this joint quantified from a kinematic assessment and thus supersede the theoretical axes for this joint described in the literature. The predominant motion in the overall rearfoot complex is transverse plane motion. This would suggest that the primary function of the foot is to permit transverse plane rotations of the leg and proximal structures whilst maintaining the foot in a stable position of the floor. In contrast to some of the literature, the ability of the foot to accommodate the transverse plane motion of the leg is a function of all three rearfoot joints...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 In the United States, falls are {{the number}} one cause of death and injury in adults {{over the age of}} 65. Many of these falls occur in the mediolateral {{direction}} and are attributed to extrinsic factors, such as uneven terrain. This study explored the stability effects and biomechanical adaptations of 10 healthy adults during ambulation over unexpected and coronally-uneven terrain. Experiments were conducted on a custom built walkway with an integrated disturbance device that was nominally flush with the walkway, but could also produce unexpected 15 ° inversions and unexpected 15 ° eversions. Unexpected eversions had the largest destabilizing effect on participant gait, as measured by both the range of coronal angular momentum and the minimum inclination angle. The disturbed limb played a role in maintaining stability, as suggested by the time integral of the external coronal moment it provided to the body not being equal between all conditions. Contributing to the corrective moment of the disturbed limb were the coronal moments provided by the hip and ankle strategies, whose time integrals were also not equal between all conditions (expected flush, and unexpected inversion/eversion). A multi-segment foot model revealed asymmetric kinematic adaptations to the uneven terrain that could be related to anatomical features. The ankle joint (comprised of the subtalar and tibiotalar joints) demonstrated more adaptation in the inversion than the eversion condition, as measured by the amount of inversion or eversion, respectively, of the hindfoot relative to the tibia in early and late-stance. By similar metrics, the midtarsal joint (comprised of the <b>transverse</b> <b>tarsal</b> and tarsometatarsal <b>joints)</b> demonstrated more adaptation in the eversion than the inversion condition. Kinetic adaptions of the ankle and midtarsal joints were significantly different between each of the conditions, but were not different for the grouped metatarsophalangeal joints. Like the disturbance itself, kinetic adaptations of the ankle and midtarsal joints were approximately equal and opposite for the inversion and eversion conditions. Clinically, the findings from this study suggest a sufficient coronal range of motion in the ankle joint is important for maintaining stability when ambulating over unexpected and coronally-uneven terrain; therefore, its preservation should be considered for certain orthopedic and prosthetic interventions as it may reduce the risk of patient falls...|$|R

40|$|Thirty-one {{patients}} with fracture-dislocations of the tarsometatarsal joint were examined {{to assess the}} functional end results after a mean follow-up of 2. 9 years (range 20 to 56 months). Sixty-one percent were polytrauma patients; 39 % suffered isolated fractures. Forty-five percent had associated lesions of the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> complex (Chopart and subtalar joint). According to the Baltimore Painful Foot Scoring System (PFS), 52 % achieved an excellent or good result and 48 % a fair or poor result. Of the four different treatment modalities, open reduction and temporary screw or K-wire fixation yielded the best results. The major determinants of acceptable results were the type of treatment, type of lesions, the quality of initial reduction and associated involvement of the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> complex. The extent of the initial injury was the determining factor {{in the development of}} late degenerative arthritis. Degenerative changes of the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> were seen in almost all cases (94 %). Such changes were more frequent after temporary screw fixation but did not seem to influence the final results. An initial anatomical reduction did not guarantee excellent results but minimized the chance of late degenerative arthritis. Primary arthrodesis demonstrated no advantage in our series. Although partial arthrodesis may be necessary in severely comminuted joints, it cannot be routinely advocated and should be used as a salvage procedure. status: publishe...|$|R

The cat was positive for feline syncytia-forming virus, and with his signalment, was diagnosed with feline chronic progressive polyarthritis...|$|R
40|$|A {{characteristic}} of all arthropods {{is the presence}} of flexible structures called joints that connect all leg segments. Drosophila legs include two types of joints: the proximal or "true" joints that are motile due to the presence of muscle attachment and the distal joints that lack musculature. These joints are not only morphologically, functionally and evolutionarily different, but also the morphogenetic program that forms them is distinct. Development of both proximal and distal joints requires Notch activity; however, it is still unknown how this pathway can control the development of such homologous although distinct structures. Here we show that the bHLH-PAS transcription factor encoded by the gene dysfusion (dys), is expressed and absolutely required for <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> development while it is dispensable for proximal joints. In the presumptive <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints,</b> Dys regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes reaper and head involution defective and the expression of the RhoGTPases modulators, RhoGEf 2 and RhoGap 71 E, thus directing key morphogenetic events required for <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> development. When ectopically expressed, dys is able to induce some aspects of the morphogenetic program necessary for distal joint development such as fold formation and programmed cell death. This novel Dys function depends on its obligated partner Tango to activate the transcription of target genes. We also identified a dedicated dys cis-regulatory module that regulates dys expression in the <b>tarsal</b> presumptive leg <b>joints</b> through direct Su(H) binding. All these data place dys as a key player downstream of Notch, directing distal versus proximal joint morphogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Flatfeet {{are divided}} into rigid and mobile forms. Rigid flatfeet usually lead to the {{development}} of pain. The most common reason of rigid flatfeet is a tarsal coalition. Mobility of the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> is checked by specific clinical tests. The study investigated the sensitivity and specificity of foot mobility tests - the “tip toes test”, Jack test, manual examination of passive and eversion and inversion. The study found the following parameters: the sensitivity of the “tip toes test”, Jack test was 87 % and 85 %, specificity - 65 % and 64 %. The sensitivity of the manual examination of passive and eversion and inversion was - 80 %, specificity - 88 %. The last test has a high specificity compared to the “tip toes test” and Jack test. Detection limits the mobility of the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> can be an indication for radiography for the detection of tarsal coalitions...|$|R
