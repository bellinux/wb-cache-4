5|$|In October 2011, the {{neighboring}} city of Alexandria, Virginia, approved plans to deploy 54 bicycles at six {{stations in the}} Old Town and Carlyle neighborhoods in 2012, <b>then</b> <b>add</b> six more stations in 2013. The cost {{of the first year}} would be $400,000, including operating costs of $100,440. The first eight Alexandria stations were deployed in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, <b>then</b> <b>add</b> the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E

50|$|Oil {{is heated}} in a stock-pot. The pork organs, shrimp, chicken and beef are stir-fried {{for about a}} minute. Soy sauce is <b>then</b> <b>added.</b> The shrimp is <b>then</b> <b>added</b> and left to simmer for a few minutes. This broth is <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to a bowl of noodles and topped with leeks, pork cracklings (chicharon) and {{sometimes}} a raw egg is cracked on top.|$|R
5000|$|Omija eungi (...) : Firstly, omija berries are boiled {{and honey}} is <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to the boiled omija. The boiled omija berries are taken out. Mung bean starch is <b>then</b> <b>added,</b> the liquid is boiled again.|$|R
5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 unit vector may be {{considered}} the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See the upper {{right corner of the}} diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, <b>then</b> <b>add</b> the vectors together. The line representing the sum of the vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} {{on the first two}} albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright. Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for {{the final version of the}} song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between Page and Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would <b>then</b> <b>add</b> lyrics before Page and Bonham developed their parts.|$|E
25|$|While {{hot press}} {{them through a}} fine sieve, with a silver spoon till nought but the skin remains, <b>then</b> <b>add</b> a little mace, 3 nutmegs, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and pepper to taste.|$|E
5000|$|The nougat {{chocolate}} {{center is}} made by whipping egg whites until they are light and frothy. Sugar syrup is <b>then</b> <b>added,</b> stabilizing the foam and creating [...] "frappé." [...] Other flavoring ingredients are <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to the frappé to create specific flavors.|$|R
50|$|S'mores {{are most}} {{typically}} cooked over a campfire by first roasting the marshmallow over the flame {{until it is}} golden brown. The marshmallow is <b>then</b> <b>added</b> on top of half of a graham cracker {{and a piece of}} chocolate. The second half of the cracker is <b>then</b> <b>added</b> on top.|$|R
50|$|Another {{division}} was <b>then</b> <b>added</b> in 1977, creating four divisions.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} Boxee Beta {{and later}} has {{the option of}} monitoring Twitter and Facebook news feeds to automatically discover links to videos, Boxee will <b>then</b> <b>add</b> those videos to a watch queue in Boxee {{so they can be}} later viewed.|$|E
25|$|If the hundreds-row {{does have}} a thousands-digit, <b>then</b> <b>add</b> to it the carry-digit from the {{previous}} row (if there is no carry-digit then {{think of it as}} a 0) and write the single-digit sum in the hundred-thousands-column under the second line.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} a graph {{requiring}} 5 colors, then {{there is a}} minimal such graph, where removing any vertex makes it four-colorable. Call this graph G. Then G cannot have a vertex of degree 3 or less, because if d(v) ≤ 3, we can remove v from G, four-color the smaller graph, <b>then</b> <b>add</b> back v and extend the four-coloring to it by choosing a color different from its neighbors.|$|E

50|$|The {{procedure}} {{starts with}} 100 g graphite and 50 g of sodium nitrate in sulfuric acid at 66 °C {{which is then}} cooled to 0 °C. 300 g of potassium permanganate is <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to the solution and stirred. Water is <b>then</b> <b>added</b> in increments until the solution is approximately 32 liters.|$|R
50|$|Hot {{tertiary}} air is <b>then</b> <b>added</b> {{to oxidize}} the remaining CO.|$|R
25|$|The Purana {{presents}} seven {{teachers and}} their hagiographic stories, describing for example Kapila, the Samkhya philosopher, as someone who was born as a full grown adult, who teaches his mother {{that in order to}} reach liberation, she must have bhakti, jnana (wisdom), and vairagya (dispassion), with bhakti being the most important. Other teachers such as Narada and Suka described in the Purana, however, present Bhakti with less prominence, and emphasize Advaita philosophy and Jnana yoga instead but <b>then</b> <b>add</b> that adoring Hari (Krishna) has the same liberating benefits.|$|E
25|$|When {{adding a}} vertex v {{to a larger}} graph L that equals the line graph of another graph G, let S be the {{subgraph}} of G formed by the edges that correspond to the neighbors of v in L. Check that S has a vertex cover consisting of one vertex or two non-adjacent vertices. If there are two vertices in the cover, augment G by adding an edge (corresponding to v) that connects these two vertices. If {{there is only one}} vertex in the cover, <b>then</b> <b>add</b> a new vertex to G, adjacent to this vertex.|$|E
25|$|Another type of punch, {{traditionally}} served {{before the}} departure of a hunting party in England, but now served {{at a variety of}} social events such as garden parties, cricket, tennis matches, and picnics, cups are generally lower in alcohol content than other punches and usually use wine, cider, sloe gin, or liqueurs as the base. They often include quantities of fruit juices or soft drinks. One well known cup is the Pimm's Cup, using Pimm's №1 and British-style lemonade at a ratio of 1:2; a squeeze of lemon; <b>then</b> <b>add</b> orange, lemon and apple slices; a couple of cucumber wedges; and decorate with borage flowers.|$|E
5000|$|These bound antibody/antigen {{complexes}} are <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to an antigen-coated well.|$|R
5000|$|Chilled water, olive oil, {{vinegar and}} salt are <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to taste.|$|R
5000|$|This {{group can}} be {{determined}} by adding the salt in water and <b>then</b> <b>adding</b> dilute hydrochloric acid. A white precipitate is formed, to which ammonium hydroxide is <b>then</b> <b>added.</b> If the precipitate is insoluble, then Pb2+ is present; if the precipitate is soluble, then Ag+ is present, and if the white precipitate turns black, then Hg is present.|$|R
25|$|One common {{solution}} is to form the enolate of one partner first, and <b>then</b> <b>add</b> the other partner under kinetic control. Kinetic control means that the forward aldol addition reaction must be significantly faster than the reverse retro-aldol reaction. For this approach to succeed, two other conditions must also be satisfied; it must be possible to quantitatively form the enolate of one partner, and the forward aldol reaction must be significantly faster than {{the transfer of the}} enolate from one partner to another. Common kinetic control conditions involve the formation of the enolate of a ketone with LDA at −78°C, followed by the slow addition of an aldehyde.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the players}} is the scorer and has written the bids down, so that during the play and for the scoring afterward, this {{information}} {{will be available to}} all the players. When a hand is over, the scores should be recorded next to the bids. Alternatively, the scorer can turn the bid into the contract score by writing in the number of bags (zero if there were none) behind the bid, and a minus sign before it if the team was set, <b>then</b> <b>add</b> bonuses and subtract penalties beneath. A running score should be kept so that players can readily see each other's total points.|$|E
25|$|Cradle-to-gate is an {{assessment}} of a partial product life cycle from resource extraction (cradle) to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations (EPD) termed business-to-business EDPs. One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can <b>then</b> <b>add</b> the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.|$|E
50|$|Two {{fundamental}} {{operations are}} <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to all rewrite rules: wrapping and concatenation.|$|R
50|$|It {{was shot}} as a silent film, with a music soundtrack <b>then</b> <b>added</b> later.|$|R
50|$|Penicillium is <b>then</b> <b>added</b> to the {{finished}} product, which produces its characteristic green veins.|$|R
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the hundreds-column will contain three digits: the hundreds-digit of the ones-row, the tens-digit of the tens-row, and the ones-digit of the hundreds-row. Find the sum of these three digits, then if there is a carry-digit from the tens-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the hundreds-column) <b>then</b> <b>add</b> this carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit then write it down under the second line in the hundreds-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the hundreds-column, and carry the first digit over to the thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten thousands-digit under the line.|$|E
25|$|This service {{begins with}} the Barechu, the formal public call to prayer, and Shema Yisrael embraced by two benedictions before and two after. Ashkenazim outside of Israel (except Chabad-Lubavitch and {{followers}} of the Vilna Gaon) <b>then</b> <b>add</b> another blessing (Baruch Adonai le-Olam), which is made from a tapestry of biblical verses. (This prayer is also said by Baladi Temanim {{in and out of}} Israel.) This is followed by the Half-Kaddish, and the Shemoneh Esreh (Amidah), bracketed with the full Kaddish. Sephardim then say Psalm 121, say the Mourner's Kaddish, and repeat Barechu before concluding with the Aleinu. Ashkenazim, in the diaspora, do neither say Psalm 121 nor repeat Barechu, but conclude with Aleinu followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (in Israel, Ashkenazim do repeat Barcheu after mourner's Kaddish).|$|E
25|$|The Apocrypha patch {{introduced}} into Eve Online {{a new type}} of ship: the Tech III (T3) strategic cruiser. These highly advanced starships gain their unique qualities by being manufactured from material recovered from beyond wormholes, another new feature introduced by Apocrypha. Strategic cruisers are quite rare and expensive, and require unique skillsets on the part of manufacturers that allow the reverse engineering and integration of highly advanced technologies recovered from dead or dormant ancient civilizations. They differ from other ships in that they are modular. Players start with a hull and <b>then</b> <b>add</b> five subsystems to it, the choice of which can dramatically change the ship's character, giving it a different layout of module slots, different preferred weapon systems, and abilities such as being able to fit covert cloaks or ignore some warp disruption effects.|$|E
