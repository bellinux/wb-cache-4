40|$|In 1995 and 1996, we trained 2 {{groups of}} costume-reared greater sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis tabida) (10 in 1995, 14 in 1996) {{to follow a}} truck. Thereafter we led 10 in 1995 and 12 in 1996 from Garland Prairie, {{northern}} Arizona, to the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, southern Arizona (ca. 620 km). These techniques were being developed to create additional, disjunct populations of the whooping crane (G. americana). The cranes taught the migration route in 1995 did not follow the desired migration route in 1996 but did travel north 140 km along the route in spring 1997. By the summer of 1997, {{we did not know}} the locations of any of these birds. Results were better for the 1996 <b>trucking</b> <b>cranes.</b> Between 1997 and 1999 there was a 92 % (11 of 12) success rate for the 1996 <b>trucking</b> <b>cranes</b> with known locations flying unassisted from the summering to wintering grounds.

50|$|These {{telescopic}} cranes are single-engine machines, {{with the}} same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane, similar to a crawler crane. In a rough terrain crane, the engine is usually mounted in the undercarriage {{rather than in the}} upper, as with crawler crane. Most have 4 wheel drive and 4 wheel steering which allows them to traverse tighter and slicker terrain than a standard <b>truck</b> <b>crane</b> with less site prep. In addition, there are rough terrain cranes with the operating cab mounted on the lower as opposed to the P&H in the above image.|$|E
50|$|A crane {{mounted on}} a truck carrier {{provides}} the mobility {{for this type of}} crane. This crane has two parts: the carrier, {{often referred to as the}} Lower, and the lifting component which includes the boom, referred to as the Upper. These are mated together through a turntable, allowing the upper to swing from side to side. These modern hydraulic <b>truck</b> <b>cranes</b> are usually single-engine machines, with the same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane. The upper is usually powered via hydraulics run through the turntable from the pump mounted on the lower. In older model designs of hydraulic <b>truck</b> <b>cranes,</b> there were two engines. One in the lower pulled the crane down the road and ran a hydraulic pump for the outriggers and jacks. The one in the upper ran the upper through a hydraulic pump of its own. Many older operators favor the two-engine system due to leaking seals in the turntable of aging newer design cranes. Hiab invented the world's first hydraulic <b>truck</b> mounted <b>crane</b> in 1947. The name, Hiab, comes from the commonly used abbreviation of Hydrauliska Industri AB, a company founded in Hudiksvall, Sweden 1944 by Eric Sundin, a ski manufacturer who saw a way to utilize a truck's engine to power loader cranes through the use of hydraulics.|$|R

5000|$|Despite doubts {{expressed}} by Dalfino, the authorities started bussing the immigrants from around midday to the Stadio della Vittoria , an {{out of use}} stadium, {{where they would be}} kept until their deportation. By the afternoon the Albanians had understood that they were ultimately to be sent home, groups of them tried to force their way through the police cordon surrounding the stadium, with many managing to escape, the authorities then decided to stop bringing anyone to the stadium and close the gates, locking them inside. The situation spun further out of control, the stadium's groundsman was effectively held hostage until the intervention of the mayor, personnel supervising the fair handling out of food were assaulted and the police then evacuated the stadium, leaving it as a lawless zone controlled by the most violent elements (some armed with firearms). Food and water was literally thrown over the wall by the authorities using a fire <b>truck</b> <b>crane,</b> which meant it was mostly appropriated by the before-mentioned thugs.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{investigation}} in Vado in 1983 {{he has led}} teams all over the world. His teams' findings include uncovering wild primates smuggled to British laboratories from Gambia, massive mortalities in wild birds caught for pets in Senegal. From 1987-1989 he was undercover in Dubai and Ajman (UAE), Tanzania, Kenya, Singapore and Hong Kong posing as a journalist, photographer, tourist or ivory dealer. His work helped uncover the trade routes and dealers in poached ivory. In 1987 he was famously hoisted, with cameraman Clive Lonsdale, on a forklift <b>truck</b> <b>crane</b> to the top shelf of a warehouse in Dubai to photograph the neighbouring unit. Through a small hole cut in the cardboard packing case they filmed for 45 minutes the poached ivory being worked in the Poon brothers clandestine ivory factory. The documentation proved crucial in unravelling the ivory pipeline and EIA's successful launch of a campaign for an international ivory ban achieved in 1989.|$|E

50|$|The level-headed master sniper of Team Optimus Prime, Inferno {{transforms}} into a {{fire engine}} and possesses the Spark of Combination, frequently combining with Hot Shot. He tended to play no major role until the Autobots were transported {{to a new}} region of space where Alpha Q had successfully recreated the planets destroyed by Unicron. Here, on Iron Planet, Inferno was charged with guarding Shockblast, but an attack by the Decepticons saw Megatron infuse Inferno with his own energies, trying to brand him with the Decepticon symbol and turn him to his side. Inferno fought the influence {{in a series of}} Jekyll-and-Hyde-like transformations, eventually plunging himself into the Energon Sun when he couldn't hold it back no more. Thankfully, Jetfire was able to recover his Spark and had a new body constructed for him, recreating Inferno as Roadblock (Inferno V in Japan), who now transformed into a <b>truck</b> <b>crane.</b> For much of the remainder of the series, Roadblock was staying at Ocean Planet, until Optimus called to him. Joining with the other Autobots, they merged into Optimus Supreme, fighting a Unicron-possessed Galvatron.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To more {{accurately}} learn reliability on anti-overturning stability for a <b>truck</b> <b>crane,</b> a parametric multi-body dynamics model is {{built in a}} dynamic software environment with overall key parameters as design variables. On this basis, stability criteria of this <b>truck</b> <b>crane</b> are established according to the working conditions and crane dynamics simulation results. After a truncated normal distribution sampling method is given for design variables which will effect on truck crane's stability, the reliability analysis of this <b>truck</b> <b>crane</b> is done via Monte Carlo method. The result indicates that the truck crane's stability reliability is 0. 9998 in the most dangerous working condition. Analysis shows that the reliability calculation of <b>truck</b> <b>crane</b> anti-overturning stability is feasible using modern multi-body dynamics and Monte Carlo method, {{and the results are}} more accurate than conventional safety factor method...|$|E
