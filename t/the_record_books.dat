5|$|In 1991, {{two people}} were {{interested}} in buying the track: Fred Weisman, a California businessman, and former National Football League player Mark May. Weisman out-bid May and purchased Rosecroft out of bankruptcy for $18.2 million. On November 23 of the same year, the grandstand caught fire {{a few hours before}} live racing began. In Weisman's first full season of operations, Rosecroft experienced a 10.5 percent increase in handle and an 8.3 percent increase in attendance. In 1992, Western Hanover, the richest horse of that year, won two of the three Triple Crown races, including the Messenger Stakes at Rosecroft. Rosecroft Raceway went into <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>books</b> on October 10, 1992, when a three-horse dead heat occurred in the seventh race. It was the 17th time in harness-racing history and the first time in Maryland history.|$|E

5|$|The first Olympic men's javelin throw contest {{was held}} in 1908 and a women's {{competition}} was introduced in 1932. The first javelins were made of various types of wood, but in the 1950s, former athlete Bud Held introduced a hollow javelin, then a metal javelin, both of which increased throwers performances. Another former athlete, Miklós Németh invented the rough-tailed javelin and throws reached in excess of 100m – edging towards the limits of stadia. The distances and {{the increasing number of}} horizontal landings led the IAAF to redesign the men's javelin to reduce distance and increase the implement's downward pitching moment to allow for easier measurement. Rough-tailed designs were banned in 1991 and all marks achieved with such javelins were removed from <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>books.</b> The women's javelin underwent a similar redesign in 1999. The current javelin specifications are 2.6 to 2.7m in length and 800grams in weight for men, and 2.2 to 2.3m and 600g for women.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{win against}} Sunderland, Spurs played Wigan {{in a home}} fixture. In what would become an {{historic}} fixture, Tottenham won 9–1. Redknapp chose to start with Peter Crouch up front with Defoe, and the move paid off as Spurs took the lead after a Crouch header from an Aaron Lennon cross that put Spurs 1–0 up at half-time. The second half entered <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>books</b> as Spurs scored eight goals, five coming from Defoe. Other goals came from Lennon and Niko Kranjčar, along with a David Bentley free-kick, originally given as a Chris Kirkland own goal before the dubious goal panel awarded the effort to Bentley. It became Tottenham's biggest ever Premier League win, the second biggest in Premier League history, and {{only the second time}} any team had scored nine goals in the Premier League since its inception in 1992. Defoe also got himself in <b>the</b> <b>record</b> <b>books,</b> becoming only the third player to score five goals in a Premier League match, the others being Andy Cole and Alan Shearer.|$|E
