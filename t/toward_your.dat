Some multiplayer maps are based in the island of Rhodes. Among the new additions is a new multiplayer mode— Deathmatch— which differs from the previous multiplayer gameplay in that there is no compass pointing <b>toward</b> <b>your</b> assigned target, rather, there is a box in the top right of the screen where your current target is displayed, which glows blue when you enter the line of sight of your target. There is also Simple Deathmatch, which also removes the abilities and perks from the players.|$|E

2500|$|John Chrysostom {{described}} slavery as 'the {{fruit of}} covetousness, of degradation, of savagery ... {{the fruit of}} sin, [...] of [...] rebellion against ... our true Father' in his Homilies on Ephesians. Moreover, quoting partly from Paul the Apostle, Chrysostom opposed unfair and unjust forms of slavery by giving these instructions to those who owned slaves: [...] " [...] 'And ye masters', he continues, 'do the same things unto them'. The same things. What are these? 'With good-will do service' ... and 'with fear and trembling' ... toward God, fearing lest He one day accuse you for your negligence <b>toward</b> <b>your</b> slaves ... 'And forbear threatening;' be not irritating, he means, nor oppressive ... {{the law of the}} common Lord and Master of all ... doing good to all alike ... dispensing the same rights to all".

2500|$|Pro ranking {{points are}} similar to the National {{armateur}} points awards. [...] "A" [...] Pros get the equivalent of National Intermediate points. i.e. 120 for first, 100 points for second etc. [...] "AA" [...] Pro get Expert equivalent points i.e. 240 for first etc. Both like in the amateur classes get participant points if the racer makes the Main. The person with the most points in a season will be District Pro #1, the same is true to become state Pro #1. However, on the national level not only you must receive the most points, you must race in at least 10 nationals plus the Grand Nationals, the ABA's multi-day season ending event, for the best 10 of your finishes will go <b>toward</b> <b>your</b> national rankings. For example, if you participate in 13 national events, your best 10 will be considered and your worst three disregarded. You must meet this qualification on the national level to wear National numbers one though ten on your number plate the following year.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{old days}} of the IBMXF when you raced an IBMXF sanctioned race you {{received}} NBL state points and points that went <b>toward</b> <b>your</b> international standing, but no national NBL points that counted toward contention for national number one plates. The World Championship title was open to 16 & over Experts and older amateurs in the 20" [...] class as well as Pros in the 20" [...] class. There is a class in European BMX called Superclass. In this class, which is ahead of Expert and the last step before going pro, amateurs race for and win money, an odd contradiction of the generally accepted definition of amateur. However, no racer in Superclass could win more than US$200 per event and keep their amateur standing. This class has been carried over in the UCI after the merger with the IBMXF. In the United States IBMXF affiliate the NBL, Superclass is the equivalent of the old [...] "B" [...] pro class and [...] "A" [...] pro is now called the Elite as per UCI practice. However, for the first few years the IBMXF while there was a pro class, the professionals did not race for money but trophies just like the amateurs and the prestige of being declared World Champions with its associate side benefits in marketing. It was not until 1987 did the pro race for award purses at the IBMXF World Championships.|$|E
