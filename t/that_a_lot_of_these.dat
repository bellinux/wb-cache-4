2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, {{but it was not}} designed that way. We also {{wanted to make sure that}} as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E

He was also involved in legal and illegal diamond buying in the diamond fields, horse theft and highway robberies. He was caught and sentenced several times for these crimes, but, always managed to escape somehow and claimed that no prison cell could hold him.

5000|$|In July 2016 Kevin McKeever, a Labour {{politician}} and partner in Portland Communications, {{a public relations}} firm accused of playing an instrumental role {{in an attempt to}} force the resignation of Jeremy Corbyn received an alleged death threat telling him he should [...] "prepare to be coxed". Commenting on the incident, and others in which MPs had received threats, Ruth Price, Cox's parliamentary assistant, urged people to [...] "move away from the baseless, nasty and intimidating abuse MPs currently face". Jo Cox's murder was also explicitly referenced in the social media posts {{of a man who was}} jailed for four months in April 2017 for making death threats towards the then MP for Eastbourne Caroline Ansell of the Conservative party. Two months after the death of Jo Cox at least 25 MPs received identical death threats, including the Labour MP Chris Bryant. Bryant noted that the threats were [...] "particularly disturbing ... in <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> threats are to women. I think women MPs, gay MPs, ethnic minority MPs get the brunt of it”.|$|E
5000|$|Writer Matt Bondurant {{wrote the}} {{historical}} novel The Wettest County in the World (2008), {{based on the}} Prohibition-era bootlegging activities of his grandfather Jack Bondurant and his grand-uncles Forrest and Howard. Producers Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher optioned the book in 2008 {{and sent it to}} director John Hillcoat. [...] Hillcoat later commented, [...] "Bootlegging sort of drew Bondurants into this crazy kind of world of corruption and lawlessness ironically, but then mostly they survived, they got through it all and actually went on to have businesses and children. And traditionally the gangster film teaches us that we've got to pay for our sins. Usually the gangster is shot down in a blaze of glory and doesn't get up again."Hillcoat and screenwriter Nick Cave, who had worked together on the Western film The Proposition (2005), were attracted to the story by the success of the Bondurants. Hillcoat also said, [...] "we also loved the idea that it sort of touched on the whole immortality <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> guys start to feel when they do survive so many strange experiences." ...|$|E
5000|$|And {{the first}} time I was {{introduced}} to this whole program when I as a young surgeon, was asked to do serial biopsies on their livers {{to see what the}} effect of the virus was in the production of the changes in the liver. And in that way, I got to know <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> young men had no idea that the risk they were taking also included death. And some of those youngsters did die {{and it was a very}} difficult thing for me to be part of, because you know, you’re powerless, when you’re part of the big team.It couldn't happen today. Internal Review Boards would not permit the use of a live virus in human subjects unless they really understood what was going to happen to them. And I doubt that even if they knew what the risk was, that an Internal Review Board in any academic institution would consent to that kind of experimental work. [...] The hepatitis research was instrumental in determining a virus is responsible for the disease and that it is transmitted through human filth, serum and drinking water.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to his 'rough, jagged lines', Bevan's work is characterised by a limitation placed on his colour palette, and his addition of grit or sand to the acrylic paint he uses. Although this handling has led some critics to associate Bevan with the School of London, this connection has been disputed, most notably by Grace Glueck in The New York Times. So it is possibly more accurate to link Bevan to artists like Steven Campbell, Ken Currie and Peter Howson, who also came to prominence in the 1980s, and like Bevan worked under a noticeable influence from 'expressionistic' forms of German art. Bevan himself wrote his thesis at art school on the highly expressive German eighteenth-century sculptor, Franz Xaver Messerschmidt, and acknowledged Messerschmidt's influence on his own work. In an interview in 2011 Bevan stated: 'I've used elements Messerschmidt in the past, but recently I decided to work specifically through these sculptures. So I used formal elements from the sculptures to make self-portraits because it's believed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sculptures were self-portraits. So I used the formal elements of his to work through my own self-portraits.' ...|$|E
5000|$|After a {{deal with}} Total/BMG, {{everything}} began to fall apart during 1992. After a final single [...] "Darling Darling Baby" [...] (MOTC 114) with Edwin Starr, it was all over, Levine close to being declared bankrupt. By that time, a total of 770 songs had been recorded.Levine {{managed to get a}} US deal with Miami-based Hot Productions which began releasing a Motorcity anthology plus Best of compilations by the artists and succeeded in getting much of the previously unreleased material out. 20 Best of Motorcity Records volumes were released over the years 1993-96 and 30 more had been planned to follow during 1997-98, including 80 new tracks Levine would record with Pat Lewis and Brenda Holloway during those years. Hot Productions, however, closed down towards the end of 1997 before all 50 volumes had been released. Levine's Motorcity recordings continue to be released on various compilations, and Levine himself has recorded new backing tracks for more than 120 of the songs to create a more authentic sound. Songs like Ronnie McNeir's [...] "Lucky Number", Carolyn Crawford's [...] "Timeless" [...] and The Elgins' [...] "Don't Wait Around" [...] have since received more praise on the UK soul scene than the first time round. The fact remains <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> artists were recorded for the very last time, many of them have since died - including Mary Wells, Herman Griffin, David Ruffin, Hattie Littles, Saundra Edwards of The Elgins, Edwin Starr, Joe Stubbs and many more.|$|E
5000|$|Ramberg is {{best known}} for her depictions of partial female bodies (heads, torsos, hands) forced into {{submission}} by undergarments and imagined in odd, erotic predicaments. The motif of the female torso is most common; it is corseted, girdled, and otherwise constricted and veiled by the bondage-like accoutrements of typical 1950s female garments. Ramberg relates a memory of watching her mother dress for a party in an interview: [...] "She would wear these—I guess that they are called 'Merry Widows'—and I can remember being stunned by how it transformed her body, how it pushed up her breasts and slenderized down her waist. I think that the paintings {{have a lot to do}} with this, with watching and realizing <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> undergarments totally transform a woman's body. … I thought it was fascinating … in some ways, I thought it was awful." [...] The motif of the [...] "hairdo" [...] is likewise common in Ramberg's oeuvre, the hairstyle also being indicative of a type of midcentury female [...] "conditioning" [...] or conformity. Critic Katheryn Rosenfeld, in a 2000 New Art Examiner review states: [...] "it's... hard not to read in the work a psychosexual inventory of the limitations of white middle-class womanhood at mid-century." [...] Indeed, Ramberg has been characterized as being the Chicago Imagist equivalent of Lee Krasner to the Jackson Pollock male artists of the movement (such ad Ed Paschke and Jim Nutt) who frequently receive the lion's share of the art movement's attention (Ramberg was also married to Philip Hanson, a lesser-known member).|$|E
