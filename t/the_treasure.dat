5|$|However, upon {{finding the}} diary, Pete shows up, holding Donald's nephews hostage in {{exchange}} for the diary. After giving Pete the diary, Donald travels to Pete's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back. The diary reveals that the map, when dipped in water, will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure. Donald flies to the island where <b>the</b> <b>treasure</b> is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach <b>the</b> <b>treasure</b> vault. After defeating the ancient spirit guarding <b>the</b> <b>treasure,</b> Donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue. When the disappointed Donald returns home, Huey, Dewey and Louie accidentally break the statue, which reveals a golden jeweled necklace was hidden inside. Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn. Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find {{the wreck of the}} Unicorn. Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find <b>the</b> <b>treasure.</b> Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not to the location of the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left <b>the</b> <b>treasure</b> but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to <b>the</b> <b>treasure</b> on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} a treasure trove, meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported a treasure trove promptly with money equivalent to the market value of <b>the</b> <b>treasure,</b> with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire <b>the</b> <b>treasure.</b> In November 1993, <b>the</b> <b>Treasure</b> Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of <b>the</b> <b>treasure.</b> He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} two adaptations, both done by Clark, the tales were adapted {{by a number of}} playwrights and screenwriters. In most {{instances}} the adaptations alter the original source material. For example, A Warning to the Curious frequently deviates from its literary source. The screenplay avoids the convoluted plot structure of M. R. James's original, opting for a more linear construction and reducing the number of narrators. In addition the central character, Paxton, is changed from a young fair-haired innocent who stumbles across <b>the</b> <b>treasure</b> to a middle-aged character driven by poverty to seek <b>the</b> <b>treasure</b> and acting in full awareness of what he is doing.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop.

Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game.
