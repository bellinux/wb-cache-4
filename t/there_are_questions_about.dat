5|$|Hundreds of books, {{articles}} and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS {{recognized as an}} important subgroup. Whether it {{should be seen as}} distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. In 2013, DSM-5 eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the {{external}} {{validity of the}} AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E
25|$|The two radical {{groups have}} used the {{conflict}} to expand and consolidate, an obvious fact accepted by the Pentagon. AQAP's most determined opponent, the Houthis, disengaged to face rival Yemeni militias {{at the same time}} as they were being hit by coalition air strikes; Yemeni troops in the south remained in their bases instead of confronting al-Qaeda militants, fearing Saudi air strikes on any troop movements. With the destruction of much of Yemen's military infrastructure by the coalition, even once peace is achieved, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the ability of the country to confront its Islamist militancy problem.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} a rematch {{of an early}} regular-season contest, but even though Georgia Tech won that game, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> whether the victory would be repeated. Twice before, the two teams matched in the ACC Championship Game had played earlier that season.

500|$|The Initiative's {{goals are}} {{gradually}} made clearer. A recurring character {{since the second}} season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, {{spending more time with}} Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during [...] "The I in Team". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is [...] "Mommy", which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{than two}} decades after the {{widespread}} introduction of AS to English-speaking audiences, {{there are hundreds of}} books, articles and websites describing it; prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS recognized as an important subgroup. However, questions remain concerning many aspects of AS; whether it should be a separate condition from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study. The diagnostic validity of Asperger syndrome is tentative, there is little consensus among clinical researchers about the usage of the term [...] "Asperger's syndrome", and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. It is likely that the definition of the condition will change as new studies emerge and it will eventually be understood as a multifactorial heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder involving a catalyst that results in prenatal or perinatal changes in brain structures.|$|E
