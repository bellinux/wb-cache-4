5|$|Frazier {{demands to}} inspect the hostages before {{allowing}} <b>the</b> <b>robbers</b> to leave and Russell takes him {{on a tour of}} the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another of <b>the</b> <b>robbers.</b> Afterwards he explains that he deliberately tried to provoke Russell and judges that the man is not a killer. However, this is disproven when <b>the</b> <b>robbers</b> execute one of the hostages.|$|E

Russell, the leader of <b>the</b> <b>robbers,</b> demands food and the police supply them with pizzas whose boxes include listening devices. The bugs pick up a language which the police identify as Albanian. They discover, however, that the conversations are in fact propaganda recordings of deceased Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha, implying that <b>the</b> <b>robbers</b> anticipated the attempted surveillance.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of cops and <b>robbers</b> on <b>the</b> grid where <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> is allowed to move faster than the cops. It {{is well known that}} two cops are {{necessary}} and sufficient to catch <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> on any finite grid when <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> has unit speed. Here, we prove that when the speed of <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> is a sufficiently large constant, the number of cops needed to catch <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> on an n × n grid is (Ω(n / n)).

50|$|The {{entanglement}} game {{is played}} by n cops against a robber ona directed graph G. Initially, all cops are outside the graph and <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> selects an arbitrary starting vertexv of G. Further on, the players move in turn. In each move the cops either stay where they are, or place oneof them on the vertex currently occupied by <b>the</b> <b>robber.</b> <b>The</b> <b>robber</b> must move from her current vertex, along an edge,to a successor that is not occupied by a cop. <b>The</b> <b>robber</b> must move if no cop is following him. If there isno free successor to which <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> can move, she is caught, and the cops win. <b>The</b> <b>robber</b> wins if shecannot be caught, i.e. if the play {{can be made to}} last forever.|$|R
5|$|The {{execution}} prompts the ESU team into action. They plan {{to storm}} {{the bank and}} use rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that <b>the</b> <b>robbers</b> have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, <b>the</b> <b>robbers</b> detonate smoke grenades and release the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from <b>the</b> <b>robbers.</b> A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props for faking the execution, but no money or valuables {{appear to have been}} stolen. With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case.|$|E

While {{scouting}} caves, Indy discovers {{a group of}} grave robbers who have found a golden crucifix belonging to Coronado and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men give chase through a passing circus train, leaving Indy with a bloody cut across his chin from a bullwhip and a new phobia of snakes. Indy escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to <b>the</b> <b>robbers.</b> Impressed with Indy's bravery, the leader of <b>the</b> <b>robbers</b> gives Indy his fedora, and encourages him to not give up.|$|E

As he is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts <b>the</b> <b>robbers</b> and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk not to mention his involvement to the police and leaves the station.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a variation of}} <b>the</b> Cops and <b>Robber</b> game where <b>the</b> cops can only see <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> when <b>the</b> distance between them is at most a fixed parameter `. We consider the basic consequences of this definition for some simple graph families, and show that this model is not monotonic, unlike common models where <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> is invisible. We see that cops’ strategy consists of a phase in which they need to “see” <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> (move within distance ` of <b>the</b> <b>robber),</b> followed by a phase in which they capture <b>the</b> <b>robber.</b> In some graphs the first phase is the most resource intensive phase (in terms of number of cops needed), while in other graphs, {{it is the second}} phase.

50|$|<b>The</b> Friendly <b>Robber</b> {{is a small}} rule {{variation}} {{that may}} be combined in any Catan scenario - it stipulates that <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> (and <b>the</b> pirate) may not be moved to a hex bordering settlements belonging to a player with two victory points (or fewer—possible with the Poor Settler tile in The Rivers of Catan). Should <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> {{not be able to}} move to any hex, <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> is moved to a desert hex (or presumably removed entirely from the game board if the variation does not have desert hex). If <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> is moved to a desert hex (either intentionally or {{as a result of this}} rule), the player moving <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> may only take resources from players with at least three victory points.|$|R

40|$|AbstractConsider the {{following}} game of a cop locating a robber on a connected graph. At each turn, the cop chooses a vertex of the graph to probe and receives {{the distance from}} the probe to <b>the</b> <b>robber.</b> If she can uniquely locate <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> after this probe, then she wins. Otherwise <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> may either stay put or move to any vertex adjacent to his location other than the probe vertex. The cop’s goal is to minimize the number of probes required to locate <b>the</b> <b>robber,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>robber’s</b> goal is to avoid being located. This is a synthesis of <b>the</b> cop and <b>robber</b> game with <b>the</b> metric dimension problem. We analyse this game for several classes of graphs, including cycles and trees...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn <b>the</b> {{cops and}} <b>robber</b> game, two players play {{alternately}} by moving their tokens {{along the edges}} of a graph. The first one plays with the cops and the second one with one <b>robber.</b> <b>The</b> cops aim at capturing <b>the</b> <b>robber,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> tries to infinitely evade the cops. The main problem consists in minimizing the number of cops used to capture <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> in a graph. This minimum number is called the cop-number of the graph. If the cops and <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> have <b>the</b> same velocity, 3 + 3 / 2 g cops are sufficient to capture one robber in any graph with genus g (Schröder, 2001). In the particular case of a grid, 2 cops are sufficient. ...|$|R
40|$|Cops and robber {{game is a}} combinatorical {{problem that}} has been studied for {{providing}} new structural tools and characterization of graphs (see the survey of B. Alspach [Alspach 04]). In this game, one player first places a set of tokens (the cops) on the vertices of a graph G, then the second player places its token (<b>the</b> <b>robber)</b> on a vertex of G. Alternatively (starting with the cops), the players moves their token from their current location to an adjacent vertex. The goal of the cops is to capture <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> (a cop must {{be placed on the}} same vertex as <b>the</b> <b>robber),</b> while <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> wants to permanently escape. Given a graph, a question is to determine the smallest number of cops that ensures the existance of a strategy (sequence of moves) that capture <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> whatever it does. For instance, if the number of cops equals the number of vertices of G, <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> will immediatly be captured. On a grid, two cops are sufficient (you can try). A corresponding problem is to design efficient algorithms (strategies) allowing either to capture <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> using <b>the</b> optimal number of cops, or the evasion of <b>the</b> <b>robber</b> facing few cops. One of the main (difficult) remaining challenge in this area consists in determining whether square-root(n) cops are always sufficient to capture a robber in any n-node graph. During recent years, some variants of this game has been considered [CCNV,FGK 08,NS 08]...|$|R
