5|$|The {{subway station}} at Porter is, at 105 feet below ground level, the deepest in the MBTA system. Porter's unusual depth {{is due to}} the MBTA's {{decision}} to build the station in bedrock rather than soft clay, saving time and money in the construction process. Passengers reach Red Line platforms via a series of escalators, stairs totalling 199 steps, or a set of elevators. The longest single span of the escalators is 143feet, the longest in the MBTA system. In 2005, a man was killed when his sweatshirt <b>tangled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the escalator.|$|E
5|$|Daun's {{battle plan}} took the Prussians {{completely}} by surprise. The {{east side of}} Frederick's line {{was the first to}} be attacked. Using the starless night and fog as cover, and grouped into small shock units for easier control and stealth, the Austrians fell on the Prussian battery when the church bell signaled 5:00, catching the Prussians completely off guard. Many men were still sleeping, or just waking up, when the attack started. After setting fire to the village, the Croats cut tent ropes, causing the canvas to fall on sleeping soldiers, then bayoneted the men as they struggled to free themselves from canvas and cords. Men <b>tangled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tents bled to death, in what today is still called Blutgasse, or Blood Alley.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Elena is {{kidnapped by}} Roman, and Nate reunites with Sully and follows {{him to the}} statue. Encouraged by Navarro, Roman opens the sarcophagus, exposing himself to an {{airborne}} virus. As he begins to turn, Navarro guns him down and orders his men to secure the statue {{so that he can}} sell the virus to the highest bidder on the black market. Nate jumps onto the net carrying the treasure which is connected to the transport chopper while a captive Elena gets the pilot killed, causing it to crash on Navarro's cargo ship. Nate kills the remaining mercenaries and attempts to rescue Elena, only to be attacked by Navarro. After a fistfight, he pulls her out of the chopper and pushes it overboard, taking Navarro, whose leg is <b>tangled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rope connected to the net, and the statue with it {{to the bottom of the}} sea.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{association}} of the apolipoprotein (Apo E) -epsilon 4 allele to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been analyzed in several studies.

25|$|Not surprisingly, plaques and <b>tangles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frontal cortex {{can cause}} {{disruption}} in functions {{as well as}} damage to the connections between prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.

40|$|We have {{compared}} <b>the</b> protein profiles <b>in</b> plaques and <b>tangles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hippocampus of post-mortem Alzheimer brains and in opaque and clear regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep cortex of eye lenses {{of the same}} donors. From the 7 Alzheimer donors studied, 1 had pronounced bilateral cortical lens opacities, 1 moderate and 5 only minor or no cortical opacities. We focused on beta-sheet levels, a hallmarking property of amyloid-beta, the major protein of plaques and tau protein, the major protein of <b>tangles</b> <b>in</b> Alzheimer brains. Confocal Raman microspectroscopy and imaging was used in combination with hierarchical cluster analysis. Plaques and tangles show high levels of beta-sheets with a beta-sheet to protein ratio of 1. 67. This ratio is 1. 12 in unaffected brain tissue surrounding <b>the</b> plaques and <b>tangles.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> lenses this ratio is 1. 17 independently of {{the presence or absence}} of opacities. This major difference in beta-sheet conformation between hippocampus and lens is supported by Congo red and immunostaining of amyloid-beta and tau which were positive for plaques and <b>tangles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hippocampus but fully negative for the lens irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} opacities. In line with a previous study (Michael et al., 2013) we conclude that cortical lens opacities are not typical for Alzheimer patients and are not hallmarked by accumulation of amyloid-beta, and can thus not be considered as predictors or indicators of Alzheimer disease as claimed by Goldstein et al. (2003) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{meeting at}} Aintree had been beset by {{problems}} before the race. Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence (as had also {{happened at the}} 1991 Grand National) resulting in a delayed start. A first false start was caused by several riders becoming <b>tangled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting tape. Starter Keith Brown, who was officiating his last National before retirement, waved his red recall flag and a second official, Ken Evans, who was situated 100 yards further down the track, in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around. At the second attempt, the tape became tangled again — {{around the neck of}} jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start. However, this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it. As a result, 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track, oblivious to the recall.|$|E
5|$|By 21:15, Pinsum {{realised}} {{that his}} heavily laden ship could not outrun Amethyst and reduced his speed, turning sharply {{in front of}} the British ship in an attempt to rake her. Seymour was prepared for the manoeuvre and countered it by turning sharply away from Thétis so that the French broadside fell harmlessly into the sea and both frigates performed a complete circle before returning to their previous course. Seymour then swung back towards the French ship, bringing Amethyst alongside and pouring a heavy fire into Thétis, which replied in kind. For 25 minutes, the frigates continued firing on one another from close range as they sailed westwards. At 21:40, Pinsum again attempted to rake Amethyst, trying to cross the British ship's stern as she pulled ahead. Seymour countered by slowing his ship and the French rigging became <b>tangled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British, the firing continuing as the crews worked to free their ships from one another. Separating a few minutes later, the frigates continued their close-range duel. Amethyst again pulled ahead at 22:05, Seymour successfully crossing the bow of the French ship from port and raking her before swinging back along the starboard side to resume the close range exchange of broadsides.|$|E
5|$|With Real Carlos disabled, Keats {{pushed on}} into combat with Saint Antoine, the {{combined}} French and Spanish crew engaging the British vessel as it approached. At 23:50, Keats laid his ship close alongside the new French ship, beginning {{a close and}} heated action as the ships of the line exchanged broadsides {{with one another in}} pitch darkness and with an increasing wind. For 30 minutes the battle continued until, with the ships off Cape Spartel in North Africa, a wounded Le Ray decided that his ship was no longer able to contest the action and hailed Superb to announce that he had surrendered. The halyards that held up his pennant had however become <b>tangled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rigging, giving the appearance that the ship was still in French hands: this later led it to be attacked repeatedly by other British ships as they came up during the night. Formidable was also {{to the rear of the}} combined squadron, escaping attack by feigning British signal lights until it had safely passed the battle between Superb and Saint Antoine. Keats remained with his prize, awaiting the arrival of the rest of the squadron: Caesar, Venerable, Spencer and Thames arrived after midnight, all firing on Saint Antoine as they passed before continuing westwards in search of the remainder of Moreno's squadron. Superb was later joined by Carlotta and the small ships HMS Calpe and Louisa, which remained on hand during the night.|$|E

40|$|Degenerative changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{substantia nigra}} and {{ventral tegmental area}} were {{investigated}} in 104 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 13 cases of Down's syndrome. Frequencies of <b>tangles</b> <b>in</b> three groups of patients with Alzheimer's disease were 86 %, 44 % and 46 % (54 % overall) respectively. About half of those with tangles, but no Lewy bodies, had excess nigral cell loss, and 16 % had moderate or severe neuronal fallout, but none had a Parkinsonian syndrome. Cases with nigral tangles were younger, tended to have more hippocampal and cortical tangles and plaques, and lower activities of cortical choline acetyltransferase. In most cases of Alzheimer's disease degeneration in nigral and tegmental areas was greater than controls, and tangles were evenly distributed. All the cases of Down's syndrome had <b>tangles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nigra and eight showed mild cell loss. Mild degenerative changes accompanied by <b>tangles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area are common in Alzheimer's disease, but severe cell loss is rare.

A fashion {{conscious}} TV reporter (Victoria Abril), who is constantly {{in search of}} sensational stories, follows Kika's misadventures. Almodóvar used Kika as a critique of mass media, particularly its sensationalism. The film is infamous for its rape scene that Almodóvar used for comic effect {{to set up a}} scathing commentary on the selfish and ruthless nature of media. Kika made its premiere in 1993 and received very negative reviews from film critics worldwide; not just for its rape scene which was perceived as both misogynistic and exploitative, but also for its overall sloppiness. Almodóvar would later refer to the film as one of his weakest works.|$|E

40|$|Although Alzheimer's {{disease may}} involve both the substantia nigra and the striatum, {{there is little}} {{information}} concerning the relationship between <b>the</b> resulting abnormalities <b>in</b> these reciprocally interconnected regions of the brain.

25|$|Seeing {{the smaller}} ship {{directly}} in front of him, the French captain spread all sail and threw Minerve forwards, attempting to ram Dido amidships. If the attack had been successful, Dido would likely have been crushed by the weight of the larger frigate, but Towry was able to respond by throwing the wheel hard to port and turning away from the blow. The frigates were so close that Minerves bowsprit became <b>tangled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rigging of Didos mizenmast. The effect was to throw Dido hard against Minerves starboard bow and lift the smaller ship almost out of the water, her weight suspended from Minerves bowsprit. Covered by cannon fire from the forward 18-pounder long guns and heavy musketry, the French crew attempted to scramble along the bowsprit and onto Didos deck, the boarding action prevented by sailors armed with pikes. The attack was dangerous, wave action causing the suspended Dido to slam repeatedly against the hull of Minerve, and at approximately 9:00 the bowsprit finally snapped under the strain, fatally plunging at least eight French sailors attempting to board Dido into the gap between the ships. It also dislodged Didos mizenmast, which collapsed.|$|E

25|$|Ginebra {{looked for}} winning {{combinations}} {{with the new}} players in their lineup. But, they still failed to secure a playoff berth for the semifinals. Being tied with the Elasto Painters, they played for one-game playoff for the last quarterfinals berth. The result was, the Kings defeated Rain or Shine, 115–88, in the lopsided win. Barangay Ginebra then renewed its historic battle with fourth-seeded Alaska Aces in the quarterfinals. This was a rematch between the two teams that <b>tangled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semifinals of the 2009 Philippine Cup. Alaska took a 2–0 lead. Diamon Simpson powered {{his way to a}} 20–20 game in the first game and Barangay Ginebra as the Aces topped the Kings, 76–72, in the opener of this quarterfinals. In game 2 Alaska showed poise at crunch time. The Aces came up with big plays down the stretch while the Kings could not, enabling the Aces to escape with an 84–82 win. Simpson capped a 30-point game with his 17th rebound that sealed the game just before the final buzzer. Eric Menk and import Chris Daniels provided scoring but their backcourt were again invisible, with Mark Caguioa, Willie Miller, Mike Cortez, and Jayjay Helterbrand struggling in the game. In game 3 Ginebra came with a breakthrough win that fanned the hopes of the team. Not one but several Kings heeded the call and resulted in a 91–87 win over the Alaska Aces that kept the Kings' hope for the quarterfinals series. J.C. Intal, who came off the bench exploded for 20 points, delivering what Mark Caguioa and Wille Mller could not while providing both inspiration and boost to the team’s cause of eluding Alaska’s broom. The Kings forced a rubber match when they got balanced scoring from their roster with a 94–90 win over Alaska in Game 4. J.C. Intal and Ronald Tubid hit consecutive three-pointers in the final three minutes while Sunday Salvacion came through with the game-sealing free throws with 2.6 seconds left in Game 4. Ginebra failed to win the quarterfinal series with a heartbreaking 91–93 loss with Aces. In game 5, Tenorio drilled a difficult triple at the buzzer which seemed enough to propel the Aces to a victory and erected a six-point lead, 90–84, with just 2:15 left in the match. Willie Miller scored on a layup off a broken play as Ginebra cut the Alaska lead to four 90–86 with 1:27 to go in the game. Miller then followed up a missed layup by his teammate to push Ginebra even closer, 90–88, with 31 seconds left. Eric Menk then intercepted a long pass by Simpson, grabbing the ball at midcourt then zipped the ball over to an open Jayjay Helterbrand who drilled a three-pointer as the Kings pulled ahead of Alaska, 90–91, with 28 seconds left. But Ginebra, unable to pull a tough defensive play, when Diamon Simpson scored from underneath to push Alaska ahead for good, 92–91, with just 5 seconds left to play. Cyrus Baguio then double-teamed an attacking Eric Menk and stole the ball from Menk that finalized the score on a split from the line, 93–91.|$|E
