5|$|Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) {{is brought}} to a maximum {{security}} military prison to begin a ten-year sentence for his decision (in violation of a presidential order) <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> troops on a mission in Burundi, resulting {{in the deaths of}} eight soldiers. Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran would ever have.|$|E
5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it was a mistake <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|Intervention in Latin America {{had been}} a minor {{campaign}} issue; Harding spoke against Wilson's decision <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> troops to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and attacked the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Franklin Roosevelt, {{for his role in}} the Haitian intervention. Once Harding was sworn in, Hughes worked to improve relations with Latin American countries who were wary of the American use of the Monroe Doctrine to justify intervention; at the time of Harding's inauguration, the U.S. also had troops in Cuba and Nicaragua. The troops stationed in Cuba to protect American interests were withdrawn in 1921; U.S. forces remained in the other three nations through Harding's presidency. In April 1921, Harding gained the ratification of the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty with Colombia, granting that nation $25,000,000 as settlement for the U.S.-provoked Panamanian revolution of 1903. The Latin American nations were not fully satisfied, as the U.S. refused to renounce interventionism, though Hughes pledged to limit it to nations near the Panama Canal and to make it clear what the U.S. aims were.|$|E

25|$|Since SHAEF {{believed}} the Wehrmacht {{was no longer}} capable of launching a major offensive, nor that any offensive could be launched through such rugged terrain as the Ardennes Forest — particularly during winter — the Ardennes {{was used as an}} area <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>US</b> divisions, which had recently fought and sustained severe casualties, in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest to regroup and refit. It was also used as a place where new units recently from the US were sent to get some field experience in a safe place.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March Kirke, Deputy Director of Operations at GHQ, flew to London {{to report}} that the Germans had gained 12 miles and {{captured}} 600 guns. Wilson wrote that 23 March was “an anxious day”: the War Cabinet discussed falling back on the Channel Ports and agreed to send out 50,000 “boys” of 18 ½ – 19 together with another 82,000 men from Britain, along with 88,000 returning from leave. A British division was recalled from Italy, Allenby was instructed to hold one ready, and Lord Reading (Ambassador in Washington) was asked to urge President Wilson <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>US</b> reinforcements quicker.|$|E

[...] "I thought he had been bullying too many people for too long, and I told him so," [...] Moran recalled. [...] "He said he didn't mean to be so accusatory ... After that, he would bring me candy from California." [...] Moran said that after the encounter he found Cunningham crying in the cloakroom.|$|E

500|$|Up {{until the}} middle of 1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a {{functioning}} unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year). According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, [...] "When you work at a multinational company, there are things that go well and there are things that don't. They didn't want <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>us</b> working Sega CD units. They wanted <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>us</b> dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio CD drive, not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the CD drive was designed to provide.|$|E
500|$|The Roosevelt Administration asked Chinese Nationalist {{president}} Chiang Kai-shek's permission <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> {{observers to}} visit the CPC. Initially, Chiang was hostile to the proposal and delayed action. The Generalissimo consented after foreign correspondents that he had permitted to visit Yan'an reported on the CPC to U.S. readers. [...] Chiang agreed after American Vice-President Henry Wallace made a state visit to Chungking, the nationalists' capital, in late June 1944. [...] John Carter Vincent, an experienced State Department China expert, assisted Wallace in persuading Chiang to allow the U.S. {{to visit the}} CPC in Yan'an without Nationalist supervision. In exchange, the U.S. promised to replace the American commander of the Burma India Theater, General Stilwell. He was removed from command in October 1944.|$|E

Of this decision, Myers states, [...] "We are a writing-intensive school, and the information produced by SAT scores added little to our ability to predict how a student would do at our college; it did, however, do much to bias admission in favor of those who could afford expensive coaching sessions.|$|R

500|$|Alan Clayson {{writes of}} reviewers criticising [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] for being repetitious, leading Starr {{to respond in}} a 1973 interview: [...] "Play me a pop song that isn't." [...] On release, Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker: [...] "A Number One hit could easily be in store for the maestro of rock drums. There's {{a touch of the}} Marc Bolans in this highly playable rhythmic excursion... It's {{hypnotic}} and effective, ideal for jukeboxes and liable <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>us</b> all mad {{by the end of the}} week." [...] Woffinden described the single as [...] "every bit as ebullient" [...] as [...] "It Don't Come Easy", although [...] "slightly inferior", while Mike DeGagne of AllMusic views it as a song where [...] "he jovial spirit of Ringo Starr shines through". In a 1974 article for the NME, Charles Shaar Murray highlighted [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] as a [...] "great radio and juke-box tune".|$|E

2500|$|Buechner has {{occasionally}} {{been accused}} of being too [...] "preachy;" [...] a 1984 review by Anna Shapiro in the New York Times notes [...] "But for all the colloquialism, there is something, well, preachy and a little unctuous about making yourself an exemplar of faith. Insights that would do for a paragraph are dragged out with a doggedness that will presumably bring the idea home to even the most resistant and inattentive." [...] The sentiments expressed by Cecelia Holland's 1987 Washington Post review of Buechner's novel, Brendan, are far more common. She writes,"In our own time, when religion is debased, an electronic game show, an insult to the thirsty soul, Buechner's novel proves again the power of faith, to lift us up, to hold us straight, <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>us</b> on again." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 11 April 1898, McKinley asked Congress for {{authority}} <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> troops to Cuba {{for the purpose}} of ending the civil war there. On 19 April, Congress passed joint resolutions (by a vote of 311 to 6 in the House and 42 to 35 in the Senate) supporting Cuban independence and disclaiming any intention to annex Cuba, demanding Spanish withdrawal, and authorizing the president to use as much military force as he thought necessary to help Cuban patriots gain independence from Spain. This was adopted by resolution of Congress and included from Senator Henry Teller the Teller Amendment, which passed unanimously, stipulating that [...] "the island of Cuba is, and by right should be, free and independent". The amendment disclaimed any intention {{on the part of the}} United States to exercise jurisdiction or control over Cuba for other than pacification reasons, and confirmed that the armed forces would be removed once the war is over. Senate and Congress passed the amendment on April 19, McKinley signed the joint resolution on 20 April and the ultimatum was forwarded to Spain. War was declared on 20/21 April 1898.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{who were}} {{involved}} in the NATO airstrikes have stood by the decision to take such action. U.S President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, said, [...] "The appalling accounts of mass killing in Kosovo and the pictures of refugees fleeing Serb oppression for their lives makes it clear that this is a fight for justice over genocide." [...] On CBS' Face the Nation Cohen claimed, [...] "We've now seen about 100,000 military-aged men missing. ... They may have been murdered." [...] Clinton, citing the same figure, spoke of [...] "at least 100,000 (Kosovar Albanians) missing". Later, Clinton said about Yugoslav elections, [...] "they're going to have to come to grips with what Mr. Milošević ordered in Kosovo. ... They're going to have to decide whether they support his leadership or not; whether they think it's OK that all those tens of thousands of people were killed. ..." [...] In the same press conference, Clinton also claimed [...] "NATO stopped deliberate, systematic efforts at ethnic cleansing and genocide." [...] Clinton compared the events of Kosovo to the Holocaust. CNN reported, [...] "Accusing Serbia of 'ethnic cleansing' in Kosovo similar to the genocide of Jews in World War II, an impassioned Clinton sought Tuesday to rally public support for his decision <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>U.S.</b> forces into combat against Yugoslavia, a prospect that seemed increasingly likely with the breakdown of a diplomatic peace effort." [...] President Clinton's State Department also claimed Serbian troops had committed genocide. The New York Times reported, [...] "the Administration said evidence of 'genocide' by Serbian forces was growing to include 'abhorrent and criminal action' on a vast scale. The language was the State Department's strongest up to that time in denouncing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević." [...] The State Department also gave the highest estimate of dead Albanians. In May 1996, Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested that there might be up to 100,000 Albanian fatalities." ...|$|E
