500|$|Rick Massimo, {{reviewing}} the concert for The Providence Journal, wrote {{that as a}} musical theater, the Monster Ball was not that exciting, but [...] "that leaves the music, and when you lay two hours of her songs end-to-end, it's easy to see the vision, the intelligence and a serious songwriting talent at work." [...] Jay N. Miller from The Enterprise {{was impressed with the}} show, saying that the music was somewhere between industrial disco and house music with a rock edge, but [...] "always danceable". Philip Borof from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York's Madison Square Garden and found it average, calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the [...] "most entertaining". Toronto Stars Ben Rayner appreciated the show, exclaiming [...] "hot damn, that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and suddenly it doesn’t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir." [...] Mariel Concepción from Billboard felt that Gaga [...] "may be best known for her gaudy outfits and over-the-top stage shows, but at her hometown headlining debut at Madison Square Garden last night, the pop phenomenon proved she's a regular girl at heart." [...] The Seattle Times staff writer Marian Liu declared that as [...] "one of the most anticipated touring acts of the year, [...] stimulated the crowd's senses on Saturday night in a way few artists can. She brought spectacle and backed it up with soul." [...] The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis reviewed the opening show of the European leg, and commented that [...] "it takes a certain je ne sais quoi <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> show doing something that looks suspiciously like mime on a rickety metal staircase while wearing an outfit with shoulderpads the size of the deck on a small aircraft carrier." ...|$|E
2500|$|From January 2002, until {{sometime}} in 2005, Geldof listened very closely to Father's Rights campaigners, {{and it was}} reported that he had sacks of mail arriving at his door on a daily basis from fathers who were unhappy with the British family courts. [...] He said, [...] "I am heartbroken. I just cannot believe what happens to people, what is done to them {{in the name of the}} law. You only have <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> eyes to see what I call the 'Sad Dads on Sundays Syndrome'". [...] He has also called for The Children Act to be repealed and his latest statement to Father's Rights campaigners was, [...] "It's not in my nature to shut up".|$|E
2500|$|The plateau {{area has}} a subarctic climate and only {{supports}} sparse tundra. The shattered terrain {{is more like}} the high ground in high-arctic Canada or northern Norway than anywhere in the Alps or Rockies. The weather often deteriorates rapidly with altitude so that, when there are moderate conditions 150 metres below the plateau, the top can be stormy or misty and there can be icy or powdery snow. Even when no snow is falling the wind can whip up lying snow to produce white-out conditions for a few metres above the surface and snowdrifts can build up rapidly in sheltered places. Gravel can be blown {{through the air and}} walking can be impossible. Adam Watson says [...] "When a gale is accompanied by thick storms of ground drift, or worse, by heavy falling blizzards plus ground drift, or worse still by mist as well, conditions can be extremely serious on the plateau, making it suffocating and difficult to breathe, hard <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>your</b> eyes, impossible to see anything beyond your own feet, and unable to communicate with your party except one at a time by cupping an ear and shouting into it." [...] In January 1993 a wind speed of [...] was measured at Cairngorm summit weather station – the greatest speed ever recorded in the UK.|$|E
