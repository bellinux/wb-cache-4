40|$|ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017. As {{the number}} of Electric Vehicle (EV) increases, <b>the</b> uncoordinated <b>charging</b> {{behaviors}} may cause <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> demand fluctuations and <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> load unbalanced. Besides, <b>the</b> users’ <b>charging</b> behaviors are affected by many factors. For example, the residual energy of battery decides the travel distance of EV and if an EV has more residual energy, <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> willing is lower. Because EV users don’t have much willing to change their charging time and place just as in <b>the</b> past, <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> habit may also affect <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> decision. In this paper, we propose a smart charging startegy CDF (Charging Decision Function), where three sub-functions related to the residual energy of battery, EV’s <b>charging</b> habit, and <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> efficiency of charging station are all weighted and involved, for improving <b>the</b> balance of <b>charging</b> load and reducing <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> demand fluctuations. <b>The</b> <b>charging</b> decision is resulted from the CDF’s value, and if an EV decides to <b>charge,</b> <b>the</b> <b>charging</b> {{time as well as}} charging place is also calculated.

To improve <b>the</b> poor <b>charging</b> characteristic at low temperature, the working principle of charging battery at low temperature is analyzed using electrochemical model and first-order RC equivalent circuit model; moreover, the multistage CC-CV strategy is proposed.

The extent to which Lord Cardigan was to blame is unproven, since he attacked only after expressing his doubts and receiving a direct order in front of the troops from his immediate superior Lord Lucan, Commander of the Cavalry Division. The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as Cardigan believed, did not treat her well. The order had been conveyed by Captain Louis Nolan, who died in <b>the</b> <b>charge,</b> and both Lucan and Cardigan blamed him for passing on the order incorrectly. Cardigan's first action on his return from <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> was to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him {{at the start of the}} attack.|$|E

American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-).
