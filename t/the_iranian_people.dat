50|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> {{split from}} <b>the</b> Indo-Iranians, <b>the</b> <b>Iranians</b> {{developed}} an increasingly distinct culture. Various common traits can be discerned among <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>peoples.</b> For example, <b>the</b> social event Norouz is an Iranian festival that is practiced by {{nearly all of}} <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>peoples</b> {{as well as others}} in the region.

25|$|Khosrau I further {{extended}} the already vast trade network. The Sasanian state now tended toward monopolistic control of trade, with luxury goods assuming {{a far greater}} role in the trade than heretofore, and the great activity in building of ports, caravanserais, bridges and the like, was linked to trade and urbanization. The Persians dominated international trade, both in the Indian Ocean, Central Asia and South Russia, {{in the time of}} Khosrau, although competition with the Byzantines was at times intense. Sassanian settlements in Oman and Yemen testify to the importance of trade with India, but the silk trade with China was mainly in the hands of Sasanian vassals and <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>people,</b> the Sogdians.|$|E
25|$|Artists, {{cultural}} authorities, {{government officials}} and <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>people</b> gathered {{to say goodbye to}} Kiarostami on 10 July, in an emotional funeral, six days after his death in France. The ceremony was held at the Center for the Intellectual Education of Children, where he began his film-making career some 40 years ago. Attendees held banners with the titles of his movies and pictures of his most famous posters, as they praised the support Kiarostami contribution to culture, and particularly, to filmmaking in Iran. The ceremony was hosted by famous Iranian actor Parviz Parastooie, and included speeches by painter Aidin Aghdashlou and by also prize-winning film director Asghar Farhadi, who stressed his professional abilities. He was later buried in a private ceremony in northern Tehran town, Lavasan.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Persian {{has become}} {{just one of}} many Iranian blog languages. English in {{particular}} is used. This is both because it is a relatively well known second language due to high education levels, and to expose the outside world to the goings on in Iran. Several influential bloggers made a plea to other bloggers to use this medium to increase international outrage at the Iranian regime. It also seeks to provide a lens from which to see <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>people</b> as separate from their repressive government. Additionally, many blogs being read are written abroad by diasporic communities of Iranians throughout the globe. Many of their families left during the Brain-drain following the Islamic revolution in 1979 and after, creating a dedicated politically motivated and educated author base. These people use their native or adopted languages in addition to Persian.|$|E

500|$|Darius's account, {{written at}} the Behistun Inscription, states that Cambyses II killed his own brother Bardiya, {{but that this}} murder was not known among <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>people.</b> A would-be usurper named Gaumata came and lied to the people, stating he was Bardiya. The Iranians had grown rebellious against Cambyses's rule and on 11 March 522 BCE a revolt against Cambyses broke out in his absence. On 1 July, <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>people</b> chose {{to be under the}} {{leadership}} of Gaumata, as [...] "Bardiya". No member of the Achaemenid family would rise against Gaumata for the safety of their own life. Darius, who had served Cambyses as his lance-bearer until the deposed ruler's death, prayed for aid and in September 522 BCE, along with Otanes, Intraphrenes, Gobryas, Hydarnes, Megabyzus and Aspathines, killed Gaumata in the fortress of Sikayauvati.|$|E
500|$|The {{stated goal}} of the subsidy reform is [...] "to {{rejuvenate}} Iran's economy, increase productivity, give it a new footing and bring {{it out of the}} slump it has been in for so long". Concretely, the government plans to replace the subsidies with targeted social assistance. Consequences of the economic reform plan are that Iran will be less vulnerable to US sanctions because it will reduce fuel imports. The reform plan will also save money for <b>the</b> <b>Iranian</b> <b>people</b> because it will end a multibillion-dollar-a-year contraband (17% percent of fuel production in Iran is smuggled abroad daily). Due to subsidies, Iran had long had one of the cheapest gas prices in the world, 10 cents per liter or 40 cents per gallon.|$|E
