5|$|Atlético de Kolkata had {{the first}} major {{opportunity}} {{of the second half}} when Jakub Podaný crossed the ball into the box with both Baljit Sahni and Arnal looking to head it in before David James came out to catch the ball. The Kerala Blasters soon had three chances in three minutes but could not convert any of those into goals. Just after the 60th minute, Kerala Blasters defender Sandesh Jhingan almost headed the ball into his own net while trying <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it.</b> The Kerala Blasters continued to have the most chances throughout the match, which was compounded in the last minute of regulation time when Michael Chopra had his point blank range shot saved by Apoula Edel. Four minutes later, in the final minute of stoppage time, Atlético de Kolkata substitute Mohammed Rafique headed home a corner from Podaný to win the match and the championship.|$|E
5|$|It took {{thirty minutes}} {{to clear the}} runway and rig an arresting cable and Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only {{two-seater}} available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, but a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it,</b> and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33 Shooting Star, but he almost landed long—and the Nellis base operations office decided that to avoid any further problems, {{it would be best}} to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.|$|E
5|$|The first {{services}} {{started on}} 1 July 1907 from Voss to Myrdal. An official opening train attempted to cross {{part of the}} line to Gulsvik on 9 December 1907, but got stuck in heavy snow and had to return. It {{turned out that the}} railway had to close and it took one and a half months <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it</b> for snow. Even a rotary snowplow at 750kW was not powerful enough {{to get rid of the}} snow. A new attempt to open the line in 1908 succeeded, and a train went from Gulsvik to Bergen. The line from Roa to Gulsvik was still under construction, so passage was along the Drammen Line via the Krøder Line with ship over Krøderen to Gulsvik. The first scheduled train from Oslo West Station en route to Bergen departed 10 June 1908.|$|E

5|$|The mission, codenamed Operation Barras, was {{undertaken}} by D Squadron of 22 Special Air Service Regiment, who assaulted {{the village of}} Gberi Bana to extract the soldiers, while a company group formed around A Company, 1 PARA, assaulted Magbeni, {{on the opposite side}} of Rokel Creek. The operation was successful and all the British captives were extracted, along with their SLA liaison and 22 Sierra Leonean civilians, while the WSB were defeated as a military force. A British soldier and at least 25 West Side Boys were killed in the operation. Many other West Side Boys fled and later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight. Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army, and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme at Benguema. Following Operation Barras, two SLA battalions—graduates of the British short-term training programme—swept the area surrounding the West Side Boys' camp <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it</b> of any remaining gang members.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal got {{the game}} {{underway}} {{and won the}} first corner of the match. Taken by Paul Merson, the ball was flicked on at the near post by O'Leary and reached Alan Smith. The forward's header was obstructed by a Wrexham player, who proceeded <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it</b> out. It did not take long for Arsenal to create another chance; Nigel Winterburn played the ball down {{the left side of}} the pitch, finding Merson who ran in towards the penalty area and produced a cross. The ball was cleared, but reached Carter whose effort near the penalty spot went wide of the right-side post. Wrexham managed to get into the opposition's area and create half-chances, but then Arsenal broke forward again with Kevin Campbell having a shot on target. Gareth Owen nearly scored the opener, when he controlled the ball from a flick on and instinctively took a shot that whistled past the post. Two minutes before the interval, Arsenal took the lead. Merson surged forward into the penalty area and his cross was met Smith who slided the ball past goalkeeper Vince O'Keefe. Wrexham almost equalised immediately from the restart, but David Seaman denied Steve Watkin by rushing towards the midfielder and obstructing him.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of 29 April, the 150th and 171st Rifle {{divisions}} started to fan out from the Moltke bridgehead into the surrounding streets and buildings. Initially the Soviets were unable to bring forward artillery, as the combat engineers had not had time to strengthen the bridge or build an alternative. The only form of heavy weaponry available to the assault troops were individual 'Katyusha' rockets lashed to short sections of railway lines. Major-General V. M. Shatilov's 150th Rifle Division had a particularly hard fight, capturing the heavily fortified Ministry of the Interior building. Lacking artillery, the men had <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it</b> room by room with grenades and sub-machine guns.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishing}} {{himself in}} Egypt, Saladin {{launched a campaign}} against the Crusaders, besieging Darum in 1170. Amalric withdrew his Templar garrison from Gaza to assist him in defending Darum, but Saladin evaded their force and fell on Gaza instead. He destroyed the town built outside the city's castle and killed most of its inhabitants after they were refused entry into the castle. It is unclear exactly when, but during that same year, he attacked and captured the Crusader castle of Eilat, built on an island off {{the head of the}} Gulf of Aqaba. It did not pose a threat to the passage of the Muslim navy, but could harass smaller parties of Muslim ships and Saladin decided <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it</b> from his path.|$|E

25|$|At 4:45 AM on 3 October, Flagship New England {{left the}} gate and was {{initially}} cleared to depart from runway 30; however, apparently unfavorable wind conditions prompted Stephenville Air Traffic Control <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it</b> for runway 07 instead. Overcast skies blocked out light from the moon and stars, rendering the terrain ahead unlit. Flights departing from runway 07 were supposed to make a right-hand turn immediately after take-off {{so as to avoid}} hilly terrain in line with the runway. However, the pilots of Flagship New England instead allowed the aircraft to continue going straight ahead after lifting off. At about 5:03 AM, some seven miles {{from the end of the}} runway, the aircraft hit a ridge at an elevation of about 1,160 feet and crashed, killing everyone on board. The investigation into the accident indicated the pilots' failure to change course, which led the aircraft across terrain over which sufficient clearance could not be gained, led to the crash.|$|E
25|$|In the MVC final, the Cougars were {{pitted against}} the 3rd seeded Drake Bulldogs, {{who had already}} won two tournament games. SIUE came out hard, {{dominating}} possession {{during the first half}} and outshooting DU 9 to 1, but the Bulldogs' defense held firm for a 0–0 halftime score. The second half was more evenly played, but Drake was a bit more effective. When the Cougars failed to clear a ball in the 77th minute, Dal Santo made a last instant save that set up a Drake corner kick; the kick bounced around in the six yard box before SIUE finally seemed <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it,</b> but it went straight toward Drake freshman reserve Ciszweski, who blasted a return shot through the crowd in front of the net that Dal Santo barely saw and had no chance of stopping. The Cougars then intensified their effort after falling behind, but as in the semis, seemed unable to put together an effective attack. In the end, Drake earned its first MVC Tournament title since 2009, and SIUE would have to wait to find out if their record was good enough to get an at-large bid to return to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} {{hour or so}} of Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's 1987 movie portraying the Vietnam War, Matthew Modine (Private Joker), Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother) and their platoon go into Huế, a Vietnamese city, <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>it</b> of Viet Cong and snipers. Kubrick had the whole {{gasworks}} selectively demolished and the art department then dressed the 'set' with latticework and appropriate advertising hoardings to make it believable. At one point the soldiers enter a building to flush out a sniper. This building {{was one of several}} located between the central buildings of the old gasworks and about 200 yards from the river Thames. The final scene sees the soldiers marching off into the (London) sunset against the silhouettes of the burning gasworks' chimneys and buildings, singing the Mickey Mouse March from the US children's TV show. In the film a period of several days takes place in the protagonist's lives as they travel through the industrial quarters of Huế city; in reality the action took place within just one square mile. According to Kubrick collaborator Leon Vitali, who worked on Full Metal Jacket, the gasworks were built by an architectural firm that also constructed much of Huế.|$|E
