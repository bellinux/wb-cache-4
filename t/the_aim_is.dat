They also record footage of people involved in anti-social behaviour on the streets. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to give other police officers up to date information on the appearance {{of people who have}} broken the law. Video footage thus collected is constantly replayed on TV screens in rooms where officers complete their paperwork. Footage that they have recorded has also been uploaded onto YouTube in an attempt to catch people they believe have reoffended.|$|E

5|$|The {{objective}} of preserving vegetables is {{to extend their}} availability for consumption or marketing purposes. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to harvest the food at its maximum state of palatability and nutritional value, and preserve these qualities for an extended period. The main causes of deterioration in vegetables after they are gathered are the actions of naturally-occurring enzymes and the spoilage caused by micro-organisms.

5|$|In Super Mario Kart, {{the player}} takes control {{of one of}} eight Mario series characters, each with differing capabilities. In single player mode players can race against {{computer-controlled}} characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups {{can be used to}} gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the clock in a Time Trial mode. In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups or can race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode. In a third multiplayer mode – Battle Mode – <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart.|$|E

The game is set in 2000 and <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to extract {{diamonds}} from Angola before the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is put in place. The winner {{is the one who}} finishes the game with the most diamonds after nine turns. Each turn, players decide where to send their three agents. They can be sent to six different Angolan regions to extract diamonds, or recalled to the player's headquarters to deposit extracted diamonds. Players make decisions in secret, and both sets of decisions are resolved on the game board simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged {{to reduce the amount}} of food they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders is a {{two-dimensional}} fixed shooter {{game in which}} the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally {{across the bottom of}} the screen and firing at descending aliens. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward {{the bottom of the screen}}. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>aim</b> of <b>the</b> study <b>was</b> to {{identify}} mechanisms acting at internal frost destruction of concrete. By 'internal frost destruction' is meant damage caused inside concrete that is moisture {{insulated from the}} surroundings, i. e. when no moisture exchange with the surroundings is possible during freeze-thaw. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> not to investigate destruction processes (scaling) taking place at the surface of concrete exposed to water or salt solution. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> should <b>be</b> reached by experimental work at which different parameters, {{that are supposed to}} influence destruction, such as concrete quality, moisture content, freezing rate, and duration of freezing temperature were varied independently of each other. The effect of these parameters on formation of ice, and on the behaviour of the concrete during freeze-thaw should be monitored. In this way it was imagined that the individual effect of each fundamental parameter could <b>be</b> identified. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to use <b>the</b> experimental results to test different existing destruction theories like the hydraulic pressure theory and the microscopic ice lens theory. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> not to build a quantitative model for internal frost destruction...|$|R
