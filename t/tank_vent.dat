50|$|The {{rocket pack}} could be swapped in around 20 minutes by {{removing}} six bolts.

50|$|The {{cause of}} both the Bryce Canyon crash and the near-fatal Gallup {{incident}} was eventually traced to a design flaw. A cabin heater intake scoop was positioned {{too close to the}} number 3 alternate tank air vent. If flightcrews allowed a tank to be overfilled during a routine fuel transfer between wing tanks, it could lead to several gallons of excess fuel flowing out of the <b>tank</b> <b>vent</b> and then being sucked into the cabin heater system, which then ignited the fuel.

5000|$|The XB-70 was {{equipped}} with six General Electric YJ93-GE-3 turbojet engines, designed to use JP-6 jet fuel. The engine was stated {{to be in the}} [...] "30,000-pound class", but actually produced 28,000 lbf (124.6 kN) with afterburner and 19,900 lbf (88 kN) without afterburner. The Valkyrie used fuel for cooling; it was pumped through heat exchangers before reaching the engines.

50|$|The Thiokol {{engineers}} had {{also argued that}} the low overnight temperatures (−8 C the evening prior to launch) would almost certainly result in SRB temperatures below their redline of 4 C. Ice had accumulated all over the launch pad, raising concerns that ice could damage the shuttle upon lift-off. The Kennedy Ice Team inadvertently pointed an infrared camera at the aft field joint of the right SRB and found the temperature to be only −13 C. This {{was believed to be}} the result of supercooled air blowing on the joint from the liquid oxygen <b>tank</b> <b>vent.</b> It was much lower than the air temperature and far below the design specifications for the O-rings. The low reading was later determined to be erroneous, the error caused by not following the temperature probe manufacturer's instructions. Tests and adjusted calculations later confirmed that the temperature of the joint was not substantially different from the ambient temperature.|$|E
50|$|Shortly thereafter, {{a second}} {{explosion}} occurred within Tank 231. Burning petroleum spilled from the <b>tank’s</b> <b>vents</b> into a diked area surrounding the tank. Within the diked area, a second tank (No. 114) {{just north of}} Tank 231, containing No. 6 grade fuel oil, also ignited as pipelines within the diked area began to fail. The initial explosion also damaged the pipe manifold outside of the dike wall and petroleum pouring out under pressure ignited.|$|R
50|$|Missile 60D (July 2) {{returned}} to the dry start method, {{this time with a}} hold down period to check for combustion instability rather than immediately releasing the missile upon full thrust. While no on-pad explosion resulted on this attempt, the Atlas failed to complete all of its test objectives when the vernier start <b>tanks</b> were inadvertently <b>vented</b> and refilled several times during the flight. This resulted in depletion of control helium and loss of sustainer and vernier thrust near the end of powered flight, and so the Mark III Mod 1B reentry vehicle landed some 40 miles short of its intended target point. An electrical glitch was believed to have caused the unplanned start <b>tank</b> <b>venting,</b> although the specifics of could not be determined.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{application}} {{is a similar}} arrangement in some fuel tanks used in control line model airplanes, where it is called a [...] "uniflow" [...] tank, where the <b>tank</b> <b>venting</b> tubing goes {{to the end of}} the prismatic tank, close to the fuel pick-up tube that feeds the engine; thus, when fuel is consumed, the uniflow tank supplies approximately the same pressure, regardless of the quantity of fuel that remains in the tank for the rest of the flight, which keeps the same carburetor calibration and air-fuel ratio.|$|R
50|$|This {{is located}} at the west end of the site near Market Rd. These tanks are used to store for raw {{materials}} for the other units of the Styrene Plant. The company purchases amination grade benzene and also a material called BTX. Both are liquids. BTX stands for Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene. BTX is a mixture of these chemical species plus many other species. Both liquids are stored in large steel tanks surrounded by concrete bunds. The tanks vent to a pair of carbon beds that collect most of the gaseous discharge from the tanks. When road tankers unload liquid benzene or BTX into the respective tanks, vapour rich in these materials is discharged from the <b>tank</b> <b>vent</b> and is trapped in activated carbon beds. Benzene and BTX are purchased overseas and is transported to nearby Coode Island where it is unloaded from ships and stored in a similar tank farm before being transported by road to the West Footscray site. The tank farm also contains similar tanks that contain the finished product styrene monomer and various intermediate liquids. See descriptions of these materials in the other sections below.|$|E
50|$|As Tyrrell was {{the only}} {{naturally}} aspirated engine user in 1984 season, they were uniquely placed {{to be able to}} benefit from a similar strategy of the water brake. In Tyrrell's case, the engine was equipped with a water injection system (a common means of lowering cylinder temperatures to increase power), whose supply tank was to be topped up late in the race. In addition, the FIA had already made provision to reduce the fuel allowance for each race during the season to 220 litres and banned the refueling of 1982-83, reducing the power available to turbocharged runners while imposing little restriction on more efficient non-turbo runners. Predictably turbo-powered teams were against this move, leaving only Tyrrell - whose engine did not need the additional fuel - in favour of it. However, F1 rules required unanimity for the change to be scrapped, leaving Tyrrell in the way.It had been observed in races that, after Tyrrell's final pit stop, lead shot could be seen escaping {{from the top of the}} car. It turned out that Tyrrell were running the car underweight during the race then, in the closing stages, topping up water injection supply tanks with an additional 2 gallons of water mixed with 140 lb of lead shot to ensure it made the weight limit. As this was pumped in under significant pressure, some escaped through the <b>tank</b> <b>vent</b> and rained down on neighbouring pits, in sufficient quantities for other teams to sweep the shot away before their drivers pitted.|$|E
50|$|A design {{weakness}} of earlier classes solved by the Tench re-design were the ballast <b>tank</b> <b>vent</b> riser pipes that {{passed through the}} interior of the boat in the forward and after torpedo rooms. These pipes allowed #1 and #7 Main Ballast Tanks (MBT) (located in the single hull sections of the boat) to vent air during diving and allowing water to flood into them from below. The tops of these tanks formed the walking deck in the interior of both rooms and thus the normal location of the vent valves (the top of the tank) could not be used. The riser pipes allowed the tanks to vent but when the tanks were full these pipes contained water at full submergence pressure inside the torpedo rooms. If these pipes ruptured during depth charge attack, catastrophic flooding would occur. Solving this problem initially proved quite difficult, but ultimately required the complete rearrangement of the ballast tanks. #1 MBT was moved to a location forward {{of the end of the}} pressure hull, thus allowing it to vent directly into the superstructure like the rest of the MBT's. This move eliminated the riser pipes completely. #7 MBT, after stability and buoyancy calculations were run was found to be redundant and was converted to a variable fuel oil tank as mentioned above. These changes forced the rearrangement of the associated piping runs and the location of many of the other tanks. Remarkably, these changes resulted in a boat that was visually almost indistinguishable from the earlier Balao class, with the exception of a sharper angle (or knuckle) at the lower corner of the bow (only visible when the boat was drydocked).|$|E
50|$|As President Laura Roslin makes a {{ceremonial}} {{visit to the}} Galactica, several explosions occur in the battlestar's potable water <b>tanks,</b> <b>venting</b> the bulk of its vital water stores into space. Shortly before the explosions, Boomer, a Cylon sleeper agent with no conscious awareness of her status, comes to consciousness in an equipment room, soaking wet, {{with a bag of}} explosives at her feet. She and her lover, Chief Galen Tyrol, who believes Boomer is being framed, suppress evidence suggesting her involvement as the sabotage is investigated. Adama concludes {{there is at least one}} humanoid Cylon aboard the Galactica.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fuel for}} the engine is usually held in a metal or plastic fuel tank, shaped so that fuel is drawn from the outside edge of the tank, as the fuel tends to be thrown to the side by {{centrifugal}} force as the airplane travels in a circle. A [...] "clunk tank" [...] as used in R/C is satisfactory, but dedicated tanks with wedge-shaped cross-sections are frequently used and tend to have better characteristics as the fuel runs out. A <b>tank</b> with a <b>vent</b> on the inner edge, or multiple vents, is usually called a 'suction' tank. The pressure of fuel delivery with a suction tank changes as the fuel runs out, causing the engine mixture ratio to become leaner as the flight proceeds. <b>Tanks</b> <b>vented</b> to only permit air to enter at the outside edge ("uniflow" [...] tanks) provide constant fuel pressure over {{the duration of the}} flight and a constant mixture ratio.|$|R
40|$|Modifications are {{described}} {{which have been}} introduced to the Centaur high-energy upper stage (which is being integrated with the Titan IIIC booster) to improve mission flexibility and reliability, and to provide three-burn synchronous orbit capability. The addition of a sidewall radiation shield significantly reduces heat transfer to the liquid hydrogen tank. This radiation field, {{in conjunction with a}} newly developed computer controlled propellant <b>tank</b> <b>venting</b> and pressurization system, permits the use of improved techniques for propellant management during orbital coast. Some minor changes in the propulsion and propellant systems which were necessary to adapt these systems for synchronous orbit trajectories {{are described}}, together with the redundancy incorporated {{to reduce the number of}} single failure points. ...|$|R
