5|$|Remember Last Night? is a 1935 American mystery comedy film {{directed}} by James Whale. The film, {{based on the}} novel The Hangover Murders, is about the investigation of the murder of {{one of a group of}} friends. The survivors are unable to recall the events of the night of the murder because they were all <b>too</b> <b>drunk.</b> Remember Last Night? features an ensemble cast headed by Edward Arnold, Constance Cummings, and Robert Young.|$|E
5|$|Riley {{began his}} career writing verses as a sign maker and {{submitting}} poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents. Riley was an alcoholic, never married or had children, and created a scandal in 1888 when he became <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to perform. He became more popular {{in spite of the}} bad press he received, and as a result extricated himself from poorly negotiated contracts that limited his earnings; he quickly became very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Walker began {{monitoring}} Riley and denying him {{access to}} liquor, but Riley {{found ways to}} evade Walker. At {{a stop at the}} Masonic Temple Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky, in January 1890, Riley paid the hotel's bartender to sneak whiskey to his room. He became <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to perform, and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated the partnership and tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the Louisville Courier-Journal that they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel. The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.|$|E
60|$|Egbert {{came for}} a week-end, in his gritty, thick, sand-paper khaki and puttees and the hideous cap. Nay, he looked terrible. And {{on his face}} a {{slightly}} impure look, a little sore on his lip, {{as if he had}} eaten <b>too</b> much or <b>drunk</b> <b>too</b> much or let his blood become a little unclean. He was almost uglily healthy, with the camp life. It did not suit him.|$|R

5|$|Within {{hours of}} the first shots from the Royal Battery, the French {{defenses}} opposite fell silent, the only return fire coming from more distant flanking batteries. British fire intensified at noon when a battery of mortars opened a bombardment, and at 16:30 flags of truce were raised over the city's bastions. Clermont's offer requested a 24-hour ceasefire to negotiate terms, but Braithwaite allowed only until 08:00 the following morning, during which time the construction of British earthworks would continue. Clermont, isolated and unsupported, accepted the terms, and the following morning Braithwaite's army entered the city and took possession, although the French garrison had seized liquor supplies during the night and were <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to surrender formally.|$|E
25|$|When {{their ship}} was {{assaulted}} in 1720, {{the two women}} and an unknown man {{were the only ones}} to defend it, the other crew members being <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to fight. In the end they were captured and arrested.|$|E
25|$|Fun House {{was also}} poorly {{received}} by critics {{and the general}} public. Alexander was dismissed in August 1970 after arriving at the Goose Lake International Music Festival <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to play. He {{was replaced by a}} succession of new bass players, including former roadie Zeke Zettner and James Recca. Around this time, the band expanded their line-up by adding a second guitar player, roadie Bill Cheatham, who was eventually replaced by James Williamson, a childhood friend of the Ashetons and Alexander.|$|E

25|$|Wilson married Lois on January 24, 1918, {{just before}} he left to serve in World War I as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery. After his {{military}} service, Wilson returned {{to live with his}} wife in New York. He failed to graduate from law school because he was <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to pick up his diploma. Wilson became a stock speculator and had success traveling the country with his wife, evaluating companies for potential investors. (During these trips Lois had a hidden agenda: she hoped the travel would keep Wilson from drinking.) However, Wilson's constant drinking made business impossible and ruined his reputation.|$|E
25|$|Another popular running gag {{concerned}} the social habits of Benny's on-air orchestra, who were consistently {{portrayed as a}} bunch of drunken ne'er-do-wells. Led first by Phil Harris and later by Bob Crosby, the orchestra, and in particular band member Frank Remley, were jokingly portrayed as often being <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to play properly, using an overturned bass drum to play cards on just minutes before a show, and so enamored of liquor that {{the sight of a}} glass of milk would make them sick. Remley was portrayed in various unflattering situations, such as being thrown into a garbage can by a road sweeper who had found him passed out in the street at 4am, and on a wanted poster at the Beverly Hills police station.|$|E
25|$|At {{about the}} time Wright's command was {{arriving}} in Washington, Early's corps began {{to arrive at the}} breastworks of Fort Stevens, yet Early delayed the attack because he was still unsure of the federal strength defending the fort, much of his army was still in transit to the front, and the troops he had were exhausted due to the excessive heat {{and the fact that they}} had been on the march since June 13. Additionally, many of the Confederate troops had looted the home of Montgomery Blair, the son of the founder of Silver Spring, Maryland. They found barrels of whiskey in the basement of the mansion, called Blair Mansion, and many troops were <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to get a good start in the morning. This allowed for further fortification by Union troops.|$|E

60|$|Now it chanced that Roger Vanderwater {{was lying}} ill in his palace {{at the other}} end of Kingsbury--not the dire illness that strikes down you and me, brothers; just a bit of biliousness, mayhap, or no more than a bad {{headache}} because he had eaten <b>too</b> heartily or <b>drunk</b> <b>too</b> deeply. But it was enough for him, being tender and soft from careful rearing. Such men, packed in cotton wool all their lives, are exceeding tender and soft. Believe me, brothers, Roger Vanderwater felt as badly with his aching head, or THOUGHT he felt as badly, as Tom Dixon really felt with his arm torn out by the roots.|$|R
25|$|Empire Cowdray {{was built}} for the MoWT. She was {{initially}} operated under {{the management of the}} Alexander Steamship Company. Following completion in October 1944, two days of sea trials were held before the ship entered service. Following these, a cargo of coal was loaded at Hendon Docks. Once loading was complete, the crew were given a brief shore leave so that they could have a beer before the ship sailed to join a convoy. When it was time to sail, the crew ignored orders to return to their ship, not returning until being threatened with being put in jail. When the crew did return to the ship, they were <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to sail, causing the ship to miss the convoy. After they had sobered up, the crew were all fined for refusing the lawful command of the Captain and causing the ship to miss the convoy.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} {{experiences}} two separate flashbacks that reveal {{the true nature}} of the Origami Killer. The first takes place 34 years earlier, with two twin brothers playing in a construction site. One of the two, John Sheppard, falls into a broken pipe and gets his leg trapped, just as a rainstorm causes the pipe to begin filling with water. The second occurs shortly after, with John's brother running home to warn their father, only to find him <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to help. Scared and confused, the boy could only watch helplessly as his brother drowned. Thus, the Origami Killer was born: a killer who searches for a father willing to sacrifice himself. He kills his victims the same way his brother died. The boy turns out to be Scott; after he reached adulthood, he changed his surname to Shelby. His actions as an investigator are not meant to get justice for his victims; rather, he needed to collect the evidence of his crimes, which he burns in his office wastebasket.|$|E
25|$|Speirs' platoon {{spent the}} night of 6 June being shuffled in {{position}} with other platoons as the company was arranged for battle to begin early the next morning. A rolling artillery barrage had been coordinated {{in support of the}} ground assault on the morning of 7 June, to initiate the attack. It was here that PFC Art DiMarzio, who is also referenced in the book “Beyond Band of Brothers”, was eyewitness to an event. He stated that a replacement sergeant disobeyed a direct order while in a combat situation, thereby risking the lives of the other soldiers in the company. According to DiMarzio, Speirs, commanding 2nd platoon, Dog Company was given orders to halt their attack on Ste. Come-du-Mont, to hold position while regimental headquarters coordinated a rolling barrage shelling fifteen targets in the vicinity of Ste. Come-du-Mont. DiMarzio, who was lying in a prone position next to a sergeant, stated he remembered the sergeant being drunk. An order to hold position was given and relayed down the line which the sergeant refused to obey, wanting to rush forward and engage the Germans. Once again, Speirs gave him the order to hold his position. Speirs told the man that he was <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to perform his duties and that he should remove himself to the rear. The sergeant refused and began to reach for his rifle. Speirs again warned the sergeant, who now leveled his rifle at Speirs. Art DiMarzio says he then saw Speirs shoot the sergeant in self-defense. The entire platoon also witnessed the event. Lieutenant Speirs immediately reported the incident to his commanding officer, Captain Jerre S Gross. Eyewitness DiMarzio says that Captain Gross went {{to the scene of the}} shooting and after receiving all the information, deemed it justifiable self-defense. Captain Gross was killed in battle the next day, and the incident was never pursued.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, {{following}} {{the release of}} the first season of their self-titled television series, the band released their debut self-titled album on their own label, Sounds Like Good.

25|$|After being cautioned by the Oba {{about his}} late night movements, Prince Aderopo visits the village bar, where he meets his {{childhood}} friends, Banji (Femi Adebayo) and Tawa (Kehinde Bankole); the trio discuss the coming independence and their pasts. One {{of the guards}} assigned to protect the prince deserts his post {{to spend some time}} with his lover, close to a stream. Afonja and Danladi question the traditional priest, Baba Ifa (Ifayemi Elebuibon) on their way out of the bar; he responds to their questions proverbially and says that the killer will continue to kill until he is satisfied. The next day, the dead body of the lover of the guard who fled his post is discovered. Danladi orders the arrest of Baba Ifa, which Afonja outrightly refuses to carry out; he is thus suspended from his job and replaced by his deputy, Corporal Omolodun (Fabian Adeoye Lojede). Corporal Omolodun, however, is eventually killed by the serial killer after trailing him along the bush-path, following the discovery of another body, this time of an Igbo girl. The girl's father, a farmer Okafor (Kanayo O. Kanayo), along with his tribesmen, capture a travelling Northerner, claiming that he is responsible for the death of his daughter. The accused man is taken into custody by the police, but still maintains his innocence. Danladi informs his superiors that he will be closing the case, since he has found the killer. As he is about to transfer the Northerner away from Akote, Okafor throws a machete at him, piercing his heart. Even with his dying breath, the man insists he didn't kill the girl. Okafor, who repeatedly affirms his actions as doing what a real man would do, is taken into custody. At night, the officers gather to celebrate the Inspector's impending departure following the presumed victory over the killer. Dandali is persuaded into drinking against his will. On his way out he hears someone whistle a tune he was earlier told by the Northerner to be from the killer. The killer approaches him but he is <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to identify the face, and is assaulted by the killer.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Harold's sister, Hester, {{comes to}} Walford {{to visit and}} tells him that her son, David Samuels (Christopher Reich), is {{interested}} in joining him in Britain. As David is a doctor in Israel, Harold thinks {{it is a great}} idea and in April that year, David joins him in Walford and is made a partner in the practice. Harold even moves back to Walford and he and David live in the flat above the surgery. Despite being extremely fond of each other, the new partners argue about almost everything. David wants to modernize the surgery and bring in computers but Harold is set in his ways and is opposed to any obvious changes. Harold also disagrees with David's friendship with their secretary, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), particularly when the two get drunk at a Christmas party, leave together and share the same bed. David awakes the next day not remembering a thing, but is reassured when Michelle informs him that he had been <b>too</b> <b>drunk</b> to do anything untoward anyway. Harold is not convinced however and berates David for the degradation he brought upon himself and the surgery. Later, David and Harold fall out over Harold's treatment of patients when he discovers that Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), is showing early symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. He decides not to tell Colin as worrying about his condition could bring on another attack although Colin may not have another attack for 20 years or so, choosing instead to tell Colin that he is overworked and anemic. This highly unethical move appalls David but despite this, Harold continues to refuse to tell Colin about his illness. However, in January 1989, he finally tells Colin the truth. Colin is furious that Harold had kept this information from him and refuses to listen when he tries to explain his reasons. He threatens to report Dr Legg to the authorities and is mortified at how unethical he has been. Although Dr Legg is sorry, he stands by his decision to lie, feeling that Colin benefited from not knowing - when in fact, the opposite is true.|$|E
