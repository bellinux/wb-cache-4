5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities did not help to subdue the French uprising. Instead, the German reprisals had <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effect</b> and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E
5|$|In this {{flat and}} marshy area, the {{branches}} and roots of mangrove trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus.

50|$|The ensuing tax {{policies}} are accused for having <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effects</b> than intended, namely reducing instead {{of increasing the}} revenues, as high taxation discourages transactions and encourages tax evasion, thus perpetuating the depression. Some firms relocated abroad to avoid the country's higher tax rates.|$|R

5|$|Tires {{have a large}} {{influence}} over bike handling, especially on motorcycles, but also on bicycles. Tires influence bike dynamics in two distinct ways: finite crown radius and force generation.

Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effect,</b> but to a lesser degree.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Enrico Tortonese {{examined}} the Nice and Cayenne specimens of S. tudes (the Coromandel specimen having {{been lost in}} the interim) and concluded that they were not great hammerheads, but rather the same species as S. bigelowi. Carter Gilbert concurred in his 1967 revision of the hammerhead sharks, noting that while the lost Coromandel specimen was probably a great hammerhead, none of the existing material belonged to that species. Thus, Sphyrna tudes became the accepted name for the smalleye hammerhead, taking precedence over S. bigelowi because it was published earlier, and the great hammerhead received the next available name Sphyrna mokarran. Gilbert designated the Nice specimen as the lectotype that would define S. tudes, having priority over the Cayenne specimen (the paralectotype). This was meant to stabilize the name, but had <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the {{interest}} of strengthening the defenses of the kingdom, Andriamasinavalona divided his realm into four quadrants to be ruled by his four favorite sons. This decision had <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effect,</b> however; each was interested in expanding his own realm, prompting one son to kidnap the king and hold him hostage for seven years. After the king's eventual release, he famously committed a mock human sacrifice to re-sanctify his authority. Upon his death, Andriamasinavalona's sons launched military campaigns against one another to seize each other's territories, triggering 77 years of civil war in Imerina. In Madagascar today, Andriamasinavalona's reign is remembered as a golden age of justice, harmony and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. <b>The</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effect,</b> lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E
5|$|The war in Zululand {{effectively}} {{ended on}} 4 July 1879 with Chelmsford's decisive {{victory at the}} Zulu capital Ulundi. Around {{the same time the}} British appointed a new Governor and High Commissioner for the Transvaal and Natal, Sir Garnet Wolseley, who introduced a new Transvaal constitution giving the Boers a limited degree of self-government. Wolseley blunted the Zulu military threat by splitting the kingdom into 13 chiefdoms, and crushed Sekhukhune and the Bapedi during late 1879. He had little success in winning the Boers over to the idea of federation; his defeat of the Zulus and the Bapedi had <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effect,</b> as with these two long-standing threats to security removed the Transvaalers could focus all their efforts against the British. Most Boers refused to co-operate with Wolseley's new order; Kruger declined a seat in the new executive council.|$|E

5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effect,</b> decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
5|$|An ally of Illinois' Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge {{supported}} {{the doctrine of}} popular sovereignty as expressed in Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics – although it ultimately had <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effect</b> – and acted as a liaison between Douglas and Pierce to secure its passage. During {{the debate on the}} House floor, New York's Francis B. Cutting, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting's demand as a challenge to duel. Under code duello, the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used and the distance between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces. He also specified that the duel should be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his friend Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark as a challenge, believed that Breckinridge's naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 paces. While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the right to choose the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the peaceful resolution of the issue may have saved Breckinridge's political career.|$|E

30|$|We {{propose that}} <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>effects</b> of {{full-length}} pDBI and bDBI on morphine antinociception (Chen et al., 1991) {{are due to}} the opposing hydrophobicity of residues at position 60 and {{the different types of}} BDZ receptors. Interestingly, bDBI potentiates morphine effect of antinociception, but its 2 active fragments bDBI- 16 and bDBI- 19 show <b>opposite</b> <b>effects</b> (Figs.  2 and S 4).
