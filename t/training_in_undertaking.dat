40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of scale-model <b>trains</b> <b>in</b> crosswinds, <b>undertaken</b> to assess steady and unsteady aerodynamic effects of the vehicle movement simulation. A 1 : 25 scale-model <b>train</b> was tested <b>in</b> the University of Birmingham's TRAIN rig facility. A crosswind generator was designed and constructed to enable static and moving model experiments in the presence of crosswinds in this facility. An on­ board pressure measuring system comprising a series of miniaturised pressure transducers and a bespoke stand­ alone data logger were developed. Static and moving model experiments were carried out investigating a scale­ model of the Class 390 Pendolino train, on a nominal flat ground infrastructure scenario whilst subjected to a crosswind at 30 ° yaw angle. The test facility, measuring equipment and experimental methodology that were developed led to a more realistic underbody flow simulation and to a reduced margin of experimental uncertainty with respect to previous moving model tests. Furthermore, they enabled detailed surface pressure data to be measured, which are suitable for CFD benchmarking. The results support the reliability of wind tunnel tests on static vehicles for investigating steady aerodynamic coefficients but suggest that their use in the analysis of train unsteady aerodynamics is not entirely satisfactory. ...|$|R

By integrating low- and high-technology in the distance in-service teacher training programs, both the trainers (the university lecturers) and the student teachers (in-service school teachers) were able to transform their pedagogical skills. The student teachers learned to become independent learners. The university lecturers learned to adjust their teaching styles to be more learner-centred. Both the lecturers and the student teachers adopted task-based approaches to learning and teaching. Finally, the student teachers were given the means to upgrade their qualifications and teaching skills.

40|$|Aims. To {{ascertain}} nurses' {{views about}} <b>training</b> <b>in</b> and <b>undertaking</b> of medication reviews and to analyse documented pharmaceutical care issues (PCI) and outputs from nurse reviews. Background. Primary-care nurses in the UK are increasingly expected to contribute effectively to chronic disease management for example by undertaking medication reviews. There are concerns that nurse education is inadequate for these new roles. Little research is published about nurse medication reviews. A pilot study in one Scottish medical practice demonstrated that, after <b>training</b> <b>in</b> systematic medication review, practice-based nurses could identify medication-related problems. The training, consisting of reading material, including self-assessment questions and a training event, was subsequently offered to all practice-based nurses in the Community Health Partnership (CHP); participants then undertook six reviews to achieve CHP accreditation. Design. Survey of participant nurses {{and analysis of}} completed documentation from reviews. Methods. A self-completion, postal questionnaire distributed three months post-training. Analysis of documentation from reviews for PCI and outputs. Results. Eighty-one nurses were offered training: 64 (79 %) participated; 38 (59 %) returned questionnaires. Low confidence levels before training (0, very confident; 6, 16 % confident) rose afterwards (8, 21 % very confident; 19, 50 % confident). Thirty-two (84 %) nurses indicated the training had completely or mostly met their needs. A total of 120 nurse reviews were analysed and 188 PCI documented, mean 1 Â· 6 /patient, with 117 outputs, mean 1 Â· 0 /patient. Twenty-seven outputs (23 %) involved prescribed medicine changes. Conclusions. A pharmacist-supported <b>training</b> package <b>in</b> medication reviews for primary-care nurses is feasible and generally welcome. The training met the needs of most respondents although concerns were expressed regarding time pressures and knowledge base for extended roles. Relevance to clinical practice. Medication reviews are vitally important for both patients and the NHS; this approach may be useful for nurse prescribers and non-prescribers alike although concerns expressed will require attention...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} stages of the AIF's {{formation}} training was rudimentary and performed mainly at unit-level.

Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic <b>training</b> <b>in</b> drill and musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces.
