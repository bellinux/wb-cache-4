5|$|Living River Siam (Thai: โครงการแม่น้ำเพื่อชีวิต; {{formerly}} South East Asia Rivers Network, or SEARIN) is a <b>Thai</b> {{non-governmental organization}} (NGO) which analyzes {{the impact of}} Thailand's various dam projects and coordinates the research of indigenous peoples to give <b>Thai</b> villagers the power to document the influence of local rivers and dams. Founded in 1999, it gained prominence during the Pak Mun Dam study period in 2001, when it developed a method for instructing villagers on how to document {{the effects of the}} dammed river on their lives. When the <b>Thai</b> government proposed other dam sites, Living River Siam took its research methods to the villages surrounding those sites as well. Today, the organization works with other NGOs in Southeast Asia to counter government-sponsored research that encourages dam construction.|$|E

5|$|The Mekong River {{remained}} free of dams until 1993 {{because of}} its complex system of rapids which wreck boats, and the unusual monsoon season which reverses the course {{of some of its}} branches. In 2004, the <b>Thai</b> government made an agreement with China to open the river to commercial navigation by destroying rapids, which <b>Thai</b> Baan research had identified as important fish spawning grounds. On the Chinese side, dams were constructed. Living River Siam gathered additional <b>Thai</b> Baan surveys from 146 villagers in Amphoe Chiang Khong, which determined that the blasting of rapids had made the river water unsuitable for drinking and bathing, washed away many local riverside gardens, and decimated the populations of local plants and fish. In response to the 2004 studies, the <b>Thai</b> government suspended blasting on one of the rapids, the Khon Pi Luang.|$|E
5|$|The incongruous make-up {{between the}} Western lower half and <b>Thai</b> roof has been {{compared}} with a Farang (Western) lady clothed in Victorian costume while wearing a <b>Thai</b> crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition is the emphasis of the superiority of <b>Thai</b> architecture (as a crown upon the head) over those of the West (the {{lower half of the}} body). This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance over Western imperialism, both of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) against those of the traditional ruling elites (as led by some of his early ministers).|$|E
