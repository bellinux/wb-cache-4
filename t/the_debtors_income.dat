40|$|AbstractPersonal bankruptcy, as {{a process}} of debt relief, is very popular among those who want to solve their {{complicated}} financial situation nowadays.

There are two ways of processing personal bankruptcy: firstly debts of an individual can be repaid (partial or whole) by selling some of <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> assets. Secondly, depending on <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> <b>income,</b> part of <b>the</b> debt can be repaid through repayment plan. In this research it is not defined by which of these two ways is personal bankruptcy handled, but it concentrates on structure of debtors in particular regions of the Czech Republic such as gender, age, education and income.

40|$|The {{arguments}} {{put forward}} by Bulow and Rogoff (1988, 1991) against sovereign debt buybacks are re-examined in a willingness-to-pay framework. This paper argues that the Bulow-Rogoff framework treats default by a debtor as an event with no dead-weight loss, and, as such, underestimates the potential gains from a buyback. The willingness-to- pay framework allows dead-weight costs of default to be introduced in a consistent and simple fashion into the buybacks calculus. Two versions of this framework are considered. First, a model in which the default costs induce an all-or-nothing default decision is analysed. In this case, an ambiguous result is derived in which the variability of <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> <b>income</b> determines whether (small) buybacks are beneficial to <b>the</b> <b>debtor,</b> even though expected total transfers to the creditor increase, consistent with Bulow-Rogoff. In a second version, default costs are modelled so as to induce at most a partial default. This model corresponds most closely, {{in terms of the}} repayment behaviour of <b>the</b> sovereign <b>debtor,</b> to <b>the</b> models used by Bulow and Rogoff. It is shown that small buybacks are always beneficial to <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> in this case. The second version is extended to include an investment opportunity. Only if the country has sufficiently scarce resources when the investment can be made, will a buyback be harmful to the interests of <b>the</b> <b>debtor.</b> Sovereign Debt Buybacks Sanctions Willingness to Pay...|$|R

Some narrow classes of payments, for example, social security, are excluded from these figures.

40|$|ENG) DISCHARGE OF A DEBTOR - ONE OF MODES OF INSOLVENCY SOLUTION This diploma thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{detailed}} overview of the discharge from debts in the insolvency proceedings. The debt relief was incorporated into the Czech legal system by the Insolvency act, No. 182, 2006 Coll, which entered into force on the January 1 st 2008. The idea of debt discharge was led by an intention to provide highest possible and proportional satisfaction equally to all creditors {{and in the same}} time, to protect debtor's right to decent living conditions. In the case of successful debt discharge, <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> is forgiven part of his debts, as long as he performs his good will during entire insolvency process. <b>The</b> <b>debtor</b> must not have any debts originated in his business activities, unless he specifically agrees on an exception with the creditor. This determinates a debt discharge to be used mainly by individual persons, not by companies. Also, the final creditors' satisfaction must reach at least 30 % of debtor's claims. We distinguish two forms of debt discharge. In the first case, which is called audition, all debtor's assets are sold out and received funds are used for creditors' satisfaction. In the second case, which uses agreed payment schedule, all <b>debtor's</b> <b>income</b> over <b>the</b> minimum base is regularly [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Debt settlement, {{also known}} as debt arbitration, debt {{negotiation}} or credit settlement, is an approach to debt reduction in which <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> and creditor agree on a reduced balance that will be regarded as payment in full. During a negotiation period, all payments by <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> are made to the debt settlement company, which typically withholds payments to the creditors, even if <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> has paid a lump sum or made payments. Once all <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> accounts are in default due to this non-payment, the debt settlement company has leverage to force <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to accept a reduced lump sum payment as settlement. <b>The</b> <b>debtor's</b> credit rating goes down significantly due to the default, especially if <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> was not behind on payments before the negotiation period commenced. Even though the accounts are [...] "settled," [...] the default appears on <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> credit record for seven years.

50|$|In a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy ("Reorganization") {{the trustee}} is {{responsible}} for receiving <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> monthly payments and distributing those funds proportionally to <b>the</b> <b>debtor's</b> creditors. <b>The</b> Bankruptcy Trustee will act on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to guarantee that both the creditors’ and <b>the</b> <b>debtor’s</b> interests are maintained {{in accordance with the}} bankruptcy laws, and will often be required to act as a negotiator between the two parties.|$|R
40|$|The debt {{collection}} process in Anglo-American law {{is based on}} the creditor 2 ̆ 7 s right to receive payment from liquidation of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets. Judicial procedures are available to the unsecured creditor for the purpose of converting <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets to cash. Whenever <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s matured liabilities are greater than his assets, the collection process may be characterized as one of 2 ̆ 2 grab law 2 ̆ 2 in which the first creditors to take <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets succeed in effectuating collection. It is an economic necessity for creditors to have an efficient collection mechanism which gives them maximum protection in the event of default by <b>the</b> <b>debtor.</b> Nonetheless, all states shield <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> from complete destitution by keeping certain property, for example, life insurance proceeds, beyond the reach of creditors. By permitting <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to keep those assets necessary for his economic survival, state exemption laws fulfill important social policies which must be balanced against the need for creditor protection. When a debtor files a petition in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee takes title to most of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s property, thereby enabling the trustee to liquidate <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets for the benefit of creditors. The twofold purpose of federal bankruptcy law is to give <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> a fresh start by discharging his debts and to make an efficient, fair, and equitable distribution of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets among his creditors. By recognizing exemptions, both the Bankruptcy Act now in effect and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 permit <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to keep those assets needed for a fresh start while protecting the rights of creditors with respect to <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s nonexempt property...|$|R
