In this study, we present a novel strategy for selectively discriminating against rRNA and favoring mRNA from prokaryotes during synthesis of cDNA by reverse transcriptase. Our technique {{is based on the}} fact that rRNA sequences, in many species, are G + C rich relative to the genome at large, and highly conserved among prokaryotes. The sequence TTTT is therefore rarely found in rRNA sequences. However, TTTT priming sites are found at a much higher frequency in protein-encoding gene sequences.

It is also commercially available as an adjunct culture to enhance the aroma and texture of cheeses, as well as the color of the surface of smeared cheeses. The molecular mechanisms allowing the growth and adaptation of S. xylosus in the dairy products are still poorly understood. A microarray representing the S. xylosus C 2 a genome was used to determine how the gene expression profile was modified during growth and adaptation to a cheese model. The C 2 a strain was inoculated at 5. 6 log CFU/g in ultra filtered milk concentrated 5. 5 -fold and supplemented with UHT cream and salt. Then rennet was added. The temperature of incubation was decreased from 30 °C to 12 °C after 10 hours of culture, to mimic the temperature shift generally encountered during cheese making. The growth of S. xylosus in the cheese model was exponential until 5 hours and reached a maximum of 8. 7 log CFU/g at 24 h. S. xylosus population remained almost at this population level after 48 hours of incubation. <b>Total</b> <b>RNA</b> <b>extractions</b> were performed directly from the solid dairy matrix inoculated with S. xylosus after 6, 24 and 48 hours of incubation.
