40|$|<b>The</b> <b>kinked</b> crack, {{which is}} {{reflecting}} {{back into the}} first medium at the interface of two bonded anisotropic media under antiplane shear loading, is analyzed by using the singular point method of complex potential functions.

The vertex of <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack has <b>the</b> different stress singularity {{from that of the}} tips of <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack. Taking account of this stress singularity of the vertex as well as the stress singularity of <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack tips, <b>the</b> singular integral equations are solved numerically.

50|$|New {{classical}} economists, led by Chicago’s George Stigler, {{worked to}} discredit <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> demand models. Stigler first argues that <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> demand models are not useful, as Hall and Hitch’s model only explains observed phenomenon {{and is not}} predictive. He further explains that <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> demand analysis only suggests why prices remain sticky and does not describe the mechanism that establishes <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> and how <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> can reform once prices change. Stigler also asserts that the model is unnecessary because Chicago theory already included allowances for short-run sticky prices due to collusion, menu costs, and regulatory or bureaucratic inefficiencies in markets.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{have carried}} out pulsed {{measurements}} of <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> effect in InAlAs/InGaAs HEMT’s on InP with nanosecond resolution.

5|$|Davies {{travelled}} to United Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California on 11 April 1969, {{to produce}} American pop band The Turtles' LP Turtle Soup with engineer Chuck Britz. While in Los Angeles, Davies helped negotiate {{an end to}} the concert ban placed on <b>the</b> <b>Kinks</b> by the American Federation of Musicians in 1965. Although neither <b>the</b> <b>Kinks</b> nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, {{at the time it was}} widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. After negotiations with Davies, the Federation relented, opening up an opportunity for the group to return to touring in America. Once the main sessions for the Turtles LP were completed, Davies returned to England. While Davies was abroad, the other members of the band had been rehearsing and practising for the upcoming album, as well as lead guitarist Dave Davies' solo album, nicknamed A Hole in the Sock of.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new model for <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> effect in In-AlAs/InGaAs HEMT’s. The model {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> {{is due to a}} threshold voltage shift which arises from a hole pile-up in the extrinsic source and an ensuing charging of the surface and/or the buffer-substrate interface. The model captures the many of the observed behaviors of <b>the</b> <b>kink,</b> including <b>the</b> <b>kink's</b> dependence on bias, time, temperature, illumination, and device structure.

40|$|Impact {{ionization}} is {{the main}} cause of <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> effect in <b>the</b> saturation region of the output characteristics of the field effect transistors. In thin film transistors (TFTs) <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> effect is enhanced due to the presence of traps.

It is observed that <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> effect in conventional metal induced laterally crystal-lized (cMILC) -TFTs occurs at a lower drain bias than that in solid phase crystallized (SPC) -TFTs under the same gate drive. This is shown to result from the overlapping of the MIC/MILC interface and the drain metallurgical junction.

40|$|Abstract We study {{radiation}} and energy balance for an antiplane fault containing a kink. A semi-infinite crack {{with a sharp}} rupture front propagates along the flat portion of a kinked crack. At time t 0, the crack reaches <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> located at <b>the</b> origin of coordinates and continues propagating beyond <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> at a different speed. We com-pute the exact solution for this problem using a Chaplygin transformation, {{a variation of the}} well-known Cagniard–de Hoop method. We first establish an integral equation for the computation of stress intensity factor after <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> and then we solve numeri-cally for the velocity and stress field around the crack. We find that the propagation of the crack across <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> produces a sharp change in energy balance that in turn pro-duces a circular SH wave centered at <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> that we call <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> wave. Across <b>the</b> wavefront of this wave there is a sudden jump in particle velocity and radial stress. At the same time, a local stress concentration appears on the external side of <b>the</b> <b>kink.</b> We establish an exact energy balance for this problem in terms of energy rates per unit crack advance. Radiated energy is shown to maintain the balance between elastic en-ergy released by the bulk and energy used to make the crack advance. <b>The</b> <b>kink</b> wave-front is <b>the</b> boundary between a field dominated by the initial flat portion of the crack and a region dominated by radiation from <b>the</b> <b>kink...</b>|$|R

5|$|Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) is {{the seventh}} studio album by English rock band <b>the</b> <b>Kinks,</b> {{released}} in October 1969. Kinks frontman Ray Davies constructed the concept album as the soundtrack to a Granada Television play and developed the storyline with novelist Julian Mitchell; however, the television programme was cancelled and never produced. The rough plot revolved around Arthur Morgan, a carpet-layer, who {{was based on}} Ray and guitarist Dave Davies' brother-in-law Arthur Anning.

5|$|Beginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began {{exploring}} theatrical concepts on the group's albums; {{these themes}} became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 and continued through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). <b>The</b> <b>Kinks</b> found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted {{to a traditional}} rock format throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm. The band returned to hard rock for Low Budget (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.|$|E
40|$|In rock material, {{the smooth}} crack mostly becomes kinked crack during its growth {{due to the}} {{anisotropy}} of rock material. For <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack, <b>the</b> outer normal direction of the crack surface at <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> line is not unique, so the continuous element is not feasible to discrete the crack surface near <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> line. Therefore four types of new discontinuous element are employed for <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack. A dual boundary element method (DBEM) based on the method suited for the smooth crack problem is proposed to deal with <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack problem. <b>The</b> numerical verification shows that the results calculated with the present method are in very good agreement with those with the primary method for the smooth crack problem. Furthermore, the proposed method is used to analyze <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack in transversely isotropic rock material of infinite domain. The stress intensity factor (SIF) is obtained. The rectangular smooth crack in transversely isotropic rock material bends. The crack opening of both crack surfaces at two sides of <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> line has mutual inhibiting effect due to the crack surface subjected to uniformly-distributed normal load. The dip angle between the crack surface and the isotropy plane changes as the crack surface bends gradually. It is found that the fracture behavior of <b>the</b> <b>kinked</b> crack is also affected by the anisotropy of the rock material. 巖體材料的各向異性導致其中的光滑裂紋在擴展后會變為折線裂紋。對于折線裂紋,其折線處裂紋面外法線方向不惟一,不能用連續單元離散。為此,在光滑裂紋問題方法的基礎上,引入 4 種新的不連續單元來離散折線處裂紋面,建立了適用于折線裂紋問題的對偶邊界元方法,該方法基于橫觀各向同性基本解。算例驗證表明,該方法具有較好的精度。最后用該方法分析了橫觀各向同性巖體中的折線裂紋,得到了該類裂紋的應力強度因子。當裂紋面上作用法向均布力,橫觀各向同性巖體介質中的矩形光滑裂紋發生彎折時,折線兩側的裂紋面在張開時存在抑制效應,從而導致折線裂紋裂尖應力強度因子小于原光滑裂紋。同時還發現,隨裂紋面的逐漸彎折,其裂紋面對各向同性面的傾角發生變化,因此,其裂尖斷裂特性還受到巖體各向異性的影響...|$|R

5|$|Ray Davies {{travelled}} to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate {{an end to}} the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, {{opening up}} an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, <b>the</b> <b>Kinks</b> recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. <b>The</b> <b>Kinks</b> embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969.

The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.|$|E
40|$|Structural {{analyses}} in the Lake Edison area of {{the central}} Sierra Nevada, California, show that prominent north-northeast–trending lineaments represent traces of joints and faults that have accommodated slip within a 4. 8 -km-wide right-lateral north-northwest–trending monoclinal <b>kink</b> band. <b>The</b> kilometer-scale <b>kink</b> band formed in Cretaceous granitic rocks, and the closely spaced, mineralized joints and faults formed at 79 Ma. Joints and faults strike ∼ 070 ° within <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> band and 020 °– 030 ° outside <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> band. A kink-band kinematic model indicates that ∼ 3. 7 (+ 2. 1,− 1. 9) km of right-lateral displacement was accommodated across <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> band and {{that as much as}} 148 m of left-lateral slip on faults within <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> band occurred. A sensitivity study on four model parameters varied the angle made by the inner and outer limbs of <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> band, <b>the</b> number of faults within <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> band, and <b>the</b> kink-band width and length. This analysis yields estimates for right-lateral displacement across <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> band and left-lateral slip on faults within <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> band that fall into the range constrained by geologic relationships. Kinking may have been the last stage of right-lateral deformation, which started with development of the Rosy Finch shear zone. The presence of curved lineaments in the southern Sierra Nevada indicates that kilometer-scale kink bands may exist elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada batholith. Such arc-parallel kinking has been described in several other transpressive settings, and kilometer-scale kink bands may be a process by which late-stage, arc-parallel deformation is accommodated in convergent margins...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>the</b> ϕ 4 <b>kink</b> {{scattering}} from a spatially localized PT-symmetric defect {{and the effect}} of <b>the</b> <b>kink’s</b> internal mode (IM) is discussed. It is demonstrated that if a <b>kink</b> hits <b>the</b> defect from the gain side, a noticeable IM is excited, while for <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> coming from <b>the</b> opposite direction the mode excitation is much weaker. This asymmetry is a principal finding of the present work. Similar to the case of <b>the</b> sine-Gordon <b>kink</b> studied earlier, it is found that <b>the</b> ϕ 4 <b>kink</b> approaching <b>the</b> defect from the gain side always passes through the defect, while in the opposite case it must have sufficiently large initial velocity, otherwise it is trapped by the loss region. It is found that for <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> with IM <b>the</b> critical velocity is smaller, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> bearing IM can pass more easily through the loss region. This feature, namely the “increased transparency” of the defect as regards the motion of <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> in <b>the</b> presence of IM is the second key finding of the present work. A two degree of freedom collective variable model offered recently by one of the co-authors is shown to be capable of reproducing both principal findings of the present work.

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the complex {{interactions}} between sedimentology, morphology and hydrodynamics near a kink in an offshore tidal sandbank (Westhinder) and combines all these data to understand <b>the</b> <b>kink's</b> characteristics. <b>The</b> Westhinder sandbank lies {{in the northern part}} of the Belgian continental shelf, where the main hydrodynamical agents are the tidal currents. The data sets include two multibeam surveys, 59 surficial Van Veen grab samples and a hydrodynamical and sediment transport model (set up by MUMM). The different data sets point to a triple division of <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> region. <b>The</b> parts north and south of <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> are covered with larger dunes, culminating at the bank's crest into a symmetrical very-large dune. Here, the bank is actively maintained by a net sediment transport up both bank flanks and by higher residual water transport strengths. <b>The</b> <b>kink</b> part of <b>the</b> bank lies deeper, is characterized by a steeper eastern flank and by a faster and eastward movement of the very-large dunes over both bank flanks. Coarse sediments west of <b>the</b> <b>kink</b> reveal that <b>the</b> peak flood current is hindered by the changing orientation of the bank northward into a more rectilinear N-S position. The finest sediments are found on the lee slope and might be washed out from <b>the</b> <b>kink's</b> stoss slope.
