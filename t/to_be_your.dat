During this drive, {{those that}} paid {{a minimum of}} $1 had the {{opportunity}} to vote on 29 concept ideas. In addition, those that paid more than the average will get to vote on a concept idea for a prototype led by Pendleton Ward, the creator of Adventure Time. After the completion of the voting period, Double Fine developed the top voted ideas into game prototypes that were available for those that purchased the bundle. As with Amnesia Fortnight 2012, 2 Player Productions filmed the production of the prototype, which was available to people who purchased the bundle, as well as on a Blu-ray, along with the prototypes on a DVD, for those who paid a minimum of $35. The four pitches that were made into prototypes for Amnesia Fortnight 2014 were Dear Leader, an emergent narrative game led by Anna Kipnis, Little Pink Best Buds, a game about little pink creatures who want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> friend led by Pendleton Ward, Mnemonic, a surreal, first-person noir adventure led by Derek Brand, and Steed, a game set in a storybook land full of inept heroes led by John Bernhelm. One idea, Bad Golf 2, was not selected as a prototype, but a group of Double Fine fans have started working on developing the title themselves, with the blessing of its conceptor, Patrick Hackett and permission of Double Fine.|$|E

It very much works within the established structure of the genre, but it never allows itself to get lazy within that structure. It sets out to earn every moment, to convince the audience at every turn that this relationship is worth fighting for, that every problem that they face is a genuine tragedy. This is a film that believes that love is always a story worth telling, and not just some component of a larger commercial proposition." [...] Nazamel Tabares of Movies Philippines rated the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "How <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Yours</b> <b>is</b> my most favorite Dan Villegas film to date."

It may be a surprise as romantic comedies are just something we usually have in Philippine cinemas but How <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Yours</b> definitely wants <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remembered and it does everything impeccably." [...] Oggs Cruz of Rappler in a very positive review wrote that [...] "How <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Yours</b> <b>is</b> conventional entertainment done right. It enthralls {{without a lot of}} the pandering to the cheap thrills that commonly pervade romances." [...] Meanwhile, Eric T.

[...] Je C.C. of Philippine Entertainment Portal wrote that [...] "Both Bea and Gerald <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> deliver commendable performances here, playing as lovers whose commitments are pulled into the opposing poles of love and career.

[...] On the other hand, Rito P. Asilo of Philippine Daily Inquirer praised Bea Alonzo's performance saying that, [...] "The juggling act that Bea—her generation’s finest actress—had to accomplish serves as a showcase for her formidable thespic gifts.

[...] Meanwhile, both of Smith's albums under the label stiffed upon release. Her debut 1977 Monument album, Pure Connie Smith, only spawned one single, entitled [...] "Coming Around", which peaked outside the Top 40. Only one single released on the label became a significant hit, a cover of Andy Gibb's 1977 pop hit [...] "I Just Want <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Your</b> Everything", which peaked at No.14 on the country singles chart in 1978. Smith's next five singles on the label continued to descend into progressively lower positions on the country singles chart and because of poor record sales, Smith decided to go into semi-retirement in 1979 to raise her five children.|$|E

500|$|... "Borderline" [...] was {{recorded}} in February 1983 and ushered a change from Madonna's [...] normal vocal tone. A sentimental track, the song talks about a love that is never quite fulfilled. According to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández in his book Madonna's drowned worlds, the song's lyrics like [...] "Something in way you love me won't let me be/I don't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> prisoner so baby won't you set me free" [...] depicted a rebellion against male chauvinism. Madonna used a refined and expressive voice to sing the song, backed by Lucas's instrumentations. It is considered {{the best example of}} the working relationship between Lucas and Madonna, and he pushed her to find emotional depth in the song. Although sounding icy, the chorus is contemporary in style, and the vocal range for this song was later used by Madonna as her own personal range through her whole music career. It opens with a keyboard rich intro played on a Fender-Rhodes electric piano and a catchy synth melody provided by Fred Zarr. Bass player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture.|$|E
500|$|Lynsey Hanley {{writing for}} The Daily Telegraph {{described}} [...] "Girl" [...] as an obvious {{choice for a}} single and hailed it as [...] "Beyoncé's requisite feminist anthem". A reviewer from Billboard magazine felt that the band's [...] "personal transition from teen-dom to womanhood" [...] was most evident on [...] "Girl" [...] among other songs. Slant Magazine's Eic Henderson {{felt that it was}} a [...] "smooth bump-and-grinder... almost sunk by the group's hyperbolic vocal arrangements". Vibes writer Dimitri Enrlich concluded, [...] "Destiny's Child refuses to play it safe with cookie-cutter formulas" [...] something he found evident on [...] "Girl". The Observer reviewer Kitty Empire noted that the band's characteristic female solidarity, [...] "is limply expressed in 'Girl', on which they purport <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> best friend". While reviewing #1's, Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine described the song as [...] "lovely". Jess Harvell writing for Pitchfork Media opined, [...] "'Girl' was a stroll over a 9th Wonder-produced Dramatics sample through bros-before-hoes territory as latte frothy as its 'Sex & the City' video." [...] Idolator's Mike Wass gave a more mixed review for [...] "Girl" [...] describing it as [...] "slightly sappy".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E

I {{just wanted}} to yell out 'He's behind you, he's behind you!' It takes sheer {{brilliance}} {{to be able to}} act that badly". Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, describes Paul as being very similar to fictional character J. R. Ewing. Paul is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching Neighbours, with scenes featuring Paul and Gail receiving disapproval from Harold, Amanda opines that she believes the couple are in love. Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail commented on Paul's obsession with Rebecca stating: [...] "You can't help feeling that nothing short of a stake through the heart is going to keep Paul out of Rebecca's life." [...] Stephen later said [...] "Taking advice from Paul is like asking Charlie Sheen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> spirit guide." [...] Paul Kalina of The Age said Dennis as Paul lightens things up and he prances about like [...] "a pantomime villain minus the moustache and cape." [...] Kalina added [...] "Erinsborough just would not be the same without him."

Bass player Anthony Jackson doubled Dean Gant's synth bass to provide a solid and more complex texture. The chords in the song were inspired by Seventies disco sound in Philadelphia as well as Elton John's musical style during the mid-seventies. The chord sequences cite from Bachman–Turner Overdrive's song [...] "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" [...] while the synth phases display her typical musical style. The third track [...] "Burning Up" [...] has a starker arrangement, brought about by bass, single guitar and Linn drum machine. The drum beats used in the song were reminiscent to the records of singer Phil Collins. It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time. The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines, while the bridge consists of a series of double entendres; the lyrics describing what Madonna is prepared to do for her lover, and that she is individualistic and shameless.|$|E
