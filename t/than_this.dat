5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher <b>than</b> <b>this</b> population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson {{has argued that the}} ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E
5|$|As a vegetarian, Higgins {{promoted}} {{the health benefits}} of not eating meat in a 2005 advertising campaign by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA); and has supported their anti-fur stance. She is interested in environmental issues and is involved with the Sierra Club, a grassroots organisation based in California. She has protested against the proposed industrialisation of the Kimberley region of Western Australia and donated the royalties from her 2009 EP More <b>Than</b> <b>This.</b> Since early 2007, Higgins has tried to make her tours carbon neutral, she purchases green energy to power venues, uses hybrid cars where possible and purchases carbon offsets.|$|E

5|$|As {{was common}} in English {{cities in the}} Middle Ages, Canterbury {{employed}} a town band known as the Waits. There are records of payments to the Waits starting from 1402, though they probably existed earlier <b>than</b> <b>this.</b> The Waits were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for 'misdemeanors' but were reinstated in 1660 when they played for the visit of King Charles II on his return from exile. Waits were eventually abolished nationally by the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835. A modern early music group called The Canterbury Waits has revived the name.|$|E

5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older <b>than</b> <b>this</b> group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E

5|$|Crickets have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{found in all}} parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number <b>than</b> <b>this</b> could have been present because some species are mute.|$|E

5|$|Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, {{and many}} {{organoboron}} compounds are relatively nontoxic to {{humans and animals}} (with toxicity {{similar to that of}} table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2g are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more <b>than</b> <b>this</b> is considered toxic in more than a few doses.

Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the telescope was varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the telescope was pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better <b>than</b> <b>this</b> value.
