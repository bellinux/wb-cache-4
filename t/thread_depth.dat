2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full <b>thread</b> <b>depth.</b> Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E
5000|$|Threads can be (and often are) {{truncated}} a bit more, yielding <b>thread</b> <b>depths</b> of 60 {{percent to}} 75 {{percent of the}} [...]65p value. For example, a 75 percent thread sacrifices {{only a small amount}} of strength in exchange for a significant reduction in the force required to cut the thread. The result is that tap and die wear is reduced, the likelihood of breakage is lessened and higher cutting speeds can often be employed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} {{adopting}} 26 tpi, is brass tube has a relatively similar wall thickness {{irrespective of the}} outside diameter of the tube, therefore as BSW <b>thread</b> <b>depths</b> {{are determined by the}} threads per inch, a lower tpi would reduce the strength of the tube or cut right through it. Brass tube threads can be confused with the British Standard Cycle thread, one of which that is most common is also 26 tpi.

In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally threaded hole (tapped holes).

50|$|The Löwenherz thread form {{is unique}} in having a thread pitch angle of 53° 8′ (53.1333°), which is a smaller angle than the ISO metric thread form but a larger angle than the Thury thread form. The unusual angle was chosen so that the pitch would be {{approximately}} equal to the thread's triangular height; however, the design was later truncated (flattened) at the roots and crests of the thread {{by a factor of}} one-eight the pitch, so the pitch is about 25% larger than the height, and the <b>thread's</b> <b>depth</b> is about 75% the length of its pitch. The Löwenherz fastener is specified for 31 diameters at irregular intervals ranging from 1mm to 40mm, each with a single corresponding pitch. (This further differentiates the Löwenherz thread from the ISO metric thread, where screws must be specified by both their diameter and pitch because multiple pitches exist for a single diameter.) Löwenherz fasteners are assembled using standard metric wrenches or sockets, and often the hex size for bolt heads and nuts is repeated (so 17mm wrenches can be used on both 9mm and 10mm Löwenherz hardware).|$|R
40|$|DE 19823511 A UPAB: 20000118 NOVELTY - A screw {{conveyor}} and antistatic devices {{are used to}} control the rate of addition of the material to the air stream. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The material is stored in a vessel with a conical base to lead the material towards a dosing screw (19) which passes the material through a bush (24) to a nozzle (2) into which atmospheric air is led at an air inlet (4). A pipe carries the mixture to an injector (27) activated by compressed air with which it forms the aerosol. The conical base of the storage vessel is ribbed, and the air entering nozzle (2) can be electrically charged, to counter static charges produced within the material. Dosing can be varied by altering {{the speed of the}} dosing screw motor or mounting screws with different pitches and <b>thread</b> <b>depths.</b> A swing arm (26), running close to the walls of the storage vessel, is attached to the screw shaft. The equipment is intended for small-scale operation with a material usage between 2 g/h and 10 mg/h. USE - For the small-scale production of fiber, or powder, containing aerosols. ADVANTAGE - Precise control of the material concentration is possible...|$|R
40|$|Dispensing any fluid {{material}} onto a mixed technology {{printed circuit}} board (PCB) substrate has two basic requirements: applying the material to the exact location required, and dispensing a dot of exact volume. Due to the decreasing pad sizes, and the typical density required in the material pattern, these are major challenges [3]. There are two basic types of dispensing mechanisms that are used for practical production: the Archimedes Metering Valve (AMV) and the Positive Displacement Pump [5]. The performance of the Archimedes Screw in the AMV depends {{a great deal on}} screw design and operating conditions. The principle geometric variables of the Archimedes Screw are the channel depths, i. e., the radial distance between the cylinder surface and root diameter of the screw, the pitch of the screw, the type of threads and the number of channels through which the material can flow. The dimensions of the nozzle, such as the nozzle ID and stand off height, and the rheological properties of the material also influence the parameters required for a consistent dot. Dispensing with an AMV is based on the laws of momentum, fluid dynamics, energy, and mass transport. The amount of material dispensed depends upon the pitch of <b>threads,</b> <b>depth</b> of cut, type of thread, length of screw, the number of starts, and angle of rotation of the screw. The quantity of material dispensed increases with an increase in depth of cut, decrease in pitch, increase in encoder counts, and increasing the number of channels.

5000|$|Development of the Thury thread {{began in}} 1876, when the Horological Section of Geneva Society of Arts {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} look into the requirements for a uniform thread standard for use in Horological arts in Switzerland. Professor Thury began his studies by collecting and measuring samples of screws made by nine independent screw and screw tackle manufacturers in Switzerland. The Thury thread form was developed in 1878, thirty-seven years after the British Standard Whitworth thread form was designed in England and fourteen years after the United States Standard thread was presented in the United States. However, unlike these two predecessors, the Thury thread was designed for small-diameter screws which were then produced with screw plates. This production technique mandated that the Thury thread form have rounded crests and roots. Thread forms with rounded or [...] "radiused" [...] crests and roots like the Thury and Whitworth thread generate smaller stress risers than those forms like the American National or ISO metric which have truncated roots and crests; in modern engineering this is particularly important factor when tapping holes in acrylic plastic, where a larger stress riser can lead to an earlier onset of crack formation. The Thury thread is unusual in having a comparatively small 47.5° thread flank angle, which was chosen to make fabrication easier and to achieve greater holding capacity than screws with larger flank angles. Screws in the Thury thread system are given nominal sizes, with the base size [...] "0" [...] being six millimeters in diameter and having a thread pitch of one millimeter. Sizes are proportional, so a size [...] "1" [...] is ten percent smaller in diameter that a size [...] "0", while a size -1 is ten percent larger than a size [...] "0". The Thury thread was {{believed to be the first}} thread form to solve the problem of creating a single system of screw dimensions applicable to all sizes. The relationship between the pitch P of a Thury screw and its diameter D is expressed by the equation D=6P5/6. Another variable Thury standardized is the <b>thread</b> <b>depth,</b> which had until then been variable when cutting threads in different materials. The proliferation of the Thury standard was hindered when in 1882, the British Science Association produced a committee report on the consideration of a standard screw gauge, where they declined to accept the Thury thread but instead chose to use the Whitworth thread standard previously designed by committee member Joseph Whitworth, in part because the Whitworth form was historically successful and because the committee did not believe England was prepared to use a metric thread as its standard. However, the committee recognized the validity of many of the design aspects of the Thury thread, and a mere two years later published their specifications for the British Association (BA) thread. The BA committee made only slight modifications to the rounding radii of Thury thread and gave specifications rounded to the nearest mil.|$|E

Methods: Quasi-three dimensional photoelastic models were created with MSI 2 ̆ 7 s embedded and then loaded with 60 and 104 grams respectively and evaluated under a full field reflection polariscope. The control MSI 2 ̆ 7 s (1. 0 mm pitch / 0. 25 mm <b>thread</b> <b>depth)</b> were compared to 3 experimental groups (n= 10) which varied with only one design characteristic: Group 1 (0. 75 mm pitch), Group 2 (1. 25 mm pitch) and Group 3 (0. 40 <b>thread</b> <b>depth).</b> The maximum shear stress (tmax) was calculated at 5 predetermined and standardized points. A two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the means of tmax followed by a Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s post hoc (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Results: No statistical differences were found for tmax between the control group and each of the 3 experimental groups except at point 4. At point 4, the control group was higher by an average of 5. 05 and 7. 1 MPa for the 60 and 104 gram loads respectively (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). No statistically significant differences were found for points 1, 2, and 5 for the 60 gram load and for points 1, 2, 3, and 5 for the 104 gram load. The mean tmax from highest to lowest was located at points 53 ̆c 13 ̆c 23 ̆c 4 3 ̆c 3 in both the 60 and 104 load steps. The variability in tmax at point 4 may have been due to its proximity to the neutral zone of the present loading conditions.

The results of this study suggest that, within limits, variation of pitch and <b>thread</b> <b>depth</b> of MSI 2 ̆ 7 s may not have a significant influence on the stress generation when loaded for orthodontic purposes.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to the design}} of a finite-element model {{simulating}} accurately the pullout behaviour of cylindrical pedicle screws and predicting their pullout force. Three commercial pedicle screws, subjected to pure pullout from synthetic bone, were studied experimentally. The results were used for the design, calibration and validation of a finite-element model. Special attention was paid to the accurate simulation of the failure inside the host material under shear. For this purpose, a bilinear cohesive zone material model was adopted, controlling the mode-II debonding of neighbouring elements {{in the vicinity of the}} screw. Comparison between experimental and numerical results proved that the implementation of this approach can significantly enhance the accuracy of the numerical simulation of a screw's mechanical behaviour under pure pullout loads. The numerical model was used for the parametric study of various factors affecting the pullout performance of a cylindrical pedicle screw. It was concluded that the major parameter influencing the pullout force is the outer radius (increasing its value by 36 % increases the pullout force by 34 %). The influence of the purchase length of the screw is of similar quantitative nature. The respective dependence on the <b>thread</b> inclination, <b>depth</b> and pitch was significantly weaker.
