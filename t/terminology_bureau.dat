50|$|In November 1928 {{the first}} Kyrgyz Research Institute of Regional Studies was opened. This {{as well as}} most of Kasymâ€™s other initiatives, such as {{creation}} of a Literature Bureau, a Didactic <b>Bureau</b> <b>Terminology</b> Commission, and a national Museum, was a very practical effort aimed at formation of Kyrgyzstan into a nation state. These new institutions created fundamental methodologies for the Kyrgyz education system, created the basis for the development of science, etc. Kasym not only coordinated the activities of the Terminology Commission, but was actively involved in creating Kyrgyz terminology. He considered terminology as a separate trend in Kyrgyz language study, so he laid out its main principles and the methods for composition of so-called term systems. Based on these original findings he and his colleagues finalized the Theory for Terminology in Kyrgyz language in 1928.|$|R
