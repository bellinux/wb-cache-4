Research on men as fathers bears the same contradiction, showing a man, who has got {{both traditional and}} more family and relation oriented characteristics. By asking {{men and women to}} tell about their life plans, their experiences of family life, gender and equality, we have tried to get hold of changes between ideal and gender identity, within the family context. The results show that the family with the focus on the children dominates the life plan of men and of women. We also find great similarities between the sexes in what they tell as about their family project. Differences appear, however, in what men and women <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they do in their everyday family praxis. In the conflict between traditional roles, equality and every day praxis, men and women create routines which are effective, but also producing ambivalence in the conception of one self as parent, sex partner and equal partner of a married couple.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 29 th May 2019. There are well {{documented}} concerns with {{the imposition of}} high stakes testing {{into the fabric of}} school education, and there is now an increasing focus on how such tests impact children’s ‘well-being’. This can be witnessed in reports in the popular news media, where discussion of these impacts frequently refer to ‘stress’ and ‘anxiety’. Yet, there is no work that is able to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is happening in the bodies of the teachers and children who are living this schooling in the day-to-day; whether this is best considered through the languages of ‘stress’; or what the implications – emotional, educational, embodied – of these experiences might be. This paper develops a transdisciplinary approach that brings social and biological accounts together in order to address the ‘more-than-social’ of the emotionality of childhood and schooling. We seek out opportunities for transdisciplinary connectivity and for new ways of seeing and knowing about learning. We consider what these ways of seeing and knowing might offer to education...|$|E
40|$|What can {{the past}} {{tell us about}} the future(s) of the body? The origins of this {{collection}} of papers lie {{in the work of the}} Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities which has been involved in presenting a series of international workshops and conferences on the theme of the cultural life of the body. The rationale for these events was that, in concepts as diverse as the cyborg, the questioning of mind/body dualism, the contemporary image of the suicide bomber and the patenting of human genes, we can identify ways in which the future of the human body is at stake. This volume represents an attempt, not so much to speculate about what might happen, but to develop strategies for bodily empowerment so as to get “back to the future of the body”. The body, it is contended, is not to be thought of as an “object” or a “sign” but as an active participant in the shaping of cultural formations. And this is emphatically not an exercise in digging corpses out of the historical archive. The question is, rather, what can past lived and thought experiences of the body <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the body can be(come) ...|$|E

40|$|What {{kinds of}} {{principles}} might underpin {{the development of}} ideas by young people for transforming the education system they currently experience? From March 2006 until May 2007, Open University and University of Exeter staff collaborated with young people in two secondary schools, to explore this question, {{as part of a}} development and research project, funded by the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts. The programme, Aspire Pilot, offered young people a leadership role in developing provocations to support their own thinking, that of their peers and others, in considering future learning systems, or ‘schome’ (not school - not home - schome – the education system for the information age) (Twining, 2003). Aspire Pilot reflected a growing movement by policy makers here in the United Kingdom as well as in North America and Australasia, to offer young people a voice in their learning offer by sharing their schooling experience (Fielding, 2006). This paper offers an exploration of the theoretical influences which shaped this project, firstly in its substantive focus and operation, and secondly in the methodology for researching it. Finally some reflections are offered on what our research strand <b>tells</b> <b>us,</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> aspects of the theoretical frame have manifested in practice for those involved, and particularly for the young people, in relation to aspiring to transform education...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{addresses}} three questions. First, what is {{the deep}} pleasure that humans take from video games? Second, {{what is the}} relationship between video games and real life? Third, what do the answers to these questions have to do with learning? Good commercial video games are deep technologies for recruiting learning as a form of profound pleasure, and have much to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> learning could look like in the future should we relinquish the old grammars of traditional schooling. They are extensions of life insofar as they recruit and externalize some fundamental features of how humans orientate themselves in and to the real world when operating at their best. Video games create a projective stance in the sense of a stance toward the world in which we see the world simultaneously as a project imposed on us and as a site onto which we can actively project our desires, values and goals. A special category of games allows players to enact the projective stance of an ‘authentic professional’, thereby experiencing deep expertise of the kind that so widely eludes learners in school...|$|E

40|$|The Swedish writer Per Olof Sundman (1922 - 1992) wrote mostly {{short stories}} and novels, but also reportages. The paper deals with two reportages from the Lofoten islands, Människor vid hav (1966, “People by the sea”) and Lofoten, sommar (1973, “Lofoten, summer”) The choice of the Lofoten islands as a subject is related to a fascination Sundman felt towards {{northern}} and arctic regions, a fascination he also expressed {{in a number of}} fictional narratives and in the documentary novel Ingenjör Andrées luftfärd (1967. English title: The Flight of the Eagle) A question that arises almost immediately is whether that fascination affects the way the reporter works and how it affects it. How does Sundman look at the Lofoten? What does he take notice of and <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about?</b> <b>What</b> kind of image does he give? And how does he understand his own role, his function as an investigator in an environment which is neither his own nor his postulated readers’ usual environment? Another question deals with the relati onship between the reportages from the Lofoten and the author’s other works. Are the reportages easy to recognize as Sundmanian texts, can Sundman’s “signature” be traced in them? It appears that “People by the sea” and “Lofoten, summer” are not merely informative texts. They also to a rather high degree suggest an atmosphere, using among other things inherited representations and judgements to that purpose. Those reportages turn out to be strongly literary texts, in the traditional meaning of the word. </p...|$|E

The introductory chapter situates the remaining chapters in the context of mathematics education research. In the second chapter I explore what the literature on proof <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> role proof might play in the promotion of learning in the mathematics classroom.

In the third chapter I look at empirical data to explore ways engaging in proof and proving might create opportunities for student learning. In particular, my analysis led me to focus on how identifying and reflecting on the key idea of a proof can create opportunities for learning mathematics.
