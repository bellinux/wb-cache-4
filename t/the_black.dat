5|$|After the 1848 {{finding of}} gold in the Sierra Nevada and {{dramatic}} gains in new wealth from it, other men {{became interested in the}} potential for gold mining in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer's announcement {{of gold in}} <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hills triggered <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hills Gold Rush.

5|$|Russia saw <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E

He then kills himself {{as part of a}} ritual that forces Celebrimbor to depart from Talion and merge with himself. This allows Sauron to possess <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hand's body and incarnate in physical form. However, Celebrimbor is able to briefly paralyze Sauron from within, allowing Talion to destroy Sauron's physical form. With <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Hand dead, Celebrimbor wishes to depart for Valinor. Talion instead convinces him to stay and attempt to overthrow Sauron. Gazing at Mount Doom, Talion declares his intention to forge a new Ring of Power.|$|E

5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west.
