50|$|JM Hunter was a {{prominent}} businessman in the Maranoa district and was {{actively involved in the}} public life of his community and in Queensland politics. He served as an Alderman on the Roma Town Council in 1898 and 1899 and as Mayor of Roma in 1900. He was instrumental in establishing the Roma Co-operative Milling Co. Ltd, which in 1900 constructed the Roma Co-operative Flour Mill and produced Excelsior brand flour until acquired by the Dominion Flour Milling Co. in 1914. He was a President of the Western Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Association, which held its annual show at Roma. He was closely associated with the formation of the Queensland Traders' Association, a leading wholesale <b>trading</b> <b>co-operative</b> with headquarters in Brisbane, of which he was chairman from its inception.|$|E
40|$|The study investigates whether government-sponsored {{community}} development {{projects in the}} township of Mdantsane, Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa, have achieved the intended goal of alleviating poverty among the beneficiaries. The specific outcomes of poverty alleviation are: improved income, acquisition of new skills, reduced dependence on welfare grants. Four urban farming projects were selected, namely: Buffalo City Organic Producers, Sakhisizwe Nursery, Lusindiso Farmer’s <b>Trading</b> <b>Co-operative</b> and Mbombela Co-operative. Focus group discussions and a mini survey were conducted with project beneficiaries, while relevant government officials were interviewed. Conceptual insights were drawn from {{community development}} theory. The findings showed that the broader context within which the projects occurred was characterised by a pro-poor social policy, relative availability of resources with which to translate it into action, and a measure of entrepreneurial potential amongst community members. However, while one of the projects showed some promise (in the sense that beneficiaries acquired new skills and had a generally positive attitude despite not enjoying any improved income status), all the others appeared doomed and trapped in dynamics such as: excessive government control of {{the management of the}} initiatives, ineffective project monitoring, and the mischaracterisation of the initiatives by both the government and the beneficiaries. A distorted sense of ownership and perverse community participation seemed to prevail, which in turn robbed the initiatives of their poverty alleviation potential. The study thus concluded that specific benefactor-beneficiary dynamics are crucial for the success of a given anti-poverty intervention. A robust pro-poor social policy, availability of resources with which to translate it into action, and local entrepreneurial potential do not in themselves bring about success; they must operate in a certain way and be undergirded by certain principles for them to become a powerful mechanism for alleviating poverty. It is against this background that the researcher offers some recommendations...|$|E

40|$|The article {{contains}} a trial of determining the share of internal trade in the national income of Poland in the post-war period. The share was examined against a backround of other divisions of the national economy. In such degree, to which the available source material permitted, proportions of growth of the national income owing to internal trade were presented {{against a background of}} development of internal trade in other socialist countries. As the starting point of analysis the proposition was adopted, that the industrial growth under conditions of a socialist economy could be treated as a determinant of economic development of the whole national economy. Hence the share of internal trade in national income is considered in connection with industrial growth. Using the regression analysis the author aims at identification of economic regularities within that scope. Much attention, besides estimation of development tendency, was devoted to the structure of the national income worked out in that division of the national economy. The national income was analysed with taking into account forms of ownership (state <b>trade,</b> <b>co-operative</b> <b>trade,</b> private trade) and several branches and organisational forms.
