5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special effects for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; {{it was up to}} Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special effects team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E
500|$|Though Goffman {{is often}} {{associated}} with the symbolic interaction school of sociological <b>thought,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not see himself as a representative of it, and so Fine and Manning conclude that he [...] "does not easily fit within a specific school of sociological thought". His ideas are also [...] "difficult to reduce to a number of key themes"; his work can be broadly described as developing [...] "a comparative, qualitative sociology that aimed to produce generalizations about human behavior".|$|E

However, in doing so, he makes more questionable investments and becomes bankrupt. The bank forecloses on the plant and puts Lenny in charge, and sells Mr. Burns' house to pro wrestler Bret Hart.|$|E
25|$|An ICM poll in September 2007 saw Cameron {{rated the}} least popular {{of the three}} main party leaders.

In the run up to the 2015 election, Cameron achieved his first net positive approval rating in four years, with a YouGov poll finding 47% of voters <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was <b>doing</b> well as prime minister compared with 46% who <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was <b>doing</b> badly.|$|R

500|$|... "Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Goldberg. This episode was his first time working for the show, and {{was a result of}} Goldberg being creator Seth MacFarlane's assistant. He wrote the episode, and {{executive}} producer David A. Goodman <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a [...] "fantastic job". He would later go on to write the season seven episode [...] "The Juice is Loose". The episode was directed by former Mission Hill and The Oblongs director and series veteran Julius Wu, who {{had been a member of}} the show's staff since the fifth season episode, [...] "The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou". Directors Peter Shin and James Purdun acted as supervising directors.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Lely, who was knighted, Wright never {{received}} significant recognition from King Charles. However, {{at least one}} admirer <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> deserve it. In 1669, Wright and the miniaturist Samuel Cooper had met Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Cosimo later called at Wright's studio where he commissioned {{a portrait of the}} Duke of Albemarle from Wright. On 3 March 1673, perhaps some time after Wright had painted his state picture of Charles II (now in the Royal Collection), a strange letter was sent from an obscure [...] "Mairie Lady Hermistan" [...] (evidently a fellow Roman Catholic) to Cosimo, asking him to intercede with the King to grant Wright a baronetcy. However, nothing came of the request.|$|E
500|$|Both Terry Rossio and Bill Marsilii have {{acknowledged}} that the film was not shot {{the way they had}} wanted it to be, shifting the blame to director Tony Scott and his goal to focus more on the action aspect of the film than on the more meaningful plot the screenplay had called for. Marsilii, although [...] "quite critical of the mistakes made," [...] said he was proud of the finished product. Rossio, however, was so put off during filming that he, as of May 2008, had not seen the film. Rossio complained that Scott had ignored the inclusion of important plot details from the screenplay whenever [...] "there was something he wanted to do" [...] instead. In the DVD commentary, Scott admits that he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a mediocre job shooting [...]|$|E

500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Alun Owen, who was chosen because the Beatles were familiar with his play No Trams to Lime Street, and he had shown an aptitude for Liverpudlian dialogue. McCartney commented, [...] "Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and put words in our mouths that he might've heard us speak, so I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a very good script." [...] Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like [...] "a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room"; the character of Paul's grandfather refers to this in the dialogue. Owen wrote the script from the viewpoint that the Beatles had become prisoners of their own fame, their schedule of performances and studio work having become punishing.|$|E
500|$|Gabrielle Union, a {{rape victim}} {{and one of the}} main stars of The Birth of a Nation, wrote in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "As {{important}} and ground-breaking as this film is, I cannot take these allegations lightly. On that night, 17-odd years ago, did Nate have his date’s consent? It’s very possible he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Yet by his own admission he did not have verbal affirmation; and even if she never said “no,” silence certainly does not equal “yes.” Although it’s often difficult to read and understand body language, the fact that some individuals interpret the absence of a “no” as a “yes” is problematic at least, criminal at worst." [...] Sources suggest that Parker and Celestin's accuser was either unconscious or extremely drunk when Parker invited Celestin to have sex with her (Parker was already actively engaged in a sex act with her at the time).|$|E
500|$|... "The Juice Is Loose" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Goldberg and {{directed}} by Cyndi Tang. The writing process began when Goldberg was creator Seth MacFarlane's assistant and was given a freelance episode. He wrote [...] "Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air", and executive producer David A. Goodman <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a [...] "fantastic job". Goldberg submitted a three-page list of ideas for his next episode, and MacFarlane especially liked the story for [...] "The Juice Is Loose". They had to add a title card {{in the beginning of}} the episode saying that it was a [...] "lost episode", as O. J. Simpson was sent to jail before the episode aired. The episode features a three-minute long segment of an archive video of Conway Twitty performing [...] "I See the Want To in Your Eyes", and executive producer Chris Sheridan had to explain to the Fox executives why the segment should be featured in the episode.|$|E

500|$|Mendes {{found that}} he still had to {{convince}} DreamWorks' production executives to let him direct. He had already discussed the film with Jinks and Cohen, and felt they supported him. Ball was also keen; having seen Cabaret, he was impressed with Mendes' [...] "keen visual sense" [...] and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not make obvious choices. Ball felt that Mendes liked to look under the story's surface, a talent he felt {{would be a good}} fit with the themes of American Beauty. Mendes' background also reassured him, because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production. Over two meetings—the first with Cooper, Walter Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald, the second with Cooper alone—Mendes pitched himself to the studio. The studio soon approached Mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules—$150,000. Mendes accepted, and later recalled that after taxes and his agent's commission, he only earned $38,000. In June 1998, DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted Mendes to direct the film.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the record}} crowd {{remained}} after the game as they watched Seattle players and coaches engaged in the post match trophy awarding ceremony and celebrated on the field. [...] In the post match press conference, Sigi Schmid praised his team's defensive efforts in the match, saying [...] "We talked about making sure their defenders – and primarily Pável Pardo – didn’t {{have a chance to}} lift their heads and hit those long balls in behind." [...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{a very good job of}} stepping up to Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They’re a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> that so great." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E

Philip Opas' junior in the trial, Brian Bourke, was filmed in 2005 saying ″One {{of the problems of}} Ryan's trial was an alleged admission that he made on the plane back to the homicide fellows. That sort of thing can't happen now, because they've got to be recorded on tape, but whether he made the admission or was verballed, I don't know. He was a pretty talkative fellow, he might have.

2500|$|III. The Buddha and the Upaniṣads (pp. 26-35). [...] "Gautama the Buddha," [...] Radhakrishnan argues, [...] "has {{suffered}} {{as much as}} anyone from critics without a sense of history. He has been cried up, and cried down, with an equal lack of historical imagination." [...] He explains that [...] "To know what the Buddha actually taught or what his earliest followers <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> we must place ourselves in imagination in the India of the sixth century B.C.... Great minds make individual contributions of permanent value to the thought of their age; but they do not, and cannot, altogether transcend the age in which they live.... Even when they are propounding answers which are startlingly new, they use the inadequate ideas and concepts of tradition to express the deeper truths towards which they are feeling their way." [...] He quotes the Buddha as stating that [...] "'there are... four truths of the Brāhmins which have been realized by me... and made known" [...] stating that the Buddha's teaching [...] "is derived" [...] from the Upaniṣads.|$|E

[...] For many years it was assumed that the lead vocal on [...] "B.B. Class Road" [...] was sung by Dawson himself, but Parsons eventually revealed in the early 1990s that it was actually him singing on the track. [...] Parsons went on to elucidate by stating [...] "I wanted Dinky to sing this song but Dinky insisted that I do it. Until now, everyone <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> I tried to sing it with an excess of testosterone in the true spirit of rock 'n roll." [...] Parsons further explained to The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997 [...] "I was imitating and taking on a different persona.
