5|$|Built for {{overseas}} service, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{were assigned}} to <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron in 1909 and 1910, respectively. Both ships had brief careers; shortly before the outbreak of World War I, the ships departed the German colony at Tsingtao. On 1 November 1914, the ships destroyed a British force at the Battle of Coronel and inflicted upon the Royal Navy its first defeat since the Battle of Plattsburgh in 1814. <b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron, including both Scharnhorst-class ships, was subsequently annihilated at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December.|$|E
5|$|Following her {{commissioning}} {{into the}} fleet, Emden {{was assigned to}} <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron. In 1913, Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Karl von Müller became the ship's commander. At the outbreak of war, Emden was the only major German warship in Tsingtao, the main German naval base in Asia. Müller immediately began to operate as a commerce raider, and captured one ship, the Russian steamer Ryazan. Emden was thereafter ordered to rendezvous {{with the rest of}} Spee's cruisers. She remained with <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron for only a few days, as Müller convinced Spee to detach Emden as an independent raider in the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June 1906, Niobe was recommissioned {{for service}} in <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron. She left Wilhelmshaven on 9 July and rendezvoused with the squadron, the {{flagship}} {{of which was}} the armored cruiser , on 8 September. The ship cruised Chinese and Japanese waters for the next three years; her time in <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron was uneventful. On 31 January 1909, Niobe steamed out of the main German port in the region, Tsingtao, and made the return voyage to Germany. She reached Kiel on 21 March, and having become badly worn out during her three years abroad, she was decommissioned ten days later.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{served in}} <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> station with <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{played a major}} role in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay {{concession}} in November 1897, under command of Admiral Otto von Diederichs. The two ships were sent to safeguard German interests in the Philippines after the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. There, Irenes presence caused tensions with the American squadron occupying the islands. Both ships returned to Germany at the turn of the century, and remained in European waters until 1914, when they were removed from active service. They were reduced to secondary roles—Irene was used as a submarine tender and Prinzess Wilhelm was hulked—and continued to serve until the early 1920s, when they were sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In June 1914, {{the annual}} summer cruise of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron began; Gneisenau rendezvoused with Scharnhorst in Nagasaki, Japan, where they {{received}} a full supply of coal. They then sailed south, arriving in Truk in early July where they restocked their coal supplies. While en route, they received news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. On 17 July, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron arrived in Ponape in the Caroline Islands. Here, von Spee {{had access to the}} German radio network, where he learned of the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia and the Russian mobilization. On 31 July, word came that the German ultimatum, which demanded the demobilization of Russia's armies, was set to expire. Von Spee ordered his ships be stripped for war. On 2 August, Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered German mobilization against France and Russia.|$|E

5|$|Kurama {{attended}} the Coronation Fleet Review of King George V in Spithead on 24 June 1911. She was at Yokosuka in August 1914 and {{was assigned to}} the 1st South Seas Squadron to search for <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron. They departed there on 14 September and reached Truk on 11 October as troops carried by the squadron occupied the Carolines. The squadron was based in Suva, Fiji in November in case <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron decided to double back into the Central Pacific. Kurama was flagship of the 2nd Squadron in 1917 and was transferred to the 5th Squadron the following year. Like her sister, she was disarmed in 1922, stricken in 1923 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Diederichs {{requested}} reinforcements from Germany, and the Kaiser authorized {{a second}} Division to deploy to <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> station. The unit was therefore reorganized as <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron; Prinzess Wilhelm {{was assigned to}} the I Division of the Squadron. On 27 November, Diederichs was promoted to Vice Admiral for his success in seizing Kiaochou, and given command of the new Squadron. Chinese forces converged on the port {{by the end of the}} month. Prinzess Wilhelm and Kaiser moved into the harbor to provide artillery support. General Chang, who had been placed under house arrest, was discovered to have been attempting to subvert the German occupation; Dierderichs therefore placed him under arrest aboard Prinzess Wilhelm. A brief skirmish ensued, which quickly resulted in a Chinese rout. On 8 January, a force of 50 men from Prinzess Wilhelms crew was sent to Chi-mo to defend against Chinese raids in the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships of}} the Königsberg class {{served with the}} High Seas Fleet after their commissionings, though Stuttgart also saw service as a gunnery {{training}} ship. Nürnberg and Königsberg were deployed overseas in 1910 and 1914, respectively. Nürnberg was sent to <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron, while Königsberg went to east African waters. Stuttgart and Stettin meanwhile remained in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Triumph {{participated in}} the hunt for <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron and in the {{campaign}} against the German colony at Tsingtao, China until November when she began a refit at Hong Kong. The ship departed on 12 January 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles Campaign. She was torpedoed and sunk off Gaba Tepe by the German submarine U-21 while bombarding Ottoman fortifications in the Dardanelles on 25 May 1915.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Tsingtao, Scharnhorst went into dock for her annual repair; Krosigk accordingly shifted his flag to Gneisenau temporarily. On 10 October, the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing Dynasty broke out, which caused {{a great deal}} of tension amongst the Europeans, who recalled the attacks on foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900–01. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron was placed on alert to protect German interests and additional troops were sent to protect the German consulate. But the feared attacks on Europeans did not materialize and so <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron was not needed. By late November, Scharnhorst was back in service and Krosigk returned to the ship. She cruised to Shanghai by way of Tientsin and Yantai, arriving on 12 December. From 14 to 24 January 1912, Scharnhorst toured the ports of the central China coast and returned to Tsingtao on 9 March, where the rest of the squadron had assembled. On 13 April, the ships went on a month-long cruise to Japanese waters, returning to Tsingtao on 13 May. From 17 July to 4 September, Scharnhorst went on another tour of Japanese ports and during this period she also visited Vladivostok in Russia and several ports in the Yellow Sea.|$|E

The common language used by the delegates during the conference was English.|$|R
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, accompanied by three light cruisers and several colliers, sailed across the Pacific Ocean—in the process evading the various Allied naval forces sent to intercept them—before arriving off the southern coast of South America. On 1 November 1914, Scharnhorst {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron encountered and overpowered a British squadron at the Battle of Coronel. The stinging defeat prompted the British Admiralty to dispatch two battlecruisers to hunt down and destroy von Spee's flotilla, which they accomplished at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914.|$|E
5|$|All six {{ships of}} the class spent the {{majority}} of their careers abroad, primarily in Germany's colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific. Seeadler visited the United States in March 1893, along with the protected cruiser , for the belated celebrations for the 400th anniversary of Columbus's crossing of the Atlantic. In July of that year, while assigned to <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Division, Bussard and Falke assisted in the suppression of Mata'afa Iosefo's revolt in Samoa, along with a British corvette. Throughout the 1890s, Seeadler was assigned to Germany's colonies in East Africa and Southwest Africa, where she suppressed local uprisings.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron {{during the}} Boxer Rebellion, the ship made a {{noteworthy}} contribution in the Battle of the Taku Forts. In June 1900, Hertha, along with Hansa, Gefion, and Irene landed detachments of Seebataillone (marines) {{to seize the}} Taku Forts. The marines joined detachments sent from warships of several other countries. A total of around 450 German troops were contributed to the multi-national force, which totaled around 2,200 officers and men. During {{the attack on the}} forts, Herthas commanding officer was shot and killed. In September, Hertha carried Alfred von Waldersee to Shanghai, arriving on the 21st, where he took command of the international forces suppressing the rebellion.|$|E
50|$|Japan used <b>the</b> name Greater <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> War (Dai Tō-A Sensō), as {{chosen by}} a cabinet {{decision}} on 10 December 1941, {{to refer to}} both the war with the Western Allies and the ongoing war in China. This name was {{released to the public}} on 12 December, with an explanation that it involved Asian nations achieving their independence from the Western powers through armed forces of <b>the</b> Greater <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japanese officials integrated what they called the Japan-China Incident (Nisshi Jihen) into <b>the</b> Greater <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> War.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, Emden won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for {{excellent}} gunnery in <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron. In early December, Emden steamed to Incheon {{to assist}} the grounded German steamer Deike Rickmers. In May 1913, Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Karl von Müller became the ship's commanding officer; he was shortly thereafter promoted to Fregattenkapitän (Commander). In mid-June, Emden went on a cruise to the German colonies in the Central Pacific, after which she was stationed off Nanjing, as fighting between Qing and revolutionary forces raged there. During this period, on 26 August, rebels attacked the ship, and Emdens gunners immediately returned fire, silencing her attackers. Emden moved to Shanghai on 14 August.|$|E
5|$|Between 1891 and 1897, the {{two ships}} were heavily rebuilt as armored cruisers. They were {{significantly}} rearmed {{with a large}} number of medium and smaller caliber guns. Kaiser served in Asian waters from 1897 to 1899, while her sister was on the Asia station from 1898 to 1900. Admiral Otto von Diederichs, then the commander of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Squadron, used Kaiser for his flagship. The ship was involved in the Kiautschou Bay concession seizure in November 1897 and was later deployed to protect German interests in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Bussard served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of her career, first in <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Asia</b> Division in the mid-1890s, and in German East Africa for {{the first decade of the}} 20th century. She had a relatively peaceful career; her only major action came while stationed in Asia in 1894. There, she assisted in suppressing a local revolt in Samoa. In 1910, she returned to Germany, where she remained in service for only two more years; she was stricken in October 1912 and scrapped the following year in Hamburg.|$|E
