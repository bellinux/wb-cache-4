5|$|Despite the {{favorable}} economic development, the military potential of 16th century Poland was modest {{in relation to}} <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> threats coming from several directions, which included the Ottoman Empire, the Teutonic state, the Habsburgs, and Muscovy. Given the declining military value and willingness of pospolite ruszenie, {{the bulk of the}} forces available consisted of professional and mercenary soldiers. Their number and provision depended on szlachta-approved funding (self-imposed taxation and other sources) and tended to be insufficient for any combination of adversaries. The quality of the forces and their command was good, as demonstrated by victories against a seemingly overwhelming enemy. The attainment of strategic objectives was supported by a well-developed service of knowledgeable diplomats and emissaries. Because of the limited resources at the state's disposal, the Jagiellonian Poland had to concentrate on the area most crucial for its security and economic interests, which was the strengthening of Poland's position along the Baltic coast.|$|E

5|$|On 9 July 1386, at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants {{faced each}} other {{for the first time since}} their {{confrontation}} at Argentan several months before. Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court, Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris picking it up signifying his acceptance of the duel. Le Gris also embellished his case by insisting that should he be proven innocent of the offence, he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40,000 livres. Following the declarations a number of high-ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men, including Waleran of Saint-Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois, Count of Eu for Le Gris. After hearing <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> accusations, the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt. If the case could not be decided by normal means, then a judicial duel would be held to adjudicate the dispute, God choosing the victor.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> quests were {{developed}} to keep players occupied while playing through the story. Molyeux told Leach about the ways {{of good and evil}} and the system's reflection of the player's behaviour, and provided him with a digital copy of the Bible with instructions to study the concepts due to their connection with gods and men. Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict between good and evil, and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player. As a method of introducing the player to miracles and combat, a god whose alignment {{is the same as the}} player's was added.|$|E

Spirit Mentors guide gladiators through the arena and Balfus is revealed to have done so for previous dead gladiators before the player.

25|$|An article {{published}} by Vietnam News echoed some of <b>the</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>and</b> opportunities that Vietnam faces {{in preparation for}} the AEC. The article said that the deputy head of the Import-Export Department under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Tran Thanh Hai, was concerned about local enterprises' lack of knowledge of the AEC. It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study the ASEAN market, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge for Vietnam, the article stated, is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.|$|E
