50|$|Canthaxanthin is most {{commonly}} used as a color additive in certain foods. Although the FDA has approved the use of canthaxanthin in food, it does not approve its use as a <b>tanning</b> <b>agent.</b> When used as a color additive, only very small amounts of canthaxanthin are necessary. As a <b>tanning</b> <b>agent,</b> however, much larger quantities are used. After canthaxanthin is consumed, it is deposited throughout the body, including in the layer of fat below the skin, which turns an orange-brown color.

The potential of synthetic <b>tanning</b> <b>agent</b> to provide anionic sites on the polyamide for berberine interaction which is cationic in nature was tested to increase the % exhaustion of berberine in this article. Experiments were designed according to Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD). The three factors for synthetic <b>tanning</b> <b>agent</b> pretreatment and two factors for berberine interaction each at five different levels, including central and axial points were considered. Experiments were conducted in a laboratory scale infra-red treatment instrument according to CCRD. For each response, second order polynomial models were developed using multiple linear regression analysis incorporating linear, interactions and squared effects of all variables and then optimized. The significance of the mathematical model developed was ascertained using Excel regression (solver) analysis module. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to check the adequacy and accuracy of the fitted models. The response surfaces and contour maps showing the interaction of process variables were constructed.
