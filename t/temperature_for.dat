5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface <b>temperature</b> <b>for</b> each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E

5|$|Bulbs are {{harvested}} for {{market in the}} summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further disinfected by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal <b>temperature</b> <b>for</b> initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E
5|$|Metalloids lie {{on either}} side of the {{dividing}} line between metals and nonmetals. This can be found, in varying configurations, on some periodic tables. Elements to the lower left of the line generally display increasing metallic behaviour; elements to the upper right display increasing nonmetallic behaviour. When presented as a regular stairstep, elements with the highest critical <b>temperature</b> <b>for</b> their groups (Li, Be, Al, Ge, Sb, Po) lie just below the line.|$|E

5|$|The {{first years}} of the 14th century were marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual <b>temperature</b> <b>for</b> Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 is a M-class dwarf star, {{meaning that}} it is small, emits reddish light, and has a {{relatively}} low <b>temperature</b> <b>for</b> a star.

Gliese 3634 is 0.020 times as luminous as the Sun, {{meaning that it}} radiates about 2% {{of the amount of}} energy that the Sun does. It was described as an intermediately active star in its discovery paper. Gliese 3634 lies 19.8 parsecs (approximately 64.6 light years) away from Earth, a relatively close star. Gliese 3634 b is the only planet to have been confirmed in the star's orbit, although initial analysis of the data suggests that a secondary body of an unknown nature also exists, with an orbit of more than 200 days and a mass approximately twice that of Neptune's.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world Campylobacter jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room <b>temperature</b> <b>for</b> a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold <b>temperature</b> <b>for</b> snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E
5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is built into the southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys built into the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum <b>temperature</b> <b>for</b> year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E
5|$|The flight muscles {{need to be}} kept at a {{suitable}} <b>temperature</b> <b>for</b> the dragonfly {{to be able to}} fly. Being cold-blooded, they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun. Early in the morning, they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wings outstretched, while {{in the middle of the}} day, a horizontal stance may be chosen. Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The green darner (Anax junius) is known for its long-distance migrations, and often resorts to wing-whirring before dawn to enable it to make an early start.|$|E

5|$|The process {{involves}} procedurally-generated {{basic elements}} like elevation, rainfall, mineral distribution, drainage and <b>temperature.</b> <b>For</b> example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area {{would make a}} swamp. Areas are thus categorized into biomes, which have two variables: savagery and alignment. They have their own specific type {{of plant and animal}} populations. The next phase is erosion—which the drainage simulates. Rivers are created by tracing their paths from the mountains (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an ocean; some form into lakes. The salinity field defines oceans, mangroves or alluvial plains. Names are generated for the biomes and rivers. The names depend on the area's good/evil variable (the alignment) and though in English, they are originally in one of the four in-game languages of dwarves, elves, humans and goblins; these are the four main races in any generated world.|$|E
