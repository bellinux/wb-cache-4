During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes to}} incorporating words from different languages. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.|$|E
5|$|While details {{regarding}} Richard Cantillon's {{life are}} scarce, {{it is thought}} that he was born sometime during the 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue. Sometime {{in the middle of the}} first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.|$|E

40|$|By {{highlighting}} {{the lack of}} rigorous evidence and calling for {{a greater understanding of}} the interaction of the two processes, a recent study [Nelson et al. (1997) ] has called into question the strong perception that poverty is both a consequence as well as a cause of resource degradation. This perception which is widely held is strongly evident in the writings of the multilateral development agencies such as the World Bank (1990) and IFAD (1992) and exists despite extensive reviews which indicate that the short- and long-term implications of land degradation are not very clear [see Scherr and Yadav (1995) ]. Similarly, while knowledge about poverty is expanding rapidly, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>parts</b> to the massive international focus and resources brought to bear on its understanding in the past ten years or so; the existing state of knowledge is still far from providing a comprehensive understanding of all the complex dimensions of its processes. The understanding of the interactions of poverty and land degradation is even less clear and limited. This paper reviews the existing knowledge about the relationship between poverty and land degradation and draws implications for research. ...|$|R

25|$|The next {{attack on}} the English colonists took place at South Deerfield, in August of the same year. Throughout {{the rest of the}} 1675, the Native American forces had a string of victories, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> {{skillful}} leadership of sachems like Metacomet, Muttawmp and Matoonas, who exploited their knowledge of local terrain to achieve surprise and often successfully ambushed colonial forces sent to track them down, much {{in the same way as}} happened in Wheeler's Surprise.

5000|$|Shinn's {{doubts about}} his {{painting}} abilities never left him during his time in France. By {{the end of his}} studies at the Ecole, he had resolved that his would not be the life of a painter, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part,</b> it seems, to his poor eyesight. He wrote to his sister in 1867, [...] "Art I should like, and I have a vocation for it; but I think my near-sightedness, color-blindness and failing vision are pretty strong hints from nature that that career is not intended for me..." [...] Already in summer of 1866, while he was in Pont-Aven, Shinn looked again to writing for newspapers and magazines. He wrote regular pieces about his experiences there for the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin and had two similar pieces published by the fledgling magazine The Nation. In 1869, in the United States again, Shinn wrote a series of articles about his experiences at the École des Beaux-Arts for The Nation, cementing his relationship with the magazine's founding editor, E.L. Godkin. By this time he was living in New York again, where he would principally reside until his death.|$|R

25|$|It was {{revealed}} through these proceedings that Van Zandt's annual {{income in the}} years before his death had climbed to over $100,000, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the royalties accrued from his songs being covered by Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard, Cowboy Junkies, and other major music stars. After Van Zandt's death his road manager, Harold Egger, released video and audio recordings from the songwriter's concerts.

25|$|Jacksonville's mostly {{conservative}} residents, however, {{objected to}} the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat John W. Martin was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern California was emerging as the major movie production center, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the move of film pioneers like William Selig and D.W.

Instead, Jordan distributed the ball with regularity, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> the triangle offense instituted by head coach Phil Jackson and assistant Tex Winter. This gave the Bulls additional offensive weapons to choose from, ranging from wingman Scottie Pippen and post players Horace Grant and Bill Cartwright to shooters such as John Paxson and B. J.

However, {{the past few}} decades have seen an unprecedented resurgence <b>in</b> bluebird numbers <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>part</b> to the placement of bluebird nest boxes by concerned citizens. A study was conducted using geographic information system (GIS) technology to determine the optimal nest box locations for bluebirds in Minnesota by analyzing nest site selection in relation to the distance between nest boxes and elements of the landscape such as roads, buildings, water, trees, and other boxes. Thirty-five years worth of data of roughly 80 nest boxes from an existing study near Pierz, MN were provided by bluebird researchers Dave and Carol Fiedler of Buffalo, MN. Field work included marking the locations of the boxes with a global positioning system (GPS) as well as describing the landscape characteristics surrounding the box. Distances were measured using ortho-rectified aerial photographs with much of the display and analysis done using Arcview 3. 2 and ArcGIS. Each of the bluebird competitors was analyzed separately and then combined to develop buffer distances for ideal bluebird box placement...|$|R

25|$|The {{national}} Republican Party was at {{that time}} going through a period of internal problems over their position on communism, {{and the best way to}} deal with the threatboth internally and externally. Craig brought the national party's problem to the state. Jenner and the party leadership supported faction of the party was virulently anti-communist, but Craig openly sided with Eisenhower and the wing of the party advocating a more measured response to the problem. Jenner was incensed not only by Craig's position on communism, but also on his campaign platform that advocated significant increased state spending and the start of a number of new programs. The difference between Craig and the party continued throughout his time in office. Craig's Democratic opponent was incumbent lieutenant governor John Watkins. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> Eisenhower's popularity, Craig won a landslide victory in the election.|$|E
25|$|As {{coordinator}} of shipbuilding, Robinson {{laid the groundwork}} for the dramatic expansion of the fleet under the two-ocean Navy program. Under Robinson, the time between contract plans and working plans was cut from between 15 and 18 months to less than a year, an efficiency achieved in part by Robinson's decision to freeze the designs of combat ships in each category in order to stop the endless engineering delays incurred by frequent design changes. He mustered legislative support by testifying some 50 times before Congressional committees to explain the Navy's materiel requirements, and mobilized industry resources by exhaustively surveying and reserving the nation's shipbuilding facilities. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> Robinson's careful preparation, when Congress appropriated the funds to expand the fleet by 70% in September 1940, the Navy awarded almost every contract within an hour after President Franklin D.
