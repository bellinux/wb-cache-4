40|$|Defective {{cellular}} <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> aquaporin- 5 (AQP 5) to the apical {{plasma membrane}} (APM) in salivary glands {{is associated with}} the loss of salivary fluid secretion. To examine mechanisms of α 1 -adrenoceptor (AR) -induced <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> AQP 5, immunoconfocal microscopy and Western blot analysis were used to analyze AQP 5 localization in parotid tissues stimulated with phenylephrine under different osmolality. Phenylephrine-induced <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> AQP 5 to the APM and lateral plasma membrane (LPM) was mediated via the α 1 A-AR subtype, but not the α 1 B- and α 1 D-AR subtypes. Phenylephrine-induced <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> AQP 5 was inhibited by ODQ and KT 5823, inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) -stimulated guanylcyclase (GC) and protein kinase (PK) G, respectively, indicating the involvement of the NO/ soluble (c) GC/PKG signaling pathway. Under isotonic conditions, phenylephrine-induced trafficking was inhibited by La 3 +, implying the participation of store-operated Ca 2 + channel. Under hypotonic conditions, phenylephrine-induced <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> AQP 5 to the APM was higher than that under isotonic conditions. Under non-stimulated conditions, hypotonicity-induced <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> AQP 5 to the APM was inhibited by ruthenium red and La 3 +, suggesting the involvement of extracellular Ca 2 + entry. Thus, α 1 A-AR activation induced the <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> AQP 5 to the APM and LPM via the Ca 2 +/ cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) /PKG signaling pathway, which is associated with store-operated Ca 2 + entry...|$|R

5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and <b>traffic</b> <b>of</b> the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E

5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following the enforced retirement of Harry Wainwright, {{who had left}} a range of competent but unspectacular locomotive classes that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train lengths and loadings. Maunsell reviewed the situation and planned to introduce six standard classes – using only two boiler designs – which would work the entire <b>traffic</b> <b>of</b> the railway. The first of these was the Nclass 2-6-0, which gave the SECR a capable mixed-traffic locomotive. For the express passenger design that could cope with the heavy boat trains, Maunsell wanted to enlarge the existing Lclass 4-4-0 with Walschaerts valve gear and an enlarged superheater, but this design would have resulted in a too heavy axle loading. Maunsell's newly recruited assistants, G.H.Pearson and Harold Holcroft from the Great Western Railway at Swindon and James Clayton from the Midland Railway at Derby, had recently been involved in the design of large passenger tank engines and persuaded him to use the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement, which would allow the class to operate at high speeds on the poor-quality track in north Kent.|$|E
5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio <b>traffic</b> <b>of</b> enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E
