50|$|On 9 October 1902 {{the sons}} of John Morton put in a patent (No.21933) for the second Lion machine which could be made as a hand or <b>treadle</b> <b>machine.</b> The lion (sculpted {{to look like the}} work of J. Vasteugh Gyorgy) stands on rocks that are hinged to allow the needle bar, presser foot and shuttle race to be seen whilst the head of the lion is also hinged to allow the user to insert the top reel and alter tension.|$|E
5000|$|Armstrong {{was born}} at Wildmoor, Worcestershire, into a family of Irish ancestry who, after her birth, moved to Bromsgrove and later to Birmingham. In 1962, {{at the age of}} 18, she {{became a member of the}} Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus, a {{teaching}} congregation, in which she remained for seven years. Armstrong claims she suffered physical and psychological abuse in the convent; according to an article in The Guardian newspaper, [...] "Armstrong was required to mortify her flesh with whips and wear a spiked chain around her arm. When she spoke out of turn, she claims she was forced to sew at a <b>treadle</b> <b>machine</b> with no needle for a fortnight." ...|$|E

50|$|On the {{north-east}} {{corner of}} the clock tower square, which is about 100 m south of the temple via the busy bazaar, is the Rathi Family Haveli. On the west wall, a European woman in a smart red frock sews on a <b>treadle</b> <b>machine.</b> The European influence {{is very much in}} evidence here, with painted roses and a Grecian column effect. On the south side of this haveli are ostentatious flourishes and the British crown flanked by unicorns. On the east side is depicted a railway station (a painted sign reads 'A Railway Station', in case you weren't sure!), and some blue eyed British soldiers. There is a busy set of chai (tea) stalls {{on the west side of}} the haveli, and this is a good place to sit and admire these extraordinarily over-the-top paintings.|$|E
50|$|Kimball and Morton {{are most}} {{famous for their}} unusual ‘Lion’ {{machines}} and {{the first of these}} was manufactured in 1868. The design uses a transverse shuttle lockstitch mechanism with the upper mechanism and the needle bar secreted beneath a bronzed cast iron lion. A pair of matching legs could be attached to hide the lower needle bar and presser foot when the machine was not in use. The treadle was equally ornate with depictions of a lion and eagle as well as the motto ‘Strength and Speed’. The Lion sewing machine was the only British-made sewing machine to win a medal at the American Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876. A rare example of both the Lion <b>treadle</b> <b>machine</b> of 1868 and hand crank model of 1902 can be seen at Glasgow Museums Resource Centre.|$|E

40|$|This design {{engineering}} project utilizes the torque provided {{from the rear}} wheel of a bicycle to power three <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machines</b> {{through the use of}} a pulley transmission system. Comprising of a three piece drive shaft made from an aluminum rod, four quick-disconnect pulleys, and a rear drive wheel from a bicycle stand, the pulley transmission allows all three <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machines</b> to be controlled independently of each other by the user through an idler wheel assemblage. The entire assembly is developed to be compact and transportable with structural framing mounted on a towable bicycle wagon. Solidworks, a 3 -D computer aided design program, modeled the true features of the system's components, and their location in the completed assembly allowing any changes to be accurately examined prior to physical construction. This report will review the development and design evolution of this project, and the various engineering choices and analysis made...|$|R

50|$|The dolls {{themselves}} may be sewn by hand or machine. Machine sewing in the Amish {{community is}} generally done {{by using a}} foot-operated <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine.</b> On older Amish dolls, {{it is not uncommon}} to see several layers of cloth on the head or body of one doll. When a doll became too dirty or badly worn, the head as well as its arms and legs would be completely covered with fresh cloth.|$|R
50|$|Up to 1900, {{the best}} violin strings {{were made in}} Europe. Victor Squier started making his own hand-wound violin strings, and the {{business}} grew so quickly {{that he and his}} employees improvised a dramatic production increase by converting a <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine</b> into a string winder capable of producing 1,000 uniformly high-quality strings per day. Squier violin strings, banjo strings and guitar strings became well known nationwide and were especially popular among students because of their reasonable price.|$|R
50|$|In 1797, {{the quality}} of brooms changed when Levi Dickenson, a farmer in Hadley, Massachusetts, made a broom for his wife, using the tassels of sorghum, a grain he was growing for the seeds. His wife spread good words around town, {{creating}} demand for Dickenson's sorghum brooms. The sorghum brooms held up well, but ultimately, like all brooms, fell apart. Dickenson subsequently invented a machine that would make better brooms, and faster than he could. In 1810, the foot <b>treadle</b> broom <b>machine</b> was invented. This machine played an integral part in the Industrial Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|John Rose Battley {{was born}} on 26 November 1880 to Adah Elizabeth Battley (née Maderson), a seamstress, and George Battley, a {{labourer}} who later opened a grocer's shop. His mother died in 1887 (in JRB's words) [...] "due to working as a sempstress at her <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine</b> night after night into {{the early hours of}} the morning in order to help my father, who was a casual labourer, to provide their children with a fair share of bread and dripping for breakfast and tea, and boiled rice for dinner." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1950, {{at the age}} of 14, Nordin went {{hiking in}} the {{mountains}} of Västerbotten and was not pleased with the design of his uncomfortable backpack. After doing some research, he learned that a pack's weight should be positioned high and close to the wearer's spine. Using his mother’s <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine,</b> he made a bag out of strong cotton material. He fastened it to a wooden frame using leather straps. The frame distributed the load better across his back and increased the ventilation between him and the pack. In addition, he could carry a heavier pack.|$|R

50|$|The first {{electric}} {{machines were}} developed by Singer Sewing Co. and introduced in 1889. By {{the end of the}} First World War, Singer was offering hand, <b>treadle</b> and electric <b>machines</b> for sale. At first the electric machines were standard machines with a motor strapped on the side, but as more homes gained power, they became more popular and the motor was gradually introduced into the casing.|$|R
50|$|One type of wheel has {{the wooden}} flyer {{assembly}} mounted horizontally {{on the table}} of a <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine,</b> and is rotated {{by means of the}} foot treadle. The spinner's left hand draws out the wool to her side, and the right hand guides the twisting yarn into the orifice. The second wheel is completely homemade. It also uses a foot treadle, but the spinner faces the spindle orifice instead of the side of the flyer, and feeds the roving in directly. Today most of the spinning machines have been motorized. The First Nations-designed spinner heads were copied by manufacturers in the United States, Canada, and New Zealand due to the renewed popularity of crafts in the 1960s. The specially adapted spinning wheels are now known as Bulky or Indian Head spinners.|$|R

Food preparation and washing equipment may include items such as a grain grinder, a bread mixer, a strainer, a manual can opener, a steam canner with canning jars and O-rings, cutlery, knives, an electric 12-volt cooler icebox, kerosene lamps and heaters, kerosene or propane stoves, extra fuel, a clothes wringer, a foot-operated <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine,</b> and an electric hot plate (which would require an inverter to operate off a car battery).|$|R
5000|$|Several {{people from}} rural Virginia spoke about their clothes made from sacks during the depression. [...] "Back then, feed {{was sold in}} sacks. I believe they held almost 100 pounds of seeds. A number of farmers who didn't sew {{returned}} the sacks for resale... I actually made hair bows, pants and dresses from the sacks." [...] "Mama always sewed on a Singer <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine</b> and made our dresses from flour sacks. She made sure Dad would get two sacks just alike. That was what the pattern took to make the dresses right." [...] "Mama made me pinafores out of flour sacks. Flour sacks were made of cotton with pretty prints."

Three air cylinders and a compressor selection design for shedding; weft insertion and beat-up operations were based on Pascal’s law with load factors including losses considered. Design results recommended selection of a 3 HP compressor and air cylinders operating at a pressure of 5 bar. Likewise the test results revealed that the mechanism could make only 172 weft insertion cycles per minute against 260 cycles design target. In addition, the present design is compact, thus requires smaller space and weaves up to 300 mm width fabric against the existing 175 mm width...|$|R

2500|$|Despite appearances, these {{machines}} were not simply Selectric typewriters with an RS-232 connector added. [...] As with other electric typewriters and electric adding machines of the era, Selectrics are electromechanical, not electronic, devices: The only electrical components are the power cord, power switch, and electric motor. The electric motor runs continuously. [...] The keys are not electrical pushbuttons {{such as those}} found on a computer keyboard. Pressing a key does not produce an electrical signal as output, but rather engages a series of clutches which couple the motor power to the mechanism to turn and tilt the element. A Selectric would work equally well if hand-cranked (or foot-powered, like <b>treadle</b> powered sewing <b>machines)</b> at sufficient speed.|$|R
40|$|The {{cast iron}} process of early {{industrial}} products {{lends itself to}} ornamentation, culminating in designs of the high Victorian period in Britain and its Empire. This paper aims to investigate the geometries employed to create cast iron products, examining samples for industrial and domestic use from the 19 th century, in a case study: a vintage <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine.</b> By reconstructing the working drawings, the use of gothic geometry such as reticulated tracery design is investigated. The suitability of gothic revival or historicizing ornamentation for the construction with lattice or net patterns is also discussed, questioning an apparent division of industrial design history in a functional and a decorative tradition. The case study employs the following methods: photo documentation, tracing of patterns, measuring, reconstruction of the draughting plan {{in preparation for the}} sand casting forms, also, to a lesser extend, contextual research and archival study. This paper will demonstrate how geometric designs such as reticulation - found in the case study - are composed, and these are juxtaposed with gothic window tracery of the English Decorative style by referring to examples in ecclesiastical architectur...|$|R
5000|$|Edith Kierzner {{was born}} May 24, 1911, in Ida Grove, Iowa, forty {{miles east of}} Sioux City, Iowa, to Danish {{immigrants}} Nils and Karoline Kierzner. In 1931, Edith enrolled at the Chicago Normal School, later renamed Chicago Teachers College, and graduated in 1934. She enrolled part-time at the Art Institute of Chicago after graduation taking her first ceramic course. In 1938, Edith married Brian Heath. Relocating to San Francisco, Edith accepted a position as an art teacher at the Presidio Hill School and audited classes at the California School of Fine Arts. She developed a clay body in these classes which she adapted many times for her production work. Not being able {{to have as much}} access to the pottery equipment, Edith pursued her ceramic interests on her own converting a <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine</b> into a pottery wheel. In 1943, she studied eutectics with Willard Kahn through the University of California extension courses. [...] "Form also {{played an important role in}} Edith's work. Beyond her obvious attraction to the science of her craft was her search for useful shapes that appealed to her modern sensibilities. Her pottery was a balance of hand-built and hand-thrown work...The pieces tended towards simplicity, a characteristic that followed Edith and her work throughout her career." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mary McConnel and her daughter, also Mary, wrote memoirs about Cressbrook, {{describing}} the buildings, gardens and generally the {{life on the}} station. Younger Mary's recollection of the Cottage includes, [...] "Through the hand-gate {{in front of the}} entrance porch (of the House) was a small paddock which divided the House from the Cottage; it had swings and a few silky oaks. The Cottage was of brick with a steep shingled roof; two or three gentlemen...were lodged under the efficient charge of a Scottish working-housekeeper". She continues on to describe living on the verandah of the House,Indoor occupation was varied and constant. One says indoor - yet it was carried out for the most part on the wide verandah, shaded from the sun by blinds. These came from Java or Japan; they were made of long strips of cane painted green and rolled up in the evening by cords on small pulleys. On the verandah peaches were stoned for jam, oranges peeled for marmalade and quinces carefully paired and cored for jelly. There was a wide table where the many kerosene lamps were washed and trimmed every morning and set ready to be carried to their respective rooms at night. There was the indispensable <b>treadle</b> sewing <b>machine,</b> and in a cool corner, in a draught, stood a filter with a tap and a tin pannikin, near it a large porous water-jar swathed in damp flannel for evaporation.|$|R
