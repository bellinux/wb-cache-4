5|$|Globalization at {{this time}} was {{hindered}} by war, diseases and population growth in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade {{and the expansion of}} globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Modern Japan's {{economic}} growth {{began in the}} Edo period. Some of the surviving elements of the Edo period are roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. During the Meiji period from 1868, Japan expanded economically with the embrace of <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> Many of today's enterprises were founded at the time, and Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia. The period of overall real {{economic growth}} from the 1960s to the 1980s {{has been called the}} Japanese post-war economic miracle: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E

Curtis was the original author of the 1898 Curtis Act, which dissolved the tribal governments of the five civilized tribes, including the Cherokee, and promoted the allotment of formerly communal tribal lands to individuals, {{with a view to}} encouraging the assimilation of Indians into mainstream US society and <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> (though the bill was heavily amended in committee, to the point where Curtis himself had reservations about the legislation in its final form).

40|$|Using a two-country {{endowment}} economy {{model with}} incomplete asset markets, we obtain closed-form solutions for consumption dynamics and welfare. We demonstrate that welfare of <b>the</b> incomplete <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> {{can be expressed}} as a convex combination of that under <b>the</b> complete <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and autarky. <b>The</b> relative weights of the convex combination depend on the persistence and spillovers of the shocks and on the discount rate. As shocks become less persistent and as agents become more patient, <b>the</b> incomplete <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> approaches <b>the</b> complete <b>market</b> <b>economy,</b> vice versa. We also show that the convex combination property holds in a production economy model with labor by solving the model with the nonlinear certainty equivalence method. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{economy of}} England in the Middle Ages, from the Norman {{invasion}} in 1066, {{to the death}} of HenryVII in 1509, was fundamentally agricultural, though even before the invasion <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> was important to producers. Norman institutions, including serfdom, were superimposed on an existing system of open fields and mature, well-established towns involved in international trade. Over the next five centuries the economy would at first grow and then suffer an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. Despite economic dislocation in urban and extraction economies, including shifts in the holders of wealth and the location of these economies, the economic output of towns and mines developed and intensified over the period. By the end of the period, England had a weak government, by later standards, overseeing an economy dominated by rented farms controlled by gentry, and a thriving community of indigenous English merchants and corporations.|$|E
5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy,</b> therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
25|$|Unger {{finds the}} two major orientations of {{contemporary}} Leftism inadequate and calls for a 'Reconstructive Left' – one which would insist on redirecting the course of globalization by reorganizing <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> In his two books The Left Alternative and , Unger lays out a program to democratize <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and deepen democracy. This Reconstructive Left would look beyond debates on the appropriate size of government, and instead re-envision the relationship between government and firms in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> by experimenting with the coexistence of different regimes of private and social property.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{whether the}} financial crisis has affected citizens’ confidence in <b>the</b> free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and whether it has triggered citizens’ demand for a free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> with stronger state regulations. Using panel data, the paper confirms that citizens’ confidence levels in <b>the</b> free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> have decreased {{in most of the}} largest economies and demand for a free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> with stronger state regulation has increased {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. After analysing the determinants for citizens’ confidence in <b>the</b> free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and demand for a free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> with stronger state regulation before and after {{the financial crisis}}, the author concludes that citizens’ net confidence loss in <b>the</b> free <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> seems to have been driven by rising unemployment rates, and citizens’ demand for stronger state regulation seems to have been driven by the real economic downturn in GDP growth...|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{conditions that}} contributed to creating <b>the</b> coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> in South Korea, and how that affected welfare policy development as industri-alization of South Korea advanced. The study shows that <b>the</b> group-coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> such as <b>the</b> Japanese or the South Korean political economy {{would not have been}} possible without a distinctive role of the state in nurturing <b>the</b> coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> In contrast to <b>the</b> industry-coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> of Europe, <b>the</b> group-coordinated <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> of South Korea had nothing to do with generous welfare state development. A weak union movement and conservative politics based upon the authoritarian state’s alliance with big business did not contribute to welfare state development in South Korea. Instead, the state’s success in establishing a coordi-nated <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> through nurturing big companies and cultivating cooperative labor mobilization encouraged the development of company-based social benefits. While company-based cooperative institutions were placed in companies, various corporate benefit programs and health benefits for industrial workers in larger companies further developed. The state established the institutional frame in which employers rather will-ingly participated in welfare provision for industrial workers. This was accompanied by the lack of state-responsible welfare provision...|$|R

25|$|Unger sees {{two main}} Lefts {{in the world}} today, a {{recalcitrant}} Left and a humanizing Left.

The humanizing (or ‘reformist’) Left accepts the world in its present form, taking <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and globalization as unavoidable, and attempts to humanize their effects through tax-and-transfer policies.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in {{adopting}} the Godesberg Program in 1959, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) largely abandoned Marxism ideas and embraced {{the concept of}} <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy</b> and the welfare state. Instead it now sought to move beyond its old working class base to appeal {{the full spectrum of}} potential voters, including the middle class and professionals.

25|$|In {{a factor}} {{analysis}} of the latest wave of World Values Survey data, Arno Tausch (Corvinus University of Budapest) found that Protestantism emerges to be very close to combining religion and the traditions of liberalism. The Global Value Development Index, calculated by Tausch, relies on the World Values Survey dimensions such as trust in the state of law, no support for shadow economy, postmaterial activism, support for democracy, a non-acceptance of violence, xenophobia and racism, trust in transnational capital and Universities, confidence in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy,</b> supporting gender justice, and engaging in environmental activism, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{rational}} choice approach to religion draws a close analogy {{between religion and}} <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>economy.</b> Religious firms compete against one another to offer religious products and services to consumers, who choose between the firms. To the extent {{that there are many}} religious firms competing against each other, they will tend to specialize and cater to the particular needs of some segments of religious consumers. This specialization and catering in turn increase the number of religious consumers actively engaged in the religious economy. This proposition has been confirmed in a number of empirical studies.|$|E
