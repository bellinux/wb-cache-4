5000|$|The combfish has a long, white {{body with}} a prominent, wide, black stripe from its mouth across its eye along the body {{to the end of}} the <b>tail.</b> The lower <b>margin</b> of the stripe is wavy and comb-like, giving the fish its common name. The portion of the stripe on the tail fin turns yellow during the {{breeding}} season. Also, a thin, red stripe runs along the top of the body from the mouth, along the base of the dorsal fin, for the fin's full length.|$|R
50|$|The silktail is a {{small black}} bird, {{measuring}} around 12 cm and weighing 16 to(-) 21 g. It {{is a small}}, dumpy bird with long rounded wings, and a short rounded tail. The plumage of the male is velvet black with metallic blue iridescent spangling on the crown and breast, and silky white lower-back patch that travels most of the length down the <b>tail.</b> The <b>margin</b> of the <b>tail</b> is black, sometimes this tip has the same iridescence as {{other parts of the}} body. The female is similar to the male, except less glossy, and immature birds are duller than the adults and may have buffy rumps and backs. The irises of this species are dark, and the legs and bill are blackish. The bill is heavy and slightly hooked at the end. The legs are long and the feet strong. The subspecies L. v. kleinschmidti is smaller than the nominate race and has more iridescence plumage than the nominate.|$|R
40|$|The Snake River flows {{across the}} {{dynamically}} uplifting hotspot plume of the Yellowstone region, {{cuts through the}} Snake River Range and ultimately enters the lowlying eastern Snake River Plain. Thermal and mantle-dynamic uplift around Yellowstone has been recorded by short-term geodesy and modeled by geophysicists, but measurements over Quaternary timescales {{and an understanding of}} how that uplift influences regional incision are absent. The Snake River is the only regional river that crosses the uplifting Yellowstone Plateau and flows into the subsiding eastern Snake River Plain (SRP), and provides an opportunity to investigate both ends of the phenomenon on the <b>tailing</b> <b>margin</b> of the Yellowstone region. This thesis consists of two related studies conducted in Alpine Canyon of the Snake River. The first is a study of fluvial terraces and steepness patterns along the Snake River considering the spatial distribution of bedrock or varying hardness and resistance to erosion and in the context of regional tectonics. This study uses surficial mapping, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, bedrock strength measurements, and steepness analyses of the mainstem Snake River and tributary drainages. Results include the first incision rate estimates for the southwestern part of the Yellowstone hotspot region and a discussion of the possible sources of baselevel fall along the Snake River. The second study documents the transitions between bedrock and alluvial channels in the study area and evaluates morphometric and transport capacity thresholds between these reaches. Alluvial bed-cover mapping with a side-scan sonar along with channel morphometric data, clast-counts, and sediment transport estimates allow us to explore what controls these two fundamental channel types. Results confirm that the Snake River has relatively fast incision rates for the interior western U. S. and that the Snake River is adjusting to an actively deforming landscape. Additionally, our dataset provides field documentation of the magnitude of bedrock-alluvial transitions and may be valuable for parameterizing landscape evolution models or assisting in the restoration of reaches that are in disequilibrium due to changes in land use or climate. This study will hopefully inspire future studies of tectonism and landscape evolution of the Yellowstone hotspot region...|$|R
40|$|Interpretation of some {{flight test}} data {{suggests}} {{the presence of}} a 'dynamic ground effect'. The lift of an aircraft approaching the ground depends on the rate of descent and is lower than the aircraft steady state lift at a same height above the ground. Such a lift deficiency under dynamic conditions could have a serious impact on the overall aircraft layout. For example, the increased pitch angle needed to compensate for the temporary loss in lift would reduce the <b>tail</b> strike <b>margin</b> or require an increase in landing gear length. Under HSR 2 an effort is under way to clarify the dynamic ground effect issue using a multi-pronged approach. A dynamic ground effect test has been run in the NASA Langley 14 x 22 ft wind tunnel. Northup-Grumman is conducting time accurate CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) Euler analyses on the National Aerodynamic Simulator facility. Boeing has been using linear potential flow methodology which are thought to provide much needed insight in, physics of this very complex problem. The present report summarizes the results of these potential flow studies...|$|R
40|$|Growth, and {{potential}} marking-related mortality of small European eel Anguilla anguilla (L.) after marking with visible implant elastomer tags (VIE) and coded wire tags (CWT) were investigated over a 6 -month period {{in a laboratory}} experiment. In addition, mark retention after marking was examined for another 16. 5 months. Neither marking method {{had a significant effect}} on growth (P > 0. 05) or mortality (P > 0. 05). After 32 days detection of the VIE marks implanted on the ventral surface and along the base of the ventral <b>tail</b> fin <b>margin</b> was 98 and 100 %, respectively, but decreased to 9 and 66 % after 512 days. Retention of the CWT implanted in the dorsal musculature of A. anguilla was 99 % after 32 days and did not change by day 512. It was therefore concluded that markinginduced mortality was nil for both marking types over the 6 -month period. Generally, both methods are found to be suitable for marking young A. Anguilla. VIE tags, however, should be used for short-time mark-recapture experiments only, and should be injected {{at the base of the}} ventral fin margin. The use of CWTs seems to be the more suitable marking method for long-term mark-recapture experiments. Nevertheless, fieldJRC. DG. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|R
40|$|We build {{a simple}} model of {{leveraged}} asset purchases with margin calls. Investment funds use {{what is perhaps}} the most basic financial strategy, called "value investing," i. e., systematically attempting to buy underpriced assets. When funds do not borrow, the price fluctuations of the asset are approximately normally distributed and uncorrelated across time. This changes when the funds are allowed to leverage, i. e., borrow from a bank, which allows them to purchase more assets than their wealth would otherwise permit. During good times funds that use more leverage have higher profits, increasing their wealth and making them dominant in the market. However, if a downward price fluctuation occurs while one or more funds are fully leveraged, the resulting margin call causes them to sell into an already falling market, amplifying the downward price movement. If the funds hold large positions in the asset this can cause substantial losses. This in turns leads to clustered volatility: Before a crash, when the value funds are dominant, they damp volatility, and after the crash, when they suffer severe losses, volatility is high. This leads to power law tails which are both due to the leverage-induced crashes and due to the clustered volatility induced by the wealth dynamics. This is in contrast to previous explanations of fat tails and clustered volatility, which depended on "irrational behavior," such as trend following. A standard (supposedly more sophisticated) risk control policy in which individual banks base leverage limits on volatility causes leverage to rise during periods of low volatility, and to contract more quickly when volatility gets high, making these extreme fluctuations even worse.

50|$|The South Indian subspecies.Male has upperside ground colour black, glossed {{slightly}} with dull indigo-blue, or, in some specimens, light green {{at the base}} of the wings. Forewings and hindwings with a broad white discal bar from interspace 4 in forewing to just below the apex of the median vein in the hindwing, narrowing on the latter wing to a point. This bar has, on the outer side on both forewings and hindwings, an irregular border of small-blue, which is narrowest anteriorly and broadens posteriorly respectively on both forewings and hindwings. Forewing with, in addition, a white rectangular spot in interspace 5 and a small whitish speck above it. Hindwing with a subterminal row of small white dots, a terminal row of deep ochraceous spots, and some small-blue markings on the <b>tails</b> and <b>margins</b> near the tornal angle. Underside pearly white, broadly brownish pink along the dorsal margin of hindwing. Forewing: two black spots at base of cell; a broad olive-green band edged on both sides with black, followed by a discal bluish-white band, as on the upperside, and continuation of that on the forewing, terminating on vein 1, followed by a broad discal, posteriorly narrowing, white bar as on the upperside. Beyond this a postdiscal series of deep Indian-red lunules, placed on an olive-green ground, and margined on the inner side by an interrupted broad black line; finally, a sub-terminal narrow green band and terminal ochraceous lunules. Tails black touched with small-blue; above tornal angle a black line from vein 1 to dorsum. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black; thorax and abdomen on the sides and beneath whitish.|$|R
50|$|Sauropodomorph size is {{difficult}} to estimate given their usually fragmentary state of preservation. Sauropods are often preserved without their <b>tails,</b> so the <b>margin</b> of error in overall length estimates is high. Mass is calculated using the cube of the length, so for species in which the length is particularly uncertain, the weight is even more so. Estimates that are particularly uncertain (due to very fragmentary or lost material) are preceded by a question mark. Each number represents the highest estimate of a given research paper. One large sauropod, Amphicoelias fragillimus, was based on particularly scant remains that have been lost since their description by paleontologists in 1878. Analysis of the illustrations included in the original report suggested that A. fragillimus {{may have been the}} largest land animal of all time, weighing up to 100 - 150 MT and measuring between 40 - 60 m long. However, later analysis of the surviving evidence, and the biological plausibility of such a large land animal, suggested that the enormous size of this animal was an over-estimate due partly to typographical errors in the original report.|$|R
50|$|The dorsal fins vary in shape, {{with the}} first is {{marginally}} larger than the second. The first dorsal fin originates over the posterior half of the pelvic fins, while the second originates over {{the middle of the}} anal fin. The pectoral fins are fairly large and wide, with rounded tips. The pelvic fins are short and low; adult males have characteristically long, thin claspers measuring roughly 10 - 11% of the total length. The anal fin is relatively small, with its base measuring 8 - 10% of the total length. The caudal fin is long, with a small lower lobe and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, each with a median ridge and three marginal teeth on the crown. An elevated, saw-like crest of enlarged denticles is present along the front half of the dorsal caudal fin edge. This species is a variable shade of gray above, with a dark saddle intersecting the front half of each dorsal fin, and two more saddles along the <b>tail.</b> The leading <b>margins</b> of the pectoral fins are distinctly black, while the trailing margins of the dorsal and anal fins are whitish. The underside is pale and unmarked. The interior lining of the mouth is blackish on the roof and white elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Upperside opaque brown, the {{basal area}} and the {{terminal}} third of both forewings and hindwings of a darker shade than the broad medial area, due to the dark markings of the underside that show through by transparency; forewings and hindwings with a subterminal series of largish yellow lunules that curve upwards posteriorly on the hindwing and end in a diffuse transverse bluish-white mark across interspace 1. Underside, forewing: basal third and a large spot on the discocellulars, that is widened anteriorly, rich dark cinnamon-brown; medial third lilacine, pale towards the dorsum, widened anteriorly and extended into {{the apex of the}} cell, and on the costa from the discocellulars to near the apex of the wing; interspaces 2, 3 and 4 with paler lilacine (lilac-coloured) lunules; terminal third of the wing dull brown, with a postdiscal and a subterminal transverse series of somewhat obscure olivaceous-yellow lunules. Hindwing: basal third rich dark cinnamon brown in continuation of that colour on the forewing; remainder of the wing lilacine, with a large posterior discal patch of cinnamon brown, margined inwardly by a diffuse broad irregular white band, and outwardly by a series of white lunules; a subterminal somewhat obscure row of olivaceous-yellow markings; the <b>tail</b> and terminal <b>margin</b> dark cinnamon brown. Antennae dark brown, head, thorax and abdomen brown with an olivaceous tinge; beneath: similar, the abdomen more brightly olivaceous yellow.|$|R
50|$|Males {{and females}} upperside white. Forewing: cell crossed by three {{comparatively}} broad, oblique black bands, the innermost produced across interspaces 1 and la to the dorsal margin, {{the next to}} vein 1, sometimes a little beyond into interspace 1a, the third to the median vein; these are followed by a triangular costal black spot above the upper apex of the cell; a postdiscal oblique band similar to the others that extends from the costa to just above the tornus, where it joins a broad black terminal edging that lies between {{the apex of the}} wing and the tornus; the costal margin edged with a black thread which widens slightly beyond the postdiscal band. The white ground colour in the anterior half of the cell, beyond the apex of the latter to the postdiscal black band, and in the area between the postdiscal and terminal bands, is hyaline (glass like) with a greenish-yellow tinge. Hindwing: a spot at the tornal angle, the anal lobe, <b>tail</b> and terminal <b>margin</b> black; above the tornal spot is a short, comparatively broad, red band edged anteriorly by a fine black line that joins the spot to the black on the anal lobe; superposed on the black of the terminal margin there are some obscure white scalings; a triangular transverse subterminal white spot in interspace 3 and occasionally a sub-terminal short white line in interspace 4; also the anterior edge of the tail at base is touched with white. Seen by transparency from the underside are two convergent transverse black bands, the outer one of which is traversed by short transverse lines of red in interspaces 2, 6, 7 and 8. Underside similar; hindwing with the addition of the two black bands mentioned above, which coalesce above the tornal area. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the head marked with red, the thorax on the sides with greyish pubescence; abdomen with lateral white stripes; beneath, white.|$|R
