5|$|According {{to modern}} genealogies {{the father of}} Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was {{a son of a}} {{previous}} ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship in opposition to the lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Another possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and <b>therefore,</b> <b>in</b> all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.|$|E

5|$|Although loaned {{to friends}} and family, and <b>therefore</b> <b>in</b> slight public circulation, Coke's Reports were never {{formally}} used during his lifetime. Select cases were published in 1600, containing {{the most famous of}} his decisions and pleadings, while a second volume in 1602 was more chronological in nature. The third part, published in the same year, was also chronological, while the fourth, published in 1604, was arranged by subject. The fifth part, published in 1605, is arranged similarly, as is the sixth, published in 1607. Five more volumes were published until 1615, but Coke died before he could publish a single bound copy. No trace has been found of the draft manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no Garden of Eden, a configuration with no predecessors. It {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not injective (it has sets of more than one configuration with the same successor), showing that the converse of the Garden of Eden theorem is not true.|$|E
5|$|In the 13th century, Newcastle upon Tyne had a {{population}} of around 4,000; and {{it was difficult for}} the four parish churches to care for the needs of such a large population. The priests were expected to be educators, doctors and counsellors, as well as meeting the spiritual needs of their parishioners. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>in</b> 1291 land was donated by William Baron of Wark on Tweed to found an Augustinian friary on the land on which the museum now stands.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to envelop the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result {{in the loss of}} all or part of his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he needed to take Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was <b>therefore</b> <b>in</b> Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the cup final, Napoli were {{in third}} place in Serie A and <b>therefore</b> <b>in</b> the last {{position}} {{to qualify for the}} Champions League, eight points ahead of Fiorentina with nine points left to play for. Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella said before the game that his priority was to finish fourth and win the Coppa Italia. His Napoli counterpart, Rafael Benítez, warned his players not to expect to win solely based on their league position.|$|E
5|$|River {{traffic and}} {{railroad}} traffic were increasingly {{in competition with}} each other. In October 1879 a disaster was narrowly avoided when a seven-coach passenger train with 800 people on board approached the open swing bridge too fast and was barely able to stop in time, ending up with its front wheels hanging off the approach road over the river. Meanwhile, boats on the river were getting larger and finding {{it increasingly difficult to}} navigate the bridges {{at the mouth of the}} north branch, so the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the clearing of three swing bridges near Kinzie Street that were obstructing river traffic. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>in</b> 1907 construction started on a new bascule bridge that would allow more space for boats to pass by on the river.|$|E

5|$|So Artavasdes I had {{maintained}} his ground against the Romans but his domain had been severely ravaged. Besides his stronger ally Phraates IV treated him condescending {{and gave him}} only little booty and was near depriving him of his dominion. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>in</b> 35 BC Artavasdes I offered Antony an alliance against Parthia, and Antony gladly accepted. To deepen this friendship Alexander Helios, the son of Antony and Cleopatra VII, was betrothed to Artavasdes I’s daughter Iotapa, although both were infants in 34 BC.|$|E
5|$|Stanier, the {{designer}} of the locomotives, felt that the added weight and difficulty in maintenance due to the streamlining was too high {{a price to pay}} for the actual benefits gained at high speed. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>in</b> 1938 a third batch of five locomotives (again named after Duchesses) was built, Nos. 6230–6234, without streamlining at an average cost of £10,659 each.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 {{expression}} {{has been}} shown to be downregulated by embryonic exposure to cocaine. Prenatal cocaine exposure in a mouse model caused a decrease in both GABA neuron migration from the basal to the dorsal forebrain and radial neuron migration in the dorsal forebrain. This exposure also decreased TBR1 and TBR2 expression. However, further research showed that cocaine exposure only delayed TBR1 expression and did not cause permanent downregulation. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>in</b> models of prenatal cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor cells is delayed.|$|E

5|$|The Colombian {{tariff system}} {{is defined in}} the Ley de Servicios Públicos or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies. The tariff system aims at {{reconciling}} the achievement of cost recovery with {{the protection of the}} poor. The basic tariff is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). <b>Therefore,</b> <b>in</b> principle, tariffs in different municipalities do not differ due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or not, but only because of the different costs of the services.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>in</b> the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E

Egham Hythe, Surrey also had postal addresses of Staines, Middlesex. Conversely, Hampton Wick was conveniently placed in Kingston, Surrey with its sorting offices just across the river. Nearby Hampton Court Palace has a postal address of East Molesey, therefore associating it with Surrey.|$|E

The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and <b>therefore,</b> <b>in</b> their opinion, unsafe.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 41,169 at Anfield, Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the first leg when Kevin Keegan scored in the 21st minute. Another goal by Keegan in the first half, {{extended}} Liverpool's lead and a further goal by Larry Lloyd meant Liverpool won the first leg 3–0. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>in</b> the second leg at the Bökelbergstadion, Liverpool had to avoid losing by three clear goals to win the competition. A crowd of 34,905 watched Borussia take the lead in the 29th minute courtesy of a Jupp Heynckes goal, he scored again 11 minutes later to double Borussia's lead. Borussia were unable to find the third goal they needed to take the match into extra-time and won the second leg 2–0. Thus, Liverpool won the final 3–2 on aggregate to win their first European trophy.|$|E
