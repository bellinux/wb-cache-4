40|$|The {{results of}} a study to {{investigate}} concepts for minimizing trim drag of horizontal takeoff single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles are presented. A generic hypersonic airbreathing conical configuration {{was used as the}} subject aircraft. The investigation indicates that extreme forward migration of the aerodynamic center as the vehicle accelerates to orbital velocities causes severe aerodynamic instability and <b>trim</b> <b>moments</b> that must be counteracted. Adequate stability can be provided by active control of elevons and rudder, but use of elevons to produce <b>trim</b> <b>moments</b> results in excessive trim drag and fuel consumption. To alleviate this problem, two solution concepts are examined. Active control of the center of gravity (COG) location to track the aerodynamic center decreases <b>trim</b> <b>moment</b> requirements, reduces elevon deflections, and leads to significant fuel savings. Active control of the direction of the thrust vector produces required <b>trim</b> <b>moments,</b> reduces elevon deflections, and also results in significant fuel savings. It is concluded that the combination of active flight control to provide stabilization, (COG) position control to minimize <b>trim</b> <b>moment</b> requirements, and thrust vectoring to generate required <b>trim</b> <b>moments</b> has the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption during ascent to orbit of horizontal takeoff SSTO vehicles...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the aerodynamic characteristics of a large-scale subsonic jet transport model with an externally jet-augmented flap system that would augment lift and provide direct-lift control. The model had a 35 deg swept wing of aspect ratio 7. 82 and two side-by-side engines mounted on a single pylon under each wing close to the fuselage. The lift of the flap system was augmented by jet engine exhaust impingement on the triple-slotted flap surfaces. The rearmost flap provided direct lift control. Results were obtained for several combinations of flap deflections at gross thrust coefficients from 0 to 2. 0. Three-component longitudinal data are presented with four engines operating. Limited longitudinal and lateral data are presented for asymmetric and symmetric thrust conditions with three engines operating. For the same overall flap deflection, lift coefficient and maximum lift coefficient were improved 13 and 7 percent compared to coefficients obtained with a double-slotted flap configuration. A maximum lift coefficient of 6. 3 was obtained at a gross thrust coefficient of 2. 0.

40|$|The {{strategic}} {{requirement for}} naval submarines {{to operate in}} near surface and littoral environments continues to increase as they are more frequently employed to support joint force missions. The operational workload for helmsmen and the risk to mission safety and success are significantly increased due to {{the interaction between the}} submarine and the free-surface. This thesis reports on an experimental investigation into the effects of submergence depth, speed of advance and length-to-diameter ratio on the interaction between a streamlined axisymmetric body and the free-surface when travelling in a near-surface condition. A broad review of the existing literature indicates that little work has been published to date on the effects of length-to-diameter on the near-surface performance of streamlined axisymmetric bodies. Furthermore, {{there is little or no}} experimental data available describing the vertical force and moment that act on a shallowly submerged body moving beneath the free-surface. Nonetheless, there is evidence to confirm that the requirement for submarine near-surface operation is significant and that a wellfounded understanding of submarine near-surface performance is needed. A model scale experimental program was conducted to measure and observe the resistance, lift force, <b>trimming</b> <b>moment</b> and wave field generated by a series of submerged bodies of revolution moving at constant forward speed. The Joubert conventional submarine geometry was tested in its bare hull configuration in three length-to-diameter ratio formats: 7. 30, 8. 50 and 9. 50. The three geometries possess the same maximum diameter. The models were tested at velocities that correspond to a Froude number range of 0. 10 to 0. 50 inclusive and at centreline submergence depths of between 1 and 3. 5 hull diameters. The results of the experiment indicate that the wave resistance, lift force and <b>trimming</b> <b>moment</b> all vary periodically with speed and are directly influenced by the wavelength of the free-surface wave field generated by the submerged body. The steady-state wave field itself is a direct function of the submerged body’s length-to-diameter ratio and speed of advance (Froude number). The magnitude of the forces and <b>trimming</b> <b>moment</b> were found to diminish exponentially with an increase in submergence depth. Considering the submergence depths and speeds experienced by naval submarines when conducting near-surface operations, it is concluded that the effect of wave resistance is a secondary issue and that the vertical lift force is of the greatest operational significance. Based on the test results of the three Joubert hull geometries, it was observed that for near-surface operation a larger length-to-diameter ratio is preferable for achieving minimum resistance and vertical plane motion (lower relative lift force and <b>trimming</b> <b>moment).</b> An evaluation of the SHIPFLOW 4. 7 potential flow software program was completed using the experimentally measured data in conjunction with additional published experimental and numerical wave resistance data. Good correlation was observed for the predictions of lift force and <b>trimming</b> <b>moment.</b> Mixed results were achieved when comparing the numerically predicted and experimentally measured wave resistance. Nonetheless, it is concluded that the potential flow method offers an inexpensive and suitable approach to evaluating the near-surface performance of submarine type geometries...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of “porpoising” of flying-boats {{has been the}} subject of investigation both abroad and in the United States. In Germany and England recourse has been had to the use of dynamically similar models, duplicating in the model as closely as possible all the features of the full scale flying-boat. In the towing tanks of the United States, usually a bare hull is tested, where measurements are made of resistance, load, <b>trimming</b> <b>moment,</b> and trim angle at various speeds. The results are usually furnished in the form of curves of <b>trimming</b> <b>moment</b> and draft against speed at various loadings and trim angles. Conclusions regarding “porpoising” of the full scale flying-boat cannot be drawn from the behavior of the hull alone, but it is considered possible to evaluate certain hydrodynamic stability derivatives, which, in conjunction with aerodynamic derivatives obtained from wind-tunnel tests, may be used in the stability equation to determine the behavior of the flying-boat in the planning condition. In the following discussion the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic derivatives are deduced. The aerodynamic derivatives are similar to those normally used for airplanes, but they are evaluated in terms of beam, trim angle, and other hydrodynamic terms; then the hydrodynamic derivatives are deduced, also in terms of hull dimensions and attitudes. This permits direct addition of the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic derivatives for use in the longitudinal stability equation. The criteria of stability then are applied. In addition, a factorization of the stability quartic, formulated by Dr. Millikan, is applied to determine periods of the oscillations, as well as damping factors. An example following the procedure above outlined and devised by Dr. Millikan is presented, using tank test data of a model 36 hull for hydrodynamic quantities. The aerodynamic quantities are based on an average of many modern flying-boats. The model 36 hull is selected as being fairly representative of present day flying boats. ...|$|E

The results of the tests made in Langley tank no. 1 include values of the horizontal forces, <b>trimming</b> <b>moment,</b> and static pressure in the tunnel for a wide range of loads and speeds and two power conditions, and are presented in the form of curves against speed with load as a parameter.

In general, the ratio of the gross load to the total resistance increases with increase in load and decrease in speed. This ratio varies between l- 7 and 5. 7 at high speeds and has a maximum value of 7. The total resistance is nearly the same for both power conditions except at low speeds and heavy loads. No abrupt change in forces on the hull or flow around the hull occurs in. the region of zero draft. The centers of pressure are generally far aft.

40|$|Performance {{prediction}} {{is an important}} part of vessel design. Common methods for predicting planing hull performance include the use of empirical equations and model testing. Empirical equations are often only applicable to similar hull types over a small range of parameters, while model testing is often prohibitively expensive, particularly for small craft. Ever increasing computer power is making the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a performance prediction tool a practical alternative. This work presents the results of a study involving CFD to evaluate the performance of a high-speed planing vessel moving at steady speed through calm water. [...] After a review of the state-of-the-art in CFD methods, it was decided that an unstructured, multiphase, finite volume code employing the volume-of-fluid (VOF) method for free surface capturing would be best suited for the study. The use of a commercial CFD code was found to be the best alternative as they are publicly available, generally undergo extensive validation, have a wide user-base, and receive periodic upgrades and improvements. The code chosen was Fluent (v 5. 3). [...] Fluent could not, however, be used directly to simulate the behaviour of a planing vessel. The performance of high-speed craft is intimately linked to the orientation of the hull at speed, which cannot be known a priori. Planing hulls rise and change trim angle in response to the pressure field generated by the flow. In order to solve for these changes in hull position, the simulation method had to ensure that dynamic equilibrium was achieved in terms of lift and <b>trimming</b> <b>moment.</b> This was accomplished with an iterative scheme wherein the flow field was solved for discrete hull orientations that were then adjusted based on force and moment results until the conditions of equilibrium were met. [...] The work began with a set of physical model experiments used to provide the baseline from which the numerical results would be evaluated. Three sets of simulations were then performed to evaluate the prediction method. The first set fixed the hull orientation to match those measured in the physical experiments. This enabled a direct comparison of the numerical results to the physical results. A second set of simulations was then performed where only the equilibrium condition of lift was satisfied; trim angles remained fixed at the experimental values. The last set of simulations solved for equilibrium in both lift and <b>trimming</b> <b>moment</b> and represent the results of predictions that would be produced without the benefit of physical experiments. [...] It was found that the CFD simulations produced high hull pressure forces compared with the experimental results. In the first set of simulations, this meant high drag forces. When the model was permitted to move vertically (with a fixed trim angle) in the second set of simulations, the numerical model lifted higher in the water. This reduced the pressure drag results, but decreased the wetted area and hence the frictional drag. During the last set of simulations, which permitted the model to trim and heave to achieve dynamic equilibrium, trim angle and sinkage were found to decrease relative to the previous simulation set. As a result, pressure drag was found to decrease, but frictional drag predictions improved. Values for total resistance were found to be low when compared with experimental results. The under predicted resistance results from the second and third set of simulations were a direct consequence of the over predicted hull pressures identified during the first set of simulations. Despite these high pressure values, the results of the predictions still followed experimental trends, and the procedure for solving dynamic equilibrium was successful...|$|E

5000|$|Taking moments {{about the}} center of gravity, the net nose-up moment is:where [...] is the {{location}} of {{the center of}} gravity behind the aerodynamic center of the main wing, [...] is the tail <b>moment</b> arm.For <b>trim,</b> this <b>moment</b> must be zero. For a given maximum elevator deflection, there is a corresponding limit on center of gravity position at which the aircraft can be kept in equilibrium. When limited by control deflection this is known as a 'trim limit'. In principle trim limits could determine the permissible forwards and rearwards shift of the centre of gravity, but usually it is only the forward cg limit which is determined by the available control, the aft limit is usually dictated by stability.|$|R
40|$|The present work applies a {{recently}} developed method 1 to compute, {{by means of}} coupled CFD/CSD simulations, the shaft angle corrections for closed section wind tunnel tests on trimmed isolated rotor configurations. A complete simulation of the rotor flow field in free-flight is performed, and the power coefficient C P is extracted. Then a set of simulations of the same rotor at the same trim state is performed in the closed section of Politecnico di Milano large wind tunnel at different shaft angles. The power coefficient is extracted from each simulation in order to evaluate the shaft angle which matches the C P value obtained in free-flight. The computations are performed using a trimmed actuator disc model with non uniform source distribution, coupling the CFD code ROSITA with the CSD code MBDyn. The methodology is applied spanning the available tunnel velocity range. Two different rotor trim conditions are evaluated: zero flapping angle <b>trim</b> and shaft, <b>moment</b> <b>trim.</b> The achieved corrections for the two trimming options are compared and discussed...|$|R
