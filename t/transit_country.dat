By 2007, oil production was declining but natural gas production was rising quickly. With the lifting of sanctions against Libya, there is growing outside investment in Libyan oil and gas resources. Major players include the Italian firms Eni and Enel, and the Russian giant Gasprom, which revealed in 2008 that it was planning large investments in Egypt and Libya in cooperation with Eni. This caused concern in Europe, which sees the North African supplies {{as an alternative to}} dependency on Russia for natural gas.|$|E

Second, we develop a dynamic model of strategic investment. We find that the failure to include Belarus and Ukraine into a framework for international contract enforcement resulted in underinvestment in cheap pipelines and overinvestment in expensive ones. As capacities are increased to gain leverage over <b>transit</b> <b>countries,</b> customers in Western Europe benefit in terms of lower prices and higher supply security...|$|R
25|$|The end of {{communism}} and {{collapse of the}} Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has contributed {{to an increase in}} human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution. Russia is a country of origin for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Russia is also a destination and <b>transit</b> <b>country</b> for persons trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation from regional and neighbouring countries into Russia and beyond. Russia accounted for one-quarter of the 1,235 identified victims reported in 2003 trafficked to Germany. The Russian government has shown some commitment to combat trafficking but has been criticised for failing to develop effective measures in law enforcement and victim protection.|$|E
25|$|Greece, {{together}} with Italy and Spain, {{is a major}} entry point for illegal immigrants trying to enter the EU. Illegal immigrants entering Greece mostly do so from the border with Turkey at the Evros River and the islands of the eastern Aegean across from Turkey (mainly Lesbos, Chios, Kos, and Samos). In 2012, the majority of illegal immigrants entering Greece came from Afghanistan, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. In 2015, arrivals of refugees by sea had increased dramatically mainly due to the ongoing Syrian civil war. There were 856,723 arrivals by sea in Greece, an almost fivefold increase to {{the same period of}} 2014, of which the Syrians represent almost 45%. The majority of refugees and migrants use Greece as a <b>transit</b> <b>country,</b> while their intended destinations are northern European Nations such as Austria, Germany and Sweden.|$|E
25|$|On January 18 {{the dispute}} was {{resolved}} when Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Yulia Tymoshenko negotiated {{a new contract}} that covered {{the next ten years}} (on October 11, 2011, a Ukrainian court sentenced Tymoshenko to seven years in prison for abuse of office because she signed this deal). Gas flows to Europe restarted on the morning of January 20, and were fully restored within two days. In the aftermath, Gazprom was estimated to have lost US$1.5billion in revenues due to lack of sales, and Ukraine was speculated to have incurred major economic losses. Analysts point out that the crisis had a negative and possibly irreversible impact on the reputations of both Russia as an energy supplier, and Ukraine as a <b>transit</b> <b>country.</b> There is no consensus amongst analysts on who bore the most responsibility for the crisis. Due to the absence of international monitors {{on both sides of the}} Ukrainian pipeline system, it is impossible to determine with certainty who was responsible for interrupting gas flow to Europe.|$|E

[...] Haiti has more human trafficking than any other Central or South American country. [...] According to the United States Department of State 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report, [...] "Haiti is a major source, passage, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex slavery." [...] Haitians are trafficked out of Haiti and into the neighboring Dominican Republic, as well as to other countries such as Ecuador, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, and North American countries as well. Haiti is also a <b>transit</b> <b>country</b> for victims of trafficking en route to the United States. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, human trafficking has drastically increased.

500|$|The 2010 TIP {{report also}} {{condemned}} Canada's {{lack of a}} national action plan, and said that Canada is a destination, source, and <b>transit</b> <b>country</b> for forced prostitution, unfree labour, the prostitution of children, {{and other forms of}} human trafficking. The report said that the federal and provincial governments of Canada were not cooperating sufficiently with respect to policing these crimes, and that a strategy for cooperation should be formulated in a national action plan. York Regional Police vice unit Detective Thai Truong agreed with the report's assessment, and said that [...] "a unified understanding and approach" [...] to human trafficking [...] "does not even exist at the municipal level of policing" [...] in Canada. Also in 2010, retired Toronto Police Service officer Dave Perry said that Canada's lack of a national action plan had resulted in the country failing to adequately deal with North Preston's Finest, a gang that engages in sex trafficking between Nova Scotia and Toronto. Perry had led a police taskforce against the gang in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said that without a national action plan, politicians lost interest in the endeavour and funding ran out. Perry stated that a plan would need to be well-funded because traffickers in Canada are making [...] "big, big money...and {{the only way you can}} combat that is with a pretty healthy budget." ...|$|E

It also requested that both parties accept independent monitoring {{of the flow of}} gas in the pipelines. [...] Later in the day officials from Gazprom and Naftogaz met with EU officials in Brussels to look {{for an end to the}} crisis.

Turkish border patrol officers are reported to have deliberately overlooked those entering Syria, upon payment of a small bribe.

Analysts pointed out that the crisis and the way it was handled had a negative and possibly irreversible impact on the reputations of both Russia as an energy supplier, and Ukraine as a <b>transit</b> <b>country.</b> According to the Czech foreign minister, [...] "The main lesson learned from this crisis is that Russia and Ukraine aren’t reliable suppliers.
