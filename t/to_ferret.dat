5|$|British {{secret service}} agent James Bond appears at the door asking for a room, having had a flat tyre while passing. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Pressuring the two men, he {{eventually}} gets the gangsters to agree to provide him a room. Bond tells Michel {{that he is in}} America in the wake of Operation Thunderball and was detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West and who now lives in Toronto, as part of his quest <b>to</b> <b>ferret</b> out SPECTRE. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Michel. A gun battle ensues and, during their escape, Horror and Sluggsy's car crashes into a lake. Bond and Michel retire to bed, but Sluggsy is still alive and makes a further attempt to kill them, before Bond shoots him.|$|E
5|$|While Allen's {{service as}} a judge in Vermont was brief, he {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>ferret</b> out Tories and report them to local Boards of Confiscation for action. He was so zealous in these efforts that they also included naming his own brother Levi, who was apparently trying to swindle Allen and Ira out of land at the time. This action was somewhat surprising, as Levi had not only attempted to purchase Allen's release {{while he was in}} Halifax, but he had also traveled to New York while Allen was on parole there, and furnished him with goods and money. Allen and Levi engaged in a war of words, many of which were printed in the Connecticut Courant, even after Levi crossed British lines. They would eventually reconcile in 1783.|$|E

Buenaventura was repeatedly attacked by irate congressmen, who accused the BSP of attempting to amass power that would allow it to poke into the private accounts of individuals it considered suspicious.

Stopford was briefly Captain (acting), of , but returned <b>to</b> <b>Ferret</b> when the Admiralty would not confirm the appointment. During the Nootka Crisis, a dispute with Spain over Nootka Sound, Ferret was stationed off Cadiz to reconnoitre the Spanish fleet there.

25|$|For {{successful}} operations, surprise must {{be achieved}} by the guerrillas. If the operation has been betrayed or compromised it is usually called off immediately. Intelligence is also extremely important, and detailed knowledge of the target's dispositions, weaponry and morale is gathered before any attack. Intelligence can be harvested in several ways. Collaborators and sympathizers will usually provide {{a steady flow of}} useful information. If working clandestinely, the guerrilla operative may disguise his membership in the insurgent operation, and use deception <b>to</b> <b>ferret</b> out needed data. Employment or enrollment as a student may be undertaken near the target zone, community organizations may be infiltrated, and even romantic relationships struck up as part of intelligence gathering.|$|E

There is no news on whether they intend to re-sign <b>to</b> <b>Ferret</b> or seek a new label.

With the ring on, Gawain finally goes off on the journey to rid the world of Morgana, who has hidden in a forbidding fortress on the island of Lyonesse. On the way there, Morgana shows up to kill Gawain's companion, her former servant named Helie. Once in Morgana's castle, Gawain gets captured and is sentenced to death, but manages to escape after defeating a giant snake. He then works to overcome Morgana and slay her vampire bodyguard Ragnar. Ultimately, Gawain is unable to end Morgana's life, but the witch's own Faerie minions help him imprison her inside Lyonesse. She swears vengeance while he returns to Camelot as a hero to join the Order of the Round Table.|$|E
50|$|Influenza, {{essentially}} the same disease and same agent that occur in humans, is caused by an othomyxovirus that can be passed from <b>ferrets</b> <b>to</b> humans and from humans <b>to</b> <b>ferrets.</b> Ferrets have served as experimental animal models {{in the study of}} influenza virus. Smith, Andrews, Laidlaw (1933) inoculated ferrets intra-nasally with human naso-pharyngeal washes, which produced a form of influenza that spread to other cage mates. The human influenza virus (Influenza type A) was transmitted from an infected <b>ferret</b> <b>to</b> a junior investigator, from whom it was subsequently re-isolated. The virus usually affects the nasal epithelium but can cause pneumonia. Signs include anorexia, fever, sneezing, nasal and ocular discharges and usually spontaneous recovery in 4 days or less. Antibiotic use can prevent complicating secondary bacterial infections.|$|R

25|$|Although authors give many {{examples}} of male witchery {{in the second part}} of the handbook, those witchcraft trials that are independently confirmed and that were led by Kramer himself are related to persecution of women almost exclusively. They took place in Ravensburg near Constance (1484) and Innsbruck (since 1485). According to Brauner, trial records confirm that Kramer believed that women are by nature corrupt and evil. His position was in harmony with the scholastic theory at the time. In contrast, Sprenger never conducted a witch trial though he was consulted in a few cases. Kramer and Sprenger use a metaphor of a world turned upside down by women of which concubines are the most wicked, followed by midwives and then by wives who dominate their husbands. Authors warn of imminent arrival of the apocalypse foretold in the Bible and that men risk bewitchment that leads to impotence and sensation of castration. Brauner explains authors' prescription on how a woman can avoid becoming a witch: According to the Malleus, the only way a woman can avoid succumbing to her passions – and becoming a witch – is to embrace a life of devout chastity in a religious retreat. But the monastic life is reserved to the spiritually gifted few. Therefore, most women are doomed to become witches, who cannot be redeemed; and the only recourse open to the authorities is <b>to</b> <b>ferret</b> out and exterminate all witches.|$|E

40|$|The {{control and}} {{eventual}} eradication of bovine tuberculosis (TB) poses major challenges in New Zealand, given {{the variety of}} wildlife species susceptible to TB, {{many of which are}} capable of onwards transmission of Mycobacterium bovis infection. Here we discuss the role of feral ferrets (Mustela furo), focussing on potential transmission or risk pathways that have implications for management of TB. Firstly inter-specific transmission <b>to</b> <b>ferrets.</b> Ferrets scavenge potentially infected wildlife, including other ferrets, thus prevalence of TB can be amplified through ferrets feeding on tuberculous carcasses, particularly brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Secondly intra-specific transmission between ferrets. The rate of ferret-ferret transmission depends on population density, and in some places ferret densities exceed the estimated threshold for disease persistence. TB can therefor...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} a stress response, two groups of twenty male golden hamsters were either exposed <b>to</b> a <b>ferret</b> or handled by a human. The hamsters' body temperature and running wheel activity were measured as stress correlates. Half of the hamsters' cages were equipped with a functional running wheel {{to determine whether the}} presence of a running wheel might reduce stress. Exposure <b>to</b> the <b>ferret</b> was followed by a significant increase in body temperature and running wheel revolutions: however, running wheel activity did not change after handling. Body temperature increased less after handling in hamsters living in a cage with a functional running wheel than in those with a non-revolving running wheel. This suggests that hamsters with a functional running wheel reacted less strongly to acute stress caused by handling. On the other hand, temperature increase after the exposure <b>to</b> a <b>ferret</b> was not affected by the presence of a running wheel. Both exposure <b>to</b> a <b>ferret</b> and handling caused stress in golden hamsters, as demonstrated by an increase in body temperature (emotional fever). Stress caused by handling was much milder than stress caused by the ferret. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
