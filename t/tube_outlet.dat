40|$|The {{preferred}} {{cooling process}} for household refrigeration appliances is a vapor compression refrigeration process with a capillary tube as expansion device. The vapor compression refrigeration system requires a phase {{change of the}} refrigerant inside the condenser and evaporator. Through a direct connection of condenser outlet and capillary tube inlet, which is commonly practiced for household refrigeration cycles, the condenser outlet defines directly the refrigerant state at the capillary tube inlet. Due to unsteady operation conditions the refrigerant state can change from subcooled liquid to saturated liquid with partially a vapor phase at the capillary tube inlet. The refrigerant flow inside the capillary tube is either adiabatic or non-adiabatic (by utilizing internal heat exchange). In both cases the refrigerants state changes during the expansion with an increase of vapor quality towards the capillary <b>tube</b> <b>outlet.</b> A variable vapor quality at the capillary tube inlet causes different flow patterns, especially at the capillary <b>tube</b> <b>outlet.</b> These flow patterns change periodically depending on the refrigerant state at the capillary tube inlet. Associated with the periodical changing flow patterns the occurrence of noise effects with the same periodicity and remarkable variations of the sound pressure level can be observed at the capillary <b>tube</b> <b>outlet.</b> Â This paper presents the experimental investigations on the simultaneous occurrence of refrigerant flow patterns and corresponding noise effects at the outlet of a capillary tube installed in a refrigeration test cycle. The discussion of the experimental results leads to an explanation of causal relation between distinguishable flow patterns and corresponding noise effects...|$|E

30|$|Under {{stationary}} conditions, {{the model}} with groundwater flow as advective heat transport is dominant (soil temperature is 10  °C) {{and is on}} average warmer than the one without flow. From the results in Fig.  4, groundwater flow appears to only minutely change the temperature at the inner ring sensors labeled 1 – 8 (see Figs.  1 and 3). However, the inner ring is essential for determining the sensor’s position relative to the BHE tubes. As the double U-tube heat exchanger is asymmetrical, the temperature shift resulting from the BHE layout {{has to be taken}} into account. Depending on the groundwater’s angle of incidence, the distorted temperature distribution differs with the relative position of the inlet <b>tubes</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>tubes,</b> provided that they have a temperature difference.

The evaporator of the boiler consists of four parallel horizontal tube paths, which are connected at both ends with headers. For different operation pressures and geometries the dynamic instability and in particular the density wave oscillation (DWO) was analysed.

40|$|Perforated {{tubes are}} widely used in {{industry}} for various applications. A special application arises when there is fluid injection into the perforated tube. Such cases arise when perforated tubes are used for horizontal oil well drilling and French drains. The behaviour of the flow under these conditions {{has led to the}} development of correlations, which consider the effects of the perforations and injection process. However, there are few friction factor correlations in literature, which consider the increased kinetic energy at the perforated <b>tube</b> <b>outlet</b> caused by fluid injection and acceleration. The current study reports experimental correlations for determining the friction factor of perforated tubes when the additional kinetic energy from the injection process is considered. The friction factor measurements were conducted in copper tubes with an internal diameter of 20. 8 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm at three nondimensional pitches of 0. 375, 0. 75 and 1. 5. A perforated length-to-diameter ratio of 40 : 1 was used for the perforated tubes. A perforation row contained seven small perforation holes with a diameter of 1. 5 mm spaced evenly around the perimeter of the tube. These perforation rows were staggered row to row, resulting in triangular perforation patterns. Water was used as a test medium with Reynolds numbers at the <b>tube</b> <b>outlet</b> ranging from 20 000 to 60 000. The injection ratio was varied from 0 to 5 % to obtain a total of 135 unique combinations of perforated tube friction factor data at different injection ratios, Reynolds numbers and nondimensional perforation pitches. The experiments were condensed into friction factor correlations, which allow perforated tube parameters to be optimisation for minimising pressure losses encountered in draining operations.

40|$|A swirl tube {{is a very}} {{effective}} cooling technique for high thermal loaded components like gas turbine blades. Such a tube consists {{of one or more}} tangential inlet jets, which induce a highly 3 D swirling flow. This swirling flow is characterized by large velocities near the wall and an enhanced turbulence in the tube which both increase the convective heat transfer. In the present work, the flow phenomena and the heat transfer in swirl tubes are studied experimentally and numerically. Therefore, a generic swirl tube with tangential inlets at the upstream end of the tube and a novel application-oriented swirl tube geometry with multiple tangential inlet jets in axial direction are investigated in detail. In strong swirling flows, the flow field is dominated by the circumferential velocity which is characterized by a Rankine vortex with a solid body vortex in the tube center and a potential vortex in the outer region. A stability analysis reveals that the solid body vortex is unstable and hence explains the transformation of the solid body vortex into a stable potential vortex towards the <b>tube</b> <b>outlet.</b> In addition, the axial velocity shows a backflow region (vortex breakdown) in the tube center over the entire tube length. It is shown that a vortex breakdown occurs in swirl dominated flows. The measurements indicate that the heat transfer in swirl tubes increases with increasing Reynolds number and swirl number, respectively. Near the inlet, the maximum heat transfer occurs due to the large circumferential velocity component. With decreasing swirl and velocity towards the <b>tube</b> <b>outlet,</b> also the heat transfer decreases continuously. The investigation of the swirl tube with multiple tangential inlet jets reveals a very complex axial velocity which changes after each inlet due to the additional mass flow. However, the circumferential velocity stays almost constant since the swirl strength is re-enhanced with each inlet jet, respectively. For each inlet jet, a high heat transfer can be observed. However, the maximum heat transfer is lower than for the swirl tube with only one inlet because of the lower inlet jet velocities. On the other hand, the heat transfer distribution is more homogeneous over the entire tube length at a much lower pressure loss. For the investigated swirl tubes with one, three or five inlets, the thermal performance is in the same order of magnitude and hence all swirl tube configurations are suitable for cooling...|$|E

Talc and wheat dusts were used in testing the laboratory scale models. Data from these tests were used in developing a mathematical computer model capable of predicting outlet dust emissions given the following input variables: dust type and inlet concentration. inlet air velocity, and cyclone type.
