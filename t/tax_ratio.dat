The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes.

The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers.

The presence of both external state rivals and internal ethnic rivals prompted states to increase their extraction of taxes from citizens while internal political rivals failed to affect the extraction of taxes. The leaders in power try to maintain their position by catering to the majority ethnic group and increase taxes to gain the resources to diminish threats from minority ethnic groups. Thus, the presence of internal ethnic rivals creates the capacity to significantly increase the <b>tax</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
40|$|In various {{empirical}} studies so-called <b>tax</b> <b>ratios</b> (<b>tax</b> revenues {{expressed as a}} ratio of some aggregate tax base) are employed as approximations for tax burdens. The most difficult problem in calculating <b>tax</b> <b>ratios</b> {{is the way in}} which personal income tax revenues are attributed to labor and capital. We argue that the methodology of Mendoza et al. (1994) is seriously flawed in this respect. Using information from national sources, we calculate more accurate <b>tax</b> <b>ratios</b> for eight OECD countries that differ substantially from those of Mendoza et al.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} revised <b>tax</b> <b>ratios</b> {{based on}} more realistic assumptions than {{those used in}} a previous study applying the same approach (based on tax revenue statistics and national accounts data) to measuring the effective tax burden. Although the levels of the revised <b>tax</b> <b>ratios</b> are sometimes quite different from those previously found, the two data sets are generally highly correlated. The paper also presents a sensitivity analysis of relaxing some remaining unrealistic assumptions for countries and periods where that is possible. It is found that this often has a large effect on the <b>tax</b> <b>ratios,</b> especially for capital, and the two data sets are sometimes no longer highly correlated. This highlights the need to use these ratios {{in conjunction with other}} indicators, such as average effective tax rates, to corroborate the story they tell. ...|$|R

We conclude that the widely used <b>tax</b> <b>ratios</b> as developed by Mendoza et al. (1994) may not be very reliable. The choice of the indicator for the tax burden on labour is also shown to affect the conclusions of some well-known empirical models. <b>tax</b> <b>ratios,</b> labour, average effective tax rates, unemployment...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} claimed that {{multinational}} firms avoid taxes by shifting income from high-tax to low-tax countries. Using a five year panel of data for two hundred large U. S. manufacturing firms, {{we find that}} U. S. tax liability, as a fraction either of U. S. sales or U. S. assets, {{is related to the}} location of foreign subsidiaries {{in a way that is}} consistent with tax-motivated income shifting. Having a subsidiary in a tax haven, Ireland, or one of the "four dragon" Asian countries - all characterized by low tax rates - is associated with lower U. S. <b>tax</b> <b>ratios.</b> Having a subsidiary in a high-tax region is associated with higher U. S. <b>tax</b> <b>ratios.</b> These results suggest that U.

40|$|The New Zealand Treasury {{forecasts}} {{tax revenue}} for the twice-yearly Economic and Fiscal Updates. The accuracy of these forecasts {{is important for the}} government's annual budget decisions as they affect key fiscal aggregates such as the operating balance and debt levels. Good decision-making in this area is important for macroeconomic stability and sustainability, one of the Treasury's outcomes. Over the past six years, Treasury tax forecasts, and the macroeconomic forecasts on which they are based, have underestimated the actual outturns. This report presents an analysis of the Treasury's tax revenue forecast errors, both in aggregate and disaggregated by individual tax type. The analysis focuses primarily on the annual one-year-ahead Budget forecasts that are typically based on rating up past tax revenues by growth rates in related macroeconomic variables such as GDP. The objective of the analysis is to better determine the major sources of tax revenue forecast error and to identify the potential for methodological improvements. A review of the Treasury’s tax forecasting methods is given and a general class of models proposed that encompasses these methods. Adopting one of the simplest of these as a benchmark, the individual tax revenue forecast errors are first disaggregated into component errors due to forecasting the macroeconomic drivers used as a proxy for the tax base, and a component due to forecasting the <b>tax</b> <b>ratio,</b> or ratio of tax revenue to proxy tax base. The <b>tax</b> <b>ratio</b> is further disaggregated into a component error due to forecasting the <b>tax</b> <b>ratio</b> trend and random error. The latter provides a measure of the best accuracy that can be achieved using the benchmark models adopted. Among other findings, the report shows that the main source of tax revenue underforecasting is the underforecasting of the macroeconomic variables used as taxbase proxies. The <b>tax</b> <b>ratio</b> forecasts were generally unbiased, but less precisely determined than the macroeconomic forecasts. This and other evidence indicate that better <b>tax</b> <b>ratio</b> forecasts are likely to be achieved, even with the simple benchmark model used here. The benchmark models have merit as competing models that could be investigated further alongside other simple structural time series models in a systematic evaluation using historical data.

As a result, the model implies that countries with more old people have relatively lower capital taxes.
