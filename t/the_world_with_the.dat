5|$|In the 1850s, {{the process}} to distill {{kerosene}} from petroleum was invented by Abraham Gesner. The demand for the petroleum as a fuel for lighting around the world quickly grew. Petroleum exploration developed {{in many parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire, particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan, taking the lead in production {{by the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, 95% of new zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, {{in which}} {{sphalerite}} (ZnS) is nearly always {{mixed with the}} sulfides of copper, lead and iron. Zinc mines are scattered throughout <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> main areas being China, Australia, and Peru. China produced 38% of the global zinc output in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E

5|$|Crickets have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{found in all}} parts of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him is a first-person narrative-based {{video game}} set around {{the death of}} a {{bisexual}} man named Will. The player controls four characters, each of whom was connected to Will during his lifetime. The characters consist of: Will, who dies in a car crash early in the game; Sarah, Will's ex-girlfriend; Harry, Will's boyfriend {{at the time of his}} death; and Mary, Will's grandmother. The gameplay has the player character walk around <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> player triggering snippets of narration by clicking on highlighted objects. When interacting with non-player characters, clicking on them will sometimes result in them disappearing and reappearing in a different location to give the impression of them walking.|$|E
5|$|Genetic testing results {{published}} in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses {{are one of}} the most isolated horse populations in <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> second-lowest genetic variation of all horse populations that have been studied to date. In part, this is due to their small founding population, and generally small modern population, made smaller during periods of drought. Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended, at least one genetic bottleneck has occurred in the breed's history, resulting in a significant decline in genetic variation over a relatively short period of time. Although an ideal minimum population size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses, the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall. Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{constructed}} by the Dinn Corporation, Mean Streak {{opened to the public}} on on May 11, 1991, as the tallest wooden coaster in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> longest drop height. Cedar Point closed Mean Streak on September 16, 2016, casting doubt and uncertainty regarding the ride's future. The park dropped subtle hints over the following year that the ride was being refurbished. On August 16, 2017, Cedar Point officially announced the conversion of Mean Streak into Steel Vengeance, marketed as the first hybrid hypercoaster. Before its official opening, a virtual recreation of the ride was made available in the video game, Planet Coaster.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are {{sometimes}} difficult, as {{in the rest of}} the country. Each group tolerate the other but they tend to avoid each other and live in what can appear as two parallel worlds. The Roma minority is on its side very deprived. Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to other ethnic groups or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the city in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> largest Roma population.|$|E
5|$|Secret of Mana, {{originally}} {{released in}} Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2, is a 1993 action role-playing game developed {{and published by}} Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the sequel to the 1991 game Seiken Densetsu, released in North America as Final Fantasy Adventure and in Europe as Mystic Quest, {{and it was the}} first Seiken Densetsu title to be marketed as part of the Mana series rather than the Final Fantasy series. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows three heroes as they attempt to prevent an empire from conquering <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> power of an ancient flying fortress.|$|E

5|$|The eldest generational Avatar {{within a}} House is {{dominant}} {{and called the}} Prophet. He possesses blue blood, also called Vitae Divina. The next in line is the Ascendant Prince. Any additional Avatara within the House are Princes ranked by generation. Although Avatara form blood dynasties from father to son, House affiliations can be mixed within a dynasty. If the youngest Prince in a dynasty dies, the dynasty is ended. Most dynasties only last on average three generations, since typical Avatara can be killed by any means. When a dynasty ends, the first male child born elsewhere in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most Avataric blood {{will be a new}} Prince starting a new dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of}} the music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members were in high school, where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also listened to their parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France to rap over. Later they purchased a drum machine, but even with this equipment, a member of the group would have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another Senegalese rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E

5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. Maternal mortality in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, maternal mortality in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported in the rest of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E
5|$|In July 1780 Adams {{replaced}} Laurens as {{the ambassador}} to the Dutch Republic, {{then one of the}} few other republics in <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> aid of the Dutch Patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states was the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition in 1778. He also negotiated a loan of five million guilders financed by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink. By 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders. In October 1782, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce, the first such treaty between the United States and a foreign power following the 1778 treaty with France. The house that Adams bought during this stay in The Netherlands became the first American-owned embassy on foreign soil.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to diversify the economy and make it less {{dependent}} on export goods, the government has pushed to increase tourism to Malaysia. As a result, tourism has become Malaysia's third largest source of foreign exchange, although it is threatened by {{the negative effects of}} the growing industrial economy, with large amounts of air and water pollution along with deforestation affecting tourism. The tourism sector came under some pressure in 2014 when the national carrier Malaysia Airlines had one of its planes disappear in March, while another was brought down by a missile over Ukraine in July, resulting in the loss of a total 537 passengers and crew. The state of the airline, which had been unprofitable for 3 years, prompted the government in August 2014 to nationalise the airline by buying up the 30 per cent it did not already own. Between 2013 and 2014, Malaysia has been listed {{as one of the best}} places to retire to in <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> country in third position on the Global Retirement Index. This in part was the result of the Malaysia My Second Home programme to allow foreigners to live in the country on a long-stay visa for up to 10 years. In 2016, Malaysia ranked the fifth position on The World's Best Retirement Havens while getting in the first place as the best place in Asia to retire. Warm climate with British colonial background made foreigners easy to interact with the locals.|$|E
