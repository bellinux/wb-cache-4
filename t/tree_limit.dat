50|$|The deep valleys {{found in}} this {{location}} may have acted as microclimates that sheltered the trees from glacial conditions and climate. Pollen studies show that these valleys consisted mostly of grasses and shrubs around 25,000-22,000 years BP. A low occurrence of beech (Nothofagus menziesii) pollen (dated to 25,742-22,988 years BP) suggests a refugium in this area. Another line of evidence {{was found in the}} fossilized remains of ground beetles dating back to 25,742-22,988 years BP. Because these beetles are normally associated with tree line habitats, their location suggests an altitudinal <b>tree</b> <b>limit</b> during the glacial period. Based on these lines of evidence, beech forest may have been more common in lower elevation areas of the Howard Valley during periods of glacial advance.|$|E

40|$|Global {{warming is}} {{triggering}} some species to shift towards the poles or higher elevations, but spatial translocation is {{also influenced by}} land-use regime or intensity. The Himalayan climate is getting warmer and land use has changed, reducing in intensity in some areas. We estimated the upper species limit (USL) and <b>tree</b> <b>limit</b> of Abies spectabilis (D.

Transects (20 m wide) ran from the USL of A. spectabilis down towards the treeline and beyond to the forest line. Length of each transect varied depending on local conditions. Co-ordinates, elevation, height and age of each A. spectabilis individual along the transects were recorded.

The 20 th century does not look unusual {{in the context of the}} last three hundred years in the Tien Shan Mountains, either in terms of the drought occurrence and severity or in summer temperature changes.
