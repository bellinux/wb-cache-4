5|$|Sea snakes were {{at first}} {{regarded}} as a unified and separate family, the Hydrophiidae, that later came to comprise two subfamilies: the Hydrophiinae, or true/aquatic sea snakes (now 16genera with 57species), and the more primitive Laticaudinae, or sea kraits (one genus, Laticauda, with five species). Eventually, as it became clear just how closely related the sea snakes are to the elapids, the taxonomic situation became less well-defined. Some taxonomists responded by moving the sea snakes to the Elapidae, thereby creating the subfamilies Elapinae, Hydrophiinae, and Laticaudinae, although the latter may be omitted if Laticauda {{is included in the}} Hydrophiinae. No one has yet been able to convincingly work out the phylogenetic relationships between the various elapid subgroups, and the situation is still unclear. Therefore, others opted to either continue to work with the older traditional arrangements, if only for practical reasons, or <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> all of the genera together in the Elapidae, with no taxonomic subdivisions, to reflect the work that remains to be done.|$|E
500|$|In {{the three}} decades {{following}} Burret's delimitation {{of the genus}} a further 15 species were described, bringing the total species count to 47. [...] Borchsenius and Bernal determined {{that many of these}} names were synonyms, although American botanist George Proctor disagreed with their decision <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> A.acanthophylla into A.minima. Borchsenius and Bernal also described one new species, Aiphanes spicata, bringing the total number of accepted species to 22. [...] In two cases the destruction of the only known collections made it impossible to be absolutely certain that a name was a synonym. [...] The current World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, maintained by Rafaël Govaerts at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, recognises 26 species, including four species described since the publication of Borchsenius and Bernal's monograph.|$|E

The emperor’s {{ultimate}} failure can arguably be attributed to the manifold religious traditions and deities that paganism promulgated. Most pagans sought religious affiliations that were unique to their culture and people, and they had internal divisions that prevented them from creating any one ‘pagan religion.’ Indeed, the term pagan was simply a convenient appellation for Christians <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> together the believers of a system they opposed. In truth, there was no Roman religion, as modern observers would recognize it.

Moreno was quoted as saying, [...] "It's all on record. We told motherfuckers not <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't going to be with them". In reviewing Deftones, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "Hexagram", the album's opener, [...] "hits hard—harder than they ever have, revealing how mushy Staind is, or how toothless Linkin Park is".

Stallman advocates referring to copyrights, patents and trademarks in the singular and warns against abstracting disparate laws into a collective term. He argues that [...] "to avoid spreading unnecessary bias and confusion, {{it is best to}} adopt a firm policy not to speak or even think in terms of 'intellectual property'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{leadership}} of the Goths, a series of major invasions of the Roman empire were launched by a grand coalition of lower Danubian tribes from c. 238 onwards. The participation of the Bastarnae in these is likely but largely unspecified, due to Zosimus' and other chroniclers' tendency <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> all these tribes under the general term [...] "Scythians" [...] - meaning all the inhabitants of Scythia, rather than the specific Iranic-speaking people called the Scythians. Thus, in 250-1, the Bastarnae were probably involved in the Gothic and Sarmatian invasions which culminated in the Roman defeat at the Battle of Abrittus and the slaying of the emperor Decius (251). This disaster was the start of the Third Century Crisis of the Roman empire, a period of military and economic chaos. At this critical moment, the Roman army was crippled by the outbreak of a second smallpox pandemic, the plague of Cyprian (251-70). The effects are described by Zosimus as even worse than the earlier Antonine plague (166-80), which probably killed 15-30% of the empire's inhabitants.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Christopher A. Hartwell {{provided}} a critical {{assessment of the}} book in a review published in German Studies Review. He described the book as [...] "interesting, but ultimately disappointing" [...] and argued that the authors committed several egregious errors, with the most prominent being the whitewash of Red Army crimes on the Eastern Front, while denigrating those [...] who do mention them [...] "as contributing to the exoneration of the Wehrmacht". He noted that the book tends to suffer {{from a lack of}} perspective [...] "on the effect the German generals had on the broader American perception of the war [...]" [...] Furthermore, Hartwell stated that the effect and influence of those [...] "romancers" [...] on American culture was not [...] "impressively support" [...] in the thesis, and the case that [...] "romancers" [...] were able to [...] "effectively spread the myth of the innocent Wehrmacht" [...] was not made out. Due to the lack of perspective, the book tended <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> together [...] "those with an interest in military history and those who actually subscribe to neo-Nazi beliefs", and Hartwell concluded: [...] "As it stands now, however, this tome has the feel of a dissertation that is trying too hard to find a niche that hasn't seen the light of day".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the deaths}} of Wagner and Abbott, Barbara Haviland {{continued}} to compile data for world records. In 1997 Kim Hutsell acquired the rights from Cynthia Abbott to World Size Records to continue the project as a stand-alone book, those rights were subsequently sold to Don Pisor. The first edition therefore incorporated many of the earlier entries, as well as additional data compiled for World Size Records by Barbara Haviland. The format of the new publication differed from World Size Records in several important ways. Significantly, the minimum size threshold was lowered from [...] to [...] In another change, the registry listed taxa alphabetically by species name within families, instead of within genera {{as they had been}} previously. This system allows for easy comparison between closely related genera, is more resilient to the frequent taxonomic changes that occur at the genus level, and gets around the issue that many shell dealers prefer <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> numerous genera for the sake of simplicity. R. Tucker Abbott had himself intended to use this arrangement in the fifth edition of his World Size Records, but died before he could see his plans through. Another difference was the presentation of sizes in millimetres to the nearest tenth instead of centimetres to the nearest hundredth, moving the publication in line with standard usage in conchology. Finally, references were added for each specimen to aid in identification. The opening paragraph of the first edition set out the project's goals and invited submissions: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{involvement}} of cannabis {{in the creation}} of [...] "stoner rock/metal" [...] can range between bands in the genre. Bands such as Sleep have involved the concept of cannabis {{to be part of the}} core of their albums and songs. The consumption of cannabis is common in the live performances of some stoner rock/metal bands, and bands such as Electric Wizard are known to have concerts with the band members and the crowd participating in smoking cannabis. [...] Dopesmoker by Sleep received controversy because the 60-minute song is about cannabis, which resulted in conflict with Sleep's record company. While other members of the genre state that [...] "stoner rock is a style, not life," [...] which is interpreted as the band members do not participate in smoking cannabis or are influenced by cannabis, however the style of their music reflects the sound of [...] "stoner rock/metal." [...] Bands such as King Caravan and Sea of Green have come under terms with this statement. [...] Similarly, Matt Pike from the band [...] High on Fire stated, [...] "It's a very strong scene, but I don't think any of the stoner rock bands want to be labeled as stoner rock ... I might use the word 'stoner' in my lyrics, but I think we're metal, dude. I'd say I was crossover metal, actually, or progressive metal. It's kind of a tough thing <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> into a category, but I guess we get the stoner-rock label because of the whole pot thing." ...|$|E

As Deftones abandoned the nu metal sound of their early work, Moreno tried to distance himself from nu metal bands and began to criticize the bands and their albums, including Korn's 2002 album Untouchables; he said, [...] "As Korn go on, it's the same things—bad childhoods and mean moms. It gets too old after a while. How old is Jonathan ? Thirty? How long has it been since he lived with his parents?" [...] Davis responded saying, [...] "Obviously, Chino hasn't listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they're nothing about my parents or my childhood." [...] Moreno also said, [...] "A big problem for me was opening for Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, two bands that wouldn't exist if it weren't for me, straight up!". Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park spoke about the nu metal label in an interview with NME, saying [...] "We never held the flag for nu-metal—it was associated with frat rock. Arrogant, misogynistic, and full of testosterone; we were reacting against that." [...] Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit said that he [...] "never liked or condoned" [...] the term [...] "nu metal" [...] in any way, and said he does not understand [...] "how so many bands that sound nothing alike can be put into" [...] the nu metal genre.
