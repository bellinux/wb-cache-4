40|$|Abstract: Currently, various {{information}} retrieval {{methods have been}} implemented and are used on the Internet. For example, the existing shortest-path system obtains {{the information from the}} shortest-path database (DB), which is constructed in advance using Dijkstra’s algorithm. However, employing a subway, if an accident disrupts the path between any two stations, the shortest-path DB does not remain intact, and must be reconstructed from scratch using Dijkstra’s algorithm. In this paper, we propose a more efficient shortest-path searching method that does not require reconstructing the entire path from scratch. And, {{in the case of the}} shortest path, the transit process may have a great influence on the shortest-path search. Existing methods, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm, might offer unavailable shortest-path information because they do not consider the <b>condition</b> of <b>transit</b> passengers. In this paper, we propose a variable weighted graph constructed from information about the <b>transit</b> passenger’s <b>condition.</b> We propose a method that obtains the available shortest-path information using a variable weighted graph.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation-based method and a risk model of ship grounding {{for a long-term}} optimization of channel depths. The long-term optimization of channel depths {{should be considered a}} two-stage process: Firstly, establishing a ship entrance guidance to facilitate a required navigation safety with respect to an acceptable risk of ship grounding due to wave impacts. As basis for such guidance, ship motion responses are defined {{as a function of the}} sea state (described by significant wave height Hs and wave period T 2) and the <b>transit</b> <b>condition</b> (ship speed V and ship draft T). Secondly, using the Monte Carlo method and based on the established accessibility policy, a simulation model is developed to define a safe underkeel clearance allowance for ship entrance and simultaneously determine downtimes that correspond to an acceptable grounding risk for a specified ship and a generated sea state. The final results derived from the simulation model can be considered as the key parameters in analysis and selection of an optimal depth.

40|$|When {{suspended}} payloads {{are moved}} in a material handling environment pendulum like oscillations are naturally introduced. This presents a problem any time especially when expensive and/or delicate objects are moved. In a steel industry environment objects have {{to be placed in}} tight locations after finishing up of rolling. Typically an object (rolled coil) is lifted by a hook {{on the end of a}} cable, creating pendulum that is free to swing in a <b>transit</b> <b>condition.</b> This swinging motion makes remote positioning of casks and barrels difficult to control precisely which is potentially destructive to facility equipment and to other storage containers. Typically, a crane operator moves objects slowly to minimize induced swinging and allow time for oscillation to dampen, maintaining safety but greatly decreasing the efficiency of operations. By employing proper algorithm or by the choice of proper drive it is possible to dampen the oscillations predictive called residual vibration[1]. Using damped-oscillation control algorithm [2] is one method of solving this problem. Residual vibrations resulting from the motion of the crane can not only be expensive to deal with but also dangerous. Standard practice in crane operation is to allow the pendulum swing to die out before working with the moved object. Considering the size of thes...|$|R

40|$|Public {{transportation}} {{projects are}} some of the most complex and costly components of urban development. While urban sites may develop naturally through the combined and only partially coordinated efforts of countless private groups, they inevitably reach a critical mass which requires the development of a shared infrastructure. While this problem is not unique to the modern era, the size, density, and intensity of modern urban uses demands a level of advanced and extensive transportation infrastructure that is unprecedented. The extreme costliness and impact of this infrastructure makes its design and implementation a difficult and controversial matter, particularly when divergent strategies are possible. Mass transit is not the predominant mode of travel for most twenty first century Americans. Before the automobile era, however, transit modes of all types graced the country’s cities, providing a level of service unmatched by most modern transit systems through high frequency and dense routes. This research investigates the transportation history of Seattle, a prominent but relatively young American city, to determine the critical cultural, political and social factors which led that city to redevelop its transit systems successfully after their initial dismantlement during the early car era. The research will focus on the unique trends which allowed Seattle to avoid the transit stagnation of other cities in the mid to late twenty-first century. Seattle’s contemporary <b>transit</b> <b>conditions</b> are summarized through the use of spatial and survey data and compared to <b>transit</b> <b>conditions</b> from the peak of the historic streetcar era.

The proposed model reveals the interaction between ETIS and TTPS, and the potential benefit of the joint implementation. There are two classes of passengers: those equipped and those unequipped with ETIS. It is assumed that unequipped passengers make their travel choices according to stochastic dynamic user optimal principles, with equipped passengers having a lower perception variation of travel cost due to the availability of better information. A bi-level program is formulated to model the integrated effects on passengers' departure time choice behavior, route choice behavior, transit network performance, and transit operators' revenue.

In today’s marketing programs, feeder calves might be transported as many as 6 times. Loading <b>conditions,</b> time in <b>transit,</b> weather <b>conditions,</b> commingling, segregation of different sexes and weight classes into separate trailer compartments, driver experience, animal nutrition, health status, and physical condition are all factors to be considered when transporting cattle. Transportation related live weight loss (shrink) is not only attributed to loss of gut fill but also tissue loss, which can exceed 60 % of total BW loss. High ambient temperature and rough handling of cattle significantly increase the amount of shrink incurred by cattle. If following best management practices could result in a 1 % decrease in shrink among the feeder cattle shipped at least once in the United States, the economic benefit would exceed $ 325 million dollars.
