5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>operated.</b>|$|E

5|$|Warmly {{received}} by the city's inhabitants and authorities, Süleyman opted to impose a series of formal moves, which were intended to appease Russia.

In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s.

5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the United States entered World War II, Pennsylvanian was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA), and, as with her pre-U.S. Navy service in World War I, she {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> by American-Hawaiian. From July to September 1942, Pennsylvanian sailed between New York and Caribbean ports, calling at Trinidad, Key West, Hampton Roads, Guantánamo Bay, and Cristóbal. In January 1943, Pennsylvanian called at Bandar Abbas, Iran, on the Persian Gulf, {{and returned to}} Caribbean sailings again by March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often {{knew where the}} locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk. In the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> with a single unit. NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus.|$|E

5|$|Between late 1962 {{and early}} 1964 the east {{ends of the}} {{platforms}} were extended to allow longer 8-car trains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>operated.</b> This involved carefully enlarging the tunnels under the Metropolitan Police's original headquarters at New Scotland Yard (now Norman Shaw Buildings). The station was completely rebuilt to incorporate new deep-level platforms for the Jubilee line when it was extended to the London Docklands in the 1990s. During the works, {{the level of the}} sub-surface platforms was lowered to enable ground level access to Portcullis House. This was achieved in small increments which were carried out when the line was closed at night.|$|E
5|$|Constanța Port {{is both a}} {{maritime}} and a river port.

Important cargo quantities are carried by river, between Constanta and Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Germany. River traffic is very important for the Constanța Port, having a share of 23.3% of the total traffic in 2005, when 8,800 river vessels called to the port.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are {{generally}} globular proteins, acting {{alone or in}} larger complexes. The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot yet be predicted from structure alone. Enzyme structures unfold (denature) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as hot springs are prized by industrial users {{for their ability to}} function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>operated</b> at a very high rate.|$|E
