5|$|The likely {{presence}} of an ocean within Callisto leaves open <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could harbor life. However, conditions {{are thought to be}} less favorable than on nearby Europa. Various space probes from Pioneers 10 and 11 to Galileo and Cassini have studied Callisto. Because of its low radiation levels, Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|Dox wrote prolifically {{over the}} course of his career, {{yielding}} nine poem anthologies, numerous books in prose, and sixteen plays along Biblical themes or Malagasy history and folk tales. In addition, he wrote a number of plays on commission for various clients, with many commissioned by Boy Scout troupes, although these have since been lost. His translation from French to Malagasy of three major Western novels was significant because they enriched Malagasy literature by introducing elements of the novel form that had never before been attempted in Malagasy language. These efforts demonstrated to other Malagasy language writers the versatility of the language and <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could be used for any literary form.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Charig and Milner found Baryonyx unique {{enough to warrant}} a new family of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They found Baryonyx to be unlike any other theropod group (and considered <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a thecodont, due to apparently primitive features), but noted that the articulation of the maxilla and premaxilla {{was similar to that}} in Dilophosaurus. They also noted that two fragmentary snouts from Niger, assigned to the family Spinosauridae by French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet in 1984, appeared almost identical to those of Baryonyx and they referred them to Baryonychidae instead. In 1988, American palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul agreed with Taquet that Spinosaurus, described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from Egypt which were destroyed in World War II, and Baryonyx were similar and (due to their kinked snouts) possibly late-surviving dilophosaurs. French palaeontologist Eric Buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989. In 1990 Charig and Milner dismissed the spinosaurid affinities of Baryonyx, since they did not find their remains similar enough.|$|E

5|$|Plans for Armidas {{performance}} were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo {{died at the}} end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio {{was still}} asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy patron of the arts at whose Venetian palace Il combattimento had been performed in 1624.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} began {{negotiations with the}} Allies about the terms of surrender on 10August. During this period B-29 attacks on Japan were limited to a raid by the 315thBombardment Wing against an oil target {{on the night of}} 9/10August and a daytime precision bombing attack on a factory in Tokyo on 10August. The next day, President Truman ordered a halt to the bombing due to <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be interpreted as a sign that the peace negotiations had failed. On 11August, Spaatz issued a new targeting directive for any renewed attacks that reduced the emphasis on bombing cities in favor of intensified attacks on transport infrastructure. On 13August, B-29s dropped copies of the Japanese government's conditional offer to surrender over Japanese cities. Negotiations appeared to be stalled, and on 14August Spaatz received orders to resume the bombing campaign. Arnold requested the largest attack possible, and hoped that USASTAF could dispatch 1,000 aircraft against the Tokyo region and other locations in Japan. In fact, 828 B-29s escorted by 186 fighters (for a total of 1,014 aircraft) were dispatched; during the day precision raids were made against targets at Iwakuni, Osaka and Tokoyama and at night the cities of Kumagaya and Isesaki were firebombed. While the Eighth Air Force units at Okinawa had not yet conducted any missions against Japan, General Doolittle decided not to contribute aircraft to this operation as {{he did not want to}} risk the lives of the men under his command when the war was effectively over. These were the last attacks conducted against Japan by heavy bombers, as at noon on 15August Hirohito made a radio broadcast announcing his country's intention to surrender.|$|E

2500|$|..... Greenstreet {{chatters}} {{about the}} falcon {{while waiting for}} a drugged drink to knock out Bogart. Huston's strategy is crafty. Earlier, Greenstreet has set it up by making a point: [...] "I distrust a man who says 'when.' If he's {{got to be careful}} not to drink too much, it's because he's not to be trusted when he does." [...] Now he offers Bogart a drink, but Bogart doesn't sip from it. Greenstreet talks on, and tops up Bogart's glass. He still doesn't drink. Greenstreet watches him narrowly. They discuss the value of the missing black bird. Finally, Bogart drinks, and passes out. The timing is everything; Huston doesn't give us closeups of the glass to underline <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> drugged. He depends on the situation to generate the suspicion in our minds.|$|R

40|$|The {{expected}} {{development of}} grid monitoring applications and control functionalities in low voltage distribution networks calls for advanced simulation tools for performance assessment of these applications.

With the aid of the data acquisition and processing system, the performance of newly developed monitoring and control applications can be assessed and evaluated in terms of accuracy, speed and effectiveness. To this extend, the paper shows how the data acquisition and processing system is implemented and discusses <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> creates for verifying newly developed applications for distribution grid automation...|$|R
