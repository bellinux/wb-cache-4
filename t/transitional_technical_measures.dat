40|$|It has {{analyzed}} different <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> {{that could}} be adopted in the NAFO 3 M cod case to reduce the catches of cod below the Minimum Landing Size (MLS) and increase the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). There {{is not so much}} information about <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> in the NAFO cod fisheries. This analysis was mainly based on the Norwegian cod fisheries information. The adoption of the some studied <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> seems to have a biological support because they would allow catching bigger fish minimizing the immature cod catches (length below the MLS) and the redfish by-catches in the NAFO 3 M cod fishery. It was also studied the impact on Fmsy of some of these <b>technical</b> <b>measures.</b> These <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> would increase slightly the current MSY but with a large increase in the fishing effort. The increase in the equilibrium yield with the selectivity change seems not to be very efficient. In NAFO, it should be studied the possibility of implementing <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> to prevent the large catches of small immature individuals observed in 2013. These devices would prevent catches of individuals with length below MLS to avoid discards and will improve the exploitation pattern.

40|$|Domestic <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> such as SPS and TBTs {{can enhance}} import demand via {{information}} disclosure and quality improvement, or hamper foreign export supply via imposing sizeable compliance costs, or both. The traditional gravity equation model estimates {{the net effect}} of these measures on international trade with a loss of useful inference on separate effects. We stipulate a generalized gravity equation model to disentangle the two effects. We apply the augmented approach to agricultural trade among OECD countries in 2004. We find that <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> in agriculture often jointly enhance import demand and hinder export supply with {{the net effect of}} promoting the propensity to trade. Further disaggregated data analysis reveals heterogeneity across sectors in terms of net effects of <b>technical</b> <b>measures,</b> despite common demand-enhancing and supply-hindering effects. These measures in the net decrease the probability of intra-OECD trade in dairy products, whereas they increase that of intra-OECD trade in cereal preparations. sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, <b>technical</b> <b>measures,</b> NTM, TBT, standards, gravity equation, protectionism, OECD, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{selective}} {{review of the}} empirical international trade literature on nontariff measures (NTMs) acting like standards–the so-called <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> under the MAST classification. This review focuses on analytical and methodological dimensions involved in evaluating these NTMs and their economic effects, and draws from established approaches to measure standard-like NTMs and rigorous models used to quantify their effects on trade and welfare. The quantification of <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> and the assessment of their effects are often entangled. We present each of these major approaches and methodologies with some formalism and details to help guide future investigations of <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> select a suitable approach for their empirical strategy. An annex contains a more advanced technical formulation for interested readers. We also identify respective and potential pitfalls of each approach and methodology. Promising research directions are suggested for further work quantifying and assessing the economic effects of standard-like NTMs...|$|R

To answer this question, {{the position of a}} disturbed site along the productivity–stress gradient was considered. The probability of attaining a target stage by spontaneous succession decreases toward both ends of the productivity–stress gradient, whereas the acceptance of <b>technical</b> <b>measures</b> generally increases. In correspondence with that, the monetary cost of restoration increases toward the ends of the gradient.
