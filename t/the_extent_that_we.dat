60|$|The {{preparations}} to be {{made for}} the momentous coup Sir Rowland meditated were considerable.

That done, he was to return and ripen his preparations for the business he had undertaken. Nevertheless, in spite of all that lay before him, he did not find it possible to leave Lupton House without stepping out into the garden in quest of Ruth. Through the window, whilst he and Richard were at their ale, he had watched her between whiles, and had lingered, waiting; for Diana was with her, and it was not his wish to seek her whilst Diana was at hand. Speak with her, ere he went, he must. He was an opportunist, and now, he fondly imagined, was his opportunity. He had made that day, at last, a favourable impression upon Richard's sister; he had revealed himself in an heroic light, and egregiously misreading the emotion she had shown before withdrawing, he was satisfied that did he strike now victory must attend him. He sighed his satisfaction and pleasurable anticipation. He had been wary and he had known how to wait; and now, it seemed to him, he was to be rewarded for his patience. Then he frowned, as another glance showed him that Diana still lingered with her cousin; he wished Diana at the devil. He had come to hate this fair-haired doll to whom he had once paid court. She was too continually in his way, a constant obstacle in his path, ever ready to remind Ruth of Anthony Wilding when Sir Rowland most desired Anthony Wilding to be forgotten; and in Diana's feelings towards himself such a change had been gradually wrought that she had come to reciprocate his sentiments--to hate him with all the bitter hatred into which love can be by scorn transmuted. At first her object in keeping Ruth's thoughts on Mr. Wilding, in pleading his cause, and seeking to present him in a favourable light to the lady whom he had constrained to become his wife, had been that he might stand a barrier between Ruth and Sir Rowland to the end that Diana might hope to see revived--faute de mieux, since possible in no other way--the feelings that once Sir Rowland had professed for herself. The situation was rich in humiliations for poor, vain, foolishly crafty Diana, and these humiliations were daily rendered more bitter by Sir Rowland's unwavering courtship of her cousin in despite of all that she could do.|$|E
6000|$|I do not {{question}} {{the intentions of}} civilisation--they are most honourable. To be clean, warm, well nourished, healthy, decently leisured, and free to move quickly about the world, are certainly pure benefits. And these are presumably the prime objects of our toil and ingenuity, the ideals to be served, by the discovery of steam, electricity, modern industrial machinery, telephony, flying. If we attained those ideals, and stopped there--well and good. Alas! the amazing mechanical conquests of the age have crowded one on another so fast that we have never had time to digest their effects. Each as it came we hailed as an incalculable benefit to mankind, and so it was, or would have been, {{if we had not}} the appetites of cormorants and the digestive powers of elderly gentlemen. Our civilisation reminds one of the corpse in the Mark Twain story which, at its own funeral, got up and rode with the driver. It is watching itself being buried. We discover, and scatter discovery broadcast among a society uninstructed in the proper use of it. Consider the town-ridden, parasitic condition of Great Britain--the country which cannot feed itself. If we are beaten in this war, it will be because we have let our industrial system run away with us; because we became so sunk in machines and money-getting that we forgot our self-respect. No self-respecting nation would have let its food-growing capacity and its country life down to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have. If we are beaten--which God forbid--we shall deserve our fate. And why did our industrial system get such a mad grip on us? Because we did not master the riot of our inventions and discoveries.

Here was an invention which was to effect a tremendous saving of labour and be of sweeping benefit to mankind. Exploited without knowledge, scruple, or humanity, it also caused untold misery and grievous national harm. Read, mark, and learn Mr. and Mrs. Hammond's book, [...] "The Town Labourer." [...] The spinning jenny and similar inventions have been the forces which have dotted beautiful counties of England with the blackest and most ill-looking towns in the world, have changed the proportion of country- to town-dwellers from about 3 as against 2 in 1761 to 2 as against 7 in 1911; have strangled our powers to feed ourselves, and so made us a temptation to our enemies and a danger to the whole world. We have made money by it; our standard of wealth has gone up. I remember having a long talk with a very old shepherd on the South Downs, whose youth and early married life were lived on eight shillings a week; and he was no exception.

40|$|The {{development}} of the capital market in Sweden {{in recent years has}} transformed the ownership in companies from private owners to large institutional owners with a main focus on investment companies, insurance companies and pension funds. Institutional investors are accused of being passive owners with a strict focus on short-term financial results and of having no interest in developing companies and building long-term relationships. There has though been an increasing trend in the business sphere towards different forms of ownership activity and corporate engagement where an increasing number of institutional investors present themselves as active owners with a sense of responsibility and genuine interest in companies, due to pressure from the society. Owners are however obliged to earn profit and present positive short-term results to shareholders and customers in order to survive in the competition and <b>we</b> believe <b>that</b> {{it can be difficult to}} combine both long and short-term goals. The purpose of this study has therefore been to examine whether a paradox exists within institutional ownership where long-term goals are being promised in theory but short-term act occurs in practice.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to put Loïc Wacquant’s {{neoliberal}} penality thesis to the test within the Greek context. Although we discover ample compelling evidence of intense and growing punitiveness in contemporary Greece, it turns out that punitive trends anticipated the recent advent of neoliberal policy-making in the country, and indeed have starker precedents throughout the twentieth century. Whilst the former leaves neoliberalism with a limited penal role at most -that of enhancing, as opposed to engendering, the revitalised expansion of imprisonment-, the latter draws attention to the forms and functions of state power characteristic of the capitalist semi-periphery. That neoliberalism bears little pertinence to the Greek case becomes all the more evident when we shift the focus of attention from the penal realm to the history of welfare and economic regulation in the country. True to its semi-peripheral status, Greece has long known both insufficient provision of social welfare -even if related expenditure has undergone an overall upward trend over the last fifty years- and widespread informal flexibility in labour relations. Although neoliberal reforms have been introduced at the policy-making level more recently, they have remained partial in scope, and have been implemented slowly and patchily. In all, then, whilst we support Wacquant’s call for ‘bringing developments in welfare and criminal justice into a single theoretical framework equally attentive to the instrumental and expressive moments of public policy’ (Wacquant, 2009 a: 175), we find neoliberalism wanting as an explanation of punitiveness in Greece today. Instead, and to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> space allows, <b>we</b> point to the configuration of social, political, and economic tensions and conflicts representative of semi-peripheral societies. Sharing Wacquant’s concern for ‘epistemic reflexivity’, we conclude with some thoughts on the political dangers of the neoliberal penality thesis...|$|R

Potentially, this will be important information to provide as feedback to the organisations as well as more generally to the public domain and the policy community. This work package also includes an in-depth analysis of the (interactive) policy processes that result in specific policy outcomes. Description of work In each country, we shall use media visibility (drawn from work package 2) as well as secondary information (e. g., attendance and consultation on interfaith and policy committees), to select between 15 - 20 important organisations per country, spread across the different groups. In addition, we propose also to interview the leaders of European- level organisations and transnational ones to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> they exist. <b>We</b> shall aim to interview organisations’ leaders. There will be a common set of questions and topics to address that will allow for reports at the national level, and then subsequent cross-national pooling of insights, information and comparative analysis. The interviews will be carried out face-to-face {{on the basis of a}} common interview grid prepared jointly by all the partners. Finally, we shall also conduct a small number of interviews with key policy-makers (12 - 15 in total including national and EU levels) who are directly involved in central government attempts to ‘outreach’ to Muslim communities. Each country will establish contact early in the project with a few key actors in this field (for example, in the UK, key actors from the Communities and Local Government Department) to ask advice and direction. Here our findings will be used as a basis for a series of questions to the policy makers with the expressed aim of providing feedback within a setting where a relationship has been established. EURISLAM coordinator UvA/IMES (the Netherlands) is the coordinator of this work package...|$|R
