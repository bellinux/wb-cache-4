5|$|Whales are {{descendants}} of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They {{are related to}} the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. Primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. What defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (Ambulocetus 49 mya), a streamlined body and the growth of flukes on the tail (Protocetus 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cranium (blowholes), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (Basilosaurus 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).|$|E
25|$|The {{triangular}} summit has a cairn at {{the high}} point above Gamlin End. The view is restricted by High Stile, but the head of Ennerdale- backed by the Scafells- presents a fine picture.

A short walk north west <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the crags brings Buttermere and Crummock Water into sight.|$|E
50|$|Gayophytum heterozygum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the evening primrose family known by the common name zigzag groundsmoke. It is native to the western United States where it grows mainly in forested mountain habitat. This is a spindly annual herb with a few forking branches which approaches 80 centimeters in maximum height. It has a sparse foliage of small, narrow leaves, {{most of which are}} on {{the lower half of the}} plant. It produces tiny white flowers <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thin stems. The fruit is a lumpy-looking capsule.|$|R
2500|$|The Rough Riders under Colonel Theodore Roosevelt {{would claim}} to have taken Kettle Hill on the American right with {{assistance}} from several troops of the [...] "black" [...] 10th Cavalry and the entire 3rd Cavalry ("white" [...] volunteers). The reality was that [...] "the regulars" [...] were supported by the 3rd & Roosevelt's 1st in taking the hill. Most of the 10th supported by elements of the 24th and 25th colored infantry on the left would take San Juan Hill, which was the main Spanish defensive position with several block houses. The 10th held the center position between the two hills and when they went forward the command would be split headed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> both hills.|$|R

25|$|Once again, the St. Francis {{reservoir}} level rose, although not without incident. Late {{in the year}} a fracture was noticed which began at the western abutment and ran diagonally upwards and toward the center section for a distance. As with others, Mulholland inspected it, judged it to be another contraction crack and ordered it filled with oakum and grouted to seal off any seepage. At the same time another fracture appeared in a corresponding position on the eastern portion of the dam, starting at the crest near the last spillway section and running downward at an angle for sixty-five feet before ending at the hillside. It too was sealed in the same manner. Both of these fractures were noted to be wider at their junction with the hillside abutments and narrowed as they angled <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the dam.|$|E
25|$|Archaeoceti is a parvorder {{comprising}} ancient whales. These ancient {{whales are}} the predecessors of modern whales, stretching {{back to their}} first ancestor that spent their lives near (rarely in) the water. Likewise, the archaeocetes can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete {{is the presence of}} visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes include the hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone which occurred with Ambulocetus 49 million years ago, a streamlining of the body and the growth of flukes on the tail which occurred around 43 million years ago with Protocetus, the migration of the nasal openings <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cranium and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers which occurred with Basilosaurus 35 million years ago, and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs which took place with the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 million years ago. The modern dolphin skeleton has two small, rod-shaped pelvic bones thought to be vestigial hind limbs. In October 2006, an unusual bottlenose dolphin was captured in Japan; it had small fins on each side of its genital slit, which scientists believe to be an unusually pronounced development of these vestigial hind limbs.|$|E
25|$|The 10th {{had held}} the center {{position}} between the two hills and when they went forward they split <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two hills. Lieutenant Ord started the regulars forward on the American left and Roosevelt claimed he started the charge on the right.

A legend was started that the Rough Riders alone took Kettle Hill, {{but this is not}} true. Sergeant George Berry (10th Cavalry) took his unit colors and that of the 3rd Cavalry to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Kettle Hill before the Rough Rider's flag arrived. This is supported in the writings of Pershing, who fought with Sergeant Conley and the 10th on Kettle Hill. and later led the American Expeditionary Force during the First World War.|$|R

50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of hard sulfation, conventional VRLA batteries should therefore be discharged at specific rates, determined by various charging algorithms. REF Furthermore, they must be frequently refreshed and are most suited to operation <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SoC (between 80% and 100% charged). REF While operating in this limited state of charge mitigates permanent sulfation on the negative electrode, battery operation exclusively at or near a full SoC is highly inefficient. REF The inefficiency is largely due to increases the incidence of side reactions (for instance electrolysis) which dissipate energy.|$|R

50|$|The fell is {{wide and}} sprawling, with six ridges leaving the summit area. The main summit sprouts four to {{the points of}} the compass.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{structure of}} an active region is determined from observations with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 2, 6, and 20 cm. This region exhibits a single magnetic loop of length approx. 10 to the 10 th power cm. The 2 cm radiation is mostly thermal bremsstrahlung and originates from the footpoints of the loop. The 6 and 20 cm radiation {{is dominated by the}} low harmonic gyroresonance radiation and originates from the upper portion of the legs or <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop. <b>The</b> loop broadens <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> apex. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop is not found to be the hottest point, but two temperature maxima {{on either side of the}} loop apex are observed, which is consistent with the model proposed for long loops. From 2 and 6 cm observations it can be concluded that the electron density and temperature cannot be uniform in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the loop; the density should decrease away from the axis of the loop...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the US, UK and many {{advanced}} economies have witnessed a sharp rise in wage and income inequality {{since the end of the}} 1970 s. Much of the evidence on this phenomenon has focused on the evolution of wage comparisons between different points in the wage distribution e. g. the 90 th- 10 th percentile wage differential. More recently, Atkinson, Piketty and Saez (2011) have emphasized how this evidence misses a significant part of the story, namely the remarkable rise in the share of income and wages taken by those <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> very <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution...|$|R
2500|$|Float type carburetors {{are able}} to {{compensate}} for these unstable conditions through various design features, but only within reason. For example, once the float type carburetor is under negative g conditions, such as a rapid nose down attitude, the float lifts <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the fuel bowl as the float becomes weightless when the aircraft descends faster than the float and the fuel. The float is [...] lifted upward by inertia, closing the fuel inlet valve as if the fuel bowl was full of fuel. Cutting off the fuel supply causes the fuel-air ratio to become greater than sixteen to one, which is then too lean for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|E
2500|$|A {{detachment}} of 66 {{men of the}} 1st Cavalry Regiment and 61 men of Company G under [...] of the 8th Cavalry had tracked the Apaches into the Chiricahua Mountains and eventually to an engagement what some called the [...] "Campaign of the Rocky Mesa." [...] The combined troops were led by Captain Reuben F. Bernard of the 1st Cavalry. The cool overcast day became [...] "a miserable day, cold with rain and hail, when the cavalrymen attacked."

2500|$|The {{platform}} featured an oak ticket {{booth and}} an oak-cased clock from the Self-Winding Clock Company of New York. Evidence of the now-demolished ticket booth is a Beaux Arts design engraved on the ceiling. The platform also features station tiling by Heins & LaFarge, {{who designed the}} station plaque in a sans-serif font. The walls are made of small white rectangular tiles, except for the bottom , which is marble. There are also fifteen ceramic plaques <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the platform wall, all of which depict a sloop in the New York Harbor to signify the station's location and use. The {{top of the wall}} also includes festooned garlands and station monograms, in addition to ceramic trim where the wall intersects the ceiling. The station artwork on the original exit's landing is a 1990 mural, [...] "South Sails", by former MTA Arts & Design director Sandra Bloodworth. During the 2004 Finding Of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the station, it was determined that the station was eligible for National Register of Historic Places status.|$|E
