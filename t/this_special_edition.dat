The European version was released the same year, but was called Independence War Special Edition instead since it was reasoned that 'deluxe' doesn't mean much to the French or German audiences.

25|$|Stage 3 of {{the series}} {{took place in a}} {{conventional}} TV studio. The 50 contestants were split into five groups of ten, each of whom sang one song for the judges, accompanied only by a piano. Each judge offered their opinion, {{and at the end of}} the pre-recorded show phone lines opened for votes. Later the same evening a live show followed in which the voting results were revealed, the top two earning a place in the final ten. In series 2, a wildcard round (an innovation that originated on American Idol) was added, in which the judges selected ten rejected contestants and gave them a second chance. In <b>this</b> <b>special</b> <b>edition,</b> one contestant, Susanne Manning, was selected by the viewer vote, and one, Sam Nixon, was chosen by the judges.
