The obtained data show the average increase of anthropometric parametres of the girls during the two-year period, that the average body height of the girls measured in 2012 was 133. 3 ± 5. 42 cm, and in 2014, 145. 2 ± 5. 71 cm.

Electronic and manual searches have been independently conducted by two investigators, up to February 2015. SRs and MAs on the dentoalveolar and skeletal effects of fixed expanders were included. The methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews). The design of the primary studies included in each SR/MA was assessed with the LRD (Level of Research Design scoring). The evidence for each outcome was rated applying a pre-determined scale. Twelve SRs/MAs were included. The AMSTAR scores ranged from 4 to 10. Two SRs/MAs included only RCTs. The current findings from SRs/MAs support with high evidence {{a significant increase in the}} short-term of maxillary dentoalveolar transversal dimensions after Rapid Maxillary Expansion (RME). The same effect is reported with moderate evidence after Slow Maxillary Expansion (SME). However, there is moderate evidence of a non-significant difference between the two expansion modalities concerning the short-term dentoalveolar effects. With both RME and SME, significant increase of skeletal <b>transversal</b> <b>dimension</b> in the short-term is reported, and the skeletal expansion is always smaller than the dentoalveolar. Even though dental relapse to some extent is present, long-term results of the dentoalveolar effects show an increase of the <b>transversal</b> <b>dimension,</b> supported by moderate evidence for RME and low evidence for SME.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} {{controlling}} {{of the group}} velocity dispersion in silicon (Si) strip waveguides, with refractive index engineered sub-wavelength grating (SWG) metamaterials, covered by silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) layer. This waveguide geometry is utilized for breaking the centrosymmetric nature of silicon and opening the route for second-order nonlinearities in the silicon-on-insulator technology. We show by calculations that attractive waveguide dispersion profiles over a broad spectral range can be flexibly tailored by proper control of <b>transversal</b> <b>dimensions</b> and appropriate refractive index engineering. Both normal and anomalous dispersion regimes can be obtained, being one important parameter for various nonlinear applications in photonics. Waveguide dispersion is an essential characteristic of nanophotonic structures and careful control of this property is of critical importance, playing significant role in development of photonic components using nonlinear processes [1].

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study maxillary arch width {{in adult}} {{patients}} with bilateral cleft lip and alveolus (BCLA) or with complete bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP), {{who have not}} had any surgery. SETTING AND SAMPLING POPULATION: Eighteen patients with BCLA, 13 patients with BCLP, and 24 controls from remote areas of Indonesia collected over 10 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dental casts were digitized three-dimensionally using an industrial coordinate measuring machine (CCM) (Zeiss Numerex; Carl Zeiss, Stuttgart, Germany). Transversal distance between molars was measured {{on the tip of}} the distobuccal cusp and the tip of the mesiobuccal cusp, and for premolars and canines, the tip of the buccal cusps was recorded. Means and standard deviations were calculated for all variables. t-Test was used to determine whether the mean values of the cleft groups showed significant differences from each other and from the controls. Level of significance was set at p < 0. 05. RESULTS: <b>Transversal</b> arch <b>dimensions</b> in the BCLA group were comparable to the controls except at the canine level. Intercanine distance, which is close to the alveolar cleft, was 4. 3 mm (SE 1. 4) smaller in the BCLA group (p = 0. 002). In the BCLP group, a comparable pattern was found. At the canine level, mean transversal width was 7. 2 mm (SE 1. 9) smaller compared to the control group, but {{no significant differences were found}} in the other <b>transversal</b> <b>dimensions.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Small differences are found in <b>transversal</b> <b>dimensions</b> in patients with BCLA and BCLP compared to a control group.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of polyampholytes near a charged planar surface is studied {{by means of}} Monte Carlo simulations. The investigated polyampholytes are overall electrically neutral and made up of oppositely charged units (called blocks) that are highly charged and of the the same length. The influence of block length and substrate's surface-charge-density on the adsorption behavior is addressed. A detailed structural study, including local monomer concentration, monomer mean height, transversal chain size, interface-bond orientation correlation, is provided. It is demonstrated that adsorption is favored for long enough blocks and/or high enough Coulomb interface-ion couplings. By explicitly measuring the chain size in the bulk, it is shown that the charged interface induces either a swelling or a shrinkage of the <b>transversal</b> <b>dimension</b> of the chain depending, in a non trivial manner, on the block length.

40|$|Background Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) is a {{congenital}} disorder {{characterized by}} craniofacial malformation {{of one or}} {{both sides of the}} lower face. Since these anomalies are associated with soft-tissue deficiencies, corrective surgery is often difficult. Bone grafts have typically been used for augmentation, but distraction osteogenesis now offers an alternative for many craniofacial deficiencies, but there are few if any appropriate distraction devices and surgical procedures for the augmentation of craniofacial <b>transversal</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Methods The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a technique for guided augmentation of craniofacial <b>transversal</b> <b>dimensions</b> through distraction osteogenesis. We tested the efficacy of a prototype distractor, developed in collaboration with Medartis, using cadavers and demonstrated its application for the correction of the transverse dimension of the temporozygomatic region in a patient with Goldenhar syndrome. Results CT scans showed a 4 -mm transverse augmentation of the bony surface after 9 days and a 10 -mm increase after 30 days. Upon removal of the distractor (60 days after the first surgery) CT indicated good bony fusion and a stable result in the transverse plane. Six months after removal of the distractor, 3 D computed tomography confirmed the success of the transverse augmentation, as it appeared to be stable and reliable. Conclusions Distraction osteogenesis, using our device, can be used to correct the transverse dimension of the temporozygomatic region in HFM patients. It should also be considered for the correction of residual postsurgical skeletal deficiency due to surgical relapse or deficient growth, and unsatisfactory skeletal contour. © 2013 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

We describe its implementation as an asymptotically consistent reference model matched to the low-energy effective theory. We show examples of typical observables of vector-boson scattering at the LHC in our unitarized framework.
