5|$|The {{success of}} Yip and Laurentia Tan, who won two bronze medals in equestrian events, sparked public {{debate about the}} {{treatment}} and recognition of disabled athletes in Singapore. Letters to The Straits Times criticised the poor coverage of the Paralympics. Many Singaporeans also commented about <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> <b>of</b> the cash awards handed out by the government: S$1,000,000 for an Olympic gold and S$100,000 for a Paralympic gold. When the issues were raised in Parliament, MCYS parliamentary secretary Teo Ser Luck promised to study plans to give disabled athletes greater support and to include them in sporting programmes such as Project 0812, a training programme for top Singaporean sportspeople. Two months later, the cash rewards for Paralympic medals were doubled and funding for the Singapore National Paralympic Council was increased.|$|E

In an effort to objectively reflect <b>the</b> urban-rural <b>disparities</b> <b>of</b> ECE in China, the data for further calculation and analysis are from China Population & Employment Statistical Yearbook and China Education Statistical Yearbook, which were published by Chinese official agencies - Chinese official websites of Ministry of Education and National Bureau of Statistics. All tables consisted of annual statistics and corresponding ratio calculation. The data are presented in the following three parts: ECE opportunities, ECE process, and ECE results. <b>The</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>of</b> educational opportunities are measured {{by the number of}} kindergartens, the number of children in kindergartens, and enrollment rates. <b>The</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>of</b> educational process are measured by teachers’ allocation, qualification, professional titles, and kindergarten conditions, including floor space, recreational space, outdoor space, and books.

25|$|The {{disparity}} between the most and least populous states has grown since the Connecticut Compromise, which granted each state {{two members of the}} Senate and at least one member of the House of Representatives, for a total minimum of three presidential Electors, regardless of population. In 1787, Virginia had roughly ten times the population of Rhode Island, whereas today California has roughly 70 times the population of Wyoming, based on the 1790 and 2000 censuses. This means some citizens are effectively two orders of magnitude better represented in the Senate than those in other states.

25|$|Tsujita and Westermann {{defended the}} idea of {{punctured}} ammonite shells as mosasaur prey in a contrarian position to the several 1998 papers that doubted this hypothesis. Based on a survey of Placenticeras shells from the Bearpaw Formation of Alberta, they concluded that the arrangements of the holes were too similar to the placement of teeth in a mosasaur's jaw to be the chance result of limpet activity. Their doubts were bolstered by <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> <b>of</b> abundance in the relevant rocks between the scarce limpet shells and the frequent occurrence of the holes themselves. According to Tsujita and Westermann, the previous attempts to test {{the effect of a}} mosasaur bite on a shell experimentally with a simulated jaw assumed an overly simplistic interpretation of mosasaur feeding behavior, so its failure to replicate the shell punctures still did not discredit their putative mosasaurian origins.|$|E
25|$|The most vexed {{issues of}} {{independent}} Malaysia were education and <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> <b>of</b> economic power among the ethnic communities. The Malays felt {{unhappy with the}} wealth of the Chinese community, even after the expulsion of Singapore. Malay political movements emerged based around this. However, since there was no effective opposition party, these issues were contested mainly within the coalition government, which won all but one seat in the first post-independence Malayan Parliament. The two issues were related, since the Chinese advantage in education played a large part in maintaining their control of the economy, which the UMNO leaders were determined to end. The MCA leaders were torn between the need to defend their own community's interests and the need to maintain good relations with UMNO. This produced a crisis in the MCA in 1959, in which a more assertive leadership under Lim Chong Eu defied UMNO over the education issue, only to be forced to back down when Tunku Abdul Rahman threatened to break up the coalition.|$|E

40|$|Disparity {{estimation}} can be {{used for}} eliminating redundancies between different views of an object or a scene recorded by an array of cameras which are arranged both horizontally and vertically. However, estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> vectors is a highly time consuming process which takes most of the operation time of the multi-view video coding. Therefore, either the amount of data that is to be processed or the complexity of the coding method needs to be decreased in order to encode the multi-view video in a reasonable time. It is proven that <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>of</b> a point in the scene photographed by cameras which are spaced equidistantly are equal. Since there is a strong geometrical correlation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> vectors, <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> vector <b>of</b> a view can for most blocks be derived from <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> vector <b>of</b> another view or views. A new algorithm is presented that reduces the amount of processing time needed for calculating <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> vectors <b>of</b> each neighboring view except the principal ones. Different schemes are proposed for 3 * 3 views and they are applied to several image sequences taken from a camera-array. The experimental results show that the proposed schemes yield better results than the reference scheme while preserving the image quality and the amount of encoded data...|$|R

To answer this question five observers adjusted <b>the</b> horizontal <b>disparity</b> <b>of</b> a probe until it was perceived at the same depth as the disparate line behind the aperture.

The method consists in exploiting the matching results obtained in one stereo pair (frame) for computing <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> map <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following stereo pair. This {{can be achieved by}} finding a temporal relationship, which we named association, between consecutive frames. <b>The</b> <b>disparity</b> range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current frame is deduced from <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> map <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding frame and the association between the two frames. Dynamic programming technique is considered for matching the image features. The proposed approach is tested on virtual and real stereo image sequences and the results are satisfactory.
