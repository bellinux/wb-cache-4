Sometimes it is also called fine grinding or surface grinding using planetary kinematics.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} {{grinding}} quality of robotic belt grinding {{systems for the}} workpieces with complex shaped surfaces, new concepts of the dexterity grinding point and the dexterity grinding space are proposed and their mathematical descriptions are defined.

Based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, a strategy <b>to</b> optimize the <b>grinding</b> robot structural dimensions and position with respect <b>to</b> the <b>grinding</b> wheel is put forward to obtain the necessary dexterity <b>grinding</b> space. Finally, <b>to</b> <b>grind</b> <b>an</b> aerial engine blade, a dedicated PPPRRR (P: prismatic R: rotary) grinding robot structural dimensions and position with respect <b>to</b> the <b>grinding</b> wheel are optimized using the above strategy.
