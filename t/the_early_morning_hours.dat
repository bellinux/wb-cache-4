5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> of December 13, 1977, a {{dormitory}} fire killed ten female residents of Aquinas Hall. Meanwhile, {{the demographics of}} the student body continued to change, as women outnumbered men in incoming classes and non-Rhode Island students soon outnumbered in-state students. In 1984, Peterson also opened St. Thomas Aquinas Priory at the entrance of campus to accommodate the growing number of Dominican brethren living on campus.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> of November 21, 1970, a dynamite-fueled bomb {{exploded}} underneath the portico, doing $170,000 in damage. Though {{no one was}} injured, windows were blown out, the Council Chamber (located above the blast) was damaged, all of the columns of the portico were damaged and replaced, and the Liberty Bell replica was a complete loss.

25|$|Additional damage {{occurred}} about 50 miles (80km) southeast in Anaheim as {{the scoreboard}} at Anaheim Stadium collapsed onto several hundred seats. The stadium was vacant at the time. Although several commercial buildings also collapsed, {{loss of life}} was minimized because of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hour</b> of <b>the</b> quake, and because it also occurred on a federal holiday (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day). Also, because of known seismic activity in California, area building codes dictate that buildings incorporate structural design intended to withstand earthquakes. However, the damage caused revealed that some structural specifications did not perform as intended. Because of these revelations, building codes were revised. Some structures were not red-tagged until months later, because damage was not immediately evident.|$|R

5|$|In {{southern}} Oklahoma City {{and surrounding}} communities, strong straightline winds caused damage to several buildings and downed trees and power lines in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> of May 7, with cleanup efforts being complicated due to flooding rains accompanying the storm. About 11,000 homes were without power during the event. There were also reports of floods across {{many other areas}} in Oklahoma. Oklahoma Governor Brad Henry had {{declared a state of}} emergency for all 77 counties across the state due to all the severe weather including the tornadoes, the flash floods and hail.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{squall line}} that {{developed}} from near Dallas to Kansas City moved eastward throughout the late evening and overnight hours causing numerous reports of damaging wind {{along with many}} spin-up tornadoes from Louisiana to Ohio and Indiana. It then moved through the southeast U.S. during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hours.</b> Additional strong thunderstorms developed ahead of the front across the southeast during the overnight and early morning hours.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 May (thirteen hours after the event), Stalin was {{informed}} of Hitler's suicide. General Hans Krebs had given this information to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov when they met at 04:00 on 1 May, when the Germans attempted to negotiate acceptable surrender terms. Stalin demanded unconditional surrender and asked for confirmation that Hitler was dead. He wanted Hitler's corpse found. In <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. Down in the Führerbunker, General Krebs and General Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig-Holstein {{fired the}} first shots of World War II when she bombarded the Polish base at Danzig's Westerplatte in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> of 1 September 1939. The ship {{was used as}} a {{training}} vessel {{for the majority of the}} war, and was sunk by British bombers in Gotenhafen in December 1944. Schleswig-Holstein was subsequently salvaged and then beached for use by the Soviet Navy as a target. As of 1990, the ship's bell was on display in the Bundeswehr Military History Museum in Dresden.|$|E
5|$|The Aurigids are {{normally}} a placid Class II meteor shower that peaks in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> of September 1, beginning on August 28 every year. Though the maximum zenithal hourly rate is 2–5 meteors per hour, the Aurigids are fast, with an entry velocity of /sec. The annual Aurigids have a radiant located about two degrees north of Theta Aurigae, a third-magnitude {{star in the}} center of the constellation. The Aurigids end on September 4. Some years, the maximum rate has reached 9–30 meteors per hour.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that approximately 20% of vehicle accidents have sleep deprivation as a cause. Between 1989 and 1993, it {{has been estimated}} that an average of 1,544 people were killed annually in the US as a result of sleep-deprived driving. Accidents related to sleep deprivation are most likely to happen in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> to midafternoon, and in <b>the</b> very <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hours.</b> Sleep deprivation was blamed a major cause of the Selby rail crash in which 10 people died and 82 were injured.|$|R
40|$|In {{many urban}} {{buildings}} ventilation {{is not sufficient}} that will increase the temperature and also create unhealthy atmosphere inside the room. In such buildings artificially induced ventilation through freely available energy promote comfort conditions by reducing the temperature by 2 to 3 °C and also creating good circulation of fresh air inside the room. In the present work the concept of improving the ventilation by excess hot energy available during summer days from the solar flat plate collector and by storing cool energy available during <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hour</b> in <b>the</b> Phase Change Material (PCM) based storage system is attempted. An experimental setup is made to study the effect of improvement in natural ventilation {{and the results are}} reported. A visible reduction in temperature is observed through circulation of air from the bottom side of the room to the roof of the house using the stored hot and cool energy. A CFD analysis is also carried out using ANSYS-CFX software to simulate and evaluate the mass flow of air at the inlet and at the selected RTD location by matching the transient temperature profile of the simulated result with the experimental results at the selected RTD location...|$|R
50|$|The area in {{and around}} the {{basilica}} begins to crowd with lights, fireworks and indigenous people dancing starting at dusk on December 11 and goes on all night and into the next day.
