5|$|The calls {{given by}} flocks near the {{breeding}} areas are typical swift screams, including a trilled tsiririri or harsher spee-eer.

5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E

5|$|Life in {{proximity}} to humans and other domestic animals {{has led to}} a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E
5|$|The {{evening of}} April 6 was a dispiriting {{end to the}} first day of one of the bloodiest battles in American history. <b>The</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> wounded and dying men on the fields between the armies could be heard in the Union and Confederate camps {{throughout}} the night. Exhausted Confederate soldiers bedded down in the abandoned Union camps. The Union troops were pushed back to the river and the junction of the River (Hamburg–Savannah Road) and the Corinth-Pittsburg Landing Roads. Around 10 p.m. a thunderstorm passed through the area. Coupled with the continuous shelling from the Union gunboats Lexington and Tyler, it made the night a miserable experience for both sides.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-level}} {{delegation of}} the Soviet Central Committee flew to Poland {{in an attempt}} to block removing pro-Soviet members of Politburo mainly Soviet and Polish Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. Soviet delegation was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Ivan Konev, and others. The negotiations were tense; both Polish and Soviet troops were put on alert, engaged in 'manoeuvres', and were used as thinly veiled threats. The Polish leadership {{made it clear that the}} face of communism had to become more nationalized; no longer could the Soviet Union directly control the Polish people. Here, Khrushchev's speech worked against him. During Stalinism, the Soviet Union had placed Moscow-friendly Poles, or Russians themselves, in important political positions in Poland. After denouncing Stalinism so vehemently in his speech, Khrushchev could not regress to the Stalinist position by forcing more Russians into the Polish leadership. The Poles, in recognizing <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> the public, needed to keep the Soviets from direct control but could not raise their demands to a point that endangered their relationships in the bloc. Gomułka demanded increased autonomy and permission to carry out some reforms but also reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning communism or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pressured by the Chinese to accommodate the Polish demands and were increasingly distracted by the events in Hungary. Eventually, when Khrushchev was reassured that Gomułka would not alter the basic foundations of Polish communism, he withdrew the invasion threat and agreed to compromise, and Gomułka was confirmed in his new position.|$|E

5|$|Instability and {{violence}} marked the family: it moved frequently, {{and much of}} Lépine's early childhood was spent in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, where his father was working for a Swiss mutual funds company. The family returned to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock market crash led {{to the loss of}} much of the family's assets. Rachid was an authoritarian, possessive and jealous man, frequently violent towards his wife and his children. He had contempt for women and believed that they were intended only to serve men. He required his wife to act as his personal secretary, slapping her if she made any errors in typing, and forcing her to retype documents in spite of <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> their toddler. He was also neglectful and abusive towards his children, particularly his son, and discouraged any tenderness, as he considered it spoiling. In 1970, following an incident in which Rachid struck Gamil so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, his mother decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976. Following the separation, Gamil lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Rachid defaulted on mortgage payments. Gamil was afraid of his father, and at first saw him on weekly supervised visits. The visits ended quickly, as Rachid ceased contact with his children soon after the separation. Gamil never again saw his father, and in the future refused to discuss him with others.|$|E
5|$|The year 1912 saw {{a marked}} {{increase}} in militant action in Wales. Anger at {{the defeat of}} the Conciliation Bills saw the WPSU disrupt a speech by Lloyd George at the Pavilion in Caernarfon. The protesters, male and female, were treated harshly with clothes torn and hair ripped out and were beaten by sticks and umbrellas. Later that year Lloyd George was again heckled by suffragettes whilst delivering a speech at the National Eisteddfod. Just two weeks later {{one of the most notorious}} events in the history of suffrage in Wales took place, when Lloyd George returned to his home town of Llanystumdwy to open the village hall. No sooner had he started speaking than he was interrupted by <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> 'Votes for Women!' The hecklers were violently assaulted by the crowd. One was stripped to the waist before being rescued and another was almost thrown off a bridge to be dashed on the rocks of the River Dwyfor below. As trouble was anticipated the national press was present and the Daily Mirror and Illustrated London News devoted a full page of photographs to the incident. The local press not only attacked the suffragettes, but poured scorn on the crowd for tarnishing the image of a peaceful, Nonconformist, chapel-going Wales. The event is seen as the most dramatic event in the history of Women's suffrage in Wales.|$|E

Up to 1850 the chambers were shown to visitors after which time the ecclesiastical authorities of Avignon decided to shut them down.

Once more, Amitābha comes to his aid and invests him with a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering multitudes.|$|E

25|$|Several Hindu stories present {{alternate}} {{aspects of}} Parvati, {{such as the}} ferocious, violent aspect as Shakti and related forms. Shakti is pure energy, untamed, unchecked and chaotic. Her wrath crystallizes into a dark, blood-thirsty, tangled-hair Goddess with an open mouth and a drooping tongue. This goddess is usually identified as the terrible Mahakali or Kali (time). In Linga Purana, Parvati metamorphoses into Kali, on the request of Shiva, to destroy a female asura (demoness) Daruka. Even after destroying the demoness, Kali's wrath could not be controlled. To lower Kali's rage, Shiva appeared as a crying baby. <b>The</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> the baby raised the maternal instinct of Kali who resorts back to her benign form as Parvati.|$|E
25|$|Blue jays {{can make}} a large variety of sounds, and {{individuals}} may vary perceptibly in their calling style. Like other corvids, they may learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is. Their voice is typical of most jays in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost gull-like scream. There is also a high-pitched jayer-jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting chick-ah-dee-ee. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to mob potential predators such as hawks and drive {{them away from the}} jays' nests.|$|E
25|$|Zeus, {{pressed by}} <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> <b>of</b> the hungry people {{and by the}} other deities who also heard their anguish, forced Hades to return Persephone. However, it was a rule of the Fates that whoever {{consumed}} food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Before Persephone was released to Hermes, who {{had been sent to}} retrieve her, Hades tricked her into eating pomegranate seeds, (either six or four according to the telling) which forced her to return to the underworld for some months each year. She was obliged to remain with Hades for six or four months (one month per seed) and lived above ground with her mother {{for the rest of the}} year. This left a long period of time when Demeter was unhappy due to Persephone's absence, neglecting to cultivate the earth. When Persephone returned to the surface, Demeter became joyful and cared for the earth again.|$|E
