5|$|The Polish Army {{pushed back}} {{and came in}} contact with <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> in the contested Suwałki Region. The {{diplomatic}} negotiations broke down. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> claimed to be defending their borders, while Poland did not recognize the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> had no rights to these territories. Poland also accused <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> of collaborating with the Soviets and thus violating the declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. In the ensuing hostilities, the towns of Suwałki, Sejny, and Augustów changed hands frequently. The diplomatic struggle, both directly between the two states and in the League of Nations, intensified.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> did {{not have}} a list of PMO members, they did not arrest the main leaders. Also, provincial PMO {{branches}} remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt for the end of September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded in convincing Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, to transfer the PMO document archive to <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians.</b> On September 21, <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> obtained a full list of PMO members and supporters and arrested them in the following days. The PMO branch in Lithuania ceased to function and was liquidated.|$|E
5|$|After Vytautas' {{death in}} 1430, Lithuania became embroiled in {{internal}} wars and conflicts with Poland.

5|$|Hostilities {{over the}} Suwałki Region resumed in summer 1920. When the Polish Army began to retreat {{during the course}} of the Polish–Soviet War, <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> moved to secure what they claimed to be their new borders, set by the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of July 1920. The Peace Treaty granted Sejny and {{surrounding}} area to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|After the Sejny Uprising, a Polish {{revolt against}} the Lithuanian {{authorities}} {{in one of the}} disputed border regions, Lithuanian intelligence intensified its investigation of the Polish minority and sympathizers in Lithuania, and uncovered the planned coup. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanians,</b> not knowing the membership of the PMO, arrested numerous Polish activists and destabilized the PMO network enough to prevent the coup attempt. Later the full membership list was obtained and the PMO in Lithuania was dissolved. The coup further strained Polish–Lithuanian relations.|$|E
5|$|After {{the last}} Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, both <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> and the Poles {{attempted}} to restore their independence. Lithuanians rebelled during the 1830 November Uprising and the 1863 January Uprising, but their first real opportunity arose when both Russia and Germany were weakened during World War I.|$|E

5|$|In any event, <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> {{were not}} {{prepared}} to accept Christianity, and Mindaugas's baptism had little impact on further developments. The {{majority of the population}} and the nobility remained pagan; his subjects were not required to convert. The cathedral he had built in Vilnius was superseded by a pagan temple, and all the diplomatic achievements made after his coronation were lost, although the practice of Christianity and intermarriage were well tolerated.|$|E
5|$|The conference {{began in}} the evening of September 29, 1920. The Polish {{delegation}} was led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz (who originated from Lithuania), and the Lithuanian delegation by general Maksimas Katche. Lithuania proposed an immediate armistice, but the Polish delegation refused. Only after the Lithuanian delegation threatened to leave the negotiation table did Poland agree to stop fighting, but only {{to the east of}} the Neman River (the Suwałki Region). Fighting {{to the west of the}} river continued. The Polish delegates demanded that <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> allow the Polish forces to use a portion of the Warsaw– Saint Petersburg Railway and the train station in Varėna (Orany). <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> refused: their major forces were concentrated in the Suwałki Region and moving them to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult. The Lithuanian side was ready to give up the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|Casimir III of Poland urged Louis to {{intervene}} in his war with <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> who had occupied Brest, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and other important towns in Halych and Lodomeria in the previous years. The two monarchs agreed that Halych and Lodomeria would {{be integrated into the}} Kingdom of Hungary after Casimir's death. Casimir also authorized Louis to redeem the two realms for 100,000 florins if Casimir fathered a son. Louis led his army to Cracow in June 1351. Because Casimir fell ill, Louis became the sole commander of the united Polish and Hungarian army. He invaded the lands of the Lithuanian prince, Kęstutis, in July. Kęstutis seemingly accepted Louis's suzerainty on 15 August and agreed to be baptised, along with his brothers, in Buda. However, Kęstutis did nothing to fulfill his promises after Polish and Hungarian troops were withdrawn. In an attempt to capture Kęstutis, Louis returned, but he could not defeat <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians,</b> who even killed one of his allies, Boleslaus III of Płock, in battle. Louis returned to Buda before 13 September. A papal legate visited Louis to persuade him to wage war against Stefan Dušan, Emperor of the Serbs, who had forced his Roman Catholic subjects to be re-baptised and join the Serbian Orthodox Church.|$|E
5000|$|On February 7, 1932, a fund {{to support}} Lithuanians in foreign {{countries}} was established in Lithuania, making {{one of the first}} attempts to maintain closer ties between <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> diaspora and Lithuania. Three years later <b>the</b> first <b>Lithuanian</b> World Congress was held in Kaunas, which established <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> World Union. <b>The</b> mission of <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> World Union, also drafted during the Congress, called for a cultural and economic union of Lithuanians in different countries. However World War II and Lithuania's occupation interrupted the work. Many educated Lithuanians fled to western countries, hoping to avoid approaching Soviet repressions. In 1946 <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> community in Germany established <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Deportees Community, which aimed at consolidating and helping Lithuanians in Germany.

5|$|In late 1401, the new {{war against}} the Order {{overstretched}} the resources of <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians,</b> who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of Władysław's brothers, the malcontent Švitrigaila, chose this moment to stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke. On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in Marienburg, where he won {{the backing of the}} Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Mindaugas and his {{antagonist}} Daniel {{reached a}} reconciliation in 1255; the Black Ruthenian lands {{were transferred to}} Roman, Daniel's son. Afterwards Mindaugas's son Vaišvilkas received baptism {{as a member of}} the Orthodox faith, becoming a monk and later founding a convent and monastery. Tautvilas's antagonism was temporarily resolved when he recognized Mindaugas's superiority and received Polatsk as a fiefdom. A direct confrontation with the Mongols occurred in 1258 or 1259, when Berke Khan sent his general Burundai to challenge Lithuanian rule, ordering Daniel and other regional princes to participate. The Novgorod Chronicle describes the following action as a defeat of <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians,</b> but it has also been seen as a net gain for Mindaugas.|$|E
5|$|Pope Innocent IV {{supported}} Mindaugas, {{hoping that}} a new Christian state could stem the inroads being made by the Golden Horde, {{a state of the}} Mongol Empire. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial papal bulls. One of them ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and to build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope. This was a welcome development to <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians,</b> since they were concerned that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too much control over the new state.|$|E

5|$|Tautvilas, Edivydas, and Vykintas {{formed a}} {{powerful}} coalition with the Samogitians, the Livonian Order, Daniel of Galicia (Tautvilas and Edivydas' brother-in-law), and Vasilko of Volhynia {{in opposition to}} Mindaugas. Only Poles, invited by Daniel, declined {{to take part in}} the coalition against <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians.</b> The dukes of Galicia and Volhynia managed to gain control over Black Ruthenia, an area ruled by Mindaugas' son Vaišvilkas. Tautvilas traveled to Riga, where he was baptized by the Archbishop. In 1250, the Order organized two major raids, one against Nalša land and the other against the domains of Mindaugas and those parts of Samogitia that still supported him.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} of the union {{was to create a}} common state under Władysław Jagiełło, but the ruling oligarchy of Poland learned that their goal of incorporating Lithuania into Poland was unrealistic. Territorial disputes led to warfare between Poland and Lithuania or Lithuanian factions; <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> at times even found it expedient to conspire with the Teutonic Knights against the Poles. Geographic consequences of the dynastic union and the preferences of the Jagiellonian kings instead created a process of orientating Polish territorial priorities to the east.|$|E

5|$|The {{uprising}} {{contributed to}} {{the deterioration of the}} Polish–Lithuanian relations and further discouraged <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> from joining Piłsudski's proposed Międzymorze federation. The Sejny Uprising doomed the Polish plan to overthrow the Lithuanian government in a coup d'état. After the uprising, the Lithuanian police and intelligence intensified their investigation of Polish sympathizers and soon uncovered the planned coup. They made mass arrests of Polish activists from August 27 to the end of September 1919. During the investigations, lists of PMO supporters were found; law enforcement completely suppressed the organisation in Lithuania, arresting members.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from the League of Nations, Poland agreed to negotiate, hoping to buy time and divert attention from the upcoming Żeligowski's Mutiny. <b>The</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> sought to achieve as much protection for Vilnius as possible. The agreement resulted in a ceasefire and established a demarcation line running through the disputed Suwałki Region up to the Bastuny railway station. The line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to Vilnius. Although neither Vilnius or the surrounding region was explicitly addressed in the agreement, numerous historians have described the agreement as allotting Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Vytautas, {{supported}} by a few Polish banners, started {{an assault on the}} left flank of the Teutonic forces. After more than an hour of heavy fighting the Lithuanian light cavalry began a full retreat. Jan Długosz described this development as a complete annihilation of the entire Lithuanian army. According to Długosz, the Knights assumed that victory was theirs, broke their formation for a disorganized pursuit of the retreating Lithuanians and gathered much loot before returning to the battlefield to face the Polish troops. He made no mention of <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians,</b> who later returned to the battlefield. Thus Długosz portrayed the battle as a single-handed Polish victory. This view contradicted Cronica conflictus and has been challenged by modern historians. Starting with an article by Vaclaw Lastowski in 1909, they proposed that the retreat was a planned, strategic maneuver borrowed from the Golden Horde. A false retreat was used in the Battle of the Vorskla River of 1399, where the Lithuanian army was dealt a crushing defeat and Vytautas himself barely escaped alive. This theory gained wider acceptance after the discovery and publication of a German letter by Swedish historian Sven Ekdahl in 1963. The letter, written a few years after the battle, cautions the new Grand Master to look out for false retreats of the kind that were used in the Great Battle. Stephen Turnbull asserted that the Lithuanian retreat did not quite fit the tried formula of a false retreat. Such a retreat was usually staged by one or two units (as opposed to almost an entire army) and was swiftly followed by a counterattack (whereas <b>the</b> <b>Lithuanians</b> returned late in the battle).|$|E
