5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> singly or in groups, and can be programmed <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{minor in}} {{southeast}} North Carolina. Moderate winds inflicted isolated shingle and siding damage along barrier islands. The winds downed several trees, some onto cars and houses. Brief power outages were also reported. Beach erosion damaged a bridge in Bald Head Island, as well. In Chowan County, a business {{parking lot was}} under several feet of water due <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> flooding. One person was indirectly killed in Carteret County when trying to restore electricity.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed <b>to</b> <b>flash.</b> Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E

50|$|In order <b>to</b> stay near <b>Flash,</b> Connor volunteers <b>to</b> work in {{the stables}} for free, and after his house is boarded up by the bank, the Rutherford's groundskeeper gives him {{a room in the}} stables. Meanwhile, things for Flash do not go {{smoothly}} either. While Tad adores the horse, his father treats Flash very harshly while trying to train him as a racehorse, {{while at the same time}} berating Tad for not pushing him hard enough. Upset by this and longing for his father's approval, Tad whips flash many times, and after calming down he goes <b>to</b> see <b>Flash</b> <b>to</b> apologize. However, <b>Flash</b> responds in a defensive way, injuring Tad. Outraged, Alfred threatens <b>to</b> put <b>Flash</b> down, causing Connor <b>to</b> take <b>Flash</b> and run away.|$|R
5|$|Scott—still unsure who his {{ships were}} firing at, and {{afraid that they}} might be firing on his own destroyers—ordered a ceasefire at 23:47, {{although}} not every ship complied.

5|$|The game's {{score system}} {{is based on}} a {{multiplier}} bar and a hit gauge counter. As the player destroys enemy cores, the hit counter increases. Points awarded for destroyed cores are multiplied by the value of the hit counter. The counter decreases when the player stops destroying cores. However, if the multiplier reaches a certain amount it will begin <b>to</b> <b>flash,</b> awarding large point bonuses for any cores destroyed during this short period of time.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{spawned a}} tropical depression near the Lesser Antilles on August30, which quickly became Tropical Storm Ella. It quickly intensified {{in the eastern}} Caribbean into a hurricane by August31 while passing south of Puerto Rico; there, the outer rainbands caused some flooding that caused minor damage. On September1, Ella strengthened to winds of , {{as measured by the}} Hurricane Hunters. At that intensity, the hurricane passed just south of the Dominican Republic before making landfall in southwestern Haiti. In the Dominican Republic, heavy rainfall and floods caused $100,000 in damage, mostly in the country's southwestern portion. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding in southwestern Haiti, and thousands of people became homeless after their houses were damaged. Near Les Cayes, 30people were killed due <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> flooding.|$|E

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|Gotō's {{force was}} taken almost {{completely}} by surprise. At 23:43, Aobas lookouts sighted Scott's force, but Gotō assumed {{that they were}} Jojima's ships. Two minutes later, Aobas lookouts identified the ships as American, but Gotō remained skeptical and directed his ships <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> identification signals. As Aobas crew executed Gotō's order, the first American salvo smashed into Aobas superstructure. Aoba was quickly hit by up to 40 shells from Helena, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Farenholt, and Laffey. The shell hits heavily damaged Aobas communications systems and demolished two of her main gun turrets {{as well as her}} main gun director. Several large-caliber projectiles passed through Aobas flag bridge without exploding, but the force of their passage killed many men and mortally wounded Gotō.|$|E

5|$|Saguaro National Park {{lies within}} the {{watershed}} of the north-flowing Santa Cruz River, {{which is generally}} dry. Rincon Creek {{in the southern part}} of the RMD, free-flowing for at least part of the year, has the largest riparian zone in the park. The creek is a tributary of Pantano Wash, which crosses Tucson from southeast to northwest to meet Tanque Verde Wash. The two washes form the Rillito River, another dry wash, an east–west tributary of the Santa Cruz River. The washes in both districts are usually dry but are subject at times <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> floods. Smaller riparian zones are found near springs and tinajas in the RMD. The largest of the springs is at Manning Camp, high in the Rincons.|$|E
5|$|Universal Studios {{had held}} the {{production}} rights <b>to</b> <b>Flash</b> Gordon but allowed them to lapse. Former Universal executives Edward Gruskin and Matty Fox {{struck a deal with}} Flash Gordon owners King Features Syndicate to produce the first 26 episodes of the series. The series was produced by Gruskin and Wenzel Lüdecke. Writers for Flash Gordon included Gruskin, Bruce Geller and Earl Markham. Episodes were directed by Wallace Worsley, Jr. and Gunther von Fritsch. Composers Kurt Heuser and Roger Roger provided much of the original music.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{has some}} special {{considerations}} that affect tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Mountains {{to the west}} act as a perfect mechanism for upward motion during sustained east winds, which can lead <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> flooding and landslides in that region (e.g. Hurricane Camille). As a tropical system approaches from the south, a frontal zone sets up between the moist Atlantic Ocean and the drier landmass to the west. This boundary can set up {{two or three days}} in advance of a tropical storm, and can lead up to prolonged heavy rains across coastal sections (e.g. Hurricane Floyd). As the cyclone advances north, the boundary will slowly shift west, but progresses west of a Richmond/Washington, D.C. line.|$|E

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} was rebuilt in the 1820s. The {{light was}} fixed until 1906, {{when it was}} converted <b>to</b> <b>flashing,</b> and its power increased from 8,000 to 281,000 candela. It was converted to electrical power in 1976, automated in 1996 and is now monitored from Edinburgh.|$|R
5|$|When Kate {{struck the}} Florida Panhandle, {{it became the}} first {{hurricane}} to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people {{to lose their jobs}} in the weeks after the storm. Gusts over 100mph (160km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while the combination of wind and rain led to downed power poles. Across the remainder of the southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15fatalities and $700million in damage.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915, the aftermost barbette of the German {{flagship}} Seydlitz {{was struck}} by a British 13.5-inch shell from HMS Lion. The shell did not penetrate the barbette, but it dislodged a piece of the barbette armour that allowed the flame from the shell's detonation to enter the barbette. The propellant charges being hoisted upwards were ignited, and the fireball flashed up into the turret and down into the magazine, setting fire to charges removed from their brass cartridge cases. The gun crew tried to escape into the next turret, which allowed the flash to spread into that turret as well, killing the crews of both turrets. Seydlitz was saved from near-certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines, which had been effected by Wilhelm Heidkamp. This near-disaster was due to the way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both German and British battleships and battlecruisers, but the lighter protection on the latter made them more vulnerable to the turret or barbette being penetrated. The Germans learned from investigating the damaged Seydlitz and instituted measures to ensure that ammunition handling minimised any possible exposure <b>to</b> <b>flash.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2005 Pacific {{hurricane}} season continued {{the trend of}} generally below-average activity that began a decade prior. The season officially began on May15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June1 in the central Pacific; it lasted until November30 in both basins. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Activity began {{with the formation of}} Hurricane Adrian, the fourth-earliest-forming tropical storm on record in the basin at the time. Adrian led <b>to</b> <b>flash</b> flooding and several landslides across Central America, resulting in five deaths and $12 million (2005 USD) in damage. Tropical storms Calvin and Dora caused minor damage along the coastline, while Tropical Storm Eugene led to one death in Acapulco. In early October, Otis produced tropical storm-force winds and minor flooding across the Baja California peninsula. The remnants of Tropical Depression One-C in the central Pacific, meanwhile, caused minor impacts in Hawaii. The strongest storm of the period was Hurricane Kenneth, which attained peak winds of 130mph (215km/h) over the open Pacific. Cooler than average ocean temperatures throughout the year aided in below-average activity through the course of the season, which ended with 15 named storms, 7 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes, and an Accumulated cyclone energy index of 75 units.|$|E
