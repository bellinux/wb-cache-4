25|$|It was {{a period}} of {{violence}} from 1978. In March 1979 the Olinga home was robbed though the temple was undisturbed and there was a suspicious accident where Olinga's car was rammed and forced down a hill by a troop transport vehicle, where he was robbed and left for dead, and Olinga's son George was disappeared for a week by soldiers of Amin. Death threats perhaps simply because of his prominence came to Olinga from his home town. Meanwhile, after President Amin fled in April the religion began to re-organize - there was the re-opening of the Bahá'í House of Worship again, and the beginning of reforming the national assembly in August. Neighbors and a garden servant boy bore witness mostly by hearing events of the execution of the Olinga family. On the evening of Sunday, September 16, 1979, the birthday of one of Olinga's daughters and planned as a day of a family reunion of which a few could not arrive in time, after 8pm local time five soldiers entered Olinga's home while one stood guard at the household gate and killed Olinga, his wife, and three of their five children. Trails of blood went from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the house and one of the children had been hurt and roughly bandaged before the family was executed. Enoch himself was killed out in the yard where he had been heard weeping after perhaps witnessing his dead family in the very same house he had joined the religion in. The news was conveyed initially by the garden servant to {{a member of the national}} committee that had been appointed and then to a 79-year-old pioneer, Claire Gung, who called internationally. Ultimately news reached the Universal House of Justice while it sat in session on the 17th. All the dead were buried in the Bahá'í cemetery on the temple grounds on the 25th while civil war and terrorism continued. The funeral included hundreds of Bahá'ís who could make the trip and several members of the government of Uganda.|$|E
500|$|The large kitchens {{occupy the}} {{south-east}} {{angle of the}} castle. The [...] high main kitchen has two [...] wide fireplaces for cooking, and a circular vent in the vaulted ceiling. Hatches in the floor give access to a well ( [...] deep) and cellars below. The adjacent passage linked <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall in the east range.|$|E
2500|$|Just before World War I he {{championed the}} avant-garde artists Lucien Pissarro, Jacob Epstein, Augustus John and Wyndham Lewis. At {{the same time}} he founded, with other artists, the Camden Town Group of British painters, named from the {{district}} of London in which he lived. This group had been meeting informally since 1905, but was officially established in 1911. It was influenced by Post-Impressionism and Expressionism, but concentrated on scenes of often drab suburban life; Sickert himself said he preferred <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drawing room as a scene for paintings.|$|E

25|$|The {{builder of}} Major Hasbrouck's house formalized this, {{providing}} a facade with continuous horizontal lines uniting {{all the family}} spaces. There are none of the vertical interruptions seen on other stone houses. The stones chosen were carefully dressed, although not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point of making an ashlar pattern. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> wing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north was placed asymmetrically, to highlight its difference in function.|$|R
2500|$|In 1900 Edward Bok of the Curtis Publishing Company, bent on {{improving}} American homes, invited architects to publish designs in the Ladies' Home Journal, the plans of which readers could purchase for five dollars. Subsequently, the Wright design [...] "A Home in a Prairie Town" [...] {{was published in}} February 1901 and first introduced the term [...] "Prairie Home". The Martin House, designed in 1903, bears {{a striking resemblance to}} that design. The facades are almost identical, except for the front entrance, and the Martin House repeats most of the Journal House ground floor. An awkward failure was no direct connection from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dining room. The Journal House had a serving pantry, but Wright was forced to give this up to accommodate the pergola.|$|E
2500|$|Drink {{was seen}} to by the Cupbearer and the Royal Cupbearer. The first tasted of the drinks, poured them and ordered them; the second, upon {{receiving}} them from the former, served them to the King. A description of a 1596 banquet in the reign of King Sigismund III Vasa was set down by the secretary to the Papal Nuncio (ambassador), Giorgio Paolo Mucante: [...] "Each dish was first given, with a bow, by the Master of <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Carver, who passed it to the Pantler. The latter dipped a prepared piece of bread into the dish, touched it to his tongue, then discarded it into a nearby silver bin. It took quite a while before the King and the Cardinal could begin eating, as they had to bear with all the ceremonies. The Carver bowed so often that I truly think that during the feast he bowed at least 3,000 times." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adamson House is {{best known}} for its {{extensive}} use of locally produced Malibu tile. In 1926, May K. Rindge (Rhonda Rindge Adamson's mother) established a tileworks east of the Malibu Pier. The factory was run by Rufus Keeler, an innovative ceramic engineer, who worked with local artisans to design decorative art tile, employing more than 100 persons in the late 1920s and creating [...] "some of the most colorful and inventive glazed tiles in the country." [...] Hand-crafted art tile fired from local clay was specially designed for each room of the Adamson House. [...] Even the ceiling of one of the bathrooms was tiled. In 1930, the Los Angeles Times reported: [...] "Striking tile effects have been obtained from original designs of the craftsmen and artists of the pottery and floors, walls and patios." [...] Sixty-seven years later, the Los Angeles Times was still writing about the home's extraordinary tilework: [...] "This huge Spanish-style mansion, built in 1929 (sic), might as well be called the house that tile built. Tile is everywhere — from the ceramic wall clock above the tile-topped oak table in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor-to-ceiling tiled bathrooms." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} further emulates its rail model, with {{tables in}} booths {{along the east}} and west walls with a single aisle between them. The ceiling is also vaulted. The rear is mostly given over to counter and cooking space; it has no windows as a result, a deviation from the model. A later rear addition expands <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> facilities <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|R
5|$|Little archaeological {{evidence}} relates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> period immediately after <b>the</b> dissolution, or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tudor house built {{on part of}} the site. A sawpit {{was found in the}} outer courtyard. It is considered that this might date from the early period of the Brookes' house, or it may have been constructed during the later years of <b>the</b> abbey. <b>The</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the Tudor house and their drainage systems appear to have been used by the Brookes, and according to Brown and Howard-Davis, were possibly rebuilt by the family. The areas previously occupied by the cloisters and the guest quarters were probably used as middens. Few archaeological findings remain from the Georgian house, apart from a fragment of a wall from the south front, and the foundations of the north wing. The much-altered medieval undercroft still stands, with its Norman doorway and Victorian replica, barrel vaulting, wine bins, and blind arcading in the former outer parlour.|$|R
25|$|Elsewhere on {{the central}} hallway are guest {{bedrooms}} and bathrooms. Stairs lead from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> wing down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> partially finished basement. Copland and his assistants used the rooms there for archival and office purposes.|$|R

40|$|This text {{focuses on}} the {{cookbook}} and related “mundane practices” (Martens) {{within the context of}} the appropriation of high-tech equipment in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> discuss <b>the</b> power of the socialisation of gender. Our argument is that cookbooks can be a way <b>to</b> dissipate <b>the</b> old difficulties that men, particularly, face in the kitchen; and at the same time, their use (and misuse) reinforces the persistence of some gaps due to previous and unequal socialisation regarding cookery as a skill...|$|R
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>the</b> {{north of}} the {{buildings}} were at least two fishponds. <b>The</b> spring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south was channelled <b>to</b> supply <b>the</b> priory with water for <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> and <b>to</b> flush <b>the</b> reredorter or latrine, and also <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> ponds.|$|R

60|$|Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock {{grappled with}} Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, {{and there was}} a terrific battle all over <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> rabbits {{underneath}} it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.|$|E
2500|$|Ong (birth name: [...] Ong Yut Ning) {{was born}} in Canton, Guangdong, China to Ong Dao Lung, a United States born Chinese-American and Wong Shee.

Ong found work as a Cabin boy where he helped the cook in <b>the</b> ship's <b>kitchen</b> and carried buckets of food from <b>the</b> ship's <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forecastle where the ordinary seamen ate.|$|R
50|$|Adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{north-east}} {{corner of}} the building is a small toilet block which is a later addition and partially conceals the early rear wall of the dressing room. The northern elevation of the supper lounge is clad in patterned board sheeting which appears to be a later addition. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> supper lounge is clad in timber weatherboards. The northern elevation of the office and shop components has been substantially altered with concrete block additions.|$|R
50|$|A second smaller {{dormitory}} for the conventual officers {{ran from}} east to west.

60|$|The ghost thus happily laid, the {{department}} of Miss Peyton flourished; {{and by the time}} the afternoon's sun had traveled a two hours' journey from the meridian, the formal procession from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parlor commenced, under the auspices of Caesar, who led the van, supporting a turkey on the palms of his withered hands, with the dexterity of a balance master.|$|E

25|$|Through {{the middle}} gate is the Second Courtyard (II. Avlu), or Divan Square (Divan Meydanı). The {{courtyard}} was probably completed around 1465, {{during the reign}} of Mehmed II. It received its final appearance around 1525-1529 {{during the reign of}} Suleyman I. It is surrounded by the former palace hospital, bakery, Janissary quarters, stables, the imperial harem and Divan <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. At the end of the courtyard, the Gate of Felicity marks <b>the</b> entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Third Courtyard. Numerous artifacts from the Roman and Byzantine periods that have been found on the palace site during recent excavations, including sarcophagi, are on display in the Second Courtyard in front of <b>the</b> imperial <b>kitchens.</b> Located underneath <b>the</b> Second Courtyard is a cistern that dates to Byzantine times. During Ottoman times this courtyard would have been full of peacocks and gazelles. It was used as a gathering place for courtiers. The Sultan, seated on the gold-plated Bayram throne, used to hold audiences in the second courtyard. Some foreign dignitaries, including The French ambassador Philippe du Fresne-Canaye, have written accounts about these audiences.|$|R
50|$|In 1866 and 1874 Milne had {{acquired}} two blocks of land fronting Petrie Terrace (renamed Musgrave Road in 1888), and was recorded as resident {{on the site}} from the late 1860s. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> houses attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> present Warriston may be the original Milne residence.|$|R

6000|$|To eat home-cooked meals {{after years}} of dreadful {{restaurants}} gave me especial satisfaction, but alas! there was a flaw in my lute.
