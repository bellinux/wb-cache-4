In a later Sanskrit text, Sati creates a surrogate who burns herself, while the real Sati is reborn as Parvati.

Children often helped the adults, and performed chores (like fetching wood or water) that quickly escalated into full work responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|DV {{is among}} the most underreported crimes {{worldwide}} for both men and women. A 2011 review article by intimate partner violence researcher Ko Ling Chan found men tended to under-report their own perpetration of domestic violence while women were more likely to under-report their victimization and over-estimate their own violence perpetration. Financial or familial dependence, normalization of violence, and self-blaming were found to reduce the likelihood of self-reporting victimization in women. By contrast, fear and avoidance of legal consequences, the tendency to blame their partner, and a narrative focus on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>needs</b> and emotions reduced the likelihood of self-reporting perpetration in men.|$|E

However, Western Electric had been concentrating on the SCR-520 for mounting in the P-61 Black Widow, an enormous purpose-designed night fighter large enough to carry it. By this time the P-61 was greatly delayed and the USAAF had begun using Beaufighters and Mosquitoes for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>needs.</b> This led to demands by both the USAAF and RAF for the SCR-720 production to move up, and Western Electric responded by stating initial units would be available in May 1943, with production quantities available in August.|$|E
25|$|The Common Sayings Source {{is one of}} many {{theories}} that attempts to provide insight into the Synoptic Problem. The theory posits that the Gospel of Thomas, a sayings gospel, and the Q source, a hypothetical sayings gospel, have a common source. Elements of this Common Sayings Source {{can be found in the}} text of the Gospel of Thomas and what scholars are proposing existed in the Q source. The high level of similarities between the two sources suggests that both documents are later redactions of a single source, the original Common Sayings Source, which was then redacted by different groups to suit <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>needs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{high level}} of {{similarities}} leads Crossan {{to believe that there}} must have been a common source. Similar to the reasoning behind the two-document hypothesis for the existence of a Q source, the percentage of common material found in Thomas and Q would suggest an earlier source shared by the authors of both documents. However, unlike Q, the Common Sayings Source is presumed to be oral, due to a lack of common order or sequence. This is not to say that a written document is an impossibility. It is clear in the Synoptic Gospels that it was common for authors to edit works for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>needs,</b> including the slight change in the order or sequence.|$|E
