50|$|Metalworking <b>taps</b> and <b>dies</b> {{were often}} made by their users during the 18th and 19th centuries (especially if the user was skilled in toolmaking), using such tools as lathes and files for the shaping, and the smithy for {{hardening}} and tempering. Thus builders of, for example, locomotives, firearms, or textile machinery {{were likely to}} make their own <b>taps</b> and <b>dies.</b> During the 19th century the machining industries evolved greatly, and the practice of buying <b>taps</b> and <b>dies</b> from suppliers specializing in them gradually supplanted most such in-house work. Joseph Clement was one such early vendor of <b>taps</b> and <b>dies,</b> starting in 1828. With the introduction of more advanced milling practice in the 1860s and 1870s, tasks such as cutting a tap's flutes with a hand file became a thing of the past. In the early 20th century, thread-grinding practice went through significant evolution, further advancing {{the state of the art}} (and applied science) of cutting screw threads, including those of <b>taps</b> and <b>dies.</b>|$|R

This resulted in considerable cost savings, not only due to the reduction in inventories, but also the numbers of <b>taps,</b> <b>dies,</b> <b>tapping</b> and clearance drills that workshops held.|$|R

5000|$|Both tools {{can be used}} {{to clean}} up a thread, which is called chasing. However, using an {{ordinary}} <b>tap</b> or <b>die</b> to clean threads will generally result in the removal of some material, which will result in looser and weaker threads. Because of this, threads are typically cleaned using special <b>taps</b> and <b>dies</b> made for this purpose, which are known as [...] "chasers". Chasers are made of softer materials and are not capable of cutting new threads, however they are still tighter fitting than actual fasteners and are fluted like regular <b>taps</b> and <b>dies</b> (to provide a means for debris like dirt and rust to escape). One particularly common use is for automotive spark plug threads, which often suffer from corrosion and a buildup of carbon.|$|R

2500|$|All {{threading}} could feasibly be done using a single-point tool, {{but because}} of the high speed and thus low unit cost of other methods (e.g., <b>tapping,</b> <b>die</b> threading, and thread rolling and forming), single-point threading is usually only used when other factors of the manufacturing process happen to favor it (e.g., if only a few threads need to be made, if an unusual or unique thread is required, or if {{there is a need for}} very high concentricity with other part features machined during the same setup.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Threads may be milled with a {{rotating}} milling cutter if the correct helical toolpath can be arranged. This was formerly arranged mechanically, {{and it was}} suitable for mass-production work although uncommon in job-shop work. With the widespread dissemination of affordable, fast, precise CNC, it became much more common, and today internal and external threads are often milled even on work where they would formerly have been cut with <b>taps,</b> <b>die</b> heads, or single-pointing. Some advantages of thread milling, as compared to single-point cutting or <b>taps</b> and <b>dies,</b> are faster cycle times, less tool breakage, and that a left- or right-hand thread can be created with the same tool. Additionally, for large, awkward workpieces (such as a fire hydrant casting), it is simply easier to let the workpiece sit stationary on a table while all needed machining operations are performed on it with rotating tools, as opposed to rigging it up for rotation around the axis of each set of threads (that is, for the [...] "arms" [...] and [...] "mouth" [...] of the hydrant).|$|R

50|$|In 1795 the South Hadley Canal opened, {{enabling}} {{boats to}} bypass the South Hadley falls and reach Greenfield via the Connecticut River. Located at {{the confluence of the}} Deerfield and Green rivers, and not far from where they merge into the Connecticut River, Greenfield developed into a trade center. Falls provided water power for industry, and Greenfield grew into a prosperous mill town. John Russell established the Green River Works in 1834, hiring skilled German workers at what was the country's first cutlery factory. The Connecticut River Railroad was the first of several railways to enter the town, replacing the former canal trade. During the 19th and 20th centuries, Greenfield {{was one of the most}} important American centers of the <b>tap</b> and <b>die</b> business and was the home of Greenfield <b>Tap</b> & <b>Die</b> Company (GTD).|$|R

5000|$|Threads can be (and often are) {{truncated}} a bit more, yielding thread {{depths of}} 60 percent to 75 {{percent of the}} [...]65p value. For example, a 75 percent thread sacrifices {{only a small amount}} of strength in exchange for a significant reduction in the force required to cut the thread. The result is that <b>tap</b> and <b>die</b> wear is reduced, the likelihood of breakage is lessened and higher cutting speeds can often be employed.|$|R
50|$|The {{same year}} (1828), Clement began making fluted {{screw-cutting}} <b>tap</b> and <b>dies</b> and urged {{the adoption of}} a standard system of screw threads where every machine screw of a particular length should have a set number of threads of a predetermined pitch and determined the number of threads for each length. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement's journeymen afterwards {{played a major role in}} such standardisation, the Whitworth thread becoming a standard for machine screws.|$|R
50|$|<b>Taps</b> and <b>dies</b> are tools used {{to create}} screw threads, which is called threading. Many are cutting tools; others are forming tools. A tap is used to cut or form the female portion of the mating pair (e.g., a nut). A die is used to cut or form the male portion of the mating pair (e.g., a bolt). The process of cutting or forming threads using a tap is called tapping, whereas the process using a die is called threading.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a thread. The single-point cutting tools or <b>taps</b> and <b>dies</b> used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult. Square threads also cannot carry as much load as a trapezoidal thread, because {{the root of the}} square thread is smaller. Also, {{there is no way to}} compensate for wear on the nut, so it must be replaced when worn out.|$|R
50|$|Before this, {{screw threads}} were usually made by {{chipping}} and filing (that is, with skilled freehand use of chisels and files). Nuts were rare; metal screws, when made at all, were usually {{for use in}} wood. Metal bolts passing through wood framing to a metal fastening {{on the other side}} were usually fastened in non-threaded ways (such as clinching or upsetting against a washer). Maudslay standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of <b>taps</b> and <b>dies</b> that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size. This was a major advance in workshop technology.|$|R
5000|$|Tools {{may include}} cutting {{tools such as}} saws, axes and hatchets; {{mechanical}} advantage aids such as a pry bar or wrecking bar, ropes, pulleys, or a 'come-a-long" [...] hand-operated winch; construction tools such as pliers, chisels, a hammer, screwdrivers, a hand-operated twist drill, vise grip pliers, glue, nails, nuts, bolts, and screws; mechanical repair tools such as an arc welder, an oxy-acetylene torch, a propane torch with a spark lighter, a solder iron and flux, wrench set, a nut driver, a <b>tap</b> and <b>die</b> set, a socket set, and a fire extinguisher. As well, some survivalists bring barterable items such as fishing line, liquid soap, insect repellent, light bulbs, can openers, extra fuels, motor oil, and ammunition.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with <b>taps</b> and <b>dies.</b> Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. Therefore, in manual thread cutting, normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters. It {{may be necessary to}} periodically remove the tap from the hole to clear the chips, especially when a blind hole is threaded.|$|R
