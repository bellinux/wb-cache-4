5|$|A further fire {{broke out}} during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, {{so it would be}} better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> cause of the original explosion and fire.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, Sachsen {{joined the}} German fleet, which was tasked {{primarily}} with coastal defense against France and Russia, who were {{presumed to be}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> enemies in a continental war. In the early 1880s, heightened tensions with Russia prompted the naval command developed more offensively-minded contingencies. These {{formed the basis for}} the annual summer fleet maneuvers, in which Sachsen took part.|$|E

5|$|Ctenophores {{are found}} in most marine environments: from polar waters to the tropics; near coasts and in mid-ocean; from the surface waters to the ocean depths.

No ctenophores {{have been found in}} fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{can be used}} to generate tables or schedules matched to a diver's planned dive profile and breathing gas mixtures. The usual procedure is to generate schedules for the intended profile and for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> contingency profiles, such as slightly greater depth, delayed ascent and early ascent. Sometimes an emergency minimum decompression schedule and a more conservative schedule will be generated to allow the diver further options.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{is available for}} personal computers to model the decompression requirements of user specified dive profiles with different gas mixtures using a choice of decompression algorithms. Schedules generated by decompression software represent a diver's specific dive plan and breathing gas mixtures. It is usual to generate a schedule for the planned profile and for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> contingency profiles.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Jesper Milàn {{and colleagues}} {{described}} two coprolites (fossilised faeces) containing fish scales and bones. They {{were found in}} the Jydegaard Formation, the first such fossils found in Danish continental Mesozoic deposits. Although the producer of these faeces cannot be identified with certainty, marine turtles and dromaeosaurids such as Dromaeosauroides are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> candidates.|$|E
