25|$|Dawkins {{listens to}} people {{from both sides}} of the divide – first, Jewish {{representative}} Yisrael Medad and then, the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri. The two sides appear irreconcilable. Hoping <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>someone</b> who might be able to see both viewpoints, Dawkins interviews Yousef al-Khattab, formerly Joseph Cohen, an American-born Jew who came to Israel as a settler before converting to Islam. After offering Dawkins a cheerful welcome, al-Khattab explains his views relating to the decadence of Western values.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Luna Park was {{a magnet}} for servicemen; both those {{treating}} their girlfriends to a night out, and those looking <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>someone.</b> The park's external lights were 'browned out' {{in case of a}} Japanese sneak attack on Sydney, the neon lights were disconnected, and non-essential uses of electricity (primarily for ride facades) were curtailed. The influx of servicemen drew prostitutes to the area, and large-scale brawls were a common occurrence - usually between Australian home defence troops and American sailors on shore leave.|$|E

40|$|In Data Mining {{large and}} {{increasing}} {{sets of data}} {{are becoming more and}} more common. In order to avoid losing the overview on these data-sets, preference queries are a very popular method to reduce quantities of data to high relevant information. Together with clustering methods like k-means, confusing sets of objects can be constituted and presented clearer in order to get a better overview. In this report we present on the one hand the Pareto-dominance as a very suitable and promising approach to cluster objects over better-than relationships. In order <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>someones</b> desires, one can tip the balance of the final results to the more favored dimension if no decision for allocating objects is possible. On the other hand we introduce based on the Pareto-dominance an advanced clustering approach exploiting the Borda Social Choice voting rule to manage distances of different domains by equally weights during the clustering process...|$|R

500|$|The {{remaining}} {{tracks on}} the record discuss her relationship between herself and Sednaoui. The first track on the album to introduce their relationship is [...] "Cowboy Style", a country number that was influenced by Celtic and tribal percussion. It details about Minogue meeting Sednaoui for the first time, and achieves a metaphorical experimentalism throughout its lyrical delivery. However, the theme of frustration was lingered into the album's seventh track, the techno-induced [...] "Drunk", which has Minogue feeling unsatisfied with the relationship, despite [...] "having so much feeling for [...] ". [...] "Limbo", a hybrid between rock, techno and drum and bass beats, was written in Spain, where Minogue discusses her inability to leave a certain country <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>someone,</b> due to bureaucracy laws. Outside of Sednaoui, Minogue mentions her meeting an ex-boyfriend on [...] "Through the Years", feeling insecure and doubtful about the entire situation; the composition was compared to Bjork's single [...] "Venus as a Boy" [...] by Cinquemani and R. Smith.|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, Mason {{stated that}} a romantic {{interest}} for Chris could be {{introduced in the}} future. He {{said that it was}} not confirmed, but there was a chance that Chris would find someone. Mason admitted that he would find it [...] "awkward" [...] if he had to perform a male kissing scene. The following year, Mason revealed that the writers had plans for a romance for Chris on their radar and a few weeks later it was announced that Bobby Morley had joined the cast as Aidan Foster, a love interest for Chris. Aidan and Chris formed the serial's first gay couple. Bower called the storyline [...] "a natural progression" [...] for Chris, noting that he needed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>someone</b> at some stage. Bower told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Chris's romance will be handled in a sensitive way and will be treated within the character. She explained [...] "Chris is a naturally shy person – he is not a person who either flaunts his sexuality or his heart. So it will be done according to that character. And {{it may not be a}} full-on relationship. The character that Bob is playing is older and further down the track with his relationship testing, so it will be a relationship story rather than a gay male romance." [...] Mason said that Chris and Aidan's relationship would have a slow build up.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{feel that}} speed dating has some obvious {{advantages}} over most other venues for meeting people, such as bars, discotheques, etc. in {{that everybody is}} purportedly there <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>someone,</b> they are grouped into compatible age ranges, it is time-efficient, and the structured interaction eliminates the need to introduce oneself. [...] Unlike many bars, a speed dating event will, by necessity, be quiet enough for people to talk comfortably. Speed dating is for singles.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Morpurgo, {{the author}} of the book on which the film is based, visited the set several times while filming was being undertaken: [...] "Spielberg’s a {{wonderful}} storyteller and a kid. He adores stories and that’s what he’s best at. It’s extraordinary <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>someone</b> with that kind of enthusiasm, utterly unspoiled ... When I went to visit him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.” Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: [...] "It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. And every single priority that as an actor that you would want to be there was there. It felt very real and focused." [...] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't sleep last night. I was worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the episodes}} from 6 August, All About Soap said that [...] "the finger of {{suspicion}} [...] is pointing firmly [...] Michael Moon this fortnight." [...] Following {{the scene of}} Michael snapping at Janine and leaving her with their baby, the magazine thought he could be seeking comfort from Kat, and Janine also overhears Michael arranging <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>someone,</b> which they thought could be Kat. Kat also tells Janine that Michael was having doubts on their wedding day, which they thought could be [...] "Kat's sly way of telling her nemesis that Michael would rather be with another woman", and when Janine sees Michael taking cash from her safe, he could be using it to fund the flat. The same week, Janine telephones Michael, but when he answers his phone, Kat is also calling her lover, which Inside Soap says would leave viewers wondering who he had answered the phone to. After Ray was eliminated as a suspect, Inside Soap said that Michael seemed to become the front-runner, as there had been looks between him and Kat, and Kat seemed distraught, and when Kat {{had a conversation with}} Janine, Kat told Michael that she did not tell her [...] "everything". Jack had become involved with Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) and Max had his own problems. However, again they felt it could be a red herring and Derek could be the one as he had been [...] "conspicuous by his absence".|$|E

Since Estrell does not know any of these rich people, Charlie offers to arrange a meeting. However, Charlie thinks impostors will {{do as well as}} the real rich people, so first he hires some men who turn out to be burglars and gamblers.
