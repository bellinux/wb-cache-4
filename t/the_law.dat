5|$|Aleister Crowley {{wrote in}} The Antecedents of Thelema, (1926), an {{incomplete}} work not published in his day, that Rabelais not only set forth <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of Thelema {{in a way}} similar to how Crowley understood it, but predicted and described in code Crowley's life and the holy text that {{he claimed to have}} received, The Book of <b>the</b> <b>Law.</b> Crowley said the work he had received was deeper, showing in more detail the technique people should practice, and revealing scientific mysteries. He said that Rabelais confines himself to portraying an ideal, rather than addressing questions of political economy and similar subjects, which must be solved in order to realize <b>the</b> <b>Law.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if <b>the</b> <b>law</b> categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied if <b>the</b> <b>law</b> categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E
