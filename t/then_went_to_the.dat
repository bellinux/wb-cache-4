5|$|Since {{there were}} few posts in Hungary for mathematicians, and those were not well-paid, his father wanted von Neumann to follow him into {{industry}} and thereby invest his time in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics. Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path {{was to become a}} chemical engineer. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat for the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time, von Neumann also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926.
