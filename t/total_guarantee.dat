ERA also includes the estimation of the Environmental Damage Index (EDI) and the calculation of the economical guarantee established by the Environmental Responsibility Offer Model (EROM). This study {{has been carried out}} according to Spain regulations, in particular, Royal Decree 183 / 2015 of environmental responsibility. The environmental risk assessment was performed using the Spain Natural Gas methodology unified with ERA procedure established by AENOR in UNE- 150. 008 - 2008 standard. Applying the methodology, different hazardous agents were identified in the LNG plant such as diesel, THT, hydraulic oil, sodium bisulfite, natural gas and others. They were also considered different initiating events (including tanks failure, pipeline ruptures and cisterns leakage) reaching different accidental scenarios where marine water and seabirds were the resources affected. Seawater pollution with diesel was the accidental scenario selected to calculate the financial guarantee, because it has the highest percentage of risk. Environmental evaluation identified the affectation of 708 m 3 of marine water, 4 threatened and 178 non-threatened seabird species.

Os resultados, {{considerando que}} a inserção profissional é uma forma de exercício da cidadania, mostram que: a inserção assistida no mercado de trabalho formal não constitui garantia absoluta de proteção aos seus direitos; as redes sociais às quais se vinculam podem ocultar violações de direitos ao se basear em relações de clientelismo; a assimilação de valores sociais do contexto de relações do ambiente laboral pode implicar afastamento do grupo de pares.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the issue of loosing {{telemetry}} (TM) data due to different reasons (e. g. spacecraft-ground transmissions) while performing a full-sky survey with space-borne instrumentation. This is a particularly important issue considering the current and future space missions (like Planck from ESA and WMAP from NASA) operating from an orbit far from Earth with short periods of visibility from ground stations. We consider, as a working case, the Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) on-board the Planck satellite albeit the approach developed here can be easily applied {{to any kind of}} experiment that makes use of an observing (scanning) strategy which assumes repeated pointings of the same region of the sky on different time scales. The issue is addressed by means of a Monte Carlo approach. Our analysis clearly shows that, under quite general conditions, it is better to cover the sky more times with a lower fraction of TM retained than less times with a higher guaranteed TM fraction. In the case of Planck, an extension of mission time to allow a third sky coverage with 95 % of the <b>total</b> TM <b>guaranteed</b> provides a significant reduction of the probability to loose scientific information with respect to an increase of the <b>total</b> <b>guaranteed</b> TM to 98 % with the two nominal sky coverages.

40|$|Unpublished white paperLess {{than two}} years after {{thousands}} of directors of French public research agencies were about to resign from their administrative duties as a protest against the reduction of research budgets (see for instance Nature, No 428, p 105), it may be timely to look at how well publicly-funded research is doing. Indeed, even in highly visible areas such as medical sciences, a number of drifts and malpractices are progressively turning public research into a costly and biased activity. One of the reasons lies in the pressure put on researchers to publish their work in scientific journals. This used to be an essential means of communication, but today publishing is much more a matter of career than one of disseminating scientific knowledge. Also, research in general tends to set its objectives independently from society's needs. This situation has given rise to a number of absurdities which undermine the usefulness of the scientific work itself. On the basis of simple facts and data, this study therefore attempts to demonstrate that modern science conducts research activities that exhibit flawed methods and poor deliverables. This paper is a critical insider's look at the world of academic research. It has been written by one researcher and one lecturer of the School of Computing Science at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. It is obviously difficult for us to speak with a <b>total</b> <b>guarantee</b> of accuracy about other disciplines. However, the various sources of information used in this study tend to demonstrate that drifts pervade many, if not all domains. The paper highlights a number of drifts within the world of research, the description of which will hopefully increase the awareness of the public and of the scientific community. In the end, the authors wish that the contents, however controversial, trigger a reflection on what science should and should not do, to the benefit of whom, and at what cost...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with showing how economic activity acquires its technical and organizational "Gestaltung". The term "Gestaltung" alludes to the classical understanding of the whole as being {{more than the sum}} of its parts; that is being both its constituent parts and their mutual relations. The thesis is composed of three forms of investigation: Theory, empiricism and analysis, each being presented in a separate section. In addition there is an appendix presenting figures with the formulas used in calculations. In the theoretical section the model I have chosen for analysing the technical and organizational "Gestaltung" is put forward. The model has three dimensions; one materially-deduced, which I call the work process, one economically-determined and one based on human agency. In the centre of my model are human beings, who through their ways of life, concrete actions and decisions to a greater or lesser extent shape patterns of eventuation. Human agents do not live in a technical, economic and social vacuum. In fact their possible actions are surrounded by many restrictions; these restrictions are dealt with through the use of the concepts work process and economic forces. In general I see economic forces as dictating the direction and speed of changes in the technical and organizational "Gestaltung", while the materially-deduced work process represents stability and is only unwillingly adapted to economic change. The object itself; the technical and organizational "Gestaltung", combined with my intention of capturing something of the dynamics and spirit of this process of creation necessitates a very complex model of analysis. This has led me to work with different levels of precision for the three dimensions of my model. In relation to the economic forces a theoretically-informed model is presented which consists of three system levels. The most operationalised level refers to strategical decision-making codified by something called "the strategic matrix". For the work process I am content with presenting a form of categorization which corresponds to my economic model. Based on this categorization different ways of describing the work process are discussed; ways which catch essential aspects of working conditions. Finally when it comes to the human agents I work with a distinctly open and searching methodological form. I do not attempt to formulate a theory of agency for the different actors. Instead we have what I term, "scenarios". In various "scenarios" I try to encapsulate the social context in which different actors have to operate. Against this background it becomes easier to understand the concrete actions of those concerned. The empirical section has for academic reasons been given an unusual form. While I attempt to describe the technical and organizational "Gestaltung" in a Swedish iron ore mine during the period 1950 - 84, I also dim to give something of an idea as to how the different actors shaped this historical process and experienced its concrete "Gestaltung". As conventional scientific methods are unable to fulfil this task I have gained inspiration from literary sources. I have chosen a form of description where I visit the mine in Kiruna on several occasions starting in 1950. The presentation is structured so that I am following a worker called Lennart Waara on a walk through the mine. Lennart does not exist as an individual in real life, but he is a synthesis of many workers' stories. My choice of method means that I can not give a <b>total</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the narrative is either correct or accurate in every detail, but I would maintain that in general terms it is a valid account. The major advantage of such an account is that it is much more concrete than conventional forms of empirical exposition. In the last section I confront my empirical findings with my theoretical categories; paying special attention to my conceptualization of economic forces. The result is a comprehensive review of different management strategies and concrete actions. Historically LKAB has had a unique competitive advantage with its proximity to the expansive European market and has therefore been able to maintain an extremely high level of profitability. In the 1950 s the rate of profit was up to 50 %. The basic problem ever since has been international over-capacity of iron-ore production and a consequent fall in prices for ore-related products. A further problem has been an increase in the costs of production due to the transition from opencast to underground mining in Kiruna. Starting with its unique competitive advantage LKAB has been able to meet increasing competition with an expanding volume of production but over the years the rate of profit has tended to a more normal level. In 1975 market demand suddenly fell to an extremely low level and LKAB found itself in the middle of an economic crisis with mounting deficits. In this context I pose the question; could this crisis have been avoided or its effects moderated? Any straightforward answer remains allusive but I would maintain that it should have been possible to cushion the effects of crisis. I show that the ten year period preceding the crisis was characterized by increasing capital obsolescence and that the crisis coincided with an accumulated need for investment. I am also able to state that there had not been any significant rise in productivity since the major strike in 1969 / 70. LKAB has tried to diversify its way out of crisis without success. In 1983 profitable production was achieved again but at the price of a financial reconstruction costing around 3 billion Swedish Crowns and a reduction in employment of about 2 500. A fortunate pattern of product development has also contributed to a return to profitability. Finally, looking to the future I give a very unfavourable prognosis and advise the trade unions to begin seriously discussing alternative means of closure. Such a planning of closure could be carried out over a considerable time period while new forms of industrial activity were being built up. Godkänd; 1986; 20070212 (ysko...|$|E

Then, we assess user–level QoS and perform QoS mapping between user–level and application–level by multiple regression analysis.
