500|$|Los Angeles had {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Washington's {{style of play}} complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player. Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds; however, he struggled with tendinitis in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing. Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against Denver. [...] "I could feel it tearing inside. I looked down, and my kneecap was hanging on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> leg." [...] Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.|$|E
500|$|For the [...] "vomit scene" [...] where Jennifer {{has just}} arrived at Needy's house after being murdered and {{inhabited}} by a demon, Fox said the liquid {{she was given}} to spit out [...] "was actually ...chocolate syrup initially". [...] "We did a few takes where I would just do this scream and sort of puke Hershey's chocolate syrup. Scratch the Hershey's because I don't want to endorse that or anything", she stated. [...] "And then, special effects did a rig that clamps onto my ear and you revisit it in the pool scene..." [...] Fox said it [...] "clips on. It goes {{around the back of}} my ear and then I bite down on it on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> face, like this, and it projectiles. It's a tube..." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{singing the}} lines [...] "So rock {{right up to}} <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{mountain}} / Climb until you reach my peak babe my peak, the peak / And reach right {{into the bottom of}} my fountain", Beyoncé uses sexual innuendos. [...] She also incorporates similar double entendres and euphemisms in the lyrics, [...] "Reach right into the bottom of my fountain / dip me under to where you can feel my river flow / Rock it till water falls". During the end of the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "You rock hard / I rock steady" [...] eventually [...] "erupting into an orgasmic finish" [...] as stated by Puja Patel of Spin. During the last part, she sings [...] "Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin / And you're comfortable in my skin". It was noted that during the end of the song, the protagonist becomes ready to be sexually subordinate and [...] "discipline" [...] as opposed to the first part where she adopted a more dominant persona; this is further exemplified in the lines [...] "Punish me, punish me please" [...] where Beyoncé uses soft vocals.|$|E

500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
2500|$|Let the {{opinions}} impugned be the belief of God {{and in a}} future state, {{or any of the}} commonly received doctrines of morality... But I must be permitted to observe {{that it is not the}} feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question for others, without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> most solemn convictions.|$|E
2500|$|Humbert Humbert's first love, Annabel Leigh, {{is named}} after the [...] "maiden" [...] in the poem [...] "Annabel Lee" [...] by Poe; this poem is alluded to {{many times in the}} novel, and its lines are {{borrowed}} to describe Humbert's love. A passage in chapter 11 reuses [...] Poe's phrase ...by <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> darling—my darling—my life and my bride. In the opening of the novel, the phrase Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied, is a pastiche of two passages of the poem, the winged seraphs of heaven (line 11), and The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me (lines 21–2). Nabokov originally intended Lolita to be called The Kingdom by the Sea, drawing on the rhyme with Annabel Lee that was used in the first verse of Poe's work. A variant of this line is reprised in the opening of chapter one, which reads ...had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea.|$|E

60|$|I {{set down}} my glass empty. The last drop had tasted like vinegar.

Always one has to fight for the things worth having--and the pain soon passes.|$|R

5000|$|I {{called it}} Part II: The Return of the Ankh because this album is the sister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> brain - it is <b>the</b> right <b>side.</b> Part I was <b>the</b> left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{thoughts}} - {{it was more}} socially political and my thought process was more analytical. This time there wasn't anything {{to be concerned with}} - the album is more emotional and flowy and talks about feelings.
