These constructions contributed immensely to the improvement of agriculture in the northern and eastern parts of the dry zone. Reservoirs were also constructed using tributaries of the Daduru Oya during this period, thereby supplying water to the south western part of the dry zone. This conservation and distribution of water resources ensured that the water supply was sufficient throughout the dry zone. James Emerson Tennent described the ancient irrigation network as: ...|$|E

500|$|Selman {{told the}} Los Angeles Times that the episode praises {{collaborative}} writing, and answers {{the question of}} whether or not writing in a group is as valuable as writing alone. He commented: [...] "I've been with The Simpsons for 15 years and [...] it's been pretty much writing as a team. We’re proud of what we've done even if it's not the traditional idea of one writer sitting down with a passion and a vision. In a strange way this episode ends up as a defense of writing in a group and celebrating the way it makes you feel connected to the work and to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> group in ways you didn't expect. It's all about a writers room ... and you know, in the story, Homer's cynical heist team does end up being incredibly productive." [...] The episode features several references to literature and parodies several popular young-adult book series, particularly Twilight, a vampire-themed fantasy book series by Stephenie Meyer that has received much popularity. While chasing T. R. Francis through the stadium where the dinosaur show took place, Lisa passes a bathroom in which a group of dinosaurs are smoking in reference to a Far Side comic of dinosaurs smoking. The dinosaur show itself, Sitting with Dinosaurs, is based on the live Walking with Dinosaurs show.|$|E

2500|$|Pareto {{originally}} {{used this}} distribution {{to describe the}} allocation of wealth among individuals since it seemed to show rather well {{the way that a}} larger portion of the wealth of any society is owned by a smaller percentage of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> society. He also used it to describe distribution of income. This idea is sometimes expressed more simply as the Pareto principle or the [...] "80-20 rule" [...] which says that 20% of the population controls 80% of the wealth. However, the 80-20 rule corresponds to a particular value of α, and in fact, Pareto's data on British income taxes in his Cours d'économie politique indicates that about 30% of the population had about 70% of the income. The probability density function (PDF) graph {{at the beginning of this}} article shows that the [...] "probability" [...] or fraction of the population that owns a small amount of wealth per person is rather high, and then decreases steadily as wealth increases.

No one from the festival noticed this plagiarism and the band avoided the controversy. The song was even released on a 7-inch single [...] "Plačem za tvojim usnama" [...] / [...] "Zapjevaj" [...] by Beograd Disk and sold surprisingly well.

2500|$|Low income black {{communities}} that have been segregated by social forces through city design {{have higher levels of}} criminal activity rates. Different methods when applied help us understand how social forces and urban design segregated {{black communities}} from white communities. [...] "Shaw and McKay argued that three structural factors- low economic status,ethnic heterogeneity and residential mobility- led to the disruption of community social organization,which,in turn, accounted for variations in crime and delinquency." [...] Radical geography has been searching for connections between [...] "the truths of how capitalism's political economy structures urban space and the emphasis on the subjective evaluation of safe urban space.". The geographical structure of a city is designed to keep high income communities separate from low income, generally black communities are formed with this structure. This type of segregation tends to increase rates of intra- racial victimization, but decrease rates of inter-racial victimization." [...] One method of segregating blacks form whites is through 'gated communities' which isolates the high income population from the low income by gating the higher status community with fences or bars. The result of this 'gated' segregation leads to an unmanageable high criminal activity called a 'ghetto' community where [...] "spatial isolation leads to social isolation, which in turn has a variety of negative outcomes including serious crime." [...] Erecting physical barriers such as gates protects the high income community, leaving the black community to be isolated and an island by itself referenced as a 'ghetto' community. This can be referred to as 'Broken Windows' in which a community,"sends a signal" [...] that it, [...] "does not care about itself" [...] and the community is unable to protect itself from,"criminal invasion." [...] By pushing the low income earners out of the gentrified community, the city is creating a large segregated criminal zone within the city. [...] "This divide has, in turn, produced disparate social worlds, in which the interests, resources, opportunities, and concerns of racial groups located in distinct neighborhoods increasingly diverge, ultimately leading to unequal rates of crime." [...] The ghetto is labeled as an undesirable area to live and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> area are labeled the same. [...] "We have also seen that those who commit crimes tend to be from the same groups that {{are most likely to be}} victimized." [...] This causes criminal behavior of the people within the area as [...] "greater racial segregation appears to substantially increase violent crimes such as robberies and aggravated assaults." [...] However it could be argued that the area that an underprivileged person lives in dictates the criminal mentality of the individual. [...] "Poor individuals are simply more prone to committing property crimes than are richer individuals." [...] Having so many people displaced into the ghetto region of a city that commit many different types of criminal actives would be a reason why those communities have higher crime rates.|$|E
