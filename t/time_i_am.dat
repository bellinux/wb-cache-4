25|$|I am {{honored to}} receive this award (the Distinguished Service Medal) today {{but at the}} same <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> saddened to be leaving active {{military}} service. The Army has been my life and I am proud of each of my twenty-five years of service.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

500|$|The medieval chronicler Matthew Paris retold {{the story}} that when King John heard of Walter's death, the king exclaimed [...] "Now for the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> king of England". This story, however entertaining, is apocryphal. More secure is {{the story that}} another chronicler, Roger of Wendover, relates about Walter's Christmas {{celebrations}} in 1200. Roger reports that Walter distributed clothing to those attending his Christmas feast, which angered King John. The chronicler says that Walter [...] "wished to put himself {{on a par with}} the king".|$|E
500|$|Jarrad Willis, a 20-year-old from Melbourne, Australia {{was arrested}} on December 8, 2007, after {{apparently}} posting on 4chan that he was [...] "going to shoot and kill {{as many people as}} I can until which <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> incapacitated or killed by the police". The post, accompanied by an image of another man holding a shotgun, threatened a shopping mall near Beverly Hills. While the investigation was still open, Willis was charged with criminal defamation for a separate incident but died before the case was heard.|$|E
500|$|Hard as the Americans {{worked to}} {{incorporate}} {{themselves into the}} Grand Fleet, they had yet to shake a belief among the veteran British that they were amateurs merely playing at war. In writing to his American-born wife following the maneuvers, Admiral Beatty noted that, [...] "The American Squadron enjoyed themselves greatly while we were out, and did well, and will do better next <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sending old Rodman out on an operation of his own, which pleases him and gives them an idea that they are really {{taking part in the}} war.

She was with me the whole <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, and {{if it had not been}} for learning the language from her, and conversing with her, I do not know how I should have got through the <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sorry to leave her behind, and promised her that, if ever I got rich enough here, I would send and purchase her freedom." ...|$|R

500|$|Krohn wrote {{a column}} for Human Events, a weekly {{conservative}} newspaper. Krohn wrote a second book, Defining Conservatism: The Principles That Will Bring Our Country Back, released February 2010. The book was praised by former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and syndicated radio host Mike Gallagher, who said of it, [...] "Any <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> depressed {{about the state of}} the country or the future of the modern conservative movement, I consider two words: Jonathan Krohn." [...] Gingrich offered to write the foreword for the book, but Krohn wanted it to be written by William Bennett. Krohn attended the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference, but did not have a speaking role. Krohn also spoke at several Tea Party protests.|$|E
500|$|For the 1969 season, Rindt {{signed for}} the 1968 World Constructors' Champion Lotus, where {{he joined the}} {{defending}} Drivers' Champion Graham Hill. Rindt felt uncomfortable with the move, owing to the notorious unreliability of the Lotus car; in a twenty-month period between 1967 and 1969, the team was involved in 31 accidents. Hill alone had nine crashes between 1968 and 1970, which led him to joke: [...] "Every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> being overtaken by my own wheel, I know I am in a Lotus." [...] When Rindt joined Lotus, his friend and de facto manager Bernie Ecclestone, who had negotiated the deal, remarked that they were aware that Brabham {{may have been a}} better choice of team but the speed of the Lotus gave Rindt a chance to win the championship. Rindt commented: [...] "At Lotus, I can either be world champion or die." [...] Because of his uncertainty about the wisdom of joining the team, Rindt did not sign the Lotus contract until shortly before the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix.|$|E

500|$|In March 2011, Aronofsky bowed out of {{directing}} the film, {{saying in a}} statement, [...] "As I talked more about the film with my collaborators at Fox, {{it became clear that}} the production of The Wolverine would keep me out of the country for almost a year.... I was not comfortable being away from my family for that length of <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sad that I won't be able to see the project through, as it is a terrific script and I was very much looking forward to working with my friend, Hugh Jackman, again". Fox also decided to be [...] "in no rush" [...] to start the production due to the damage incurred in Japan by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Despite this, Jackman said the project was moving ahead. [...] "It's too early to call on Japan, I'm not sure where they're at. So now we're finding another director, but Fox is very anxious to make the movie and we're moving ahead full steam to find another director".|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E
500|$|December {{started with}} the last group stage match of the UEFA Cup. Benfica visited Beveren and won 3-0 with a double from Zlatko Zahovič, {{ensuring}} qualification for the round of 32 behind Stuttgart. On 6 December, Benfica received Estoril. The visitors scored first, but Benfica responded through Simão with a double inside ten minutes, giving them the first league win in a month and returning them to first place. On 12 December, Benfica played away to Belenenses. Trapattoni's team did not perform to expectations and lost 4–1, the largest defeat there since 1947–48. Trapattoni remained optimistic, saying, [...] "Losing a game like this is not catastrophic. Give up? No, that is not my vocabulary." [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} defeat, José Moreira lost his starting goalkeeping place to Quim. Trapattoni, in the preview for the upcoming match with Penafiel, said, [...] "Benfica needs to forget this humiliating defeat quickly. Four goals...three goals in eight minutes, it is true we {{are in a state of}} emergency. We have the mentality to react and will do so." [...] On the same day, Benfica discovered their next opponent in the UEFA Cup would be CSKA Moscow. On 18 December, Benfica beat Penafiel 1–0 with a goal from Argel. On 21 December, Benfica played the last game of the year, hosting third-tier team AD Oliveirense for the Portuguese Cup. Benfica won 4–1 but required extra time to beat the visitors after a 1-1 draw in regular time. Throughout the game, Benfica fans whistled the team for the poor game. Later, Trapattoni acknowledged the performance, saying, [...] "For the first <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> with the fans since the team deserved the whistles." ...|$|E
