2500|$|Wilson {{grew up in}} Chicago, Illinois, {{and moved}} with his parents to Santa Monica, California, at age 9. At a young age he would skip school in order to watch the Academy Awards from the bleachers. He {{attended}} University of California, Los Angeles, majoring in film and television. While attending college, he also managed [...] the Fox Theater, Westwood Village. After graduating UCLA, Wilson obtained a position working on marketing campaigns for movies and as a copywriter for a sponsor of the Los Angeles Film Festival, and watched over 200 movies per year in this capacity. In 2005, Wilson stated that he still worked in film marketing, and also worked on film trailers. His marketing work has included publicity for the Academy Awards: [...] "When {{they found out that}} I did the Razzies, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like I was a spy," [...] said Wilson to The Blade.|$|E
6000|$|... [Gaily.] Well, I met Arthur at a {{week-end}} party. He'd {{come home}} on leave {{and all sorts}} of important people had been asked to meet him. I was frightened out of my life. The duchesses had strawberry leaves hanging all over them and <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> down their noses. And the Cabinet Ministers' wives had protruding teeth and <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> up their noses.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> curiously. Buell {{raised his}} face with a queer smile. Bud broke into a laugh.|$|E
50|$|I {{think it}} is clear to other people when <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> that I am of Māori descent.|$|R
30|$|Ade: Ya, {{last time}} I try right? I try to… I cut like that…err like a maid’s {{appearance}} and then, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|I wait a little, {{to enjoy}} the full luxury of hearing him say those words--to revel in the love and the {{gratitude}} that moisten his dear eyes as <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Then I rouse my resolution, and put the momentous question on which our future depends.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{not quite}} under{{standing}}; then I {{caught sight of}} Claudia, who was standing close to us.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I tried, because Lady Adela and Miss Bertha and all do,' said Ida, 'and <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me!</b> But {{it made me}} faint, as I knew it would,' and she put {{her head}} on one side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lost her memory, eh?" [...] said Tommy with interest. [...] "By Jove, that {{explains}} why <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so queerly when I spoke of questioning her. Bit of a slip on my part, that! But it wasn't {{the sort of thing}} a fellow would be likely to guess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} must be the croupiers, dear. I'm sure I never heard of croupiers in fancy costume before. It doesn't seem right. I'm sure people don't like those nasty Hindoos. I am quite nervous myself when I go into the Indian room. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so oddly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wordsworth {{commenting on}} the album's title says [...] "I felt the songs {{reflected}} the emotion, time or period that either I went through, someone next to me went through or somebody that might not even know me went through. And when I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> people, the audience, and <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> I think <b>they</b> see a reflection from me in my music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold your tongue, and don't worry me. I can see Nancy's eyes, just as <b>they</b> will <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{and feel}} {{her hand in}} mine already." ...|$|R
6000|$|If I {{looked at}} these girls with little scruple, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with still less. Eulalie raised her unmoved eye to mine, {{and seemed to}} expect, passively but securely, an impromptu tribute to her majestic charms. Hortense {{regarded}} me boldly, and giggled at the same time, while she said, {{with an air of}} impudent freedom-- ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} them and <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{for quite a long}} while, since {{following}} my usual rule, I determined not {{to be the first to}} speak. Moreover, if they meant to kill me there was no use in speaking. At length their leader, an elderly man with thin legs, a large stomach and a rather pleasant countenance, saluted politely, saying-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha! You {{should have}} seen them revive and buckle to their work! For I kept them at it to pull right across that ship's path. They were changed. The sort of pity I had felt for them left me. They looked more like {{themselves}} every minute. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with the glances I remembered so well. They were happy. They smiled.|$|E
6000|$|... "But no {{one would}} take me with such clothes, ma'am. <b>They</b> wouldn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> or speak to me even in the little shops where I went to ask for work." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stepped back}} again, {{leaning against the}} rock. The {{moonlight}} shone full upon her face. There was terror as well as astonishment in her eyes while <b>they</b> now <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There's to be a prayer-meeting {{for rain}} in the Auld Licit kirk the night," [...] he told me as I escorted him {{as far as my}} side of the Quharity, now almost a dead stream, pitiable to see, [...] "and I'm gaen; though I'm sweer to leave thae puir cattle o' mine. You should see how <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> when I gie them mair o' that rotten grass to eat. It's eneuch to mak a man greet, for what richt hae I to keep kye when I canna meat them?" ...|$|R
60|$|I retraced my steps upstairs. The Chinese ambassador, Vanhallon, and Lamartine {{were deep}} in {{conversation}} in the dead man's sitting-room. I was admitted to their confidence after a few minutes' hesitation. A draft for one hundred and sixty thousand pounds had been found upon the dead man, but notes {{to the value of}} forty thousand pounds were missing! <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a little curiously as I entered, and Lamartine explained the situation to me.|$|E
60|$|They were evidently {{talking of}} me, for {{every now and}} then <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and {{some of the people who}} were sitting on the bench outside the door--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd, so I quietly got my {{polyglot}} dictionary from my bag and looked them out.|$|E
60|$|He wore a {{beautiful}} blue frock-coat, buttoned up. I like a frock-coat to be buttoned up. He had light-colored trousers and gray gloves {{and a pretty}} cane. I like light-colored trousers and gray gloves and a pretty cane. What color his eyes were is more than I can say; I only know they made me hot when <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Not that I mind being made hot; it is surely better than being made cold. He and Mrs. Staveley shook hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--I am not sorry," [...] {{said she}} presently. [...] "I am much {{depressed}} {{by the way}} <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> here. And you have been keeping on this house and furniture entirely for me and the boy! You don't want it yourself, and the expense is unnecessary. But whatever we do, wherever we go, you won't take him away from me, Jude dear? I could not let him go now! The cloud upon his young mind makes him so pathetic to me; I do hope to lift it some day! And he loves me so. You won't take him away from me?" ...|$|R
60|$|I let go, and <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> reproachfully <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{as though}} I had imperilled their {{chance for a}} bed and three parts of skilly. Nobody came. Luckily {{it was the wrong}} bell, and I felt better.|$|R
500|$|Rodman {{admitted}} {{his frequent}} transgressions, but asserted {{that he lived}} his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people: [...] "I just took {{the chance to be}} my own man... I just said: 'If you don't like it, kiss my ass.' ...Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and see someone trying to do that... I'm the guy who's showing people, hey, it's all right to be different. And I think they feel: 'Let's go and see this guy entertain us.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one noticed}} me. Had <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{they would have}} seen, even in the darkness, the great patches {{down the front of}} the robe; but I don't think anyone did notice me. Other figures were moving about, from group to group, and I kept on through the grove, until beyond the trees. I came out on the side {{opposite}} to that which I had entered, and, as I expected, found some of the Dervish horses grazing among the bushes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{that had}} been all,' said Clement; 'but Angel and Bernard choose to go and sit by themselves, and I could see, from Felix's place in the choir, that they were tittering long after. I shook my head, but Nares must needs make up an odious imitation; and Bernard not only touches Angel to make her look, but grins impudently at me. I found myself growing burning hot with shame, and {{whenever}} <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> their heads went down and their shoulders worked.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could have}} smashed the silly devils. At last, faint {{with the desire}} for tasteful food, I went into another place and demanded a private room. 'I am disfigured,' I said. 'Badly.' <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> curiously, {{but of course it}} was not their affair--and so at last I got my lunch. It was not {{particularly}} well served, but it sufficed; and when I had had it, I sat over a cigar, trying to plan my line of action. And outside a snowstorm was beginning.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{talk too}} intimately," [...] she whispered, {{as the people}} began to file in to take their places. [...] "After luncheon we will take our coffee in my coupe. Then, if you like, we will speak of these matters. I have a headache. Will you order me some champagne? It is a terrible thing, I know, to drink wine in the morning, but when one travels, what can one do? Here come your bodyguard. <b>They</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as though I had stolen you away. Remember we take our coffee {{together}} afterwards. I am bored with so much traveling, and I look to you to amuse me." ...|$|R
6000|$|He half smiled. [...] "But if I {{were to go}} to them, and <b>they</b> only <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> coldly, {{and whispered}} sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off and left me one by one, what then? Would you go with them?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> {{all stood}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> as if <b>they</b> {{was waiting for}} something. I folded my arms--tight--and stared back at 'em.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{first two}} girls started {{explaining}} {{the thing to}} the third girl, and before they were half-way through the third girl began to giggle--she {{was the sort of}} girl who would giggle at anything. That done, they fell to chattering like Jenny Wrens, all three together; and between every half- dozen words they looked across at me; and the more <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> the more the third girl giggled; and before they had finished they were all three giggling, the little idiots; you might have thought I was a clown, giving a private performance.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{found the}} house was deserted. It had two empty rooms. There was a little shed in the yard where beasts had once been kept. In a loft {{of it was a}} lot of old hay. I put my horses in there and gave them some of it, for which <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sorrowful, expecting apologies. The rest of the hay I carried into the house by armfuls, with a view to accommodations. I also brought in the patent kindler and the Brazilians, neither of which are {{guaranteed}} against the action of water.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{licked his}} lips, did Dan, and stayed up walking {{about more than}} half the night, {{thinking}} of the wife {{that he was going to}} get in the morning. I wasn't any means comfortable, for I knew that dealings with a woman in foreign parts, though you was a crowned King twenty times over, could not but be risky. I got up very early in the morning while Dravot was asleep, and I saw the priests talking together in whispers, and the Chiefs talking together too, and <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> out of the corners of their eyes.|$|E
60|$|My {{surprise}} at this {{last piece of}} information could not pass unnoticed. Both the hall-porter and his assistant were evidently well-trained servants, but <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> curiously <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and then exchanged rapid glances with one another. I recovered myself, however, in an instant.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974 he {{received}} the command over the Infantry and Paratroopers Branch of the Israeli army. He had planned and commanded the Entebbe rescue operation (in which Yonatan Netanyahu, the brother of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, took part in as the breaching force commander - had been killed). He was acclaimed a hero but did not always seem comfortable with people viewing him as a hero. He said, “I also felt some kind of envy from the military {{and it was not}} comfortable for me. Around the world, until today, <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like something from a different world, a super super-hero, something not natural. I don’t like that feeling of being an advertisement.” ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{was only}} yesterday. All this has {{happened}} in a week. I can hardly steady myself down--I can hardly believe that all this happiness is true, and that in another year Percy will be home to claim me. But yet it is all true, {{and it seems to}} have given me back my youth and life again. Every one tells me that in this short week I am so changed, that <b>they</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> almost with wonder, and are hardly able to believe that I am the same person they knew ten days ago, as a quiet, melancholy-looking woman. Thank God for it all--for all His exceeding mercy and goodness to me! ...|$|R
