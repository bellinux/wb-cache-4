40|$|In {{this paper}} the pendant drop method to measure {{interfacial}} <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> molten polymers is reviewed. A typical pendant drop apparatus is presented. The algorithms used to infer interfacial tension from the geometrical {{profile of the}} pendant drop are described in details, in particular a new routine to evaluate correctly {{the value of the}} radius at the apex of the drop, necessary to the calculation of interfacial tension is presented. The method was evaluated for the possibility of measuring the interfacial <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> polyethylene and polystyrene. It is shown that the method is unsui able for the measurement of interfacial <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> high density polyethylene and polystyren due possibly to a too small difference of density between the two polymers. Values of interfacial <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS) {{as a function of the}} molecular weight of PS are presented. It was shown that the interfacial <b>tension</b> <b>between</b> LDPE and PS incrased as a function of molecular weight of PS up to values of molecular weight of roughly 40, 000 g/ml, value for which entanglements occur...|$|R

5|$|Simmering <b>tensions</b> <b>between</b> the UK and Argentina {{increased}} {{during the}} second half of the century, when Argentine President Juan Perón asserted sovereignty over the archipelago. The sovereignty dispute intensified during the 1960s, shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on decolonisation which Argentina interpreted as favourable to its position. In 1965, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2065, calling for both states to conduct bilateral negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute. From 1966 until 1968, the UK confidentially discussed with Argentina the transfer of the Falklands, assuming its judgement would be accepted by the islanders. An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971 and, consequently, Argentina built a temporary airfield at Stanley in 1972. Nonetheless, Falklander dissent, as expressed by their strong lobby in the UK Parliament, and <b>tensions</b> <b>between</b> the UK and Argentina effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977.|$|E
