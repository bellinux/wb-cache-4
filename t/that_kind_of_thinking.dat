40|$|First, {{by giving}} a {{historical}} overview, I {{show how the}} last fifty years of Borgesian criticism mostly reveals contradictions and misunderstandings when the meaning of philosophy and metaphysics in Borges?s works is studied. Second, through a semantic analysis of the words philosophy and metaphysics, even in Borges?s correspondence and some of his early essays, I argue that philosophical doctrines differently deploy in the historical development of Borges?s opus, not only in the form of irony?as countless critics have always affirmed?, but also and most fundamentally in the form of inspiration, positive and negative experimentation, or radicalization. Third, literary theory and the history of ideas help me to propose a new understanding of the word fiction in Borges?s works. I found that this Borgesian word, still at stake in contemporary critical discussions of Hispanism (I think of Saer and Piglia, for instance), has unexpected roots in and profound debts to philosophers such as Kant, Nietzsche, and Vaihinger. Forth, I show how French critical thinking {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century finds in Borges one of its most seductive sources of inspiration. Particularly, Borges?s essays and short stories are catalyzers for <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> Authors such as Blanchot, De Man, Genette, and Foucault philosophize with Borges in topics touching the death of the author, the anonymous presence of artistic works, the inter-textual threads of any writing, the suspicion towards all discourse pretending to be mimetically realistic, and even the Borgesian way of destabilizing absolute, human categories used to classified things in the universe. Fifth, and as a counterpoint with other related theories (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Agamben), I give new ethical and political light to Borges?s literature studying some of his texts through underlining what Borges used to call a very Argentine passion, that is, friendship. If I am right, because his literature has a strong praise of friendship, Borges?s works can be no longer understood as intellectually solipsistic. In the conclusion of my study, a thought-provoking analogy offers a way to provisionally understand the way philosophy and literature are related to each other in Borges?s opus...|$|E
40|$|Usually, hate-speech and its {{criminalisation}} are {{looked at}} from {{the angle of}} a separate hate-speech offence, and often {{in the context of}} human rights law, especially freedom of speech and religion. In the Islamic world, such issues are treated under blasphemy laws and the availability of severe sanctions for that offence, not infrequently the death penalty, may make a separate recourse to homicide offences unnecessary. Yet, recent events in the Islamic world suggest {{that it would not be}} unimaginable to entertain the idea of a liability for the deaths of those killed in unrests caused by hate-speech, in Western legal systems: Can it be acceptable any longer, in the age of YouTube and other (social) networks of instantaneous and easy-access worldwide information traffic, that people intentionally put out inflammatory messages which they know will lead to unrests with the risk of lethal outcomes, without having to bear any legal consequences? Is freedom of speech a panacea which allows them to wash their hands of these obvious effects of their actions? Can the criminal law accommodate liability in such circumstances or are we asking the system to do something that it should not and maybe even cannot do? Is <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> the first step on a slippery slope towards religious censorship and thought-crime? Against the background of events such as those triggered in 2012 by the dissemination of the film Innocence of Muslims, we will look at the specific anti-Islamic context as an example where the lines appear to be particularly bright, because general experience tells us that the adherents of no other religion tend to react to religious provocations as violently and as predictably as a certain conservative sector of the Muslim community. This is a sensitive area as it partly deals with non-Muslim perceptions about Muslim self-perception which may not be shared by everyone, least of all the moderate Muslims who are not part of the problem, either. Yet it is necessary to start a discussion about the issue. By doing so, we do not contend that Islam is in any special position as far as the need for protection from defamation is concerned, yet it cannot be denied that the vast majority of the current problems in this field are specifically Islam-related. The Islamic context thus lends itself well to drawing the contours of the problem...|$|E
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians 2 ̆ 7 Report and {{proposals}} {{from the perspective}} of constitutional theory. Introduction In January 2012, the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians (‘Expert Panel’) delivered its report to the then Prime Minister making a number of recommendations to amend the Australian Constitution to ‘recognise’ Indigenous Australians. Rather than engage in a legal critique of the substance of the Expert Panel’s various proposals, this article approaches the Expert Panel’s Report and proposals as a whole {{from the perspective of}} constitutional theory. It argues that the Expert Panel’s Report and proposals strongly reflect the constitutional theory of the American constitutional theorist Jack Balkin. In his book Living Originalism, Balkin conceives of the United States Constitution functioning not only as ‘basic law’, distributing powers and setting up institutions of government, but also as ‘higher law’, embodying values and aspirations for the nation, and as ‘our law’, helping to constitute the people of the nation as a people. The first claim made in this article is that the Expert Panel conceives of the functions of the Australian Constitution {{in much the same way}} as Balkin conceives of the functions of the United States Constitution. The article makes a second claim. For Balkin, a constitution successfully functioning as basic law gives it procedural legitimacy whilst its success in functioning as higher law and our law gives it moral and sociological legitimacy respectively. Whilst the Australian Constitution does not really function as higher law or our law in Balkin’s sense, the Expert Panel’s adoption of <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> can be seen as a critique of the legitimacy of the Australian Constitution. The Expert Panel implicitly suggests that the Australian Constitution can be made more legitimate. The article also makes a third claim building upon the first two. It is argued that the Expert Panel is engaged in a project of constitutional redemption, a concept that features heavily in Living Originalism and which is the principal subject of its companion work Constitutional Redemption: Political Faith in an Unjust World. This article begins by setting out the background to the Expert Panel’s Report and notes its various proposals for amendments to the Australian Constitution. The article then turns to the first main claim. It explains Balkin’s tripartite view of constitutional functions and explores how the Expert Panel’s report and recommendations appear to be based on a view of the Australian Constitution as higher law and as our law. The article then turns to the second main claim, explaining how it is difficult to accept that the Australian Constitution functions as higher law and our law in Balkin’s sense and showing how the Expert Panel’s adoption of that thinking offers a critique of the legitimacy of the Australian Constitution. The article then turns to the third main claim and explores how the Expert Panel appears to be engaged in a project of constitutional redemption. The article concludes with a reference to The Castle and ‘the vibe’ and suggests that it is possible that the Australian people may one day look to the Australian Constitution as higher law and our law...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a basic tool for the teaching of linear algebra at university level: the administration of weekly quizzes.

40|$|The {{ability to}} reason with {{proportions}} is known {{to take a long}} time to develop and to be difficult to learn. We regard proportional reasoning (the ability to reason about quantities in relative terms) as a threshold concept for academic quantitative literacy. Our study of the teaching and learning of proportional reasoning in a university quantitative literacy course for law students consisted of iterative action research, in which we introduced various teaching interventions and analysed students’ written responses to assessment questions requiring students to explain their reasoning in situations that call for proportional reasoning. For this analysis we used a modified phenomenographic method to develop and refine a framework to code the responses. This enabled us to broadly describe the responses in terms of the concept of the liminal space that a student must traverse in coming to a full understanding of a threshold concept, and to further define the liminal space to facilitate finer description of students’ responses. Our latest analysis confirmed that many university students cannot reason with proportions, <b>that</b> this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> is difficult to learn, and that it takes more time than is available in a one-semester course. The context and structure of the questions have a marked effect on students’ ability to apply proportional reasoning successfully.

5000|$|Prior to the debate, {{biological}} {{scientists were}} generally {{split into two}} major factions: whether animal structure was determined by functional needs of an animal or the [...] "conditions of existence" [...] (Cuvier), or a basic unified form that was modified across all animal forms (Geoffroy). By determining {{the answer to this}} question, scientists could also shed light on the mechanisms of the evolution of species, as well as potentially finding a useful system to classify species to better understand the order of nature. Cuvier was an influential scientist with significant political power and many prominent positions: permanent secretary at the French Academie of Science, a professorship at the Museum of Natural History and the College of France, as well as a Council member at the University of France. Cuvier stuck to [...] "positive facts" [...] of science and refused to flirt with hypotheses and unsupported ideas. This attitude sprang from worries <b>that</b> this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> would lead to unrest and disorder in France as the French Revolution had torn through only a few decades before. Cuvier encouraged young scientists to stick with facts and often won them over easily due to his strong reputation as a good ally to have in science. His political ties and academic connections gave his ideas a broader audience and generally more historical recognition. Geoffroy was heavily influenced by Buffon and Lamarck. It was in his memoir Philosophie anatomique, published in 1818, that he first put his ideas on animal form and structure into print. Here he attempted to answer his own question, [...] "Can the organization of vertebrated animals be referred to as one uniform type?" [...] Cuvier on the other hand was known as Lamarck's greatest critic, as Cuvier felt Lamarck was too speculative without enough facts to back up his theories. Cuvier grew up reading the works of Linnaeus and was mostly self-taught through dissection and measurements of organisms. Geoffroy thought of facts as building blocks to science while new ideas would lead to real discovery, occasionally dipping more into philosophical hypotheses instead of testable or demonstrated research. Geoffroy kept his unpopular ideas under wraps when advantageous to his career but found it increasingly difficult to stay passive as he got older and more well known. He may even have welcomed the debate between himself and Cuvier as a chance to liven up the discussions in the Academy and generate new ideas.|$|R

40|$|Exposition and {{narration}} as writing {{forms are}} often oppositional {{in terms of}} their purposes, stylistic elements, and organizational patterns. Recently there have been calls for “mixed” and “alternate” genre writing to allow for the intersection of academic investigation (typically exposition) and emotional investment (typically narration) previously limited by using either/or forms. The present study was an investigation into the writing process of writers choosing mixed genre forms. ^ Five interviews were conducted with writers of five mixed genre writing pieces published in refereed academic journals or books. The researcher sought to determine the following: What characterizes a piece of mixed genre writing, according to the writer, in terms of (a) purposes of the writer including but not limited to personal, communicative, learning, and political, (b) content, (c) writing strategies/processes, (d) learning processes, and (e) form(s) chosen. What are the influences, according to the writer, that cause these writers to choose this style or resist another style, including but not limited to, the politics of academia in general and the field in particular, the status of the writer in the field, and {{the context in which the}} piece is submitted? ^ Analysis of the case studies indicated that mixed genre writing gave participants a place to grapple with a problem or idea by synthesizing informational knowledge with personal knowledge. Furthermore, the participants all emphasized the learning they experienced during this writing process. These findings are not surprising given the foundational literature by Vygotsky (1962 / 1996), Britton (1970), and Berthoff (1981, 1984) suggesting that the linking of personal experience and academic exploration are essential for learning. The data further indicated that the narration/exposition opposition might be politically/institutionally motivated and/or maintained in spite of the fact <b>that</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> synthetic <b>thinking</b> prompted by mixed genre writing might best serve the learning interests of students. ...|$|R

The second aim is to present data about different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> metacognitive <b>thinking</b> in classrooms which was elicited with cartoon templates. Sample and methods. Data about thinking in classrooms is drawn from a sample of 355 pupils, aged 4 – 15, in 12 schools who were involved in a project which promoted meta-cognition and self-regulation. The completed templates were coded for different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> including metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive skillfulness. A two way ANOVA (gender and age) was conducted to examine the development <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> across age groups (4 – 7 year olds; 7 – 11 year olds; 11 – 15 year olds). Results. There was an increase in all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> recorded on the templates with younger children (4 - 11 year olds), but contrary to expectation more complex <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> were identified less frequently with the 11 – 15 year olds. Conclusion. There is strong evidence from meta-analysis that metacognition and selfregulation are key dimensions in supporting learning, but there are also indications from classrooms that such approaches are not routinely embedded in schools in a way which takes advantage of learners’ developing capabilities...|$|R
