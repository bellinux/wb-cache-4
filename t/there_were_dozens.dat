25|$|The homophile {{movement}} lobbied {{to establish}} a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability. Radicals of the 1970s would later disparage the homophile groups for being assimilationist. Any demonstrations were orderly and polite. By 1969, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>dozens</b> of homophile organizations and publications in the U.S, and a national organization had been formed, but they were largely ignored by the media. A 1962 gay march held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, according to some historians, {{marked the beginning of}} the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the LGBT youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality, and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April–July 1966, followed by the August 1966 Compton's riot, where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of Tenderloin rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, Gene Compton's Cafeteria.|$|E

They were some of the largest ships to have been built at the time, and ironically hastened the decline of the city docks by proving the feasibility of large ships. The SS Great Britain was to be towed away from her builders, to have her 1,000 hp engines and interior fitted out on the River Thames, but her [...] beam was too big to pass through the lock. Thus the SS Great Britain was moored in the Floating Harbour until December 1844, before proceeding into Cumberland Basin after coping stones and lock gate platforms were removed from the Junction Lock.

500|$|The first Danish farmer-owned {{co-operative}} bacon factory {{was established}} in 1887. [...] There were soon more, and by 1897 <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>dozens.</b> [...] By 1900 the co-operatives outnumbered private enterprises. [...] By this time the export of live pigs had almost ceased, being replaced by export of pork and bacon. [...] There followed intense competition between the co-operatives and private producers, with the co-operatives eventually winning out. [...] The co-operatives had competition from foreign investors as well as indigenous enterprises. [...] The first of these was I. D. Koopmann of Hamburg, who bought and opened new bacon factories {{in order to get}} around the German ban on live pigs. [...] Koopmann refused to do business with the co-operatives, calling the movement [...] "a sick idea". [...] They worked closely with Denny & Co. of London—the Denny family were a major bacon manufacturer in Ireland and between them they controlled {{a large portion of the}} UK market. [...] Denny's took over Koopmann's when the latter got into debt in 1894. [...] Denny's never managed to get on top of the co-operatives, but they held on in Denmark until 1968 when they finally sold what was left of the Danish operation to the Federation of Danish Co-operatives. [...] Another major foreign player, ironically, was the English Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS). [...] The CWS had depots in Denmark from 1881, taking advantage of the refusal of London dealers to buy from the co-operatives. [...] From 1899, however, they started setting up their own manufacturing in Denmark. [...] Production grew until 1930 but then slowly declined and CWS started selling up in 1971.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{released}} {{their third}} album, OK Computer, in June 1997. The album found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating ambient, avant garde and electronic influences, prompting Rolling Stone {{to call the}} album a [...] "stunning art-rock tour de force". Radiohead denied {{being part of the}} progressive rock genre, but critics began to compare their work to Pink Floyd, a band whose early 1970s work influenced Greenwood's guitar parts at the time. Some compared OK Computer thematically to Floyd's bestseller The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), although Yorke said the album's lyrics had been inspired by observing the [...] "speed" [...] of the world in the 1990s. Yorke's lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called [...] "end-of-the-millennium blues" [...] in contrast to the more personal songs of The Bends. According to journalist Alex Ross, the band had become [...] "the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation—as the Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before." [...] OK Computer met with critical acclaim. Yorke said he was [...] "amazed it got the reaction it did. None of us fucking knew any more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create."OK Computer was the band's first number-one UK chart debut, propelling them to commercial success around the world. Despite peaking at number 21 in the US charts, the album eventually met with mainstream recognition there, earning Radiohead their first Grammy Awards recognition, winning Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year. [...] "Paranoid Android", [...] "Karma Police" [...] and [...] "No Surprises" [...] were released as singles from the album, of which [...] "Karma Police" [...] was most successful internationally.
