All three countries opted for the European Union by signing association agreements on 21 March 2014. However, break-away regions of Moldova (Transnistria), Ukraine (Donetsk and Lugansk) and Georgia (South Ossetia and Abkhazia) have {{expressed a desire to}} join the Eurasian Customs Union and integrate into the Eurasian Economic Union.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{with the}} European Union in 2014 have {{increased}} both unions to pressure post-Soviet states <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> integration unions. Both sides have accused each other of carving spheres of influence. Members of the union, especially Russia {{have tried to}} diversify their trade by signing economic agreements with China, Iran and Turkey. Trade with North and South Korea has also risen.|$|E

5|$|A {{supporter}} of nine-man baseball teams, Adams favored a measure in 1856 which allowed for players {{from outside the}} Knickerbockers <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared. No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13–11 vote, {{in favor of a}} rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).|$|E
5|$|African Americans were {{originally}} {{admitted to the}} university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E

5|$|After the Jacobite rising of 1745, Adam's {{position}} as Mason to the Board of Ordnance {{brought him a}} number of large military contracts in the Highlands. In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant, and Adam was quick to put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post. His three eldest sons were all involved in the family business by 1746, James and John both leaving Edinburgh University early <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> father.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{measures}} have included attempts to breed them in captivity {{and to reduce}} fatalities to young at their natural nesting sites. Nearly 15% of the chicks are killed when they fall off the nests and die of starvation, so some conservationists have used nets positioned below the nests to prevent injuries to falling young and then raising these fallen birds in enclosures for about five months before releasing them <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> wild siblings.|$|E

50|$|All {{recruits}} {{applying for}} service with the battalion undergo {{the same basic}} training as every other recruit in the Armed Forces (3 months). Though {{they are required to}} undertake a selection course in order to be considered for further training and service with the battalion. Further training to become a Ranger with the battalion is 6 months long, similar in length to what all soldiers/sailors undergo prior <b>to</b> <b>joining</b> <b>their</b> units.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the party can talk with demons they encounter, {{and through a}} negotiation process persuade them <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> party. Using a special location in the game world, players can fuse two different demons into a new demon, with the new demon inheriting skills from both its parents. The choices made by the protagonist during the story impact which demons can be recruited. The attitude of demons towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full.|$|E

There is also a Level Editor available, where players can access developer tools and create their own levels which can be shared with other players. The editor features {{a large amount of}} options for environment customization, including adjusting the shade of environmental elements like roads.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} Roman {{citizens}} were also regularly recruited to the auxilia. Most likely, {{the majority of}} citizen recruits to auxiliary regiments were the sons of auxiliary veterans who were enfranchised on their fathers' discharge. Many such may have preferred <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> fathers' old regiments, which were a kind of extended family to them, rather than join a much larger, unfamiliar legion. There are also instances of legionaries transferring to the auxilia (to a higher rank). The incidence of citizens in the auxilia would thus have grown steadily over time until, after the grant of citizenship to all peregrini in 212, auxiliary regiments became predominantly, if not exclusively, citizen units.|$|E

5|$|L.A.P.D. {{formed in}} Bakersfield, California, in 1989. The band was started with Richard Morrill, James Shaffer, and Reginald Arvizu. With both guitarist and bass guitar {{positions}} filled, {{there was still}} a need for a lead vocalist, as well as a percussionist. The group asked Pete Capra <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> band. Capra joined the band and was positioned as lead vocalist. Although he had not been a vocalist for other bands, Capra introduced the group to bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More. The group was inspired by the bands that Capra had shown them, and committed to head into those band's genres and style.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile Erika 'Rika' Wallen, born Lovisa Erika Jakobson in 1874 on a {{farm near}} Örebro Sweden, immigrated with her sister in 1891 to the United States. They {{traveled}} to Minneapolis, Minnesota <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> brother Carl Jakobson. There they changed their last name to Wallen to distinguish themselves from the many other Jacobsons and Jakobsons. After Carl died in an accident, the sisters moved to San Francisco, which they heard was booming. Rika {{took a job as}} a cook for the Hills Brothers coffee family, which lasted until the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Nigerian guerrillas {{arrive at}} a small village, grab a young boy named Yemi and try {{to force him to}} shoot an old man. The boy hesitates and his older brother, Eko, takes the gun and shoots the man himself, thus saving his brother from the act. The guerrillas are pleased with this, and force him <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> group, tearing his Christian cross from his neck, which is then taken by Yemi.|$|E

5|$|Simpson {{decided to}} move to the {{continent}} for a better chance at success, and contacted French brothers Robert and Yvon Murphy, whom he met while racing. They agreed that he could stay with them in the Breton fishing port of Saint-Brieuc. His final event in Britain was at Herne Hill, riding motor-paced races. Simpson won the event and was invited to Germany to train for the 1959 motor-paced world championships, but declined the opportunity in favour of a career on the road. Bicycle manufacturer Elswick Hopper invited him <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> British-based team, but Benny Foster advised him to continue with his plans to move to France.|$|E
5|$|The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> {{exhibition}} basketball squad. Russell, who {{was sensitive}} to any racial prejudice, was enraged {{by the fact}} that owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the matter with Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|The Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) was {{organised}} {{under the}} control of the Propaganda Ministry in September 1933. Sub-chambers were set up to control aspects of cultural life such as film, radio, newspapers, fine arts, music, theatre and literature. Members of these professions were required <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>their</b> respective organisation. Jews and people considered politically unreliable were prevented from working in the arts and many emigrated. Books and scripts had to be approved by the Propaganda Ministry prior to publication. Standards deteriorated as the regime sought to use cultural outlets exclusively as propaganda media.|$|E
