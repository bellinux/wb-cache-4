The jail is {{significant}} as a relatively unaltered historic jail <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to the 18th-century Bristol County. It is also significant in that it currently serves as the home of the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society. The Society also houses its library and collections in the jail and runs a small museum shop from the building.|$|E

5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E

5|$|Johan Huizinga (1872â€“1945) {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important.</b> The Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|Gnostics tended toward asceticism, {{especially}} in their sexual and dietary practice. In {{other areas of}} morality, Gnostics were less rigorously ascetic, and took a more moderate approach to correct behaviour. In normative early Christianity the Church administered and prescribed the correct behaviour for Christians, while in Gnosticism it was the internalised motivation <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important.</b> Ritualistic behaviour was not important unless {{it was based on}} a personal, internal motivation.

The {{eastern edge of the}} Rocky Mountains was a major migration route <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The Ancient Pueblo peoples lived in the valleys and mesas of the Colorado Plateau. The Ute Nation inhabited the mountain valleys of the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Western Rocky Mountains, even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The Apache and the Comanche also inhabited Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. At times, the Arapaho Nation and the Cheyenne Nation moved west to hunt across the High Plains.|$|E

25|$|Mara {{starred in}} the 2008 film Stone of Destiny, written and {{directed}} by Charles Martin Smith, about the theft of the Stone of Scone on Christmas Day, 1950. Mara played Kay Matheson, one of four students that removed the stone in a Scottish nationalist plot. The period adventure-comedy co-starred Billy Boyd, Robert Carlyle and Charlie Cox. Filming began in June 2007 in locations around Glasgow. She employed a Scottish accent for the role, which she found very difficult to master. Mara felt lucky and proud to play a role <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to people's heritage. She stayed near the Botanic Gardens in the city's West End while filming, attending the film premiere at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on June 21, 2008.

25|$|Little {{is known}} of Starkey's early education. Prior {{to the death of}} his father in 1637, Starkey most likely was tutored, perhaps by his parents or learned acquaintances of the family. After the death of the elder Stirk, Starkey was sent to New England around 1639 to {{continue}} his studies. In 1643 he matriculated at Harvard College, where he was exposed to a core curriculum in the classical languages and theology in addition to courses in logic, physics, mathematics, politics, and history. His studies soon focused on chemical philosophy and alchemist theory. Starkey earned his A.B. in 1646 and his A.M. by 1649, although the exact date is uncertain. During his years at Harvard, Starkey was introduced to alchemy through the physics curriculum, which included subjects on metallic transmutation and potable gold. In addition, he acquired a thorough understanding of corpuscular matter theory <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to his alchemist work throughout his career.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, a {{study of}} the dog genome {{compared}} to the wolf genome looked for genes that showed signs of having undergone positive selection. The study identified genes relating to brain function and behavior, and to lipid metabolism. This ability to process lipids indicates a dietary target of selection <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> when proto-dogs hunted and fed alongside hunter-gatherers. The evolution of the dietary metabolism genes may have helped process the increased lipid content of early dog diets as they scavenged on the remains of carcasses left by hunter-gatherers. Prey capture rates may have increased in comparison to wolves and with it the amount of lipid consumed by the assisting proto-dogs. A unique dietary selection pressure may have evolved both from the amount consumed, and the shifting composition of, tissues that were available to proto-dogs once humans had removed the most desirable parts of the carcass for themselves. A study of the mammal biomass during modern human expansion into the northern Mammoth steppe found that it had occurred under conditions of unlimited resources, and that many of the animals were killed with only a small part consumed or left unused.|$|E

The pilot episode was mostly shot at various locations in and around New York City including the Silvercup Studios, where principal photography lasted for two days. Most of the production crew were previously part of The Sopranos. After filming concluded in New York, production moved to the Los Angeles Center Studios. Abraham collaborated with an entirely different production crew from the one in New York. According to Abraham, Los Angeles contained a continuity that {{was related to the}} show.

500|$|The fourth English edition, {{published}} in 1769, was personally supervised by Franklin while visiting London from Philadelphia. He made several corrections on {{different parts of}} the first three editions and wrote explanatory notes. One important correction Franklin noted in the Forward was that Letters 1 and 2 had been transposed and he had corrected that. He added a letter <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to him. It was a letter to Collinson dated March 28, 1747. Franklin had thanked him for the gift of the German [...] "electric tube" [...] with directions on how to use it to make electricity. He was much appreciative of this, so he made that particular one Letter #1. This then advanced the numbering sequence of the Letters by one from the first three editions.|$|E

500|$|Rock critic Paul Williams {{saw that}} Anderle's idea to form Brother Records was reasonable, [...] "but {{the time it}} takes to put this type of thing through the courts was not conducive to the {{production}} race <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> during this period of radical change in pop." [...] In the months leading up to Smiley Smiles release, a multitude of revolutionary rock albums were received by an anxious and maturing youth market as Wilson's image was reduced to that of an [...] "eccentric" [...] figure. From February to May 1967, this included Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's Are You Experienced, the Velvet Underground's The Velvet Underground and Nico, and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Up until this point, the Beatles were the only act that posed a competitive threat to the Beach Boys, and Wilson was concerned that if Smile followed in the wake of another critically successful release by the Beatles, that his album would be received with unjust comparisons. Once they released Sgt. Pepper, Wilson's race was effectively lost.|$|E
500|$|Because of the railroad, Wytheville was {{connected}} to two more points of military significance. A small headquarters for the Confederate army was located about [...] west of Wytheville at the western edge the adjacent Smyth County. The army outpost was at the community named Saltville, which was {{the home of a}} salt mine <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to the Confederacy. Salt is essential for the diet of humans and livestock, and was also used (at the time) to preserve meat. Salt was not widely available during the Civil War, and eight states used salt from this mine. More fighting would occur at Saltville in 1864. About [...] east of Wytheville in Pulaski County is the Dublin railroad depot, which was a regional headquarters for the Confederate Army. The Dublin Depot was originally named Newbern Depot, although the town of Newbern is [...] south of the railroad line. A short time before the Civil War, the depot was renamed Dublin Depot in honor of the New Dublin Presbyterian Church, which was located nearby. Thus, some maps from the early 1860s still used New Bern to identify the depot.|$|E
500|$|Kinne Cemetery, {{also known}} as the Glasgo Cemetery and Old Kinne Burying Ground, is a {{historic}} cemetery in Jarvis Road in Griswold, Connecticut. The earliest marked stone is for Daniel Kinne who died in 1713. In the 1930s, the inscriptions of 79 stones in the Kinne Cemetery were recorded for the Hale Index. There are around 80 fieldstones with no carving or identification, but it is unknown if this stems from wearing of the gneiss stone or that there were no skilled carvers locally available. The seven carvers that have been identified are Lebbeus Kimball, Jotham Warren, Josiah Manning, Peter Barker, Mr. Huntington of Lebanon, E. Marston of Mystic Bridge and O. Doty of Stonington. The National Historic Register of Places nomination notes, [...] "the cemetery is significant artistically because the carving on the stones gives many good examples of the funerary art that was characteristic of the 18th and 19th centuries in New England." [...] The cemetery is notable because of the burial of Isaac C. Glasko, the namesake of the village of Glasgo, and a prominent African American land-holding man who ran a blacksmith shop <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to the marine industry of the area. The cemetery was made apart of the Connecticut Freedom Trail in 1995 and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 12, 2001.|$|E
