5|$|Many {{environmental}} {{scientists believe}} amphibians, including frogs, are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health {{because of their}} intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults). It appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline, while those with direct development are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>resistant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars appear to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>resistant,</b> while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as the poison has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where the poison is found in plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{diet and}} {{physiology}} of Edmontosaurus have been probed by using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen as recorded in tooth enamel. When feeding, drinking, and breathing, animals take in carbon and oxygen, which become incorporated into bone. The isotopes {{of these two}} elements are determined by various internal and external factors, such as the type of plants being eaten, the physiology of the animal, salinity, and climate. If isotope ratios in fossils are not altered by fossilization and later changes, they can be studied {{for information about the}} original factors; warmblooded animals will have certain isotopic compositions compared to their surroundings, animals that eat certain types of plants or use certain digestive processes will have distinct isotopic compositions, and so on. Enamel is typically used because the structure of the mineral that forms enamel makes it <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>resistant</b> material to chemical change in the skeleton.|$|E

25|$|The Atlantic {{coast of}} the United States is low, with minor exceptions. The Appalachian Highland owes its oblique northeast-southwest trend to crustal {{deformations}} which in very early geological time gave a beginning to what later came to be the Appalachian mountain system. This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or {{to the survival of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>resistant</b> rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land. Additionally, the southeastern section has undergone an elevation resulting in the advance of the land upon the sea.|$|E
25|$|Of all the oaks, the Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>resistant</b> to {{drought and}} the continental-style climate. These forests, of a sub-Atlantic character, often {{represent}} {{the shift from}} Mediterranean vegetation to Atlantic vegetation. They cover a wide area of the peninsula and are of great importance, above all on the mountain ranges in {{the centre of the}} peninsula; from the interior of Galicia and extending south of the Cordillera Cantábrica they extend throughout the Sistema Central, reaching, to the south, (though scarce by the time they reach this region) the Sierra Nevada and Cádiz. They usually extend from some 700 to 800 metres to some 1500 to 1600 m in altitude. They prefer siliceous soil and, as altitude increases, they replace the damp oak forests and cork oak; on the high ground they give way to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests or to los piornales serranos with creeping juniper. In areas where the influence of the Atlantic is more evident, they are taken over by heather and Erica australis; in the remainder, in clearings and in more degraded phases, rock rose (Cistaceae) mixed with laurel leaf and Spanish lavender (Lavandula stoechas) is more frequent. Their natural range is usually covered by forests of Scots pine or maritime pine.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Hamilton Lytle {{believes}} {{these estimates}} unrealistic, even assuming that Carson can be [...] "blamed" [...] for worldwide DDT policies. John Quiggin and Tim Lambert have written that [...] "the most striking {{feature of the}} claim against Carson is {{the ease with which}} it can be refuted." [...] DDT was never banned for anti-malarial use, (its ban for agricultural use in the United States in 1972 did not apply outside the US or to anti-malaria spraying; the international treaty that banned most uses of DDT and other organochlorine pesticides—the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants—included an exemption for DDT for the use of malaria control until affordable substitutes could be found.) Mass outdoor spraying of DDT was abandoned in poor countries subject to malaria, such as Sri Lanka, in the 1970s and 1980s, not because of government prohibitions, but because the DDT had lost its ability to kill the mosquitoes (because of insects' very short breeding cycle and large number of offspring, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>resistant</b> insects that survive and pass on their genetic traits to their offspring replace the pesticide-slain insects relatively rapidly. Agricultural spraying of pesticides produces resistance to the pesticide in seven to ten years).|$|E

2500|$|Statistical {{research}} has shown that the various phenotypes are more, or less, likely to suffer a variety of diseases. For example, an individual's susceptibility to cholera (and other diarrheal infections) is correlated with their blood type: those with type O blood are the most susceptible, while those with type AB are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>resistant.</b> Between these two extremes are the A and B blood types, with type A being more resistant than type B. This suggests that the pleiotropic effects of the genes set up opposing selective forces, thus maintaining a balance.

2500|$|Bone - {{being one}} of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>resistant</b> {{materials}} {{to the process of}} fossilisation - often preserves internal detail, which allows the histology and growth of the scales to be studied in detail. The scales consist of a non-growing [...] "crown" [...] composed of dentine, with a sometimes-ornamented enameloid upper surface and an aspidine (acellular bony tissue) base. Its growing base is made of cell-free bone, which sometimes developed anchorage structures to fix it {{in the side of the}} fish. Beyond that, there appear to be five types of bone-growth, which may represent five natural groupings within the thelodonts - or a spectrum ranging between the end members, meta- (or ortho-) dentine and mesodentine tissues. Interestingly, each of the five scale morphs appears to resemble the scales of more derived groupings of fish, suggesting that thelodont groups may have been stem groups to succeeding clades of fish.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experimental}} marine epoxy coatings {{on steel}} substrates were tested under four-point bend cyclic-loading in both simulated sea water, at two temperatures, and in air. Freshly prepared and artificially aged coatings were examined. The samples were characterised by sectioning, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and EDX elemental analysis. The ageing processes used had multiple stages involving temperature cycles and/or repeated water soaking and drying. The coatings were loaded at strain amplitudes of 0. 15 % and 0. 22 % for 500, 000 cycles at frequencies simulating wave action. The coatings showed high fatigue resistance, so slot defects of different depths and widths were introduced to simulate damage in service and to act as crack initiators. This permitted observation of crack propagation under cyclic loading. Additionally, plastic substrates were tried so that tests at higher coating strains of 1. 33 % could be performed. The {{results showed that the}} softest epoxy coating was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> fatigue <b>resistant.</b> An epoxy containing large filler particles (50 gm diameter) was <b>the</b> next <b>most</b> <b>resistant</b> while a hard epoxy with small filler particles showed multiple fatigue cracking after 300, 000 cycles when tested on steel substrates. No fatigue cracks were observed on aged coatings. Internal stress measurements were performed that showed the coating which was <b>most</b> <b>resistant</b> to fatigue had the lowest internal stress of around 2 MPa. The other coatings internal stress levels were over 15 MPa. Tensile tests on free-films indicated that <b>the</b> coating <b>most</b> <b>resistant</b> to fatigue showed the lowest tensile strength, approximately 10 MPa, and the highest strain to failure, the latter property being the more important one. Hardness measurements using micro and macro Vickers indentors were performed between stages of an ageing process, along with nano-indentation (to measure Young's modulus) showing that the softest coating exhibited low elasticity.
