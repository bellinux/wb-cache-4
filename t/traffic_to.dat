5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{transferred}} {{maintenance of}} Queens Chapel Road from MD 410 to US 1 {{to the town}} of University Park in August 1988 ahead of the construction of the Washington Metro's Green Line underneath the town; the town subsequently closed the road through town. A 1991 traffic study showed the majority of traffic along the University Park segment of Queens Chapel Road was through traffic before it was closed, and recommended the highway be closed {{at the southern end of}} town and only allow <b>traffic</b> <b>to</b> exit the town onto US 1. After Metro construction was completed in the summer of 1992, the University Park Town Council elected to keep the road closed to through traffic; this measure was affirmed by a town referendum in January 1993.
