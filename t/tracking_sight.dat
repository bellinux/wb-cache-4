After a failed initial design, an improved design was developed in 1979 and ready for evaluation in 1984. The Type 87 gun was accepted for service in 1987. It has the same layout as the original model and consists of two automatic, recoil-operated cannons, a two-wheel cartridge, a Type 86 infrared <b>tracking</b> <b>sight</b> and two 40-round ammunition magazines. The Type 87 fires in either single shot or burst mode, with a cyclic rate of fire of 600~700 rounds/min and has a muzzle velocity of 1,050 m/s.|$|E

This paper provides a method of designing a sliding mode control for an active magnetic hearing(AMB) system {{which is used to}} support the elevation axis of a target <b>tracking</b> <b>sight</b> instead of mechanical bearings to eliminate the effect of mechanical friction. In such system, the axis should be levitated and supported within a predetermined air gap while AMB is excited by base motion.

40|$|The {{results from}} {{intensive}} small scale surveys are {{often difficult to}} extrapolate to wider spatial scales, yet an understanding at such scales is critical for assessing the minimum densities and populations of rare and wide ranging species. In this paper, the minimum size of population and minimum density estimates of Bengal Tigers Panthera tigris tigris and its prey were conducted from 2005 to 2007 using camera traps for 90 days and using distance sampling surveys for over 200 days, respectively. The results were extrapolated from the core study area in Katka-Kochikhali, southeastern Sundarbans, to five additional sites using indices of abundance. With the use of 10 camera-traps at 15 trap-points, field data provided a total of 829 photos, including seven photos of five individual tigers. A total of 5. 0 (SE = 0. 98) tigers (adults and sub-adults) are thus estimated in the core area with an estimated density of 4. 8 tigers/ 100 km 2. Distance sampling surveys conducted on large mammalian prey species obtained an overall density estimate of 27. 9 individuals/km 2 and a biomass density of 1, 037 kg/km 2. Indices of abundance were obtained by using tiger <b>track</b> <b>sighting</b> rates (number of tracks/km of riverbank) and the sighting rates of the prey species (number of prey/km of riverbank) in the core area and in five additional sites across the region. The densities of tiger <b>tracks</b> and <b>sighting</b> rates of prey were strongly correlated suggesting a wide scale relationship between predator and prey in the region. By combining the estimates of absolute density with indices of abundance, an average of 3. 7 tigers/ 100 km 2 across the region is estimated, which given an area of 5, 770 km 2, predicts a minimum of approximately 200 tigers in the Bangladesh Sundarbans...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRegarding traffic safety, railway {{crossings}} {{are crucial}} {{points in the}} rail and road network. In Hungary the safety ranking of railway crossings has been performed since 1993 and {{the results have been}} used for selecting unsafe locations and for prioritizing safety measures. Prioritization is based on a complex point system taking into account accident data, traffic volumes and various traffic engineering aspects. Weights of various indicators were based on engineering judgement. Although this method has been renewed a few times, {{there is a need to}} update this method involving more thorough statistical methods. The objective of this paper is to calibrate a new model and to compare it with previous models. A sample of about 1700 railway crossings satisfying a few requirements (railway with public service, traffic volume data available) was set up. The first part of the paper describes data collection. Five years (2010 – 2014) of accident data, AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic) for rail and road, speed limits and further data (road pavement width, control devices, crossing angle, alignment, number of <b>tracks,</b> <b>sight</b> distances) were gathered. The modeling was conducted in two steps. First, each variable was entered into the model alone to see which ones significantly affect accident frequency. As a next step, two-variable models were built where expected injury accident frequency is predicted by annual daily road traffic and annual daily rail traffic. The sample was also split up into subgroups based on the type of control devices in order to analyze their effect on safety. Models are proposed using the Generalized Linear Modeling approach (GLM) assuming a negative binomial error structure. The results give estimation of the impacts of explanatory factors on the safety of railway crossings. Annual daily road traffic and annual daily train traffic are significant predictors. A number of predictors such as crossing angle, track alignment, number of <b>tracks</b> and <b>sight</b> distances turned out to be not significant. As far as the type of control devices are concerned, as expected coefficients are decreasing, hence safety is increasing in the following order: passive crossings, flashing lights, flashing lights + half barriers. Based on the above results, the complex point system used by practitioners for safety ranking was simplified considerably leaving out variables which turned out to be not significant...|$|R
