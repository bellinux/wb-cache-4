5|$|One {{advantage}} of this camera system is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the game designers to use the language of film. Indeed, like filmmakers, they have the possibility to create a mood through camerawork and careful selection of shots. Games that use this kind of technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities.|$|E
5|$|It {{is largely}} an {{empirical}} procedure, {{and has a}} reasonable safety record {{within the scope of}} its intended application. Advantages are reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple rule-based procedure which can be done underwater by the diver. It requires the use of specific gas mixtures for given depth ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the depth is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual depth, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> deep dives without the use of an expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a {{six degrees of}} freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas.|$|E
50|$|Active Desktop worked {{much like}} desktop widget {{technology}} in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> users to place customized {{information on their}} desktop.|$|R
25|$|The Sikh Empire was {{idiosyncratic}} in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> {{men from}} religions {{other than their}} own to rise to commanding positions of authority.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1912 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> houses to be built from {{materials}} other than wood, giving the town a distinctive appearance.|$|R
5|$|Once a field {{had been}} selected, an observing {{strategy}} {{had to be}} developed. An important decision was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters useful {{for the study of}} the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the 'throughput' of each filter—the total proportion of light <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.|$|E
25|$|The Rhynie chert (410 Ma) of Scotland has {{remains of}} a Devonian land flora and fauna with {{preservation}} so perfect <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> cellular studies of the fossils.|$|E
25|$|A final {{advantage}} {{of this approach is}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> for natural direct descriptions of many of the fundamental objects of study to differential geometry and topology.|$|E
50|$|Van Paassen spoke Dutch, French, English, {{and some}} Ruthenian (a {{language}} similar enough to Ukrainian <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> him to converse passably with many Russians), and later learned Hebrew.|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{it was an}} {{internet}} radio service. It was different in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> for direct customization of stations, including the ability to weight the stations to only play the seeds.|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} aspect of the Act is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> injured sailors to obtain compensation from their employers for the negligence of the owner, the captain, or fellow members of the crew.|$|R
25|$|The {{value of}} this deal is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> Advance/Newhouse to more {{directly}} control their cable investments without having to completely unravel the TWEAN partnership, which does bring some benefits via Time Warner's development and purchasing clout.|$|E
25|$|One {{interpretation}} of the Jeffries case is that while a university cannot fire a professor for opinions and speech, they have more flexibility with a position like department chair. Another is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> public institutions to discipline employees in general for disruptive speech.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} is rather non-specific in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> tests {{in terms of}} high-level software requirements, low-level technical details or anything in between. One {{way of looking at}} BDD therefore, {{is that it is a}} continued development of TDD which makes more specific choices than TDD.|$|E
50|$|One {{criticism}} of Bedlam {{at this time}} was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> paying visitors to observe the lunatics and despite the banning of this practice at St. Luke's, Monro didn't restrict it until 1770.|$|R
5000|$|The carbon-arc {{source was}} so bright <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> film {{directors}} to make [...] "day" [...] at night, which also heralded {{the era of}} blinding actors — a term coined as [...] "Klieg eye".|$|R
50|$|The United States of America's Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 {{broke with}} the common law {{precedent}} of the time, in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> for truth as a defense, though judges were not consistent in their rulings.|$|R
25|$|And the {{standard}} appropriately constrains employers' discretion in making race-based decisions: It limits that discretion to {{cases in which}} there is a strong basis in evidence of disparate-impact liability, but it is not so restrictive <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> employers to act only when there is a provable, actual violation.|$|E
25|$|Alan Scott wields {{a magical}} ring {{that can produce}} a variety of effects. The extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined, but three {{consistent}} traits are <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> him to fly, that its effects are accompanied by a green light, and that it cannot directly affect anything made of wood.|$|E
25|$|It allows {{easy access}} to both formats, making the {{production}} of them easily achieved by anyone {{with access to the}} equipment. Much of the pornography available today is produced by amateurs. Digital media is revolutionary in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> photographers and filmmakers to manipulate images in ways previously not possible, heightening the drama or eroticism of a depiction.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis was {{developed}} for the Xbox 360. The development team {{took advantage of the}} hardware's graphical power, and found <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> them to develop games at a faster pace than with previous hardware.|$|R

2500|$|Maverick's stated {{reason for}} not {{branding}} his cattle was that he didn't want to inflict pain on them. [...] Other ranchers, however, suspected his true motivation was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> him to collect any unbranded cattle and claim them as his own.|$|R
25|$|The {{water law}} has been criticized by the Peruvian Peasant's Association {{claiming}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the privatization of water resources, does not involve local and regional governments in decision-making, promotes private operators in drinking water supply who would control water resources. They also claim that the interests of mining companies, industries and export-oriented agriculture influenced the drafting of the law.|$|E
25|$|This {{method is}} {{advantageous}} in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> multiple mutations {{to be introduced}} into the genome in one experiment. It also has vastly improved efficiency over previous technologies and allows for almost any kind of mutation with ease. These advantages make the CRISPR/Cas9 recombination technique the most promising for application in human health. However, major drawbacks exist, including, most prominently, off-target cleavage that can result in unintended genome disruptions.|$|E
25|$|A draft interim {{constitution}} {{was released on}} 27 September 2006, and received mixed reactions. Structurally, the draft {{was similar to the}} 1991 Constitution, the 1976 Constitution, and the 1959 Charter, in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> an extremely powerful executive branch to appoint the entire legislature. The CDR, which would be transformed into a Council for National Security (CNS), would appoint the head of the executive branch, the entire legislature, and the drafters of a permanent constitution.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 February 2017, the {{majority}} of the German Bishops' Conference published guidelines which were considered to be the broadest interpretation of Amoris Laetitia and stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> communion for the divorced and remarried in only certain cases which involved difficult situations.|$|R

25|$|The {{performance}} (speed) of ext3 is {{less attractive}} than competing Linux filesystems, such as ext4, JFS, ReiserFS, and XFS, but ext3 {{has a significant}} advantage in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> in-place upgrades from ext2 without having to backup and restore data. Benchmarks suggest that ext3 also uses less CPU power than ReiserFS and XFS. It is also considered safer than the other Linux file systems, due to its relative simplicity and wider testing base.|$|E
25|$|Although {{theoretically}} PB biopsy and blastocyst biopsy {{are less}} harmful than cleavage-stage biopsy, {{this is still}} the prevalent method. It is used in approximately 94% of the PGD cycles reported to the ESHRE PGD Consortium. The main reasons are <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> for a safer and more complete diagnosis than PB biopsy and still leaves enough time to finish the diagnosis before the embryos must be replaced in the patient's uterus, unlike blastocyst biopsy.|$|E
25|$|The SDA {{attempts}} {{to have a}} relatively positive relationship with retail employers, with the idea <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> it to negotiate better outcomes for its members than a more confrontational approach because of the reluctance of SDA members to take industrial action, which rarely if ever occurs in the SDA. This reluctance is inherent to the categories of workers who are covered by the SDA - young people {{and women who are}} generally in casual employment.|$|E
5000|$|Withrow {{claimed that}} he {{advocated}} a cell-based organization akin to Leaderless resistance, albeit one that he personally called the [...] "100 Hitlers policy", arguing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> the movement to continue to function even when individual cells were brought down by law enforcement.|$|R
50|$|One {{theory for}} why {{primates}} developed sensitivity to red is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> ripe fruit to {{be distinguished from}} unripe fruit and inedible vegetation. This may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage of this new ability, such as the emergence of red faces.|$|R
50|$|Allmusic praised Ithaca's emotionally raw, 90's sound, stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> Cole to {{work out}} her {{troubles}} while becoming reacquainted with the listener, taking them on a journey of pain and her ultimate rebirth. The album has consistently been compared to Cole's Harbinger and This Fire records.|$|R
