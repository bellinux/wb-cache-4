Adolf Hitler, on board the cruiser Deutschland, personally toured the city and gave a short speech. The armada sailing to Klaipėda included the cruiser Admiral Graf Spee, the light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, and Köln, two destroyer squadrons, three torpedo boat flotillas, and one tender flotilla. At the time the Lithuanian navy had only one warship, the Prezidentas Smetona, a 580-ton converted minesweeper.

5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few rubber plants left in the {{concession}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the rubber. Once this process was completed the rubber tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government {{to reduce the size}} of its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber within the confines of its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{a dispute}} between the FVdG and the Free Trade Unions in Berlin led the party {{commission}} to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re-unification of the two wings of the German labor movement. At the meeting, the FVdG {{made a number of}} compromises, which led to member protests. Soon, over one-third of the members left the union. The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with the Free Trade Unions. This panel demanded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> Trade Unions adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of revisionists from the SPD during the debate on Eduard Bernstein's theses would strengthen their position. The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the Free Trade Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the Free Trade Unions.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E

5|$|Yoga and Vedanta are the {{two largest}} {{surviving}} schools of Hindu traditions. They share many thematic principles, concepts and belief in self/soul, but diverge in degree, style {{and some of their}} methods. Epistemologically, Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways. Yoga disputes the monism of Advaita Vedanta. Yoga school believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity; Advaita Vedanta, in contrast, believes that in the state of moksha, each individual discovers the blissful, liberating sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything, everyone and the Universal Self. They both hold <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> conscience is aloof yet transcendent, liberated and self-aware. Further, Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good, ultimate freedom and jivanmukti.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{was happy}} to take over Abir's {{concession}} as the State had built up sufficient income {{to be able to}} afford to run tax collections by itself. In addition the Free State was embarrassed by the continuing allegations of atrocities caused by Abir and it could institute reforms more effectively if it were in control. Leopold authorised the takeover in the hope <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Free</b> State would be able to resume rubber collection and exports and on 12 September 1906 an agreement was signed which stated that all profits from the concession would go to the Free State in return for payment to Abir of 4.5 fr per kilogram of rubber harvested until 1952. Leopold told Abir's shareholders that he expected exports to return to normal levels within two years. To restore control the Free State dispatched a force of 650 men and 12 European officers under the command of Inspector Gerard to the concession. They returned four months later, leaving some areas still rebellious and with news that there were almost no rubber plants left. As a result, the quotas expected per man were cut to just 6kg of rubber per year, with some struggling to find even that much. State income was therefore negligible whilst the costs of controlling the concession continued to increase. Throughout this time Abir was still making a profit by taking its share of the rubber exported for almost no expenditure.|$|E

40|$|The microalga, Chlorella vulgaris, was immobilized in {{carrageenan}} gel. The {{growth of}} C. vulgaris in the carrageenan matrix exhibited a one day longer lag period {{when compared with}} <b>the</b> <b>free</b> cells. However, growth of the immobilized cells in the log phase was nor hindered, as shown from the specific growth constant (k) which was virtually <b>the</b> same as <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>free</b> cells (0. 397 vs 0. 362 d(- 1)). The rare of chlorophyll synthesis in the immobilized cells was double <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>free</b> cells, compensating for the self-shading or gel-screening effect. The depletion of the nutrient ions, nitrate and phosphate, from the medium showed {{no significant difference between}} <b>the</b> immobilized and <b>free</b> cells. For <b>the</b> activity of nitrate reductase, though the immobilized cells had assimilated a similar amount of nitrate as <b>the</b> <b>free</b> cells, their kinetic profiles were different. The nitrate reductase activity increased more slowly than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>free</b> cells and had a maximal level about half <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>free</b> cells (300 vs 700 x 10 (6) mu mol NO 2 mu g protein(- 1) h(- 1)). The decline in the nitrate reductase activity in the immobilized cells was also less drastic than <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>free</b> cells upon <b>the</b> depletion of nitrate ions in the medium. This study provided evidence that carrageenan gel had no adverse effect on the growth and physiology of the immobilized microalga. The enzyme activity was also conserved in the immobilized cells. Carrageenan could thus be an alternative gel matrix for immobilizing microalgae. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
