5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to <b>the</b> <b>dealership</b> to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items <b>the</b> <b>dealership</b> has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E

50|$|Auto rows, like mall food courts, are {{an example}} of the economies of agglomeration. Even though being grouped {{together}} increases immediate competition, the auto row becomes more of destination for consumers and benefits all <b>the</b> <b>dealerships.</b> Many consumers may want to test drive automobiles from multiple companies before making a purchase and the auto row provides one stop shopping. Competing dealerships also often share advertising costs to promote their single destination under an agreed-upon marketing name. Auto rows attract ancillary businesses including car washes, insurance offices, and body shops that benefit all of <b>the</b> <b>dealerships.</b>|$|R

5|$|After two weeks, when <b>the</b> <b>dealership</b> {{had sold}} every print it had, Ortiz removed the display.

Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. South Africa's {{automotive}} industry {{has become an}} increasingly important contributor to the country's gross domestic product, largely through the strong growth in the motor vehicle and component exporting sector. The South African Motor Industry is ranked 20 th {{in the world in}} terms of vehicle production. It is responsible for an estimated 80 % of Africa's vehicle productivity and makes 0. 85 % of the world's vehicles. In this study, the {{automotive industry}} in South Africa is investigated, how it was influenced during the recession which started at the end of 2008 and went through the 2009 period, what effect it had on the market as well as the influence on sales during that period. In the literature section, the 4 P's of the marketing mix are explained and discussed as well as how it influences the automotive industry. The purpose of this study is to see specifically how <b>the</b> Klerksdorp <b>dealerships</b> were influenced by the recession and what decisions they had undertaken to tackle the problems that they encountered. This study also investigates what influences the marketing mix had on <b>the</b> different <b>dealerships</b> in Klerksdorp area. From the empirical study done, the conclusion is that <b>the</b> <b>dealerships</b> in Klerksdorp were struggling through the economic crisis. As far as the product was concerned, <b>the</b> different <b>dealerships</b> concentrated on <b>the</b> best selling lines during the recession period. Very few dealerships adjusted their prices and very few offered extras that were already included in the price. With the promotion, it was actually established that <b>the</b> <b>dealerships</b> did not actually put any extra effort in order to promote their vehicles. Four out of nine dealerships decreased their promotion expenditure, while the other five kept it at the same level. None of <b>the</b> <b>dealerships</b> has increased their promotional spending during the time of recession. Finally, the recommendations to <b>the</b> <b>dealerships,</b> as how to improve the marketing and sales through the correct use of the marketing mix, especially through the use of promotion in <b>the</b> Klerksdorp <b>dealerships</b> were made.

In many markets, {{such as the}} U.S., <b>the</b> <b>dealership</b> network is a distinct organization from corporate headquarters, with separately owned and operated Lexus showrooms. By contrast, in Japan all 143 dealerships {{in the country are}} owned and operated by Lexus. Several markets have a designated, third party regional distributor; for example, in the United Arab Emirates, sales operations are managed by Al-Futtaim Motors LLC, and in Costa Rica, Lexus vehicles are sold via regional distributor Purdy Motors S.A. Other officially sanctioned regional distributors have sold Lexus models prior to the launch of, or in absence of, a dedicated dealership network.|$|E

5|$|At first clients sent hole-punched {{accounting}} records to a Reynolds processing center, which would print a complete accounting that is {{sent back to}} the client by mail. The development of modems and internet technology in the 1970s led to several advancements. Reynolds provided 3,600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978. The modems communicated with Reynolds' VIM-brand minicomputers at 80 Reynolds locations, which provided computing power and printed forms. This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to Reynolds in tapes and allowed daily access to online services. By the end of the 1970s, batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at <b>the</b> <b>dealership.</b> In the years 1978 and 1982, Reynolds introduced VIM-brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships.|$|E
