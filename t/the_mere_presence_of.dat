5|$|The Soviet {{entry into}} the war {{prompted}} French communists to join the French Resistance, augmenting its presence in Brittany significantly. The majority of Breton nationalists adopted a neutral stance, refusing to join French collaborationist units such as Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism, while sharing their hatred of what they perceived as a worldwide Judeo-Bolshevist conspiracy. In the meantime, Breton nationalists became targets of a guerilla campaign waged by Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, who continued to view them as traitors. The first such killing took place on 4 September 1943, with the shooting of Yann Bricler, a relative of Breton nationalist Olier Mordrel. Lainé decided to directly aid the Germans in their anti partisan operations, hoping {{for a change in}} policy regarding the question of Breton independence. He believed that <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a purely Breton force would inspire others to join his cause.|$|E

Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well.* Stylianou, Diodorus Siculus, 510512 Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a series of {{introductory}} programming workshops, initially targeting female high school students, which utilised Lego Mindstorms robots. Cognitive load theory (CLT) was applied to the instructional design of the workshops, and a controlled experiment was also conducted investigating aspects of the interface. Results indicated that a truncated interface led to better learning by novice programmers as measured by test performance by participants, as well as enhanced shifts in self-efficacy and lowered perception of difficulty. There was also a transfer effect to another programming environment (Alice). It is argued that the results indicate that for novice programmers, <b>the</b> <b>mere</b> <b>presence</b> on-screen <b>of</b> additional (redundant) entities acts as a form of tacit distraction, thus impeding learning. The utility of CLT to analyse, design and deliver aspects of computer programming environments and instructional materials is discussed...|$|R

However, he felt that [...] "the spectral swirlings are all a bit Raiders of the Lost Ark". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk felt that [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] was [...] "terribly, terribly disappointing" [...] on first viewing, as Rose and the Doctor's characterisation did not drive the plot and the story was reduced to playing it safe and being [...] "ordinary", as it just made the aliens evil instead of discussing their morality. Despite this, he wrote that the story was still enjoyable, with a [...] "delightfully ludicrous" [...] set-up, [...] "vividly realized" [...] period setting, and the characterisation of Dickens. Burk's coauthor, Robert Smith? , called the episode a [...] "complete mess". He felt that Gatiss was attempting to recreate the classic series, but that it came across as [...] "half-hearted". He felt that there was no moral dilemma and Sneed underwent an unsettling character change. While he noted that Eccleston and Piper were [...] "excellent", he felt that Rose and the Doctor's developing relationship was not subtle.|$|E

These changes in persistence occurred despite the inability of these others to witness or evaluate the participants.

In January 1944, when the Second Arakan Offensive was met by a Japanese counter-offensive, the Indian 7th Infantry Division was quickly surrounded along with parts of the Indian 5th Infantry Division and the 81st (West Africa) Division. The 7th Indian Division's defence was based largely on the [...] "Admin Box" [...] formed initially from drivers, cooks and suppliers. [...] They were supplied by air, thus negating {{the importance of their}} lost supply lines. The Japanese forces were able to halt the offensive into Arakan but were unable to decisively defeat the allied forces or advance beyond the surrounded formations. In early 1944, the Japanese Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo approved of plans for victory in Asia, calling for two operations, Operation U-Go as the invasion of India was code-named and Operation Ichi-Go which was intended to defeat China once and for all. The two operations in India and China were closely linked given that American supplies for China were flown over [...] "the Hump" [...] of the Himalayas and the Japanese wanted to take the Assam province of India in part to close the American air bases in India that sustained China {{at the same time that}} they were launching Operation Ichi-Go, the biggest Japanese offensive of all time that involved 2 million men. The Japanese knew that they lacked the logistics to invade India, and the plans for U-Go were based on the assumption that the 14th Army would just collapse, allowing the 15th Army to capture enough food to prevent its men from starving to death.
