5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> service bell of 4¼ cwt, {{known as}} the Mears bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1820. It was {{repaired}} there in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Ganoga Glen has ten named waterfalls in 1.1miles (1.8km). It is 1.8miles (2.9km) from PA 118 in {{the south}} to Waters Meet and the {{southern}} end of Ganoga Glen.

5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E
5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant to a limited range of depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E
5|$|Other mosques in the Old City {{include the}} Mamluk-era Sayed Hashem Mosque that {{believed}} {{to house the}} tomb of Hashem ibn Abd al-Manaf in its dome. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> nearby Kateb al-Welaya Mosque {{that dates back to}} 1334. In Shuja'iyya is the Ibn Uthman Mosque, which was built by Nablus native Ahmad ibn Uthman in 1402, and the Mahkamah Mosque built by Mamluk majordomo Birdibak al-Ashrafi in 1455. In Tuffah is the Ibn Marwan Mosque, which was built in 1324 and houses the tomb of Ali ibn Marwan, a holy man.|$|E

5|$|Since 2008 {{they have}} {{played at the}} Stade de l'Épopée, a stadium which holds about 12,000 spectators. The rugby club in Calais is Amicale Rugby Calaisien. Basketball is popular in Calais with the teams Calais Basket (male) and COB Calais (female) as is volleyball with the Lis Calais (male) and Stella Calais (female) teams. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> SOC club which caters {{in a range of}} sports {{including}} athletics, handball and football and Yacht Club de Calais, a yachting club. Calais also has Les Seagulls, an American football team.|$|E
5|$|The National Library of Wales is at Aberystwyth {{and there}} is {{information}} on local history at the Ceredigion Museum, also in Aberystwyth. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> technical museum Internal Fire – Museum of Power, which is at Tan-y-groes near the coast road. Stately homes in the county {{open to the public}} include the Hafod Estate and Llanerchaeron.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility}} that tribal differences {{were part of}} the Neolithic cultural landscape. Unstan Ware pottery is associated with small settlements like Knap of Howar, and stalled tombs such as Midhowe. Grooved Ware pottery on the other hand tends to be associated with larger 'village' settlements like Skara Brae and Barnhouse, and with Maes Howe style tombs.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> club sports (non-IHSAA) of cheerleading, boys' and girls' rugby, boys' volleyball, boys' hockey, and boys' and girls' bowling.|$|R
25|$|JIS and Shift JIS – Principally Japanese encodings, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> basic 33 Russian Cyrillic letters (in upper- and lower-case).|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> {{mountable}} robots {{that can}} carry their passengers almost anywhere {{they need to}} go. Some of the Japanese robots move through rolling.|$|R
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> presumed site of {{a chapel}} near MacLean's Point (just east of the landing place) where an incised cross, {{tentatively}} dated to between the sixth and ninth centuries was found. Archaeological evidence of the Norse presence in the Hebrides is scant, but boat shaped stone settings found {{not far from the}} chapel may be graves from this period of occupation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> 1943 The Battle of Britain in Frank Capra's Why We Fight series. It was {{included}} in an episode of Battlefield Britain.|$|R

5|$|The Marwari is {{descended from}} native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses. The ponies {{were small and}} hardy, but with poor conformation; the {{influence}} of the Arabian blood improved the appearance without compromising the hardiness. The Arabians possibly came ashore from a cargo ship wrecked off India's west coast. Legend in India states that the Arabian ship, containing seven Arabian horses of good breeding, was shipwrecked off the shore of the Kachchh District. These horses were then taken to the Marwar district and used as foundation bloodstock for the Marwari. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> possibility of some Mongolian influence from the north. The breed probably originated in northwest India on the Afghanistan border, as well as in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and takes its name from the Marwar region (also called the Jodhpur region) of India.|$|E
5|$|The Sundanese author M.A.Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist. Rosidi {{writes that}} {{a sense of}} realism was {{promoted}} in Joehana's writings {{through the use of}} references to existing (and often popular) brands of products, including cigars, salted fish, and biscuits (though, as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected to know these products, they are not given any in-text explanation). Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of goods or services, or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat.|$|E
5|$|The {{final vote}} {{has come under}} much {{criticism}} because of the relatively {{small percentage of the}} 9000-strong IAU membership who participated. Besides the fact that most members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the final vote was taken {{on the last day of}} the 10-day event, after many participants had left or were preparing to leave. The claim is that only 424 astronomers were present for the vote, which is less than 5% of the entire community of astronomers. However, sampling 400 representative members out of a population of 9,000 statistically yields a result with good accuracy (confidence interval better than 5%). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to Prague and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.|$|E
