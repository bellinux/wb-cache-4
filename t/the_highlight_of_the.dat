5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in 1988, the Giants started the 1989 season 8–1 and did not allow more than 24 points in any game. After {{suffering}} through a 1–3 stretch, including a 31–10 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in Anaheim, the Giants rallied to win their final three games to secure the second {{best record in the}} NFC at 12–4. The division clinching season finale was highlighted by kick returner Dave Meggett's first career punt return for a touchdown. Though many people predicted an NFC Championship showdown between the Giants and the 49ers, the Giants lost their divisional playoff game to the Rams 19–13 in overtime. <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass over cornerback Mark Collins. After he caught the pass, Anderson raced down the sideline, through the end zone, and into the tunnel that led to the locker rooms, silencing the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Ginóbili {{played with}} the junior Argentine {{national}} team at the 1997 FIBA Under-21 World Championship, where his team finished in 4th place. Ginóbili {{is a member of}} the senior Argentine national basketball team, and made his senior debut during the 1998 FIBA World Championship in Athens.

His best accomplishment as a member of the national team came at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics when Argentina became the first team other than Team USA to win the gold medal in 16 years. <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament was his game-winning buzzer beater with 0.7 seconds remaining, on the opening day of the Olympics, in a game versus Serbia and Montenegro. Ginóbili led the team in both scoring (19.3 points per game) and assists (3.3 assists per game).|$|E
5|$|India {{followed}} the NZ tour with {{a trip to}} Australia. India lost the Test series 3–0 and the margin of defeat was heavy {{in each of these}} matches – 285 runs, 180 runs, innings and 141 runs. <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Test series came in the final Test when V. V. S. Laxman scored 167 at a run a ball in fading light at the Sydney Cricket Ground and came for much praise from the media. India's ODI series performance matched the Test series in failure as India managed to win just one match against Pakistan and Kapil had to come out in defense of his team.|$|E

5|$|Merv Harvey {{broke into}} the Victorian state team during the 1940–41 season and played in three {{first-class}} matches. <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first phase of his career for Victoria was a rapid 70 in one hour against a New South Wales attack containing Bill O'Reilly, regarded as the best bowler {{in the world at}} the time. However, the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific caused the suspension of top-level cricket and halted Harvey’s progress. Harvey then served in the Royal Australian Air Force as an airframe fitter, losing his best cricketing years to the war.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to the top division, West Ham {{finished}} in ninth place, <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2005–06 season, however, was reaching the FA Cup final and taking favourites Liverpool to a penalty shootout after a 3–3 draw. West Ham lost the shootout, but nonetheless gained entry to the following season's UEFA Cup as Liverpool had already qualified for the Champions League. In August 2006, West Ham completed a major coup {{on the last day}} of the transfer window after completing the signings of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano. The club was eventually bought by an Icelandic consortium, led by Eggert Magnússon, in November 2006. Manager Alan Pardew was sacked after poor form during the season and was replaced by former Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of {{the event}} have been mainly positive. Several reviewers have called Bret Hart's matches <b>the</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PPV. The match for the Intercontinental Championship has {{received}} positive reviews, but the ending to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, which featured Hulk Hogan in his final PPV appearance in the WWF until 2002, has been criticized. The event was attended by 6,500 fans — the lowest attendance of any King of the Ring event. The PPV buyrate, however, was the highest of any King of the Ring event until 1999. The event has been released on VHS in North America and on VHS and DVD in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The Giants' 12–4 {{record in}} 1989 was the NFC's second-best (only to San Francisco's 14–2 record) They lost their divisional playoff game in {{overtime}} to the Rams, 19–13. <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass. After catching the ball, Anderson made {{a long run}} to the end zone, silencing the crowd in attendance. In 1989, free-agent acquisition Ottis Anderson ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Rookie Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531 yards, and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fighting}} {{became the}} bloody {{struggle for the}} large Raevsky redoubt {{near the village of}} Borodino. The French managed to capture this redoubt late into the day, gradually forcing the rest of the Russian army to pull back as well. The Russians suffered terrible casualties during the fighting, losing over a third of their army. French losses were also heavy, exacerbating the logistical difficulties that Napoleon encountered in the campaign. The exhaustion of the French forces, and the lack of information on the condition of the Russian army, persuaded Napoleon to remain on the battlefield with his army instead of ordering the kind of vigorous pursuit reminiscent of previous campaigns.|$|E
5|$|West Ham, {{on their}} return to the Premier League, signed former players James Colllins and George McCartney on {{permanent}} deals, as well as record signing Matt Jarvis and Andy Carroll on loan. They won their {{first game of the}} season, on 18 August 2012, 1–0 against Aston Villa thanks to a Kevin Nolan goal. <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first half of the season was a 3–1 home win against reigning European champions Chelsea on 1 December 2012 which saw them in eighth position and 12th {{at the end of the}} year. On 22 March 2013, West Ham secured a 99-year lease deal on the Olympic Stadium, with it planned to be used as their home ground from the 2016–17 season. Tenth place was secured at the end of the season with nine home wins and only three away from home. Only 11 away goals were scored, the lowest of the entire league.|$|E

5|$|When Byrd {{became the}} {{university}} president in 1935, Jack Faber replaced him {{as head coach}} and accumulated a 7–2–2 record. The following year, Frank Dobson, former Georgia Tech assistant coach under John Heisman, assumed the head coaching position. After a 6–5 first season, Dobson led the Terrapins to an 8–2 record in 1937. <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season was a 13–0 shutout of 17th-ranked Syracuse. In the homecoming game, Charlie Weidinger completed a pass to William Bryant for a 13–7 go-ahead over Florida. The Terrapins' two losses came against Penn and Penn State, the latter being the second game in a rivalry that would bedevil Maryland throughout its entire duration. At {{the end of the}} season, Maryland was declared the Southern Conference champions, the team's first major conference title.|$|E
5|$|Bum Phillips {{was fired}} {{three days after}} Houston's loss in the wild-card game, and {{defensive}} coordinator Ed Biles was given the head coaching job. In 1981, the Oilers finished 7–9 and {{failed to make the}} playoffs {{for the first time with}} Campbell on the roster. Also for the first time, Campbell did not claim the rushing yards title, as he finished fifth in yards with 1,376 and seventh in touchdowns with 10. <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season was back-to-back rushing performances of over 180 yards, against the Bengals in Week 5 and the Seahawks in Week 6. His 39 carries against the Seahawks set an Oilers single-game record. Campbell was invited to his fourth Pro Bowl, but failed to make an All-Pro roster. A players' strike in 1982 shortened the season to nine games and the Oilers finished with a 1–8 record. Campbell had just two touchdowns and 538 rushing yards, an average of 59.8 yards per game—far below his average of 104.1 per game over the previous four seasons.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Maryland had {{a preseason}} rank of 20th, but their {{first three games}} {{included}} a shutout by 12th-ranked Notre Dame, 22–0, and a loss to 16th-ranked Florida State, 37–10. The Terrapins rallied to defeat 13th-ranked West Virginia and 17th-ranked NC State, while losing only to Virginia. That loss, however, prevented Maryland from earning {{a share of the}} ACC championship alongside Florida State. The Terrapins routed Tennessee in the Peach Bowl, 30–3, and finished with an 11–3 record and final ranking of 18th. Maryland began the 2003 season with losses to Northern Illinois and eighth-ranked Florida State. They later defeated 23rd-ranked West Virginia, but were edged by Georgia Tech. In the postseason, 24th-ranked Maryland delivered a second crushing defeat against 20th-ranked West Virginia in the Gator Bowl, 41–7, and finished the season ranked 17th. The New York Times computer poll ranked Maryland third in the nation, behind only split-national champions Louisiana State and Southern California. The 2004 season was Friedgen's first with a losing record. Maryland finished with a 5–6 mark that included an overtime loss to West Virginia, 19–16. <b>The</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season was an upset victory over fifth-ranked Florida State, which was Maryland's first against the Seminoles and their first win against a top-10 team since 1990. The Terrapins again ended the 2005 season with a 5–6 record. That season opened with a victory over Navy, which was the first meeting between the intrastate foes in 40 years.|$|E
