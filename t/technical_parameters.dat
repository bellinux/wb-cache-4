40|$|This is {{a public}} comment on the above cited {{solicitation}} (RFI) [1] related to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). It is sent jointly by the Internet Architectecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Clarification of <b>technical</b> <b>parameter</b> assignment function. Specifically, the "technical parameters " portion of the IANA RFI [2] describes the management of parameters defined by IETF standards. As part of its standards specification process, each new parameter type definition includes a specification of the method of allocation of parameter values, as well as provision for appropriate technical review and acceptance. Where specific expertise {{will be required to}} evaluate any request, the IETF provides a "designated expert " to support the allocation function. These specifications are developed in the IETF's usual international, open, consensus-based e-mail discussion venues. Dispute resolution, when needed, occurs within the IETF organization. There is a factual error in the RFI's description of the current <b>technical</b> <b>parameter</b> assignment function. It incorrectly associates "reservation and direct allocation of space for special purposes, such as multicast addressing, addresses for private networks, and globally specified applications " with the IP address management function. These allocations are in fact standards-based allocations developed and controlled by the IETF. IANA’s function is to record these allocations.
