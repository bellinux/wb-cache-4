5|$|When Gaston Maspero was reappointed {{as head of}} the Egyptian Antiquities Service, {{the nature}} of the {{exploration}} of the valley changed again.

60|$|I noticed, as {{the song}} progressed, that a good many other people seemed to have their eye fixed on <b>the</b> two <b>young</b> <b>men,</b> as well as myself. These other people also tittered when <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> tittered, and roared when <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> roared; and, as <b>the</b> two <b>young</b> <b>men</b> tittered and roared and {{exploded}} with laughter pretty continuously all through the song, it went exceedingly well.|$|R

Fagan's The Wheel, as understudy, bit-part player and assistant stage manager, an invitation he accepted. A colleague, recognising that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> had talent but lacked technique, recommended him to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Gielgud was awarded a scholarship to the academy and trained there throughout 1923 under Kenneth Barnes, Helen Haye and Claude Rains.|$|E

60|$|The pursuit by <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> was relentless. By {{miracles of}} luck, {{as well as}} by {{deduction}} from the topography of the way the runaways must take, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> picked up <b>the</b> blizzard-blinded trail and clung to it. When the snow flew, Smoke and Labiskwee took the most improbable courses, turning east when the better way opened south or west, rejecting a low divide to climb a higher. Being lost, it did not matter. Yet they could not throw <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> off. Sometimes they gained days, but always <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> appeared again. After a storm, when all trace was lost, they would cast out like a pack of hounds, and he who caught the later trace made smoke signals to call his comrades on.|$|R

5|$|The {{remainder}} of Night describes Eliezer's efforts {{not to be}} parted from his father, not even {{to lose sight of}} him; his grief and shame at witnessing his father's decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes and <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> becomes the older man's caregiver, his resentment and guilt, because his father's existence threatens his own. The stronger Eliezer's need to survive, the weaker the bonds that tie him to other people.|$|E

Beauchamp agreed to her request, expressing his own desire to dispatch Sharp.|$|E

5|$|Kitsune are {{commonly}} portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune {{who takes the}} form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife.

He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} has been to {{highlight}} <b>the</b> situation for <b>young</b> <b>men</b> within <b>the</b> context of honour. The aim has also been to highlight <b>the</b> restrictions of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> within <b>the</b> context of honour, and how they rebel against those demands. The study was based on a qualitative research method and carried out in Sweden. The results have been analyzed using the hermeneutic perspective. The results showed that <b>the</b> situation for <b>young</b> <b>men</b> within <b>the</b> context of honour is often manifested by controlling their sisters and the expectation that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> support their families in the future by marring a woman who has been approved by <b>the</b> collective. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are restricted because they are not free to dispose of their spare time themselves, cannot choose their future partner or socialize with people from other cultures. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> can rebel against these restrictions by negotiating with those in authority within the family, by gaining support within or outside the context or by breaking away from it. The conclusion of the study was that by highlighting <b>the</b> situation for <b>young</b> <b>men</b> within <b>the</b> context of honour you gain understanding for the context as a whole. ...|$|R
