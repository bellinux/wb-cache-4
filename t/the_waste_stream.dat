40|$|The US Department of Energy (DOE) has stored or {{expects to}} {{generate}} {{over the next}} five years more than 130, 000 m{sup 3 } of mixed low-level waste (MLLW). Before disposal, MLLW is usually treated to comply with the land disposal restrictions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Depending on the type of treatment, the original volume of MLLW and the radionuclide concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> may change. These changes must be taken into account in determining the necessary disposal capacity at a site. Treatment may remove the characteristic in some waste that caused it to be classified as mixed. Treatment of some waste may, by reduction of the mass, increase the concentrations of some transuranic radionuclides sufficiently so that it becomes transuranic waste. In this report, the DOE MLLW streams were analyzed to determine after-treatment volumes and radionuclide concentrations. <b>The</b> <b>waste</b> <b>streams</b> were reclassified as residual MLLW or low-level or transuranic waste resulting from treatment.
