5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped <b>the</b> <b>treated</b> water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E

Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, {{which makes it}} difficult to know the specific treatment outcome for pedophiles. Many do not select their treatment and control groups randomly.

There is some evidence that dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. For example, one observer reported that a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting on it until the rightful owner of <b>the</b> <b>treat</b> left <b>the</b> room.

25|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{light can}} be used instead of chlorine, iodine, or other {{chemicals}}. Because no chemicals are used, <b>the</b> <b>treated</b> water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it, as {{may be the case}} with other methods. UV radiation causes damage to the genetic structure of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, making them incapable of reproduction. The key disadvantages of UV disinfection are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the UV radiation (i.e., any solids present in <b>the</b> <b>treated</b> effluent may protect microorganisms from the UV light). In the United Kingdom, UV light is becoming the most common means of disinfection because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water. Some sewage treatment systems in Canada and the US also use UV light for their effluent water disinfection.|$|E

25|$|Phosphorus can {{be removed}} biologically in a process called {{enhanced}} biological phosphorus removal. In this process, specific bacteria, called polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs), are selectively enriched and accumulate large quantities of phosphorus within their cells (up to 20 percent of their mass). When the biomass enriched in these bacteria is separated from <b>the</b> <b>treated</b> water, these biosolids have a high fertilizer value.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} step can {{be added}} to the nitrocarburizing process called Postoxidation. When properly performed, Postoxidation creates a layer of Black Oxide (Fe3O4), that greatly increases the corrosion resistance of <b>the</b> <b>treated</b> substrate while leaving an aesthetically attractive black color. Since the introduction of the Glock pistol in 1982, this type of nitrocarburizing with postoxidation finish has become popular as a factory finish for military style handguns.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: We have {{reported}} earlier that administration of a treat containing a special cellulose preparation (Arbocel BWW 40 ®), {{instead of a}} control treat without cellulose, diminishes the clinical signs of periodontal disease in dogs. Based on the physical characteristics of the cellulose preparation, we hypothesized that treats with cellulose have greater elasticity and induce longer chewing time, leading to more mechanical dental cleansing. Approach: Treats without or with cellulose were subjected to bending and pulling tests in which the threshold before fragmentation, expressed as required force, was determined. <b>The</b> <b>treats</b> were also used in an experiment with dogs to determine chewing times. Results: The addition of cellulose to <b>the</b> <b>treats</b> raised <b>the</b> forced needed for bending and pulling until fragmentation by 12 and 99 %. The inclusion of cellulose into <b>the</b> <b>treats</b> raised chewing by dogs of medium-sized and large breeds by 16 and 11 %. However, in small-breed dogs chewing time was not affected by cellulose. Conclusion: The inclusion of the cellulose preparation into <b>the</b> <b>treats</b> induces a resistant and elastic texture which promotes chewing. It is suggested that <b>the</b> cellulose-containing <b>treats</b> maintain contact with the tooth surface which provides effective mechanical cleansing, explaining the observed improvement of periodontal disease in dogs...|$|R
