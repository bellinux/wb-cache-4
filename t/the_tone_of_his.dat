25|$|Gates's letter restated what Bunnell {{wrote in}} September and Roberts wrote in October. However, <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> letter was those hobbyists were {{stealing}} from him, {{not from a}} corporation.|$|E
25|$|In {{his earlier}} novels Stephenson deals heavily in pop culture-laden metaphors and imagery and in quick, hip dialogue, {{as well as}} in {{extended}} narrative monologues. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> books is generally more irreverent and less serious than that of previous cyberpunk novels, notably those of William Gibson.|$|E
25|$|The violin maker Antonio Stradivari {{produced}} his instruments {{during the}} Little Ice Age. The colder climate is proposed to {{have caused the}} wood used in his violins to be denser than in warmer periods, contributing to <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> instruments. According to the science historian James Burke, the period inspired such novelties in everyday life as {{the widespread use of}} buttons and button-holes, knitting of custom-made undergarments to better cover and insulate the body. Fireplace hoods were installed to make more efficient use of fires for indoor heating, and enclosed stoves were developed, with early versions often covered with ceramic tiles.|$|E

25|$|Hume {{was very}} outspoken and never feared to criticise {{when he thought}} the Government was in the wrong. Even in 1861, he objected to the {{concentration}} of police and judicial functions {{in the hands of}} police superintendents. In March 1861, he took a medical leave due to a breakdown from overwork and departed for Britain. Before leaving, he condemned the flogging and punitive measures initiated by the provincial government as 'barbarous … torture'. He was allowed to return to Etawah only after apologising for <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> criticism. He criticised the administration of Lord Lytton before 1879 which according to him, had cared little for the welfare and aspiration of the people of India.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} Cortina was most active in 1896–1898, during {{the run-up to}} the Spanish–American War. Busy in the Hispanic New York {{community}} and contributing to a daily Las Novedades, he tried to confront the anti-Spanish frenzy of American press and complained about lack of assistance on part of Madrid, the charges which thanks to Vázquez de Mella reached the Cortes and the government in 1896. Following a visit in Spain, starting 1897 Cortina changed <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> press endeavors; he switched to advertising the claims of Carlos VII. Thanks to his efforts few US periodicals, including New York Herald, published pieces on Carlism. Some quoted Cortina say that 100,000 volunteers waited for an order to rise and that by January 1, 1898, Don Carlos would assume the throne, though also that the claimant would do nothing which might impair international standing of his country.|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} his time in Florida that Delius {{is said to have}} fathered a son with a local African-American woman named Chloe, {{although}} details of this legend are scarce. [...] Violinist Tamsin Little embarked on a search for descendants of Delius' alleged love child in the 1990s. [...] According to legend, upon Delius' return to Florida some years later to sell the plantation, Chloe, fearing that he had come to take her son away from her, fled with the child and disappeared, and Little believes that this tragic occurrence was a significant influence in <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works thereafter.|$|E
60|$|The {{priest was}} a large man with beaming, kindly eyes, and a round jovial face. There was no bite in <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> good-natured retort, and so, smiling, the boy raised his visor.|$|R

6000|$|While he {{was still}} at table, Toff appeared, with {{profound}} mystery in his manner, and discreet confidence in <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice. [...] "Here's another one, sir!" [...] the Frenchman announced, in his master's ear.|$|R
500|$|Lynch and {{his family}} spent five years living in an {{atmosphere}} of [...] "violence, hate and filth". The area was rife with crime, which would later inform <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. Describing this period of his life, Lynch said [...] "I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe... I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back". In Olson's David Lynch: Beautiful Dark, the author posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the [...] Pacific Northwest, giving the director a [...] "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" [...] which has subsequently shaped his films.|$|E
500|$|Đujić {{became known}} for his fiery speeches, which earned him the {{nickname}} [...] "Father Fire" [...] (...) [...] <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> speeches changed depending on the course of political developments in Yugoslavia and his ideological convictions ranged from right-wing royalist to left-wing progressive. At certain points, Đujić appeared to embrace the fascism of {{the leader of the}} Yugoslav National Movement, Dimitrije Ljotić, and at others, he strongly propagated conservative Chetnik ideology. Đujić's repeated calls for [...] "democracy" [...] and [...] "national rights" [...] prompted the regency of Prince Paul to brand him a [...] "left-wing agitator". He received considerable support from the Serbian Orthodox Church in Knin. He also used his position as a priest and respected local leader to influence how the people of Strmica would vote, instructing his parishioners to cast ballots for a candidate of his choosing in the 1935 Yugoslav parliamentary elections.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Ross' lyrics are {{somewhat}} different, [...] "Red bottom Bawse house big as Baltimore" [...] and [...] "With a blonde bombshell trying {{to bond with}} your boy." [...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him. I love <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice. I think the contrast of his voice and mine would be something special. I always like to do collaborations that people might think are different." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a pause. Mr. Farebrother {{seemed to}} wait for a {{recognition}} of the fact; and the emotion perceptible in <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fine voice gave solemnity to his words. But no feeling could quell Fred's alarm.|$|R
5000|$|For philosopher Thomas Carlyle Coletti was [...] "by {{the cast}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, by <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice, by his general bearing,(...) {{a man of}} deep and ardent sensibilities, of {{delicate}} intuitions, just sympathies originally an almost poetic soul, or man of genius." ...|$|R
60|$|He held up {{his hand}} in warning. <b>The</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice deepened, <b>the</b> luster <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes brightened.

500|$|The {{protagonist of}} Dead Head Fred is Fred Neuman (voiced by John C. McGinley), a private detective. [...] Fred {{is the only}} playable character, but since each head gives him a {{different}} set of animations, he could be considered nine separate characters. [...] As he does not have a proper face, Fred's mood is portrayed by <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice and by face-like expressions formed by his eyes and frontal lobes. [...] Fred has a wisecracking, sarcastic personality and occasionally breaks the fourth wall, such as heckling the player when he dies. [...] Ulysses Pitt (Jon Polito), the game's primary antagonist, is a small-time hoodlum turned racketeer. [...] Pitt employs many henchmen throughout Hope Falls, the most prominent of which is his lieutenant Lefty, whose right leg has been amputated and replaced with a tommygun. [...] Fred makes several allies throughout the game, including Dr. Steiner, who resurrected him, his girlfriend Jeanne Rossini (Kari Wahlgren), and his former partner Benny Salazar. [...] Fred's enemies are generally employees of Pitt, like the skeletal [...] "bone thugs", or creatures created by Hope Falls' radiation, like zombies and animated scarecrows.|$|E
500|$|After the sudden, inexplicable {{death of}} a cow on the ranch, Homer sends Lonnie to town to bring Hud to the ranch for his opinion. [...] Lonnie, finding Hud {{just in time to}} take the blame for Hud's tryst with a married woman, protests Hud's putting him in a {{dangerous}} situation as they return to the ranch, with Hud driving over Alma's flowers as they arrive. [...] At the dead animal, Hud shoots several buzzards to scare the flock away against his father's protestations that they keep the land clean and shooting them is illegal. [...] Hud states his immunity to laws that inconvenience him, setting <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overall demeanor. [...] Hud is annoyed by his father's decision to summon the state veterinarian, and suggests selling the animals to other ranchers before the news spreads; otherwise, government agents will kill all the cattle and destroy everything they have worked for. He blames his father for not realizing that the cheap Mexican cattle were sick before he bought them. Adhering to his principles, Homer ignores Hud's idea and waits for the veterinarian. Upon his arrival, the state veterinarian immediately issues a legally binding State Livestock Transfer Order directing the quarantine of the ranch for a possible foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. This freezes the movement of all livestock to or from the Bannon ranch, while they await the test results.|$|E
500|$|Travolta's {{involvement}} in Battlefield Earth was first publicized in late 1995. He told the New York Daily News that [...] "Battlefield Earth is {{the pinnacle of}} using my power for something. I told my manager, 'If we can't do the things now {{that we want to}} do, what good is the power? Let's test it and try to get the things done that we believe in.'" [...] It was assumed from the start that Travolta would star in and produce the film, which would be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; J. D. Shapiro was to write the screenplay. Shapiro was eventually fired because he refused to accept some suggestions from the studio producers that changed <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> script, including removing key scenes and characters. In 1997, Travolta's long-time manager, Jonathan Krane, signed a two-year deal with Twentieth Century Fox under which that studio would release Battlefield Earth instead of MGM, but the deal with Fox also fell through. James Robert Parish, author of Fiasco: A History of Hollywood's Iconic Flops, comments that both MGM and Fox regarded the project as too risky on several grounds: Its heavy reliance on special effects would be very expensive, pushing the budget up to as much as $100million; Hubbard's narrative was seen as naïve and outdated; and the [...] "Scientology factor" [...] could work against the film, negating Travolta's star power. As one studio executive put it, [...] "On any film there are ten variables that can kill you. On this film there was an eleventh: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Panchen Lama {{was only}} 24 when he dared {{to oppose the}} Chinese Communist Party.

2500|$|... "Mr. Horne Tooke", writes Hazlitt, [...] "was {{in private}} company, and among his friends, the {{finished}} gentleman {{of the last}} age. His manners were as fascinating as his conversation was spirited and delightful." [...] Yet [...] "his mind, and <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> feelings were modern." [...] He delighted in raillery, and prided himself on his cool, even temper. [...] "He {{was a man of}} the world, a scholar bred, and a most acute and powerful logician ... his intellect was like a bow of polished steel, from which he shot sharp-pointed poisoned arrows at his friends in private, at his enemies in public." [...] Yet his thinking was one-sided: [...] "he had no imagination ... no delicacy of taste, no rooted prejudices or strong attachments".|$|E
2500|$|Before leaving Tokyo, MacArthur {{issued a}} communique {{in which he}} offered to confer with his enemy {{counterpart}} on arranging a cease-fire. He specified that he was making the offer [...] "within the area of my authority as the military commander" [...] {{and that he would}} be in search of [...] "any military means" [...] for achieving the desired result. He thus kept the bid within the military sphere. But in leading up to his offer MacArthur belittled China's military power, noting in particular that Chinese forces could not win in Korea, and made statements that could be, and were, interpreted as threatening that the United Nations would decide to attack China if hostilities continued. These remarks prompted other governments to ask about a possible shift in U.S. policy, and in President Truman's judgment they so contradicted <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own planned statement that he decided not to issue it for fear of creating more international confusion.|$|E

2500|$|Harrison, who {{recorded}} many of {{the songs}} during her stint on Dancing with the Stars, combined all different styles on the album. She wanted classic Mýa songs, dance, collaborations, urban, pop, slow jam ballads. Mýa said the album's title track [...] "K.I.S.S." [...] is beneficial because it clarify {{the meaning of the}} album. [...] "Mess Up My Hair" [...] was produced by Young Yonny. Mýa and Young Yonny met in 2007 and began working together on music independently; recording 2009's Beauty & The Streets Vol.1 and continue to work together on other future projects as well. Marques Houston is featured on [...] "Love Me Some You" [...] a slow jam love ballad. Harrison recruited Marques Houston to record the song with her because she liked <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice; Harrison said the song was perfect for him. [...] "Problem + Solution" [...] was written by Afro-pop artist Tiwa Savage and Boyz II Men member Shawn Stockman.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was as a}} {{composer}} of madrigals, however, that Rore achieved enduring fame. [...] With his madrigals published primarily between 1542 and 1565, {{he was one of}} the most influential madrigalists at mid-century. [...] His early madrigals reflect the styles of Willaert with the use of clear diction, thick and continuous counterpoint, and pervasive imitation. [...] These works are mostly for four or five voices, with one for six and another for eight. <b>The</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> writing tends toward the serious, especially as contrasted with the light character of the work of his predecessors, such as Arcadelt and Verdelot. Rore chose not to write madrigals of frivolous nature, preferring to focus on serious subject matter, including the works of Petrarch, and tragedies presented at Ferrara. [...] Rore carefully brought out the varying moods of the texts he set, developing musical devices for this purpose; additionally he often ignored the structure of the line, line division, and rhyme, deeming it unnecessary that the musical and poetic lines correspond.|$|E
2500|$|As {{his policy}} for eradicating {{corruption}} inside {{the government had}} included many administrative reforms, he had to face high opposition. During the reformation of the prosecution, to resolve the opposition, he suggested a TV forum. The prosecutors insisted that Roh appointed the major positions of the prosecutor's office without consulting the personnel committee, and Roh answered that [...] "The current members of the personnel committee themselves represent the old prosecution which has to be changed, {{if we do not}} change now, it would sustain the old prosecution at least few months." [...] Three months into his presidency, He commented about the opposition problem, stating [...] "I'm worrying the opposition that maybe I cannot continue the presidency while I get that much of it." [...] That comment was quoted partly by conservative media, ('I cannot continue the presidency') and Roh was beset by skepticism about his ability and experience. Roh set <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> administration with a number of adventurous policies, and measures to uncover and reveal the names of the descendants of Japanese collaborators. The investigations, criticized by opposition parties as a covert means of attacking them, and coming too late to provide substantive redress, mostly resulted in damage to his own party members.|$|E
60|$|Helen's {{warning was}} not as playful as {{it seemed to her}} lover, for {{something}} in the glow <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes and something vibrant in <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice had disturbed her profoundly. The fear of something which he seemed perilously near saying filled her with unrest, bringing up questions which had thus far been kept in the background of her scheme of life.|$|R

60|$|Huish sat by {{his side}} in towering spirits that were not wholly genuine. Perhaps as brave a man as ever lived, brave as a weasel, he must still reassure himself with <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own voice; he must play his part to exaggeration, he must out-Herod Herod, insult all that was respectable, and brave all that was formidable, {{in a kind of}} desperate wager with himself.|$|R
