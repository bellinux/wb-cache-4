Religiously themed toys were also popular, including a model Noah's Ark with miniature animals and objects from other Bible scenes.

25|$|The {{growth of}} cricket {{in the mid}} and late 19th century was {{assisted}} {{by the development of}} the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> and encouraged the locals so they could have some entertaining competition.

25|$|Many prisons {{also provide}} a library where prisoners can check out books, or do legal {{research}} for their cases. Often these libraries are very small, consisting of a few shelves of books. In some countries, such as the United States, drastic budget cuts have resulted in many prison libraries being shut down. Meanwhile, many nations that have historically lacked prison libraries are starting to develop them. Prison libraries can dramatically {{improve the quality of}} life for prisoners, who have large amounts of empty <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> that can be occupied with reading. This time spent reading has a variety of benefits including improved literacy, ability to understand rules and regulations (leading to improved behavior), ability to read books that encourage self-reflection and analysis of one's emotional state, consciousness of important real-world events, and education that can lead to successful re-entry into society after release.|$|E

500|$|In {{developing}} Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, Ensemble Studios {{worked with}} Big Huge Games {{for the first}} time. This partnership came about {{as a result of}} Ensemble Studios being busy with other projects including Halo Wars, and Big Huge Games' real-time strategy team with spare <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> Several Big Huge Games employees, including Brian Reynolds, had declared they were fans of the Age of Empires series, and thus they asked Ensemble Studios if the two could work together on the upcoming expansion. The two studios did large amounts of communication through the internet, and Reynolds says the entire process worked well. Ensemble Studios took the role of the [...] "customer" [...] in their relationship with Big Huge Games, and thus the game was designed to satisfy Ensemble's needs. Ensemble designers Greg Street and Sandy Petersen were also heavily involved in brainstorming and developing the game.|$|E
500|$|Whereas most Hollywood {{productions}} {{of the day}} took {{little more than a}} month to shoot, Wings took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, [...] "a trip home or a trip to the hospital". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, [...] "Just keep your mouth shut. You've got 'em where it hurts." [...] The cast and crew had a lot of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, [...] "San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months {{and by the time they}} left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he wasn't impressed, considering the drama in it to be [...] "sudsy", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the costumes which were made for the film by Paramount designer Travis Banton, and slit the necklines and cut off the sleeves of his clothing, much to the chagrin of Banton.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. If future {{recreation}} {{consumption and}} associated in-tangible values can be predicted, {{the problem of}} rapid decision-making in recreation-resource management can be reduced, and the problems of implementing those decisions can be anticipated. Man-agement and research responsibilities for meeting recreation demand are discussed, and proved methods for forecasting recreation use and associated qualitative values are presented. The best approach for developing recreation-participation rate equations may be to include a distance factor, recreation-supply variables, socio-economic measurements of users and non-users, and qualitative measures of recreation environments- {{all in the same}} model. The effects of technological progress on values and behavior patterns are described; and methods for forecasting relevant technological advances are outlined. MERICANS, with more <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> A <b>hands</b> and more money to spend than ever before, boomed leisure into an 83 -billion-dollar business in 1969. (U. S. News and World Report 1969). That figure tops the total outlay for national de-fense during the same year. The money going into outdoor recreation activities and e uipment reaches into almost every aspect 9 o the Nation's economy. Today, pleasure is business. And it's the fastest-growing business in the land. Behind the scenes, serving the ever-increasing demand for the trappings of leisure, are the muscle and sinew of Amer-ican technology. But the responsibilities of meeting the quantitative and qualitative as-pects of outdoor recreation demand for forests, mountains, lakes, and streams on public and private lands rests squarely on the shoulders of recreation resource plan-ners and managers. This paper deals with the problems of forecasting the quantitative and qualitative aspects of outdoor recreation participation. At times this objective seems almost in-solvable, for this is a dangerous corner in the research arena where natural sciences and social philosophies collide with a re-sounding crash...|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time the meeting went {{on at the}} Dragon. I can't say that Mr. Tappitt was on this {{occasion}} called upon to preside over the petition. He was simply invited to take the chair {{at a meeting of}} a dozen men at Baslehurst who were brought together by Mr. Sharpit in order that they might be induced by him to recommend Mr. Hart to employ him, Mr. Sharpit, in getting up the petition in question; and in order that there might be some sufficient temptation to these twelve men to gather themselves together, the dinner at the Dragon was added to the meeting. Mr. Tappitt took the chair in the big, uncarpeted, fusty room upstairs, in which masonic meetings were held once a month, and in which the farmers of the neighbourhood dined once a week, on market days. He took the chair and some seven or eight of his townsmen clustered round him. The others had sent word that they would manage to come in time for the dinner. Mr. Sharpit, before he put the brewer in his place of authority, prompted him as to what he was to do, {{and in the course of}} a quarter of an hour two resolutions, already prepared by Mr. Sharpit, had been passed unanimously. Mr. Hart was to be told by the assembled people of Baslehurst that he would certainly be seated by a scrutiny, and he was to be advised to commence his proceedings at once. These resolutions were duly committed to paper by one of Mr. Sharpit's clerks, and Mr. Tappitt, before he sat down to dinner, signed a letter to Mr. Hart on behalf of the electors of Baslehurst. When the work of the meeting was completed it still wanted half an hour to dinner, during which the nine electors of Baslehurst sauntered about the yard of the inn, looked into the stables, talked to the landlady at the bar, indulged themselves with gin and bitters, and found the <b>time</b> very heavy <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> They were nine decent-looking, middle-aged men, dressed in black not of the newest, in swallow-tailed coats and black trousers, with chimney-pot hats, and red faces; and as they pottered about the premises of the Dragon they seemed to be very little at their ease.|$|R

The employees of the New Asiatic Bank, having plenty of <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands,</b> were able to retain their individuality.

Presently {{she came to}} Columbus Circle, and, {{crossing}} Broadway {{at the point where}} that street breaks out into an eruption of automobile shops, found herself, suddenly hungry, opposite a restaurant whose entire front was a sheet of plate glass. On {{the other side of this}} glass, at marble-topped tables, apparently careless of their total lack of privacy, sat the impecunious, lunching, their every mouthful a spectacle for the passer-by. It reminded Jill of looking at fishes in an aquarium. In the centre of the window, gazing out in a distrait manner over piles of apples and grape-fruit, a white-robed ministrant at a stove juggled ceaselessly with buckwheat cakes. He struck the final note in the candidness of the establishment, a priest whose ritual contained no mysteries. Spectators with sufficient <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> to permit them to stand and watch were enabled to witness a New York midday meal in every stage of its career, from its protoplasmic beginnings as a stream of yellowish-white liquid poured on top of the stove to its ultimate Nirvana in the interior of the luncher in the form of an appetising cake. It was a spectacle which no hungry girl could resist. Jill went in, and, as she made her way among the tables, a voice spoke her name.|$|E

Curious and cumbrous mythological lore comes out in every other line. The smartness, the fine epithets, the recondite conceits, the bits of effect, are beyond all praise; but as for one spark of life, of poetry, of real belief, you will find none; not even in that famous Lavacrum Palladis which Angelo Poliziano thought worth translating into Latin elegiacs, about {{the same time that the}} learned Florentine, Antonio Maria Salviano, found Berenice's Hair worthy to be paraphrased back from Catullus' Latin into Greek, to give the world some faint notion of the inestimable and incomparable original. They must have had much <b>time</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands.</b> But at the Revival of Letters, as was to be expected, all works of the ancients, good and bad, were devoured alike with youthful eagerness by the Medicis and the Popes; and it was not, we shall see, for more than one century after, that men's taste got sufficiently matured to distinguish between Callimachus and the Homeric hymns, or between Plato and Proclus. Yet Callimachus and his fellows had an effect on the world. His writings, as well as those of Philetas, were the model on which Ovid, Propertius, Tibullus, formed themselves.|$|E
