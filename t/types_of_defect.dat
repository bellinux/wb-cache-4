40|$|Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>defect</b> between femoral hip {{implants}} {{and cement}} have been identified. Interfacial porosity arises from cement shrinkage during curing and presents as pores randomly located along the stem. Interfacial gaps are much larger stem-cement separations caused by air introduced during stem insertion. To investigate the mechanical consequences of both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>defect,</b> a {{finite element analysis}} model was created {{on the basis of}} a computed tomography image of a Charnley-Kerboul stem, and alternating torsional and transverse loads were applied. The propagation of fatigue cracks within the cement and the rotational stability of the stem were assessed in models simulating increasing amounts of interfacial gaps and pores. Anterior gaps covering at least 30 per cent of the implant surface promoted cement cracks and destabilized the stem. Anterolateral gaps were less destabilizing, but had more potential to promote cracks. In both cases, cracks occurred mainly outside gap regions, in areas where the stem contacted the cement during cyclic loading. Although random interfacial pores did not destabilize the implant, they acted as crack initiators even at low fractions (10 per cent). In conclusion, random interfacial pores were more harmful for the cement mantle integrity than were larger regions of interfacial gaps, although gaps were more detrimental for the rotational stability of the stem...|$|E

40|$|It is a {{frequently}} reported effect of applying requirements specification languages that the formalization of informal requirements {{leads to the}} detection <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> such as omissions, conflicts, and ambiguities.

The results indicate that ambiguities require special care during formalization, because they are less {{frequently reported}} than other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>defects.</b> Instead, ambiguities tend to become often disambiguated unconsciously, which is a serious problem, because implicit assumptions are more likely than in our study to be wrong when the system is more complex. Moreover, ambiguities are misinterpreted more often than other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>defects.</b> Finally, ambiguities, if noticed, require immediate clarification. 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an easily {{accessible}} and reproducible, nonhealing alveolar bone defect in the rabbit mandible. Twenty-four adult male New Zealand white rabbits underwent unilateral mandibular defect surgery. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>defect</b> in the premolar/molar region were compared: (1) a 10 -mm "full thickness" cylindrical defect removing both cortical plates and the intervening trabecular bone and tooth roots; (2) a 10 -mm "partial thickness" cylindrical defect removing only the lateral bony cortex, trabecular bone, and tooth roots. Both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>defect</b> were examined at 0, 8, and 16 weeks using histology and/or microcomputed tomography to determine the quality and quantity of bone formation. The partial thickness defect displayed significant bone fill at 8 weeks (86. 9 % +/- 10. 8 %), and complete regeneration of bony contours and bridging by 16 weeks. In contrast, the full thickness defect was never able to bridge itself and displayed no significant difference in bone regeneration between the 8 -week (61. 5 % +/- 3. 7 %) and 16 -week (55. 1 % +/- 18. 5 %) time points. These results indicate that a nonhealing defect can be created with a 10 -mm bicortical cylindrical ostectomy placed in the premolar/molar region of the rabbit mandible, demonstrating the potential of this animal model as a test bed for mandibular biomaterials and tissue-engineering constructs...|$|E
