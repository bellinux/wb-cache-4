5|$|After the war, Oppenheimer became {{chairman}} of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the Second Red Scare, he suffered the revocation of his security clearance in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented) him with the Enrico Fermi Award {{as a gesture of}} political rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|An {{influential}} group {{assembled in}} Britain <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> for {{his release from}} prison.

5|$|By 1962, Congress {{had passed}} {{legislation}} to deny financial aid grants to Yugoslavia, {{to withdraw the}} sale of spare parts for Yugoslav warplanes, and to revoke the country's most favored nation status. Kennan strongly protested the legislation, arguing that it would only result in a straining of relations between Yugoslavia and the U.S. Kennan came to Washington {{during the summer of}} 1962 <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> against the legislation but was unable to elicit a change from Congress. President Kennedy endorsed Kennan privately but remained noncommittal publicly, as {{he did not want to}} jeopardize his slim majority support in Congress on a potentially contentious issue. With U.S.–Yugoslav relations getting progressively worse, Kennan tendered his resignation as ambassador during late July 1963.|$|E

Soon after {{the failure of the}} Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E
5|$|Four {{decades after}} its construction, Union Station was proving {{too small for}} its role as the {{principal}} railroad hub of Berkshire County.

In 1910 MacInnis appointed a three-man committee (one {{a director of the}} B) <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> the railroad authorities to replace Union Station. Financial constraints at first hampered their efforts. but in April 1912 the B agreed to support the project. In 1913, the NYNH acquired the former Burbank Hotel property and began constructing the second Union Station.|$|E

Muir and the Sierra Club continued <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> the government and influential people {{for the creation of}} a unified Yosemite National Park. The Sierra Club began to organize annual trips to Yosemite in 1901 in an effort to make the remote area more accessible.|$|E
