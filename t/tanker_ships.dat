500|$|Manchester Liners {{established}} regular sailings {{by large}} ocean-going vessels. In late 1898 the Manchester City, at 7,698gross tons, became the largest vessel {{to reach the}} terminal docks. Carrying cattle and general cargo, it was met by the Lord Mayor of Manchester and a large welcoming crowd. [...] In 1968 Manchester Liners converted its fleet to container vessels only. To service them it built two dedicated container terminals next to No. 9 Dock. The four container vessels commissioned that year, each of 11,898 gross tons, were the largest ever to make regular use of the terminal docks at Salford. [...] In 1974 the canal handled 2.9million long tons (3.25million short tons) of dry cargo, 27 per cent of which was carried by Manchester Liners. The dry tonnage was, and is still, greatly supplemented by crude and refined oil products transported in large <b>tanker</b> <b>ships</b> {{to and from the}} Queen Elizabeth II Dock at Eastham and the Stanlow Refinery just east of Ellesmere Port, and also in smaller tankers to Runcorn. The limitations imposed by the canal on the maximum size of container vessel meant that by the mid-1970s Manchester Liners was becoming uncompetitive; the company sold its last ship in 1985.|$|E

2500|$|The {{confrontation}} between Iran and Britain escalated as Mosaddegh's government {{refused to allow}} the British any involvement in Iran's oil industry, and Britain made sure Iran could sell no oil. In July, Mosaddegh broke off negotiations with AIOC after it threatened to [...] "pull out its employees", and told owners of oil <b>tanker</b> <b>ships</b> that [...] "receipts from the Iranian government would not be accepted on the world market." [...] Two months later the AIOC evacuated its technicians and closed down the oil installations. Under nationalized management many refineries lacked the trained technicians that were needed to continue production. The British government announced a de facto blockade, reinforced its naval force in the Persian Gulf and lodged complaints against Iran before the United Nations Security Council.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide the {{information}} model for the worldwide <b>tanker</b> <b>shipping</b> market 2010 – 2020. The evaluation and analysis of the relevant variables of the model and the resulting growth rates are used to describe the most important theoretical principles of the worldwide <b>tanker</b> <b>shipping</b> market over the observed period of time. The research produced direct growth rates of the variables on the index scale from 1 to 100 : 1. Innovations in maritime shipping (37. 5), 2. Global economy (25. 0), 3. Shipbuilding (14. 3). 4. Globalisation (12. 5) and 5. Freight rates (12. 5). It can be concluded that the direct growth rates of all model variables of the worldwide <b>tanker</b> <b>shipping</b> market 2010 – 2020 have realistic chances to be implemented. By 2020 it is expected that the demand on the <b>tanker</b> <b>shipping</b> market will increase more intensely than the demand in other trades...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{discussed}} {{the implementation of}} Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to optimize a Fuzzy Model Reference Learning Controller (FMRLC) for <b>tanker</b> <b>ship.</b> FMRLC is developed by synthesizing several basic ideas from fuzzy set and control theory. It can achieve the heading regulation of <b>tanker</b> <b>ship</b> exposed to plant changes and disturbances by adjusting the rules in a direct fuzzy controller so that the overall system behaves like a “reference model”. However, the tuning of the fuzzy inverse model scaling gains {{is considered to be}} difficult and tedious due to the high nonlinearity of the ship dynamic model and the external disturbances. It is shown that PSO can provide a very promising technique for the design of FMRLC for its simplicity and ease of use. Moreover, Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) is implemented to select the starting positions of the particles strategically. The promising results from the experiment provide direct evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of PSO for the optimization of FMRL controller for <b>tanker</b> <b>ship</b> heading regulation.
