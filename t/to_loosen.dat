5|$|Oral hygiene is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E
50|$|French {{bicycles}} before 1980 {{often used}} French-threaded bottom brackets (now {{difficult to find}} replacement parts for). French bottom brackets, like Italian ones, used right-hand threading on the fixed cups, making them subject <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> by precession. Motobécane broke ranks with most other French manufacturers in the mid-70s, using Swiss-threaded bottom brackets (also difficult to find replacement parts for now). Swiss bottom brackets were identical to French, save that the fixed cups were reverse-threaded (like English ones), making them immune <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> by precession. For more information, see bottom bracket specifications.|$|R

5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while Pete was {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} do better with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) {{and a couple of}} other people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> up, and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him. Pete finally loosens up and begins to give in to Vicki's temptations, but NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) sets him straight, telling him to recall the day that he got married.|$|E
5|$|Robert van Voren {{noted that}} {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall, it became {{apparent}} that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of the iceberg, the sign that much more was basically wrong. This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated. It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected. Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service. Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant. According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with the starboard side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of the starboard wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of the starboard wing. Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one <b>to</b> <b>loosen</b> from its nacelle and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, the starboard wing caught on fire.|$|E

40|$|We {{reviewed}} the plain radiographs, bone scans and hip aspiration results of 54 patients with painful hip arthro-plasties {{which had been}} explored surgically, to compare {{the results of the}} investigations with the operative findings. For acetabularloosening, the sensitivity and specificity of bone scanning were 87 % and 95 %, with an accuracy of 90 %: for serial plain radiography sensitivity was 95 %, specificity 100 % and accuracy 97 %. For femoral compo-nent loosening, bone scan sensitivity was 85 %, specificity 100 % and accuracy 89 %: the sensitivity of plain radiogra-phy was 100 %, with specificity 92 % and accuracy 98 %. Technetium bone scanning did not provide additional information with regard <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> and is not necessary in the routine investigation of a painful hip arthroplasty. Serial plain radiography is the most effective method of detecting loosening, and bone scanning is useful only when radiography is inconclusive with regard <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> or infection.

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and radiographic results from patients who underwent femoral reconstruction secondary <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> of total hip arthroplasty, using circumferential proximal femoral allografts and cemented implants. Methods: A retrospective {{study was conducted}} on 32 patients (33 hips) who underwent femoral reconstruction secondary <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> of total hip arthroplasty, using circumferential proximal femoral allografts and cemented implants. Among these patients, 28 (29 hips) fulfilled all the requirements for this study. The mean follow-up was five years and two months. The clinical evaluation was done {{in accordance with the}} Harris Hip Score. Radiographically, the patients were assessed regarding reabsorption and consolidation of the allograft, migration of the greater trochanter, stability of the femoral component and heterotypic calcification. Results: The average preoperative Harris Hip Score was 32 points. At the last postoperative follow-up, the average score was 82 points. Allograft resorption of some degree was seen in nine hips (31 %). Regarding consolidation, 24 cases (82. 8 %) showed full consolidation, three (10. 3 %) showed partial consolidation and two (6. 9 %) showed pseudarthrosis. All femoral components were stable. According to the criteria established, 27 cases (93. 1 %) were considered to be successful reconstructions after a mean follow-up of five years and two months. Conclusion: From the results obtained, it was concluded that use of circumferential proximal femoral allografts in selected cases of femoral reconstruction secondary <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> of arthroplasty presented a high survival rate from the reconstruction over an average follow-up of five years and two months...|$|R

50|$|In {{critical}} fastener joints, embedment {{can mean}} loss of preload. Flattening of a surface allows {{the strain of}} a screw to relax, which in turn correlates with a loss in tension and thus preload. In bolted joints with particularly short grip lengths, the loss of preload due to embedment can be especially significant, causing complete loss of preload. Therefore, embedment can lead directly <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> of a fastener joint and subsequent fatigue failure.|$|R

30|$|A {{major cause}} of {{artificial}} joint failure is the loosening that occurs {{as a consequence of}} wear and tear of the bearing surfaces. Even a well performing prosthetic joint releases billions of microscopic wear particles (debris) into the joint space. When an excessive amount of debris is generated it may stimulate a severe body reaction in the capsular tissues and bone leading to inflammation and osteolysis. The resulting loss of supporting bone may lead <b>to</b> <b>loosening</b> of the implants requiring difficult revision surgery.|$|R
