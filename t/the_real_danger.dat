5|$|About 10:30, some of Leane's scouts {{reported}} that the 13th Brigade, {{on the right of}} the 12th Brigade and opposite Dernancourt, was falling back. Around the same time, his right forward company on the embankment sent back a message indicating that the Germans had penetrated on the right of the brigade {{in the area of the}} 47th Battalion, and that it was taking over part of the left of the 47th Battalion line to assist. In response to a probe by the Germans against his northern-most company in the series of posts alongside the Albert–Amiens road, Leane immediately sent part of his reserve company from Pioneer Trench to reinforce it. Sensing the danger in the 13th Brigade area, Leane ordered Major Arthur Samuel Allen, commanding the nearby 45th Battalion, to move his battalion forward to vacant trenches overlooking that sector. As Allen was implementing these orders, he received conflicting orders from Gellibrand to send two companies forward to Pioneer Trench. Allen saw the wisdom of Leane's orders, and tried to convince the brigade major that Leane's preferred course of action was best. Nevertheless, Allen was directed to carry out Gellibrand's orders. Later events proved that, being the most experienced commander on the ground, Leane actually had the most accurate conception of <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> to the 12th Brigade's position.|$|E
25|$|While some {{military}} historians {{point out that}} leaving enemies in your rear is not generally wise, the Mongols proved that indirect attack, and bypassing weaker foes to eliminate the strongest first, can be a devastatingly effective mode of invasion. In this case, those enemies were virtually no danger, given {{the ease with which}} the Muslims destroyed them. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> was Charles, and the failure to scout Gaul adequately was disastrous.|$|E

25|$|Steinbeck's {{characters}} are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish {{a sense of}} respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established {{as many of the}} ranch hands are victims of the Great Depression. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action- oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to generate enough money. Lennie {{is the only one who}} is basically unable to take care of himself, but the other characters would do this in the improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> of Lennie's mental handicap comes to the fore.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{wrote in}} 1949, that the defence of Calais delayed the German attack on Dunkirk {{and helped to}} save the BEF. In 1950, Guderian denied this but in 1966, L. F. Ellis, the British {{official}} historian, wrote that three panzer divisions had been diverted by the defence of Boulogne and Calais, giving the Allies time to rush troops {{to the west of}} Dunkirk. In 2006, Karl-Heinz Frieser wrote that the halt order issued to the German unit commanders because of the Anglo-French attack at the Battle of Arras (21 May) had more effect than the siege. Hitler and the higher German commanders panicked, because of their fears of flank attacks, when <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> was of the Allies retreating to the coast before they could be cut off. British reinforcements at Boulogne and Calais had arrived in time to forestall the Germans, when they advanced again on 22 May.|$|E
25|$|The Privy Council {{ordered the}} arrest of both Howard and Arundell; De Vere {{immediately}} met secretly with Arundell to convince him to support his allegations against Howard and Southwell, offering him money and a pardon from the Queen. Arundell refused De Vere's offer, and he and Howard initially sought asylum with Mendoza. Only after being assured they would be placed under house arrest {{in the home of}} a Privy Council member, did the pair give themselves up. During the first weeks after their arrest they pursued a threefold strategy: they would admit to minor crimes, prove De Vere a liar by his offers of money to testify to his accusations, and demonstrate that their accuser posed <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> to the Crown. The extensive list to discredit De Vere included atheism, lying, heresy, disobedience to the crown, treason, murder for hire, sexual perversion and pederasty with his English and Italian servants ("buggering a boy that is his cook and many other boys"), habitual drunkenness, vowing to murder various courtiers and declaring that Elizabeth had a bad singing voice.|$|E

25|$|Thielmann {{correctly}} deduced {{that the}} French manoeuvrer {{was designed to}} reinforce I Corps. But his superior the Duke of Saxe-Weimar believed that Maison wanted to capture Brussels, {{a belief that the}} Frenchman encouraged by spreading false rumours among the Belgians. Saxe-Weimar shifted Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn's division from Leuven to Aalst where he concentrated 9,000 foot soldiers and 900 horsemen. Coalition detachments reoccupied Courtrai, Deinze and Harelbeke while Helwig's Freikorps was sent to observe Valenciennes and Condé-sur-l'Escaut. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> to Maison remained Thielmann who might cut off the French with his total force of 12,000 troops in 15 battalions and 500 cavalry. On 30 March, Maison abandoned Ghent, marching south-west along the Leie River with the main body of I Corps. To shield the movement, he sent Solignac's division and one squadron of the 2nd Guard Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment farther east to Petegem. At Deinze the main body brushed aside Major Puckler's small force and continued to Courtrai. The latter place was evacuated by some Prussian cavalry when the I Corps appeared.|$|E
500|$|Leading Marine officers, however, {{were not}} all of the same opinion. Cushman, the new III MAF commander, {{supported}} Westmoreland (perhaps wanting to mend Army/Marine relations after the departure of Walt). Other concerns raised included the assertion that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> to I Corps was from a direct threat to Quang Tri City and other urban areas; that a defense would be pointless as a threat to infiltration, since NVA troops could easily bypass Khe Sanh; that the base was too isolated and that the Marines [...] "had neither the helicopter resources, the troops, nor the logistical bases for such operations". Additionally, Shore argues that the [...] "weather was another critical factor because the poor visibility and low overcasts attendant to the monsoon season made such operations hazardous." [...] Brigadier General Lowell English (assistant commander 3rd Marine Division) complained that the defense of the isolated outpost was ludicrous. [...] "When you're at Khe Sanh, you're not really anywhere. You could lose it and you really haven't lost a damn thing." ...|$|E

He had observed the coming of professionalism in England and correctly surmised that the same would happen in Scotland. [...] Celtic signed several of the Hibs players through offering financial inducements to the amateur Hibs players. This effectively left Hibs without the team who had been highly successful in the preceding years. Celtic {{went on to win}} four league championships in the 1890s.|$|E

2500|$|In Europe Blenheim is {{regarded}} as much a victory for Eugene {{as it is for}} Marlborough, a sentiment echoed by Sir Winston Churchill (Marlborough's descendant and biographer), who pays tribute to [...] "the glory of Prince Eugene, whose fire and spirit had exhorted the wonderful exertions of his troops." [...] France now faced <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> of invasion, but Leopold I in Vienna was still under severe strain: Rákóczi's revolt was a major threat; and Guido Starhemberg and Victor Amadeus (who had once again switched loyalties and rejoined the Grand Alliance in 1703) had been unable to halt the French under Vendôme in northern Italy. Only Amadeus' capital, Turin, held on.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, Arminians seek {{to follow}} the biblical writers in warning believers about <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>dangers</b> of {{committing}} apostasy. A sure and biblical way to avoid apostasy is to admonish believers to mature spiritually in their relationship with God in union with Christ and through power of the Spirit. Maturity takes place as Christ-followers keep on meeting with fellow believers for mutual encouragement and strength; exhorting each to love God and others; to be growing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; and to persevere in faith in prayerful dependence upon God through various trials and temptations.|$|R
2500|$|Kraken {{were also}} {{extensively}} described by Erik Pontoppidan, bishop of Bergen, in his Det første Forsøg paa Norges naturlige Historie [...] "The First Attempt at [...] Natural History of Norway" [...] (Copenhagen, 1752). Pontoppidan made several claims regarding kraken, including {{the notion that}} the creature was sometimes mistaken for an island and that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> to sailors was not the creature itself but rather the whirlpool left in its wake. However, Pontoppidan also described the destructive potential of the giant beast: [...] "it is said that if [...] were to lay hold of the largest man-of-war, they would pull it down to the bottom". According to Pontoppidan, Norwegian fishermen often took the risk of trying to fish over kraken, since the catch was so plentiful (hence the saying [...] "You must have fished on Kraken"). Pontoppidan also proposed that a specimen of the monster, [...] "perhaps a young and careless one", was washed ashore and died at Alstahaug in 1680. By 1755, Pontoppidan's description of the kraken had been translated into English.|$|E
2500|$|The {{same year}} she {{was elected to}} the first London School Board, an office newly opened to women; Garrett's was the highest vote among all the candidates. Also in that year, she was made one of the visiting {{physicians}} of the East London Hospital for Children, becoming the first woman in Britain to be appointed to a medical post, but she found the duties of these two positions to be incompatible with her principal work in her private practice and the dispensary, as well as her role as a new mother, so she resigned from these posts by 1873. In 1872, the dispensary became the New Hospital for Women and Children, treating women from all over London for gynaecological conditions; the hospital moved to new premises in Marylebone Street in 1874. Around this time, Garrett also entered into discussion with male medical views regarding women. In 1874, Henry Maudsley’s article on Sex and Mind in Education appeared, which argued that education for women caused over-exertion and thus reduced their reproductive capacity, sometimes causing “nervous and even mental disorders”. Garrett’s counter-argument was that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>danger</b> for women was not education but boredom and that fresh air and exercise were preferable to sitting by the fire with a novel. [...] In the same year, she co-founded London School of Medicine for Women with Sophia Jex-Blake and [...] became a lecturer in what was the only teaching hospital in Britain to offer courses for women. She continued to work there {{for the rest of her}} career and was dean of the school from 1883 to 1902. This school was later called the Royal Free Hospital of Medicine, which later became part of what is now the medical school of University College London.|$|E

Individuals with sufficient technical knowledge of Information Technology (IT), networks, and networking devices can steal sensitive information and may exploit vulnerable network systems. In this paper we illustrate some of those threats and learn how to protect our network from attacks and exploits. For this purpose we also propose a set of developed theoretical and practical laboratory sessions that can serve as a complement to academic/professional introductory network security classes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Part one of {{this paper}} {{considers}} the question of property rights in general and asks how such rights can be justified, contrasting Consequentialist with other approaches and concludes {{that it is impossible}} to avoid a broadly Consequentialist approach.
