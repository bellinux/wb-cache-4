25|$|In Oamaru, 225kilometres {{southwest}} of Christchurch, the earthquake caused {{part of a}} chimney on the St Kevin's College principal's residence to fall <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>and</b> caused the clock atop the Waitaki District Council building to stop at 4:36am. The earthquake also caused the Dunedin Town Hall clock and the University of Otago clocktower to stop working in Dunedin, some 350km away from the quake epicentre.|$|E
25|$|As {{the storm}} worsens, a hungry Cleveland confronts his son over the {{possibility}} of having food stored in his room. Cleveland, Jr. explains he used a very scientific method to ration the food. When the family is still resistant to his non-religious lifestyle, accusing him of wanting the food all to himself, Cleveland, Jr. locks the food away in spite. Cleveland calls on God to smite Cleveland, Jr. for his actions, at which point a tree crashes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> pins him instead of his son. The family members are unable to lift the tree by hand and decide to pray to God for help. Cleveland, Jr. is able to rig together a pulley system and lifts the tree using his own weight. The family disagrees over whether God was involved in Cleveland, Jr.'s actions and the belief of Cleveland, Jr. is left unresolved as the hurricane heads for Quahog.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} {{presented}} in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar (Buffy). Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, [...] "We're not supposed to move the body!" [...] Both Gellar and Trachtenberg (Dawn) were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, [...] "you try to separate it {{as best you can}} {{and at the same time}} it adds that extra layer". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar [...] "at a fever pitch", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure.|$|E

Mardawi surrendered along with Ali Suleiman al-Saadi, known as [...] "Safouri", and thirty-nine others. He later said that [...] "There was nothing I could do against that bulldozer".|$|R

500|$|Lang was {{supportive}} of the Malines Conversations of 1921â€“26, though not directly involved. [...] These were informal meetings between leading British Anglo-Catholics and reform-minded European Roman Catholics, exploring the possibility of reuniting the Anglican and Roman communions. Although the discussions had the blessing of Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, many Anglican evangelicals were alarmed by them. Ultimately, the talks foundered on the entrenched opposition of the Catholic ultramontanes. A by-product of these conversations {{may have been the}} awakening of opposition to the revision of the Anglican Prayer Book. The focus of this revision, which Lang supported, was to make concessions to Anglo-Catholic rituals and practices in the Anglican service. The new Prayer Book was overwhelmingly approved by the Church's main legislative body, the Church Assembly, and by the House of Lords. Partly through the advocacy of the fervently evangelical Home Secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, the revision was twice defeated in the House of Commons, in December 1927 by 238 votes to 205 and, in June 1928, by 266 to 220. Lang was deeply disappointed, writing that [...] "the gusts of Protestant convictions, suspicions, fears [...] prejudices swept <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>and</b> ultimately prevailed." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an actuating drive for deflecting an actuating element (15) {{by means of}} a solid body actuator (2) which, when an electrical voltage or an alternating magnetic field is changed, experiences a length change, wherein a <b>housing</b> (1) encloses <b>the</b> solid body actuator and, together with the latter, delimits an interspace (13) in a fluid-tight manner. Furthermore, the solid body actuator has a hollow duct (6), the first end of which is connected to a first hollow conduit (20) passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other end of which opens into the interspace.

2500|$|Architecture in Malaysia is a {{combination}} of many styles, from Islamic and Chinese styles to those brought by European colonists. Malay architecture has changed due to these influences. Houses in the north are similar to those in Thailand, while those in the south are similar to those in Java. New materials, such as glasses and nails, were brought in by Europeans, changing the architecture. [...] Houses are built for tropical conditions, raised on stilts with high roofs and large windows, allowing air to flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> cool it down. Wood has been the main building material for much of Malaysia's history; it is used for everything from the simple kampung to royal palaces. In Negeri Sembilan traditional houses are entirely free of nails. Besides wood, other common materials such as bamboo and leaves were used. The Istana Kenangan in Kuala Kangar was built in 1926, and it the only Malay palace with bamboo walls. The Oral Asal of East Malaysia live in longhouses and water villages. Longhouses are elevated and on stilts, and can house 20 to 100 families. Water villages are also built on stilts, with houses connected with planks and most transport by boats.|$|E
2500|$|Union skirmishers {{went forward}} {{to try to}} {{determine}} {{the strength of the}} Confederate position. Most were driven back immediately. Two companies from the 5th New York led by Captain Kilpatrick and Captain John G. Butler, the General's nephew, advanced across an open field with only a few trees, a shed and a house for cover. An artillery shot went <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> killed one of the men. Around noon, the 3rd New York Infantry led by Colonel Townsend came forward to the skirmishers' position. They tried to attack the forward Confederate position but could advance only to within [...] before being forced to lay down due to the heavy Confederate fire. Townsend feared he was being flanked and began to withdraw just as the Confederate howitzer facing his position broke and the Confederate commander in the redoubt, Colonel William D. Stuart, pulled his 200 men of the 3rd Virginia Infantry back to a hill near the church. Stuart also feared he was being flanked. Part of the 5th New York Infantry which was attacking alongside the 3rd New York temporarily seized this position but were unable to hold it. Townsend had nothing to fear from the men on his left because they were a company of his own regiment who had become separated from the main body. By the time this was discovered, Townsend had pulled back. Magruder did not want to give up the advantageous forward position and sent Stuart back with another howitzer and reinforcements from the 1st North Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment. This Confederate move and Townsend's retreat left the 5th New York unsupported and they had to withdraw from their captured position as well. Renewed fire from the regained Confederate position insured that neither Townsend nor Duryee would move forward against this position again.|$|E
