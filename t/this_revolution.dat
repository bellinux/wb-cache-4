5|$|The {{translation}} of the myth of Myrrha as it appeared in Ovid's Metamorphoses is suggested as being {{a critique of the}} political settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution. The wife of the leader of <b>this</b> <b>revolution,</b> William of Orange, was Mary, daughter of James II. Mary and William were crowned king and queen of England in 1689, and because Dryden was deeply sympathetic to James he lost his public offices and fell into political disfavor under the new reign. Dryden turned to translation and infused these translations with political satire in response - the myth of Myrrha being one of these translations.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{is located}} in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with a {{diameter}} of about 100,000 light-years containing about 100 billion stars. The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur. The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the Galactic Centre, and its speed within the Milky Way is about 220km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225–250 million years. <b>This</b> <b>revolution</b> is known as the Solar System's galactic year. The solar apex, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation Hercules {{in the direction of the}} current location of the bright star Vega. The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about 60° to the galactic plane.|$|E

Herein, we illustrate the development of studies inspired by multi- and chemo-enzymatic approaches to build the core moieties of polyethers, polypeptide alkaloids, piperidines and pyrrolidines promoted by the joint action of oxidoreductases, hydrolases, cyclases, transaminases and imine reductases.

25|$|The May Fourth Movement {{twenty years}} ago marked a new stage in China's bourgeois-democratic {{revolution}} against imperialism and feudalism.

Around the time of the May Fourth Movement, hundreds of thousands of students courageously took their place in the van. In these respects the May Fourth Movement went a step beyond the Revolution of 1911.|$|E

By 1776, the Tây Sơn had occupied all of the Nguyễn Lord's land and killed almost the entire royal family. The surviving prince Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (often called Nguyễn Ánh) fled to Siam, and obtained military support from the Siamese king. Nguyễn Ánh came back with 50,000 Siamese troops to regain power, but was defeated at the Battle of Rạch Gầm–Xoài Mút and almost killed. Nguyễn Ánh fled Vietnam, but he did not give up.|$|E

25|$|As a result, {{microbial}} mats {{began to}} produce the atmosphere we know today, in which free oxygen is a vital component. At {{around the same time}} they may also have been the birthplace of the more complex eukaryote type of cell, of which all multicellular organisms are composed. Microbial mats were abundant on the shallow seabed until the Cambrian substrate revolution, when animals living in shallow seas increased their burrowing capabilities and thus broke up the surfaces of mats and let oxygenated water into the deeper layers, poisoning the oxygen-intolerant microorganisms that lived there. Although <b>this</b> <b>revolution</b> drove mats off soft floors of shallow seas, they still flourish in many environments where burrowing is limited or impossible, including rocky seabeds and shores, hyper-saline and brackish lagoons, and are found on the floors of the deep oceans.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} <b>this</b> <b>revolution</b> in art {{education}} were far-reaching. Over {{the course of the}} 1880s and 1890s the Birmingham School of Art became the focus of a generation of distinguished designers, all of whom had studied there and most of whom went on to teach there, who became known as the Birmingham Group. This included the stained glass designers Henry Payne, Sidney Meteyard, Florence Camm and Bernard Sleigh; the wood engravers and book illustrators E. H. New and Charles March Gere; the jewellers and metalworkers Arthur Dixon, Arthur Gaskin and Georgie Gaskin; and the furniture designers Ernest Barnsley and Sidney Barnsley. The influence of the school's teaching also permeated beyond this inner circle, and important work in an Arts and Crafts style was also produced by organisations such as the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft, the Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts, the Kynoch Press and the Ruskin Pottery; and commercial firms such as the silversmiths A. E. Jones, the stained glass workshops of T. W. Camm and Co. and the metalworkers Henry Hope and Son.|$|E
25|$|During the {{following}} years, the dichotomy {{between the government}} of Luis Muñoz Marín and the Nationalist Party was widened over the Commonwealth that was being negotiated in Congress. On October 30, 1950, these differences materialized in the Jayuya Uprising. The 295th Infantry Regiment was mobilized {{from the beginning of}} the insurrection until November 6, 1950. In the crossfire that took place at Utuado, Corporal José Rodríguez Alicea of H Unit in Arecibo was killed. The 296th's First Battalion was mobilized under Lt. Col. Rafael Sepúlveda, was moved to forts Brooke and Buchanan. <b>This</b> <b>revolution</b> was quelled after the Puerto Rico Air National Guard bombed the municipalities of Jayuya and Utuado, the first and so far only time that the United States military has bombed a locale under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Following the crossfire, the PRNG confiscated a flag of Puerto Rico that had been placed before the Jayuya Police Headquarters. For its participation in this conflict, the entity received letters of gratification from the Police of Puerto Rico and other organizations affiliated to the government such as the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority. In turn, Esteves commended a number of officers for their coordination.|$|E

25|$|The {{years of}} {{political}} {{struggle between the}} conservative authoritarian absolutists and the progressive constitutionalist Liberals {{over the issue of}} royal succession, lasting from 1828 to 1834, was a complex period in Lisbon's history. In 1828, Prince Michael, whom the absolutists wanted to rule Portugal as an absolute monarch, returned from exile in Vienna. Conservative politicians, clergymen and aristocratic supporters of Queen Carlota manipulated political developments and proclaimed him king, starting a civil war against the forces of the Liberal constitutionalists who supported his brother, Emperor Peter I of Brazil. Peter's forces won the war in 1834 and he became Pedro IV of Portugal, but the new Constitution as promulgated was more conservative than expected by the people. However, it did present some liberal reforms, such as restoration of freedom of the press, mandatory education, abolishment of the slave trade in the African colonies, extinction of the religious orders and confiscation of their convents, as well as the expropriation of many other properties of the Catholic Church, which had supported the Miguelists. The Liberals of Lisbon soon became disillusioned with Pedro and formed new political conspiracies. On 9 September 1836, the politicised population, many of them petty bourgeois and literary intellectuals, joined with the National Guard to drive the Cartistas (Chartists) from power and forced Queen Maria II to reinstate the 1822 Constitution. Members of the government installed following <b>this</b> <b>revolution</b> were called Setembristas, after their short-lived movement, the Setembrismo, which was launched in September. The absolutists attempted a coup in 1836, and again in 1837. The country was divided into two opposing radical groups that refused to engage in a dialogue. Seeing opportunity in this chaotic state of affairs, the great northern European powers planned the division of its provinces and colonies.|$|E
