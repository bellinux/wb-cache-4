5|$|Gautham and Sameera go to London, {{where they}} and their driver Gulaab Singh escape from a murder attempt; Gautham's manager, Michael, is killed. The Rubik's Cube, when solved a certain way, reveals a safe-deposit-box number in which Gautham finds a {{preserved}} rice sample. After escaping another murder attempt in a parking lot, he eludes {{the police and the}} two men with Sameera and Singh's help. One of the men—a fan—seeks revenge for his father (one of the other murderers, according to the aged <b>taxi</b> <b>driver),</b> who was killed by Gautham in Belfast when he performed there. Gautham learns that the aged <b>taxi</b> <b>driver</b> he met previously is a businessman and the murderer; the person hit by the businessman's car in Gautham's presence was the actual, innocent <b>taxi</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Taxi driving {{seems to}} be a strenuous occupation. There was {{evidence-based}} paucity of literature on health assessment of <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers.</b> Meanwhile <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> of South Africa were burdened by communicable and non-communicable diseases including high-level exposure to injuries and criminal attacks. Health assessment of this cohort group enables mitigation to engage in appropriation of relevant interventions related to the occupational needs of <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers.</b> Objectives: The objective {{of the study was to}} conduct health assessment of <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> in the city of Tshwane to identify health risk factors. Method: An exploratory, descriptive and quantitative survey was conducted and anthropometric measurements of blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference were monitored and recorded on a convenience sample of 69 <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> in Tshwane Municipality. Consent was sought from individual <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> who participated in the study, while taxi rank queue marshals assisted with smooth running of the process. Data were gathered using a questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using statistical STATA II with the assistance of a statistician. Results: The study found that <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> were obese, hypertensive, had type II diabetes-related risk factors, including unhealthy life style practices. The results indicate that the general health of <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> impacts their occupation. Conclusion: The findings implicate that the health status of taxi operators in Tshwane was a serious concern and urgent concerted effort is needed to engage in lifestyle modification of <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers.</b> The need for health promotion and formalised occupational health services was recommended...|$|R

40|$|Media {{reports are}} {{emerging}} on {{the phenomenon of}} young girls who travel with older mini-bus <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers,</b> and who {{are thought to have}} sex with the drivers in exchange for gifts and money. The extent to which such relationships might facilitate unsafe sexual practices and increased risks for both the men and the young women, often referred to as taxi queens, remains an important question {{in the light of the}} current challenges of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. However, very little research has been undertaken on this issue, especially regarding the perceptions and experiences of <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers.</b> Thus this paper aims to provide some preliminary findings on taxi drivers’ attitudes and beliefs about taxi queens and their relationships with <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers.</b> A 22 -item questionnaire was administered to 223 male <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> in two regions in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. <b>Taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> in this study largely saw the relationship between <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> and the young girls who ride with them as providing status for both the girls and drivers, and there seemed to be recognition of the transactional nature of the relationship between <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> and <b>taxi</b> queens. The stigmatisation of young girls who ride with <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> was evident. Drivers had knowledge and awareness of the risks of unsafe sex and supported condom use, although there appeared to be some uncertainty and confusion about the likelihood of HIV infection between drivers and girls. While <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> recognised the role of alcohol in relationships with young girls, they seemed to deny that the abuse of drugs was common. The study highlights a number of key areas that need to be explored with men in the taxi industry, in order to address risk behaviours for both <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> and the girls who ride with them...|$|R

30|$|Today, taxis are an {{important}} component of China’s urban public transit network. However, <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> frequently work under extremely stressful and hazardous conditions, including long working hours, frequent driving, and occasional disputes with passengers, all of which increase drivers’ physical and mental stress. A survey in Beijing reported that <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> worked up to 11  h per day and at least 27.8  days per month [1]. <b>Taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> in Tlahuac, Mexico City were found to drive 11.1  h a day behind the wheel [2]. Another survey in Sydney showed that 67 % of <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> drove at least 50  h per week [3]. Obviously, taxi drivers’ e daily earnings rely heavily on their driving distance within a scheduled period, so they must spend long hours driving in order to carry more passengers and earn more money.

However, the efficiency of this occupational exposure in vitamin D synthesis has not been addressed yet. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the vitamin D status of <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> in Tehran, and examine vitamin D status association with some anthropometric and circulating biomarkers. Materials and Methods: In a case control study, 53 <b>taxi</b> <b>drivers</b> and 80 apparently healthy subjects from other occupations were enrolled. Questionnaires for demographic data, supplement use, and {{duration of}} sun exposure were completed. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured. Blood samples were taken from all participants for complete blood cell count, fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid profile, and 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol (25 (OH) D) measurements.

To find answers to these questions, a case study is conducted by assuming a hypothetical linear city with a single city centre, ten taxi stands and twenty residential zones. A discrete-event dynamic simulation model is adopted to simulate the movements of taxis and to estimate various taxi system performance characteristics, such as taxi operation profit and customer waiting time. The time period simulated is a 3 -hour morning commune. The taxi fleet size, fare structure, taxi operation cost and customer demand pattern are all assumed given.
