5|$|A 2001 {{proposal}} envisaged three routes, lines 1, 2 and 3. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> circular route {{around the}} northern suburbs, {{and the others}} were radial routes to Newbridge in the west and Newcraighall in the south. All lines would have passed through the city centre. In May 2004, a 15-year operating contract was awarded to Transdev, to operate and maintain the tram network. This contract was cancelled in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} pilot, Miller {{structured}} each episode by telling two {{stories in the}} episode. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> traditional procedural plotline. The second story was a flashback from Henry's past. The flashback either related to the episode's main present-day storyline, such as Henry's involvement in investigating the Jack the Ripper case, or was a scene from Henry's backstory, such as {{his life in the}} Lower East Side's tenements in the 1890s. Both the father-son relationship between Henry and Abe and one of the two season-long story arcs, Henry's relationship with his wife Abigail, were told through flashbacks.|$|E
5|$|From the 1850s {{through to}} the present day, Franklin's last {{expedition}} inspired numerous literary works. Among <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> play, The Frozen Deep, written by Wilkie Collins with assistance and production by Charles Dickens. The play was performed for private audiences at Tavistock House early in 1857, {{as well as at}} the Royal Gallery of Illustration (including a command performance for Queen Victoria), and for the public at the Manchester Trade Union Hall. News of Franklin's death in 1859 inspired elegies, including one by Algernon Charles Swinburne.|$|E

In 2012, a dollar coin with his image, part of the Presidential $1 Coin Program, was issued.|$|E
5|$|His {{increasing}} interest in mineralogy {{at this time}} is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy.

5|$|Of Stratton's many contributions, {{his studies}} on {{perception}} and visual illusions {{would continue to}} influence the field of psychology well after his death. Of the nine books he wrote, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> scholarly look at the methodology and scope of experimental psychology. The remaining, including one unfinished at his death, were on sociology, international relations and the issues of war and how findings from psychology {{could be used to}} eradicate conflict between nations. Stratton considered these issues more salient to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on this front did not produce a lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E
5|$|Palmyrene trade {{reached its}} apex {{during the second}} century, aided by two factors; <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> trade route built by Palmyrenes, and {{protected}} by garrisons at major locations, including a garrison in Dura-Europos manned in 117 AD. The second was the Roman conquest of the Nabataean capital Petra in 106, shifting control over southern trade routes of the Arabian Peninsula from the Nabataeans to Palmyra.|$|E

5|$|Roland Rich Woolley, {{lawyer for}} several Hollywood celebrities, funded three biographies by Arrington. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{biography}} of Woolley's father-in-law, William Spry. Woolley first hired popular writer William L. Roper {{to write the}} biography, but as the manuscript lacked professionalism, Roper hired Arrington to complete it. The biography focuses disproportionately on Spry's decision to execute Joe Hill, reflecting Woolley's conservative politics in suppressing labor radicalism.|$|E
