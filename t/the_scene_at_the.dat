5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tower of Joy, Lyanna Stark {{was portrayed}} by actress Aisling Franciosi. The Danish comedian Frank Hvam portrayed the {{clerk at the}} Citadel, {{although}} his lines may have been dubbed as {{he was not a}} confident English speaker.|$|E
5|$|The Ohio protopunk bands {{were joined}} by Cleveland's the Pagans, Akron's Bizarros and Rubber City Rebels, and Kent's Human Switchboard. Bloomington, Indiana, had MX-80 Sound and Detroit had the Sillies. The Suburbs came {{together}} in the Twin Cities scene sparked by the Suicide Commandos. The Feederz formed in Arizona. Atlanta had the Fans. In North Carolina, there was Chapel Hill's H-Bombs and Raleigh's Th' Cigaretz. The Chicago scene began not with a band but {{with a group of}} DJs transforming a gay bar, La Mere Vipere, into what became known as America's first punk dance club. The Crucified, Tutu and the Pirates and Silver Abuse were among the city's first punk bands. In Boston, <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Rat was joined by the Nervous Eaters, Thrills, and Human Sexual Response. In Washington, D.C., the Controls played their first gig in spring 1977, but the city's second wave really broke the following year with acts such as the Urban Verbs, Half Japanese, D'Chumps, Rudements and Shirkers. By early 1978, the D.C. jazz-fusion group Mind Power had transformed into Bad Brains, one of the first bands to be identified with hardcore punk.|$|E

5|$|The {{engineering}} set {{did provide}} some challenges; a {{health and safety}} brief was required for the actors on it as it was still raised off the ground. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} bubbles being sent through water tubes that represented part of the engine core created noise issues for the sound technicians; they asked for it to be turned off whenever it wasn't placed in shot. One of the special effects went wrong, causing an actual explosion behind Jeri Ryan rather than simply creating sparks following the weapons fire which would be edited in during post-optical effects. The explosion remained in the final cut. The final day of the shoot took place on March 10; taking the filming period to eight days, a day longer than normal for Voyager episodes. It took place on the set of the Dauntless bridge, in the orange color scheme. The final full scene filmed was of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the episode where the Dauntless returns to Borg space and Arturis realises he is about to be assimilated, and after an hour of closeups for various scenes, the shoot ended at 12:50am on March 11.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay {{and the crew}} only had three hours to film. Residents {{thought it was a}} real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the {{superintendent}} so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes at Paul Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.|$|E

The San Bernardino SWAT team happened to be conducting its monthly training exercise {{a few miles away}} from <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the attack, which allowed them to arrive at the scene within eleven minutes. Police used a battering ram to get into the complex. The first floor was cleared by 11:17a.m., and a secondary sweep of the building began fourteen minutes later.|$|E

After an escape attempt, Lilya is brutally beaten by her pimp, but she escapes again successfully.

25|$|Up {{until this}} eruption, {{it had been}} assumed that Hekla was {{incapable}} of producing the most dangerous of volcanic phenomena, the pyroclastic flow. In January 2003, however, a team from the Norvol Institute in Reykjavík, {{under the leadership of}} Dr. Ármann Höskuldsson, reported that they found traces of a pyroclastic flow, roughly 5km long, stretching {{down the side of the}} mountain. This will call for a reappraisal of volcanic eruptions of the basic rock type, which up to now were generally thought not to produce large pyroclastic flows. It will also require that the public and curious spectators who always rush to <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of a new outbreak, be kept much further away from the volcanic activity than was thought necessary during previous outbreaks.|$|E
25|$|A {{testament}} to the adulation he inspired among fans worldwide was <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo headquarters of Honda, where the McLaren cars were typically displayed after each race. Upon his death, so many floral tributes were received, they overwhelmed the large exhibition lobby. This was despite the fact Senna no longer drove for McLaren and that McLaren in the preceding seasons did not use Honda power. Senna had a special relationship with company founder Soichiro Honda and was beloved in Japan, where he achieved a near mythic status. For the next race at Monaco, the FIA {{decided to leave the}} first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger.|$|E
25|$|As the Union {{troops were}} withdrawing, Wood stopped his brigade {{commanded}} by Col. Charles G. Harker {{and sent it}} back with orders to counterattack the Confederates. They appeared on <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> flank of the Confederates who had captured the artillery pieces, causing them to retreat. The brigades of McNair, Perry, and Robinson became intermingled as they ran for shelter in the woods east of the field. Hood ordered Kershaw's Brigade to attack Harker and then raced toward Robertson's Brigade of Texans, Hood's old brigade. As he reached his former unit, a bullet struck him in his right thigh, knocking him from his horse. He {{was taken to a}} hospital near Alexander's Bridge, where his leg was amputated a few inches from the hip.|$|E

The book is produced in a 12x12 format to mimic the size of traditional album covers. In addition, life size images of memorabilia from the period, including tick stubs, trinkets, and an authentic can of Aquanet from the time period. The text inside the book is written by band members and others who were a part of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.

25|$|After Stormblåst, keyboardist Stian Aarstad {{left the}} band {{due to his}} {{obligation}} {{to serve in the}} Norwegian army, thus being unable to participate in the 1996 recording of Devil's Path. That period was also marked by the departure of bassist Brynjard Tristan and the arrival of Nagash. Stian Aarstad returned for the recording of 1997's Enthrone Darkness Triumphant. He had trouble attending rehearsals and was unable to tour. He was then subsequently fired and replaced by Kimberly Goss for their 1997/1998 world tour. Enthrone Darkness Triumphant was a huge success for the band, and was their first release signed to Nuclear Blast, a German record label. The album was recorded in the Abyss Studios, owned by Hypocrisy's frontman Peter Tägtgren. After the release of Enthrone Darkness Triumphant, the band went on tour with In Flames, Dissection and other bands who were prominent in <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E
