5|$|In 2007, the band's studio albums from Trespass <b>to</b> <b>Calling</b> All Stations were {{digitally}} remastered by Nick Davis {{across three}} box sets: Genesis 1970–1975, Genesis 1976–1982 and Genesis 1983–1998. Each album {{is presented as}} a two-disc set containing a CD/Super Audio CD of a new stereo mix and a DVD with a 5.1 surround sound mix and bonus features including previously unreleased live performances, interviews, and concert programs. Two DVD box sets followed, Genesis Live 1973–2007 and Genesis Movie Box 1981–2007, in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> for cuts {{in federal}} government spending {{to help reduce}} the national debt, Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs, such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare. He supported substantial increases in military spending and promised to invest more heavily in military weapons programs while {{increasing the number of}} active-duty military personnel. He was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan, although he later proposed his own budget plan.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September, West Cheswald began another, similar {{voyage to}} Africa.

The ship was in transit from Cape Town to Trinidad on 7 December during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and by the time she arrived at Boston on 27 December, the United States had joined the Allies of World War II in declaring war against the Axis powers.|$|E

5|$|By early 1934, {{the focus}} {{shifted away from}} funding work {{creation}} schemes and toward rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended {{to speed up the}} rearmament programme. In addition <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1959, Mona Best decided to open a club in her cellar, and offered the Les Stewart Quartet a {{residency}} if they would help convert the cellar. Harrison and fellow Quartet guitarist Ken Brown, however, missed a show, causing Les Stewart to fire the two and drop the residency. This caused distress to Best, but Harrison offered a solution: he recruited Lennon and McCartney to play, and they returned <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> themselves the Quarrymen. After helping Best finish converting the cellar, the new four guitarist line-up of the Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Brown) opened the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959. The opening night performance was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air conditioning and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. The Quarrymen were afforded the use of Brown's three input amplifier (which, along with McCartney's Elpico, meant that all four guitarists were electric), and sang through one microphone connected to the club's small PA system.|$|E

5|$|Arha and Kossil have {{a public}} falling out in which Kossil says that nobody {{believes}} in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response Arha curses her {{in the name of}} the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads underground to the labyrinth, and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who has found the other half of Erreth-Akbe's ring in the treasury. He tells Arha that she must either kill him or escape with him, and says that the Nameless Ones demand her service but give nothing and create nothing in return. He tells her his true name, Ged, in return for the trust she has shown him. They escape together, though Manan, who has come looking for Arha, falls into a pit in the labyrinth and is killed. The tombs begin to collapse in on themselves; Ged holds them off until they leave. Arha reverts <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> herself Tenar as she and Ged travel to the coast where his boat is hidden. While waiting for the tide she has an urge to kill Ged for destroying her life, but realizes while gazing at him that she has no anger left. Ged and Tenar return to Havnor, where they are received in triumph.|$|E
25|$|The routing of the {{railroad}} through Hillsboro gave the young city the motivation to attempt to have the county seat moved there from Caledonia, which had been the seat of Traill County since its organization in 1875. The ensuing contest grew bitter and heated, with Caledonians arming themselves, posting guards in the town, and organizing a committee for defense. Hillsboro residents took <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> the defense committee Tigers of the Jungle and Irreconcilables.|$|E
25|$|According to Berlusconi's {{political}} and entrepreneurial opponents, Berlusconismo {{is only a}} form of demagogic populism, comparable to Fascism, in part because Berlusconi has defended aspects of the regime of Benito Mussolini, {{even though he has}} criticised the racial Fascist laws and the alliance with Nazi Germany, referring to himself as pro-Israel. In 2013, he returned <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> Mussolini a good leader whose biggest mistake was signing up to exterminate the Jews. Conrastingly his supporters compare Berlusconismo to French Gaullism and Argentinian Peronism.|$|E

Assisted by engineer/producer Anjali Dutt, Pierce completed final remixes {{of his songs}} in January 1990. However, Peter Kember's side of the album was far from ready, and he resorted <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> on the help of Richard Formby, a producer. According to Formby, when he arrived, Kember's recording was only half done; some songs were incomplete, and two had to be re-recorded from scratch.|$|E

25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the receiving party pays systems is that phone owners keep their phones turned off to avoid receiving unwanted calls, {{which results in}} the total voice usage rates (and profits) in Calling Party Pays countries outperform those in Receiving Party Pays countries.

25|$|Francis of Assisi {{was born}} in late 1181 or early 1182, one of several {{children}} of Pietro di Bernardone, a prosperous silk merchant, and his wife Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except {{that she was a}} noblewoman originally from Provence. Pietro was in France on business when Francis {{was born in}} Assisi, and Pica had him baptized as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro took <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> his son Francesco ("the Frenchman"), possibly in honor of his commercial success and enthusiasm for all things French. Since the child was renamed in infancy, the change can hardly have {{had anything to do with}} his aptitude for learning French, as some have thought.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, the Nazi {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union changed the Party's opinion of strikes, though it would be simplistic to treat this change in strategy solely as the result in the change in Comintern policy. Throughout his career, Quill preferred to threaten strikes as leverage <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> them and provoking a decisive test of strength. In addition, the union leadership had reservations in 1941 about the depth of its support among {{the general public and}} the employees of the IRT and BMT, many of whom believed that civil service protections gained as employees of the City made union representation less critical. National CIO leaders and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt administration intervened in 1941 to avert a subway strike with an ambiguous agreement that preserved TWU's right to represent its members, even though the City continued to deny it exclusive representation.|$|E
25|$|Buck {{served as}} the CBS Radio voice of Monday Night Football (teaming with Hank Stram) {{for nearly two decades}} (1978–1984 and again from 1987–1995 after CBS regained the radio rights from NBC). Ironically, in 1970 ABC's Roone Arledge had asked via {{telephone}} about Buck's interests in becoming the first television play-by-play announcer for Monday Night Football, but because of personal animosity surrounding his previous stint with the network, Buck would not return their phone call. (The television play-by-play role would go to Keith Jackson instead, and later to Buck's CBS colleague, Frank Gifford.) In addition to MNF, Buck called numerous playoff games for CBS Radio, including 17 Super Bowls (the most of any announcer). Buck also served as a local radio broadcaster for the football Cardinals in 1980 and 1981, and returned <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> Sunday NFL games for CBS television from 1982 to 1987.|$|E

25|$|The cause {{has long}} been {{supported}} beyond the victim nations, and associations like Amnesty International are campaigning in countries where governments have yet to support the cause, like in Australia, or New Zealand. Support in the United States continues to grow, particularly after the United States House of Representatives House Resolution 121 was passed on July 30, 2007, asking the Japanese government to redress the situation and to incorporate internationally accepted actual historical facts about this program into their educational system. In July 2012, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a strong advocate of the cause, denounced {{the use of the}} euphemism 'comfort women' for what should be referred to as 'enforced sex slaves'. The Obama Administration also addressed the need for Japan to do more to address the issue. In addition <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> attention to the issue, the American memorial statues erected in New Jersey in 2010 and California in 2013 show support for what has become an international cause.|$|E
25|$|The Steelers, whose history traces to a {{regional}} pro {{team that was}} established in the early 1920s, joined the NFL as the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 8, 1933, owned by Art Rooney and taking its original name from the baseball team of the same name, as was common practice for NFL teams at the time. To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> the football team the Rooneymen, an unofficial nickname which persisted for decades after the team adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since its founding. Art's son, Dan Rooney owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan's son Art Rooney II. The Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation. The Steelers currently play their home games at Heinz Field on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. Built in 2001, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium which hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and Forbes Field.|$|E
25|$|In September 1979, {{before the}} Olympics, the American team started {{exhibition}} play. They played {{a total of}} 61 games in five months against teams from Europe and America. Through these games, Herb Brooks instilled a European style of play in the American team, emphasizing wide open play with sufficient body contact. He believed {{it would be the}} only way for the Americans to compete with the Soviets. From the start of the exhibitions, he conducted the team through skating windsprints consisting of end line to blue line and back, then end line to red line and back, then end line to far blue line and back, and finally end line all the way down and back. Some of the players took <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> these Herbies. On September 17, 1979, the team played to a 3-3 tie in Norway. Brooks had them skate Herbies after the game, and after a while, the lights were turned off by custodians and the practice continued in the dark. Near the end of the exhibition season, although he had supported them throughout, Brooks threatened because of subpar play to cut Eruzione (the captain) and replace Craig as the starting goalie with Steve Janaszak.|$|E
