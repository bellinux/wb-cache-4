5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in <b>the</b> <b>constellation.</b> In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of <b>the</b> <b>constellation.</b> The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Trianguli Australis, {{known as}} Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant and the {{brightest}} star in <b>the</b> <b>constellation,</b> as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the triangle are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars, deep-sky objects are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC 5979.|$|E

50|$|Manship {{described}} this sphere {{in the following}} words: “The representation of <b>the</b> heavenly <b>constellations</b> is derived from Babylonia and Assyria: the Greeks and Latins added their names and gave <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> a local significance in some cases and I have adhered {{as closely as possible}} to the ancient forms. Thus the star, Aldebaran, which represents the eye of Taurus, dictates the character of the design, as is also the case of Regulus, Leo’s Heart, and so with all <b>the</b> <b>constellations.</b> <b>The</b> forms and attitudes of the figures have been made to correspond firstly with the positions and the meanings of the emblems themselves. After that the inter-relationship of <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> was designed to create a harmonious ensemble”.|$|R

40|$|This papers {{considers}} {{the design of}} a mutiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with channel knowledge at the transmitter and receiver. The design methods available in the literature have addressed the following two aspects of the problem: a) choice of <b>the</b> symbol <b>constellations</b> for a given transmission scheme or b) choice of the optimal (linear) precoder and equalizer for a given choice of <b>the</b> <b>constellations.</b> More specifically, <b>the</b> choice of <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> has been made enforcing a diagonal, or parallel, transmission. However, in practice, the two problems of choosing <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> and <b>the</b> linear precoder/equalizer are clearly coupled, and the diagonal structure may not be necessarily the best. This paper attempts to provide a global view of the problem by bridging the gap between the existing results on the selection of <b>the</b> <b>constellations</b> and on <b>the</b> design of the signal processing {{in the form of a}} linear transceiver (i. e., precoding at the transmitter and equalization at the receiver) ...|$|R

5000|$|Felis (Latin for cat) was a {{constellation}} created by French astronomer Jérôme Lalande in 1799.

5|$|Since Callimachus' poem, Coma Berenices {{has been}} {{occasionally}} mentioned outside astronomy. In 1886, Spanish artist Luis Ricardo Falero created a mezzotint print personifying Coma Berenices alongside Virgo and Leo. In 1892, the Russian poet Afanasy Fet made <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> {{the subject of}} his short poem, composed for the Countess Natalya Sollogub. Francisco Guerrero, a 20th century composer from Spain, wrote an orchestral work on <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> in 1996.

5|$|The First Point of Aries, the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for <b>the</b> <b>constellation.</b> This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus defined it in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the First Point of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E

5|$|This {{constellation}} forms {{part of the}} zodiac, {{and hence}} is intersected by the ecliptic. This circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually be found in <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> Taurus during some part of each year. The galactic plane of the Milky Way intersects {{the northeast corner of}} <b>the</b> <b>constellation</b> and the galactic anticenter is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic.
