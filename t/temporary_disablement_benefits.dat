On the other hand the government is introducing a number of supplementary measures to stimulate the use of reintegration instruments to make it more attractive for employers to retain or take on employees with a disability.

Our research {{goal was to}} a priori assess occupational health risk for greenhouse workers {{on the basis of}} working conditions classification as per deviations of environment parameters and working process from the existing hygienic standards. We examined microclimate parameters in cold and warm seasons, contamination or working area air with hazardous chemicals and aerosols; we also performed occupational and time studies of work activities when basic working tasks were accomplished during an annual vegetables growing cycle in greenhouses. We detected that green-house workers during their working activity were exposed to a set of hazardous factors; the prevailing ones were heating microclimate, occurrence of hazardous chemicals and dust in increased concentrations in working area air, hardness of labor process which involved excessive physical exercise, long-term work in an inconvenient posture, frequent body bend-ings, and necessity {{to spend a lot of}} time standing. Overall hygienic assessment of greenhouse working conditions corre-sponded to 3 degree category of hazardous conditions (3. 3 danger class) allowing for impacts exerted by a set of hazard-ous working environment factors and working process itself during annual working cycle. Hazardous working conditions caused occupational health risk for greenhouse workers which, in conformity with R 2. 21766 - 03, corresponded to high (intolerable) risk when urgent activities aimed at its reduction were to be accomplished.

40|$|The paper defends three {{claims about}} Aristotle’s theory of {{uncontrolled}} (akratic) actions in NE 7. 3. First, I {{argue that the}} first part of NE 7. 3 (1146 b 30 - 47 a 24) contains the description of the overall state of mind of the agent while she acts without control. Aristotle’s {{solution to the problem of}} uncontrolled action lies in the analogy between the uncontrolled agent and people who are drunk, mad, or asleep. This analogy is interpreted as meaning that the uncontrolled agent, while acting without control, is still in possession of her knowledge (and so she can make use of what she knows) but she is unable to use it as knowledge due to the <b>temporary</b> <b>disablement</b> of her reason by appetite. Due to this disablement, the uncontrolled agent is temporarily unable to be motivated to act by her knowledge and acts merely on her appetite. Second, I argue that the second part of NE 7. 3 (1147 a 25 -b 5) provides an analysis of the particular mental state from which the uncontrolled action issues. Its central passage (1147 a 31 - 5) is a description of the uncontrolled agent’s state of mind before the uncontrolled action and not, as it has been traditionally understood, a description of her state of mind during the uncontrolled action. Third, I argue that, on Aristotle’s view, the transition from the state before the uncontrolled action to the state in which the agent already acts without control does not involve any psychological state that would constitute the agent’s choice to abandon her decision and give in to her desires but proceeds on a purely physiological level...|$|R

The main analysis was of 665 men, 283 of whom had died. Of the deaths, 39 % were from lung cancer, 9 % mesothelioma, and 20 % asbestosis. The observed mortality was compared with expectation based on the death rates for England and Wales. For all causes the observed number of deaths was 2. 6 times expectation and for lung cancer 9. 1 times expectation. After 10 years from first certification half of the men had died compared with an expectation of one in four. The excess death rates were apparent in the first year after certification and were still operating after 10 years on those who survived until then. The main factor influencing the mortality was the clinical state of the men at the time of certification, as indicated by the percentage disability awarded; the excess lung cancer rate and the mesothelioma and asbestosis rates all increased with percentage disability. Those awarded only 10 % or 20 % benefit were still at risk from all the three asbestos-related causes.

40|$|Abstract: In the United Kingdom the {{diagnosis}} of Hand-arm Vibration Syndrome varies depending on the purpose of that diagnosis. The criteria differ in three situations. More than 100, 000 miners and ex-miners with claims for HAVS have been examined using a Medical Assessment Process which included the use of standardised tests. This contract is unique but it has had significant effects on the two other processes. The Industrial Injuries <b>Disablement</b> <b>Benefit</b> Scheme provides a benefit that can be paid to an employed earner because of an accident or Prescribed Disease. New recommendations have been published to remove the anomalies in the present format for assessing HAVS. If implemented the new scheme will recognise the Stockholm Workshop Scales and workers with neurological problems will also be compensated. The Health and Safety Executive will issue new guidance {{in the near future}} on the hazards of hand-arm vibration. Health surveillance in the workplace will be fundamental and the HSE propose a tiered approach with levels 1 to 5. Specialist occupational nurses and doctors with training in {{the diagnosis}} and assessment of HAVS will be needed for levels 3 and 4. Only at this level may a diagnosis of HAVS be made. The Medical Assessment Process has demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} examine a large number of claimants in a standardised manner. The IIAC and HSE recommendations contain very important improvements on the existing positions in the UK and it must be hoped that they will be implemented in the near future.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade in Japan the number of newly {{compensated}} cases of occupational diseases has stopped declining and is fluctuating between 7, 000 and 9, 0001). Excluding pneumoconiosis and asbestos related cancers, the incidences of typical occupational diseases relating to chemical exposures have almost been eliminated from the statistics and almost all the reported cases are from acute poisonings. Recently we studied the incidence of compensated cases of organic solvent poisoning in Japan, and reconfirmed that almost all cases were acute poisoning and no cases of typical occupational diseases or related chronic diseases. This may depend {{on the fact that}} this statistics rely on cases that had more than 3 d off from work by the disease and not including mild cases. Considering the recent trend, it is becoming clear that the statistics we can get is not sufficient for making provision for the further prevention. For example, important issues of organic solvent poisoning among developed countries nowadays are chronic poisoning in subclinical state or symptoms at mild state, which will decrease the working abilities of the workers to some extent and might develop severe diseases in some cases.

During the intake procedure, 160 CFS patients completed a questionnaire on fatigue related measurements, physical impairment, depression, somatic and psychological attributions, somatic focus, and sense of control over symptoms. Pre-treatment physical activity level was measured with an actometer. At baseline, post-treatment and 6 -month follow-up individual strength, subjective fatigue and physical impairment, were reassessed. Large effect sizes were found on subjective fatigue (1. 2 post-treatment; 1. 2 follow-up) and physical impairment (−. 9 post-treatment; −. 9 follow-up), Clinically significant improvement was found in 33. 8 % of the participants at post-treatment and 30. 6 % at follow-up.

It is, however, often neglected in manpower forecasting studies. In this paper, we develop a flow model with which we can forecast the replacement demand at a detailed level of types of education. The essential element of the model is the determination of the yearly outflow coefficients for each type of education, distinguished by age category and gender. Instead of applying a fixed coefficient approach (Willems and De Grip (1993), we will introduce the random coefficient estimation technique in the model. This technique takes the reliability of the flow coefficients explicitly into account. If a specific flow coefficient is unreliable, the random coefficient estimate will tend towards the mean value for that age category over the types of education. This means that ad hoc corrections based on judgmental forecasting can be considerably reduced. Moreover, it will be shown that the random coefficient estimates of labour market outflow are more reliable than the estimates of the Willems/De Grip model. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Disablement</b> {{pensions}} (Invalidity <b>benefits)</b> - Resumé As I {{am interested}} in the situation of disabled people {{and the ability of}} the community to take care properly of these needy people I decided to write a thesis on the subject of disablement pensions (or invalidity benefits). The aim of this thesis was to give a reader an overview of how different countries regulate the conditions under which invalidity benefits are provided. At the same time I would like to describe in detail and evaluate above named national legislations in the same structure, if possible. The first chapter deals with historical aspects. After the origins of social security are mentioned, I already focus on the historical development of invalidity benefits' legislation in european and czech context. The next chapter is an analysis of invalidity benefits at the international level. Especially the achievements of the International Labour Organization, the Council of Europe and the European Union in the field of disablement pensions are highlighted. It is completed by a brief description of bilateral agreements on social security. The third chapter, which is the largest one included in this thesis, examines the czech legislation regarding the invalidity benefits. First of all the issue of the pension insurance in general is outlined. The [...] ...|$|R

40|$|I {{studied a}} {{potential}} function and underlying mechanism(s) {{of the magnetic}} sense in honey bees, Apis mellifera. A waggle-dancing bee informs hive mates about a food source. Directional information pointing to the food source relative to the sun 2 ̆ 7 s azimuth is encoded in the angle between the straight segment of her waggle dance and a reference line such as gravity or the local geomagnetic field (LGMF). Neither cancelling the LGMF nor shifting its declination affected the recruitment success of waggle-dancing bees, implicating gravity as the reference line for the dance alignment. To study the underlying mechanism(s) of the bees’ magnetic sense, I analyzed lyophilized and pelletized bee tagmata by a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device. A distinct hysteresis loop for the abdomen {{but not for the}} thorax or the head of bees indicated the presence of magnetite in the abdomen. Magnetic remanence of abdomen pellets produced from bees that I did, or did not, expose to an NdFeB magnet while alive differed, indicating that magnet-exposure altered the magnetization of this magnetite in live bees. Following exposure of live bees to the same magnet, magnetized bees, unlike sham-treated control bees, failed to sense the presence of a magnetic anomaly, demonstrating a functional connection between magnetite in the abdomen and the magnetoreceptor, and <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>disablement</b> of the receptor through magnet-exposure. To test whether bees sense the polarity of a magnetic field, I trained bees to associate a magnetic anomaly with a sugar water reward. I then presented trained bees with a sugar water reward in two separate watch glasses, placing one reward {{in the center of the}} anomaly that I either kept the same as during bee training (control experiment) or that I altered by reversing its polarity (treatment experiment). That bees continued to recognize the magnetic anomaly when its polarity was kept unaltered, but failed to recognize it when its polarity was reversed, indicates that bees have a polarity-sensitive magnetoreceptor. To increase the detectability of magnetite in bee tissues, I lyophilized samples to reduce water content, maximized the signal amplitude by pelletizing samples, and accounted for sample dimensions in data analyses...|$|R
