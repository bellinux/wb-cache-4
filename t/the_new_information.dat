5|$|Lambeosaurus has a {{complicated}} taxonomic history, beginning in 1902 with Lawrence Lambe's naming of hadrosaurid limb material and other bones (originally GSC 419) from Alberta as Trachodon marginatus. Paleontologists began finding better remains of hadrosaurids {{from the same}} rocks in the 1910s, {{in what is now}} known as the late Campanian-age (Upper Cretaceous) Dinosaur Park Formation. Lambe assigned two new skulls to T. marginatus, and based on <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>information,</b> coined the genus Stephanosaurus for the species in 1914. Unfortunately, there was very little to associate the skulls with the scrappy earlier marginatus material, so in 1923 William Parks proposed a new genus and species for the skulls, with both generic and specific names honoring Lambe: Lambeosaurus lambei (type specimen NMC 2869, originally GSC 2869).|$|E

As related by prosecutor to the society, William Alexander Forbes, the animal suffered an accidental demise when the heavy lid of a washstand fell on {{it and it was}} unable to free itself. Forbes used the opportunity to dissect the fresh female specimen, thus was able to provide explicit anatomical details on the female reproductive system, the brain, and the liver—parts not previously described by Owen, who had access only to preserved specimens. Scottish embryologist William Caldwell—well known in scientific circles for determining the reproductive mechanism of the platypus—described the uterine development of the koala in 1884, and used <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>information</b> to convincingly place the koala and the monotremes into an evolutionary time frame.|$|E

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>information</b> (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

25|$|Several {{researchers}} {{proposed a}} solution to these problems by introducing space into the initial model either explicitly or {{in the form of}} a spatial segregation within compartments. Bresch et al. proposed a package model as a solution for the parasite problem. Later on, Szathmáry and Demeter proposed a stochastic corrector machine model. Both compartmentalized systems proved to be robust against parasites. However, package models do not solve the error threshold problem that originally motivated the idea of the hypercycle. A few years later, Maarten Boerlijst and Paulien Hogeweg, and later Nobuto Takeuchi, studied the replicator equations with the use of partial differential equations and cellular automata models, methods that already proved to be successful in other applications. They demonstrated that spatial self-structuring of the system completely solves the problem of global extinction for large systems and, partially, the problem of parasites. The latter was also analysed by Robert May, who noticed that an emergent rotating spiral wave pattern, which was observed during computational simulations performed on cellular automata, proved to be stable and able to survive the invasion of parasites if they appear at some distance from the wave core. Unfortunately, in this case, rotation decelerates as the number of hypercycle members increases, meaning that selection tends toward decreasing the amount of information stored in the hypercycle. Moreover, there is also a problem with adding new information into the system. In order to be preserved, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>information</b> has to appear near to the core of the spiral wave. However, this would make the system vulnerable to parasites, and, as a consequence, the hypercycle would not be stable. Therefore, stable spiral waves are characterized by once-for-ever selection, which creates the restrictions that, on the one hand, once the information is added to the system, it cannot be easily abandoned; and on the other hand, new information cannot be added.|$|E
30|$|The {{multiplexing}} {{method of}} control information and data is conducted according to [17]. According {{to the number of}} bits of the control information, UE will conduct rate matching to generate data bits to be multiplexed with the control <b>information.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>new</b> control <b>information</b> has different bit number to the old control information, rate matching result of data bits will change accordingly. Although the relay does not know the content of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> control <b>information,</b> <b>the</b> relay does know which kind of control information will be transmitted by the UE, e.g., periodic CQI, ACK/NACK of HARQ. Therefore, the relay can know bit number of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> control <b>information</b> and thus can perform the same rate matching as the UE to generate the data bits. Because the mapping rule of data bits to resource is predefined, the UE and the relay will have the same mapping results for data transmission. As a result, even if <b>the</b> <b>new</b> control <b>information</b> has different bit number compared with the old control information, the proposed method can still be applied.|$|R

500|$|On {{his return}} to England, Cobham kept this {{information}} from the full MCC committee, knowing {{that they would be}} forced to cancel the tour if they became aware of it. Instead, he wrote a letter to a committee member, whose identity has never been made public. The letter's recipient passed it on to Griffith, who in turn showed it to Allen and Arthur Gilligan, at that time the MCC president. These three men chose to hide the information from the full committee, and nobody informed Denis Howell. Allen later defended these actions, setting out his reasoning in his biography, which was written by his close friend Swanton—Allen argued that the advice given by Douglas-Home, an international diplomat, took precedence over Cobham's information and had already been accepted by the MCC. He further suggested that, as the four England selectors had to choose the team [...] "without any other consideration", and two of them sat on the MCC committee, it would have been unfair to burden them with Cobham's information. Oborne dismisses Allen's reasoning as [...] "disastrously muddled", pointing out that Cobham's advice was far more up-to-date than Douglas-Home's, and that {{there would have been no}} burden of conscience for the team selectors as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>information</b> would have caused the tour to be cancelled.|$|E
500|$|A different, widely {{circulated}} story {{suggests that}} Peel urinated on the pitch before being dismissed by Hawke. Woodhouse, writing in 1989, suggested that [...] "it {{is difficult to}} ascertain the truth behind this long-standing tale", while Hodgson observes: [...] "I have never been convinced of this account because it has {{always seemed to be}} so much out of character for a cricketer of that time when so much stress was placed upon behaving 'like a gentleman' even in one's cups." [...] Mick Pope writes: [...] "The more recent accusation that Peel urinated on the pitch remains unjust, unproven and such a myth... that it should have no place in any study of Bobby Peel, the cricketer." [...] The story originated in a cricket publication, Cricket Quarterly, in 1968. The historian Rowland Bowen, in an article called [...] "Fresh Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897", claimed that an [...] "aged Yorkshireman of 85" [...] told him that Peel had urinated and that this was a common practice then. Subsequent research by the historian Irving Rosewater established that Bowen's information came to him second-hand. The 85-year-old had not used the word [...] "urinated" [...] but had actually said [...] "pissed at the wicket", meaning that Peel was drunk ("pissed" [...] being slang for drunk) on the pitch ("at the wicket"). Rosewater suggests that this was merely repetition of the already known story, not <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>information</b> claimed by Bowen. Rosewater self-published his findings in a book called An Unjust Slur on Bobby Peel in 1997.|$|E
