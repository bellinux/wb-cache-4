Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

The program quoted Morrow's radio comments about wanting [...] "a stunt <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> hit the headlines across the world" [...] as evidence of irresponsibility. The show also presented Craig Reucassel from The Chaser, responding to questions and claiming that the comedians were [...] "hardly sorry" [...] for their actions. Ironically, the report was made by Dave [...] "Sluggo" [...] Richardson, notorious for his hoax [...] story [...] "In Barcelona Tonight"; but Richardson, unlike The Chaser crew, had not gone through roadblocks in his stunt.|$|E
2500|$|On March 27, 2003, Wolfowitz {{told the}} House Appropriations Committee that oil revenue earned by Iraq alone {{would pay for}} Iraq's {{reconstruction}} after the Iraq war; he testified his [...] "rough recollection" [...] was: [...] "The oil revenues of that country could bring between $50 and $100 billion {{over the course of}} the next two or three years. Now, there are a lot of claims on that money, but ... We are dealing with a country <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon." [...] By October of that year, [...] "Lawrence Di Rita, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said 'prewar estimates that may be borne out in fact are likelier to be more lucky than smart.' [...] added that earlier estimates and statements by Mr. Wolfowitz and others 'oozed with uncertainty.'" [...] Di Rita's comments came as a much less optimistic secret Pentagon study—which had been complete at the time of Wolfowitz's testimony—was coming to public light, and when actual production results in Iraq were coinciding with those projected in the less optimistic Pentagon study.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2001, having dropped {{original}} producer Arnold Lanni, the band met with new producer Bob Rock to start {{work on their}} fifth album. Later the following month, founding guitarist Mike Turner either quit the band or was forced out due to the other members' concerns about his guitar-playing abilities. Said Maida of Turner's departure, [...] "The last two records we've been yearning for a guitar player <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> stand up and have a strong voice and Mike (Turner) just wasn't that kind of guitar player." [...] Turner later formed the band Fair Ground with Harem Scarem guitarist Pete Lesperance and later joined the band Crash Karma. Turner's last performance with the band was for Music Without Borders at Toronto's Air Canada Centre on October 21, 2001. In the months following Turner's departure, the band held auditions for a replacement lead guitarist. Steve Mazur, {{a friend of a}} friend of drummer Jeremy Taggart, was announced as the new guitarist in April 2002. Long-time touring musician Jamie Edwards also became an official band member around this time, but later left that year for personal reasons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Chad's introduction would cause {{trouble for the}} romantic pairing of Will Horton (Dylan Patton) and Mia McCormick (Taylor Spreitler). According to the actor, Chad is extremely sincere about getting custody of the baby from Nicole {{which is why he}} turns down her sexual advances. He refuses to let Mia [...] "whose been lying to him this whole time get in his way." [...] However, Deidrick commented that when Chad turns down Nicole, he is not [...] "acting [...] age." [...] Though he suspects Mia and Nicole are hiding something, Deidrick explained that Chad is completely blindsided when he finds the specifics. Of Chad's reaction to the baby reveal Deidrick said, [...] "There's nothing <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> prepare you for something like that." [...] However, what hurts the most is that Chad has spent so much time trying to win Mia back, and his love for her is actually [...] "sincere." [...] According to Deidrick, it is a [...] "slap in the face," [...] to learn that Mia has been lying about such a huge part of their lives. For Chad, the revelation allows him to see Mia's true colors. Deidrick stated that [...] "here's always going to be tension" [...] between Chad and Mia but Deidrick maintained that despite her lies, Chad feels sorry what Mia has gone through and tries to stay by her side. [...] "It's a very hard situation." [...] Of his character during the storyline, Deidrick described Chad as a [...] "kid who doesn't know what to do and he's a fighting all these feelings." [...] Deidrick previewed that the reveal about the baby switch would put everything [...] "into place." [...] The actor admitted that the baby storyline kept him very isolated due to the significant age differences between himself {{and the rest of his}} teenage costars. When asked about a future love interest, Deidrick mentioned Gabriela Rodriguez who had recently been introduced to the canvas as Gabi Hernandez (Gabriela Rodriguez) but didn't believe a romantic pairing would work due to the age difference.|$|E

60|$|The modern miser {{has changed}} {{much from the}} miser of legend and anecdote; but only because he has grown yet more insane. The old miser had some touch of the human artist about him in so far that he {{collected}} gold&mdash;a substance <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> be admired for itself, like ivory or old oak. An old man who picked up yellow pieces had something of the simple ardour, something of the mystical materialism, {{of a child who}} picks out yellow flowers. Gold is but one kind of coloured clay, but coloured clay can be very beautiful. The modern idolater of riches is content with far less genuine things. The glitter of guineas is like the glitter of buttercups, the chink of pelf is like the chime of bells, compared with the dreary papers and dead calculations which make the hobby of the modern miser.|$|E
60|$|We conclude, therefore, {{that unless}} Eugenic {{activity}} {{be restricted to}} monstrous things like mania, there is no constituted or constitutable authority <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> over-rule men in a matter {{in which they are}} so largely on a level. In the matter of fundamental human rights, nothing can be above Man, except God. An institution claiming to come from God might have such authority; but this is the last claim the Eugenists are likely to make. One caste or one profession seeking to rule men in such matters is like a man's right eye claiming to rule him, or his left leg to run away with him. It is madness. We now pass on to consider whether there is really anything in the way of Eugenics to be done, with such cheerfulness as we may possess after discovering that there is nobody to do it.|$|E

6000|$|See now the {{difference}} of styles. Had I been to have told my thoughts on this occasion; instead of saying how Mr. H[arle]y was [...] "treated by some persons," [...] and [...] "preserved from some unparalleled attempts"; I should with intolerable bluntness and ill manners, have told a formal story, of a com[mitt]ee[6] sent to a condemned criminal in Newgate, to bribe him with a pardon, on condition he would swear high treason against his master, who discovered his correspondence, and secured his person, when a certain grave politician had given him warning to make his escape: and by this means I should have drawn a whole swarm of hedge-writers to exhaust their catalogue of scurrilities against me as a liar, and a slanderer. But with submission to the author of that forementioned paper, I think he has carried that expression to the utmost it will bear: for after all this noise, I know of but two [...] "attempts" [...] against Mr. H[arle]y, <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> be called [...] "unparalleled," [...] which are those aforesaid of Gregg and Guiscard; and as to the rest, I will engage to parallel them from the story of Catiline, and others I could produce.|$|E
60|$|There {{are certain}} authors of whom {{personally}} we know little, but of whose works we cannot ever know enough, such a one for example as Shakespeare; others of whose lives we know much, but for whose works {{we can have}} but scant affection: such is Doctor Johnson; others who are intimate friends in all their aspects, as Goldsmith and Charles Lamb; yet others, who do not quite come home to our bosoms, whose writings we cannot entirely approve, but for whom and for whose works we find a soft place somewhere in our hearts, and such a one is Anthony Trollope. His novels are not for every-day reading, any more than are those of Marryat and Borrow--to take two curious examples. There are times and moods and places in which {{it would be quite}} impossible to read The Three Clerks; others in which this story is almost wholly delightful. With those who are fond of bed-reading Trollope should ever be a favourite, and it is no small compliment to say this, for small is the noble army of authors who have given us books which can enchant in the witching hour between waking and slumber. It is probable that all lovers of letters have their favourite bed-books. Thackeray has charmingly told us of his. Of the few novels <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> be enjoyed when the reader is settling down for slumber almost all have been set forth by writers who--consciously or unconsciously--have placed character before plot; Thackeray himself, Miss Austen, Borrow, Marryat, Sterne, Dickens, Goldsmith and--Trollope.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Still, {{it is not}} all sunshine--there is {{a cloudy}} side. The burden of wealth is a heavy one to bear. Sometimes I have doubted {{if it were not}} better to be poor--at least not inordinately rich. It pains me to see {{neighbouring}} tribesmen stare as they pass by, and overhear them say, reverently, one to another, [...] "There--that is she--the millionaire's daughter!" [...] And sometimes they say sorrowfully, [...] "She is rolling in fish-hooks, and I--I have nothing." [...] It breaks my heart. When I was a child and we were poor, we slept with the door open, if we chose, but now--now {{we have to have a}} night-watchman. In those days my father was gentle and courteous to all; but now he is austere and haughty and cannot abide familiarity. Once his family were his sole thought, but now he goes about thinking of his fish-hooks all the time. And his wealth makes everybody cringing and obsequious to him. Formerly nobody laughed at his jokes, they being always stale and far-fetched and poor, and destitute of the one element <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> justify a joke--the element of humour; but now everybody laughs and cackles at these dismal things, and if any fails to do it my father is deeply displeased, and shows it. Formerly his opinion was not sought upon any matter and was not valuable when he volunteered it; it has that infirmity yet, but, nevertheless, it is sought by all and applauded by all--and he helps do the applauding himself, having no true delicacy and a plentiful want of tact. He has lowered the tone of all our tribe. Once they were a frank and manly race, now they are measly hypocrites, and sodden with servility. In my heart of hearts I hate all the ways of millionaires! Our tribe was once plain, simple folk, and content with the bone fish-hooks of their fathers; now they are eaten up with avarice and would sacrifice every sentiment of honour and honesty to possess themselves of the debasing iron fish-hooks of the foreigner. However, I must not dwell on these sad things. As I have said, it was my dream to be loved for myself alone.|$|E

60|$|The Censor of Plays is a {{small and}} {{accidental}} eighteenth-century official. Like nearly all the powers which Englishmen now respect as ancient and rooted, he is very recent. Novels and newspapers still talk of the English aristocracy that came over with William the Conqueror. Little of our effective oligarchy {{is as old as}} the Reformation; and none of it came over with William the Conqueror. Some of the older English landlords came over with William of Orange; the rest have come by ordinary alien immigration. In the same way we always talk of the Victorian woman (with her smelling salts and sentiment) as the old-fashioned woman. But she really was a quite new-fashioned woman; she considered herself, and was, an advance in delicacy and civilisation upon the coarse and candid Elizabethan woman to whom we are now returning. We are never oppressed by old things; it is recent things <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> oppress. And in accordance with this principle modern England has accepted, {{as if it were a}} part of perennial morality, a tenth-rate job of Walpole's worst days called the Censorship of the Drama. Just as they have supposed the eighteenth-century parvenus to date from Hastings, just as they have supposed the eighteenth-century ladies to date from Eve, so they have supposed the eighteenth-century Censorship to date from Sinai. The origin of the thing was in truth purely political. Its first and principal achievement was to prevent Fielding from writing plays; not at all because the plays were coarse, but because they criticised the Government. Fielding was a free writer; but they did not resent his sexual freedom; the Censor would not have objected if he had torn away the most intimate curtains of decency or rent the last rag from private life. What the Censor disliked was his rending the curtain from public life. There is still much of that spirit in our country; there are no affairs which men seek so much to cover up as public affairs. But the thing was done somewhat more boldly and baldly in Walpole's day; and the Censorship of plays has its origin, not merely in tyranny, but in a quite trifling and temporary and partisan piece of tyranny; a thing in its nature far more ephemeral, far less essential, than Ship Money. Perhaps its brightest moment was when the office of censor was held by that filthy writer, Colman the younger; and when he gravely refused to license a work by the author of Our Village. Few funnier notions can ever have actually been facts than this notion that the restraint and chastity of George Colman saved the English public from the eroticism and obscenity of Miss Mitford.|$|E
