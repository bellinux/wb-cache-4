5|$|Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put ourselves out of our way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part of the story, which starts {{immediately}} after the end of the first part but extends into the next seven years, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together, and eventually get married. Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from, especially Nagisa's illness. Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter Ushio, she dies, which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed. He is barely able to function, let alone look after an infant. As a result, Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae, take care of their granddaughter. Five years later, Tomoya meets with Shino Okazaki, his paternal grandmother. Shino tells Tomoya of his father's traumatic past, which is eerily similar to Tomoya's current situation. Afterwards, Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression, Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had. Tomoya, Sanae and Akio struggle to save her—Tomoya even quits his job—but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain. In the coming winter, wanting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> his daughter, Tomoya takes her on a trip, but she dies shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Thermopylae {{is arguably}} the most famous battle in European ancient history, {{repeatedly}} referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, {{within the context of the}} Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians. The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.|$|E

Despite the help of Joseph de Maistre, the King of Sardinia's diplomatic envoy {{to the court of}} the Russian tsar Alexander I, he was only able to gain small advantages for the future king. However, his willingness <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> the exiled prince, quickly gained Blacas the trust and confidence of his royal master. In 1809, Blacas was made the pretender's grandmaster of the wardrobe (grand-maître de la Garde-Robe du Roi). After the death of the Comte d'Avaray in 1811, he became Provence's closest advisor and favorite.|$|E
25|$|Murray {{summoned the}} Corps Chiefs of Staff at around 1am on 24 August (the {{night after the}} Battle of Mons), and ordered them to retreat, but gave them no {{detailed}} plans, leaving them {{to work out the}} details themselves. French agreed to Haig’s request that I Corps retreat east of the Forest of Mormal (Haig Diary, 24 August) without, apparently, Smith-Dorrien (GOC II Corps) being asked or informed. (Inept staffwork was not unique to GHQ – neither I nor II Corps staff had checked whether or not the Forest of Mormal was occupied by the enemy.) On 24 August Harper refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> Murray, so that Lord Loch had to write messages even though it was not his job. Loch wrote in his diary for that day that Murray was “by nature petulant” and “difficult to work with”. Murray and his staff were working flat out in intense heat at Bavai, and recorded (24 August) that he had passed 24 hours without undressing or sleeping. Smith-Dorrien visited GHQ to request detailed orders on the evening of 24 August, and had to bully Murray into issuing orders for II Corps to retreat to Le Cateau.|$|E

Bernadotte's car was stopped by an Israeli Army Jeep at a roadblock in the Katamon neighborhood. Cohen ran from the Jeep pointed a gun inside the car and shot at Bernadotte and the others {{in the back seat of}} the car at point-blank range, riddling him with bullets. Bernadotte had been hit six times, killing him almost instantaneously. The car was driven at full speed to Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus, but doctors there were unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> Bernadotte, who was bleeding profusely from his wounds. French Army Colonel André Serot, who had been sitting in the back seat next to Bernadotte, was also killed.

25|$|By day four, the {{battered}} division {{was too weak}} to make any attempt to reach the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment, still existed as a unit; the others were just remnants and battalions in name only. The division, unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> the 2nd Battalion at the bridge, dug in, forming a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek with its base on the river. The remnants of the 10th and 156th battalions at Wolfheze began to fall back, but several elements were surrounded and captured. Some 150 men of 156th Battalion were pinned down just west of the Oosterbeek. These men broke out in the late afternoon, with 90 of them making it into the perimeter. At the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Frost finally made radio contact with the division and was told that reinforcement was doubtful. Shortly afterwards, Frost was injured by a mortar bomb, and command passed to Major Frederick Gough. Gough arranged a two-hour truce to evacuate his wounded (including Frost), who were taken into captivity. That night, some units managed to hold out for a while and several tried to break out towards Oosterbeek, but by 05:00 on day five, all resistance at the bridge had ceased.|$|E

500|$|Under Offenbach's management, the Bouffes-Parisiens staged {{works by}} many composers. These {{included}} new pieces by Leon Gastinel and Léo Delibes. When Offenbach asked Rossini's permission to revive his comedy Il signor Bruschino, Rossini {{replied that he}} was pleased to be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> [...] "the Mozart of the Champs-Élysées". Offenbach revered Mozart above all other composers. He had an ambition to present Mozart's neglected one-act comic opera Der Schauspieldirektor at the Bouffes-Parisiens, and he acquired the score from Vienna. With a text translated and adapted by Léon Battu and Ludovic Halévy, he presented it during the Mozart centenary celebrations in May 1856 as L'impresario; it was popular with the public and also greatly enhanced the critical and social standing of the Bouffes-Parisiens. By command of the emperor, Napoleon III, the company performed at the Tuileries palace shortly after the first performance of the Mozart piece.|$|E
500|$|As Grant moved south against Lee in the Overland Campaign, Union Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler {{launched}} the surprise Bermuda Hundred Campaign with landings up the James River. Beauregard successfully lobbied with Jefferson Davis's military adviser, Braxton Bragg, to prevent significant units of his small force from being transferred north of Richmond {{to the aid}} of Lee. His timely action, coupled with the military incompetence of Butler, bottled up the Union army, nullifying its threat to Petersburg and Lee's supply line. Now that this sector was stable, pressure began to rise to transfer troops from Beauregard's front to Lee's. Beauregard did send a division (Maj. Gen. Robert Hoke's) to Lee for the Battle of Cold Harbor, but Lee urgently wanted more and took the step of offering Beauregard command of {{the right wing of the}} Army of Northern Virginia for his cooperation. Beauregard replied in a passive–aggressive manner, [...] "I am willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> our success, but cannot leave my Department without orders of War Department." ...|$|E

She quickly introduced him to her parents and was prepared <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> him, like stealing from the local café. When Dobber asked Toyah to have sex with him, she agreed, despite knowing that she should wait. Toyah was scared that if she said no, Dobber would break up with her. Toyah was persuaded to lose her virginity to Dobber {{in the back of his}} car.

500|$|The {{concept of}} {{motherhood}} is also explored in the episode. According to Elyce Rae Helford, {{in her book}} Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television, Mrs. Peacock functions as a being who has been reduced [...] "to all female functions" [...] by her sons. [...] She is [...] "the grotesquely willing mother who has lost any sense of individual purpose" [...] other than <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> her children. Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club writes that [...] "Scully’s sympathy for a mother that she imagines to be persecuted is turned violently on its head, to reveal a monster whose priorities are not quite so straightforward." [...] The episode {{is also one of}} the first to explore Scully's desire to become a mother. Booker states that the episode presents the dual nature of Scully's [...] "modern desire for motherhood", as opposed to Mrs. Peacock's [...] "perverted notion of family". Helford writes that the entry predicts [...] "Scully's fate as the mother of 'immaculately' (technologically) conceived and monstrous progeny". In the fifth season, Scully indeed learns that she is a mother, albeit accidentally, after her ova was harvested following her abduction in second season, and an alien/human hybrid named Emily is the result. With the revelation that Scully is pregnant at the end of the seventh season finale, [...] "Requiem", the concept revolving around Scully as a mother took center stage in seasons eight and nine with the birth of baby William.|$|E

You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something."

You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV".

Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment.
