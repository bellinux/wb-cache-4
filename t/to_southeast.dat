The less regular western shore faced the Santa Rosa Mountains towards north and the Fish Creek Mountains and Vallecito Mountains farther south. Earlier lake stages may have extended into the Jacumba Mountains as well.|$|E

5|$|Chong Chul Rhee, 8th dan, is {{the founder}} and head of Rhee Taekwon-Do. He holds the title 'World Master' and claims the title 'Father of Australian Taekwondo.'

Rhee is a former unarmed combat instructor in the Korean Marines, and helped introduce taekwondo <b>to</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia (notably in Malaysia and Singapore) before becoming the first taekwondo master sent to Australia by the Republic of Korea.|$|E
5|$|Extant relations, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the white-headed {{starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities in colouration and other features with the extinct Mascarene species. Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling—which appears closer <b>to</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asian starlings—there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from Asia to the Mascarenes, with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival. Except for Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean with native starlings, probably due to their isolation, varied topography, and vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Infections {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{acquired in the}} urban environment.

5|$|Manila {{became famous}} during the Manila–Acapulco galleon trade, which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe, Africa and Hispanic America across the Pacific Islands <b>to</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia (which was already an entrepôt for goods coming from India, Indonesia and China), and vice versa. Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru was {{exchanged}} for Chinese silk, Indian gems and the spices of Southeast Asia.

5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray occurs {{widely in}} the Indo-Pacific, {{with a range}} extending from off eastern South Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, westward {{along the coast of}} the Indian subcontinent <b>to</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia, and reaching as far as Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands to the north, and New Guinea and northern Australia to the southeast. It has also colonized the eastern Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal, i.e. it is a Lessepsian migrant, and it is now common in the south eastern Mediterranean. This species seems to be common only in Australian waters, where it occurs from Shark Bay to Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|The route {{was first}} assumed in 1931 as a {{depression}} relief project and extended in 1937. It remained generally unchanged {{for the next}} 60 years before being decommissioned in 1998. However, a realignment near Lindsay in the late 1950s changed the southern terminus of the route from {{the centre of the}} town <b>to</b> <b>southeast</b> of it; the original route through Lindsay became Highway36B and is now known as Kawartha Lakes Road 17.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by the Japanese, {{in an attempt}} to prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative overland road named Burma Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, Burma, transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese when referring <b>to</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia). Following the request, the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment notice on 7 February 1939.|$|E

5|$|During the Vietnam War era, {{the corps}} {{supervised}} {{the training and}} deployment of more than 137 units and detachments <b>to</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia, including the I and II Field Force staffs. The corps also trained more than 40,000 individual replacements for units in Vietnam, {{for a total of}} over 100,000 soldiers trained. As the war in Southeast Asia ended, the corps received many units and individual soldiers for reassignment or inactivation. It was also during this period that III Corps units participated in a number of key tests and evaluations that would help determine Army organization and equipment for the next 30 years. During this era, the corps also received its distinctive unit insignia.|$|E

This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E
5|$|Following her return, {{the carrier}} {{spent six months}} in Australian waters, before a two-month {{deployment}} <b>to</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia. During this deployment, on 21 June 1981, Melbourne rescued 99 Vietnamese refugees from a disabled fishing vessel in the South China Sea. The carrier's deployments {{for the second half}} of the year consisted of two exercises, Sea Hawk and Kangaroo 81. A major refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed pending the decision on a replacement carrier. After docking at Garden Island in December, the carrier was accidentally flooded by an officer who was impatient to commence leave. In his haste to shut down the carrier, he failed to deactivate the water pumps, and over 180tons of fresh water were pumped in before a maintenance party discovered the flooding the next day. Melbourne remained in dock at the start of 1982, and did not leave before the decision regarding her replacement was made.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, McCauley again became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. In 1947 he was {{promoted}} to air vice marshal and appointed Chief of Staff at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan. Returning to Australia in June 1949, he served as the last Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Eastern Area and the inaugural AOC Home Command (now Air Command). Raised to air marshal, he took up the position of Chief of the Air Staff in January 1954, and was knighted a year later. During his tenure in the RAAF's senior role, McCauley focused on potential deployments <b>to</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia—particularly Vietnam—and threats from the north, commencing redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin and recommending purchase of a light supersonic bomber to replace the Air Force's English Electric Canberra. After retiring from military life in March 1957, he chaired various community and welfare organisations, serving as Federal President of the Air Force Association for ten years. He died in Sydney in 1989, aged 89.|$|E
5|$|Hebron Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a graveyard, consisting of about 700 granite, marble, slate and wooden headstones laid in semi-regular rows running northeast <b>to</b> <b>southeast.</b> The graveyard also abuts the northeastern elevation of the community building. Its interments date from about 1806 to the present; early headstones have deteriorated beyond recognition, and may be older than 1806. Slaves and other people of color are interred in a small area of the graveyard's southeastern section, with simpler markers than the cemetery's other headstones. Although its headstones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks, the graveyard's earliest headstones were simple wooden boards. Several gravestones are ornately carved, including one modeled on a tree stump. The graveyard is active, with the most recent burials at the property's northern end. Dr. William Blum, Sr., an electrochemist at the National Bureau of Standards who invented a chrome plating technique used in banknote printing, is interred at the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In February 1957, Melbourne {{was sent}} to the Royal Hobart Regatta. Following this, she {{travelled}} to New Zealand, where she participated in exercises with HMNZS Royalist and visited several New Zealand ports. The first of several annual three-month deployments <b>to</b> <b>Southeast</b> Asia as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve began in April, with Melbourne returning to Darwin at the end of June. The carrier {{spent the rest of the}} year visiting Australian ports for open inspections by the public. During the visit to Port Adelaide, on 28 October 1957, Melbourne was slightly damaged when she was struck by MV Straat Lanka—the first of several minor collisions the carrier would experience throughout her career. Operations for the year concluded with participation in Exercise Astrolabe off Lord Howe Island, with ships from the RAN, Royal Navy, and Royal New Zealand Navy, before returning to Sydney on 13 December.|$|E
