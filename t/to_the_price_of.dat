5|$|The acute rice {{shortage}} prevailing in {{the state}} became an election issue with the DMK promising to supply three padis (approx. 4.5kg) of rice for 1 Rupee in its election manifesto. The DMK capitalised on the rice shortage as well as widespread discontent with the Bhaktavatsalam administration. Slogans like Kamarajar Annachi kadalaiparuppu vilai ennachu (Elder Brother (Annachi is a title historically been {{used to refer to}} a person of Kamaraj's caste) Kamaraj, what happened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> chana dal?), Bhaktavatsalam annachi arisi vilai ennachu (lit.

5|$|British {{producer}} Elizabeth Karlsen of Number 9 Films {{came across}} Nagy's script circa 2004, {{during which she}} co-produced Nagy's film Mrs. Harris with Christine Vachon of New York-based Killer Films. Berwin's rights <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Price</b> <b>of</b> Salt expired in 2010, and Karlsen thereafter acquired the script. Berwin remained an executive producer on the film. Karlsen managed to convince Highsmith's estate to sign over the rights to her, closing down the deal with Tessa Ross in late 2011. She then persuaded a disillusioned and reluctant Nagy to come back on board. The producers hired a U.K. director who then dropped out because of scheduling conflicts. They later recruited Irish director John Crowley, who was announced in May 2012 along with the film's lead cast, Cate Blanchett and Mia Wasikowska, and involved producers, Karlsen and Stephen Woolley of Number 9 Films and Tessa Ross of Film4, who received executive producer credit. Carol was scheduled to commence photography in early 2013, until Crowley withdrew due to a scheduling conflict. Karlsen called Christine Vachon to discuss losing another director and Vachon told her that Haynes' new film {{was not going to}} happen because its star had backed out of it. They then decided to approach Haynes. Vachon, Haynes' frequent collaborator, asked him if he would be interested and he received a copy of the screenplay. Two days later he committed to direct and Vachon joined the film as a producer. Haynes was announced {{as the director of the}} film in May 2013. Two days later, The Weinstein Company acquired U.S. distribution rights at the Cannes Film Festival.|$|E

5|$|The {{previous}} state {{internet traffic}} are routed through a hub in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur, {{passing through a}} submarine cable connecting the Peninsular with Kota Kinabalu. The systems are considered as costly and inefficient especially due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> leasing bandwidth with the large distance. In 2000, there is a plan to establish Sabah own internet hub but the plan was unreachable due to the high cost and low usage rates in the state. Other alternative plan including using the Brunei internet gateway in a short term before establishing Sabah own gateway. By 2016, {{the federal government has}} start to establish the first internet gateway for East Malaysia with the laying of 60 terabyte submarine cable which are developed by a private company named Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn. Bhd. {{at a cost of about}} RM850 million through the Private Funding Initiative (PFI). Under the 2015 Malaysian Budget project of 1Malaysia Cable System Project (SKR1M), a new submarine cable for high speed internet has been built from Kota Kinabalu to Pahang in the Peninsular which completed in 2017. The 1Malaysia submarine cable system linking the state capital with Miri, Bintulu and Kuching in Sarawak together with Mersing in Johor with an increase of bandwidth capacity up to 12 terabyte per second. Another submarine cable, the BIMP-EAGA Submarine and Terrestrial (BEST) Cable Project is currently being built from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau to connecting Sabah with Brunei, Kalimantan and Mindanao which will be completed in 2018. In early 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and China's largest networking company, Huawei to set Sabah to become information and communications technology (ICT) hub by leveraging on Huawei's ICT expertise. More free high speed Wi-Fi hotspots are being planned in Sabah, especially to the state capital.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a numerically accurate and computationally fast approximation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> European options on coupon-bearing instruments that is applicable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire family of affine term structure models. Exploiting the typical {{shapes of the}} conditional distributions of the risk factors in affine diffusions, we show that one can reliably compute the relevant probabilities needed for pricing options on coupon-bearing instruments by the same Fourier inversion methods used in <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> options on zero-coupon bonds. We apply our theoretical results <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> options on coupon bonds and swaptions, and the calculation of "expected exposures" on swap books. As an empirical illustration, we compute the expected exposures implied by several affine term structure models fit to historical swap yields. Copyright 2002 Blackwell Publishers. ...|$|R
