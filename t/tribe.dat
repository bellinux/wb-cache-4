The <b>Tribe</b> {{is shown to}} be similar to the Clans, yet follows a different set of ancestors: the <b>Tribe</b> of Endless Hunting. The <b>Tribe</b> has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the <b>Tribe.</b> The Healer leads the <b>Tribe,</b> heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the <b>Tribe</b> of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the <b>Tribe,</b> and the prey-hunters hunt.The <b>Tribe</b> was formed by the Ancients when they left the lake to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the <b>Tribe</b> moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.|$|E
5|$|On {{the return}} journey, the Clan cats decide, after {{consultation}} with Midnight, {{to go through}} a mountain range which they had avoided in their initial travels. There, they meet a Clan-like group of cats called the <b>Tribe</b> of Rushing Water, who have their own set of ancestors: the <b>Tribe</b> of Endless Hunting. The <b>Tribe</b> takes the traveling cats in and gives them food and shelter. The Clan cats discover that the <b>Tribe</b> cats have a prophecy: a silver cat will save them from Sharptooth, a savage lion-like creature that has been killing many members of the <b>Tribe.</b> The <b>Tribe</b> thinks that Stormfur is the silver cat from the prophecy, and he is therefore expected to protect the <b>Tribe</b> from Sharptooth. Stormfur eventually agrees to help the <b>Tribe.</b>|$|E

5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul Indian <b>tribe</b> {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, the <b>tribe</b> had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the <b>tribe</b> filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The <b>tribe</b> made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the <b>tribe</b> came to an agreement in 2009, where the <b>tribe</b> would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee <b>tribe</b> was {{considered}} {{by a government}} survey to identify tribes for termination, {{a process in which}} federal recognition of the <b>tribe</b> would be withdrawn and the <b>tribe</b> would no longer be dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a <b>tribe</b> that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that termination would allow the tribal members to be assimilated into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated the federally recognized status of the <b>tribe</b> with the Menominee Indian Termination Act. According to the terms of the Termination Act, the federally recognized status was to end in 1958. The <b>tribe</b> and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of termination until 1961. The <b>tribe</b> was opposed to termination for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss of tribal culture, the loss of land due to tax liens, the possibility of bankruptcy and loss of the tribal timber industry, and the lack of tribal members who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for the <b>tribe</b> to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial outlay that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.|$|E

5|$|Menominee <b>Tribe</b> v. United States is a {{landmark}} case in Native American law, {{primarily in the}} area of reserved tribal rights. It has been used in college courses to explain tribal sovereignty rights and that tribes retain some rights even if the <b>tribe</b> has been terminated, as the Menominee <b>tribe</b> was. The decision in the case has affected subsequent legislation, such as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, in which Congress expressly extinguished all aboriginal rights. The case has been discussed internationally, for example in Australia regarding the relevance of indigenous or aboriginal title.|$|E

5|$|On April 25, 1968, {{the case}} was reargued. The <b>tribe</b> was again {{represented}} by Hobbs, who made the same basic argument that the hunting and fishing rights were not extinguished. The state of Wisconsin was represented by Bronson La Follette, the Attorney General of Wisconsin. La Follette argued that the plain language of the termination act not only ended federal supervision of the <b>tribe,</b> but extinguished the <b>tribe</b> and with it all treaty rights. He argued that the Court of Claims ruling was incorrect and should be reversed, and that the <b>tribe</b> was due compensation from the federal government. The United States was again represented by Claiborne, who reiterated his earlier argument.|$|E
50|$|According to the 2001 census, the Scheduled <b>Tribes</b> {{population}} as in {{percentage of the}} total population of Assam was 12.4 percent.

The Constitution of India categorizes the <b>tribes</b> of Assam into two groups: Scheduled <b>Tribes</b> (Hills) and Scheduled <b>Tribes</b> (Plains). Since hills <b>tribes</b> living in the plains and plains <b>tribes</b> living in the hills in large numbers are not recognised as scheduled <b>tribes</b> in the respective places, the census data may not reflect the correct figures.

5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the <b>tribe</b> had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the <b>tribe,</b> citing The Menominee <b>Tribe</b> of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the <b>tribe</b> had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E

5|$|The Menominee Indian <b>Tribe</b> {{had entered}} {{into a series of}} {{treaties}} with the United States that did not specifically state that they had hunting and fishing rights. In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of health care and education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the <b>tribe</b> were charged with violating Wisconsin's hunting and fishing laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The <b>tribe</b> members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee <b>tribe</b> no longer had hunting and fishing rights because of the termination action by Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Menominee sued in the U.S. Court of Claims {{to recover}} {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} their hunting and fishing rights.
