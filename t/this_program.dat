The international financial community offered strong support for <b>this</b> <b>program,</b> and economic growth continued.

5|$|The {{high energy}} content of 178m2Hf was {{the concern of}} a DARPA-funded program in the US. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> {{determined}} {{that the possibility of}} using a nuclear isomer of hafnium (the above-mentioned 178m2Hf) to construct high-yield weapons with X-ray triggering mechanisms—an application of induced gamma emission—was infeasible because of its expense. See Hafnium controversy.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of the}} Silverplate codename was {{discontinued}} {{after the}} war, but modifications continued under a new codename, Saddletree. Another 80 aircraft were modified under <b>this</b> <b>program.</b> The last group of B-29s was modified in 1953, but never saw further service.|$|E

5|$|Woodward {{asserts that}} the U.S. is {{implementing}} a secret killing program in Iraq targeting designated terrorists and that <b>this</b> <b>program</b> in large parts accounts for the significant drop in violence in the country. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> may have been being carried out by Task Force 77. The secrecy surrounding the program can, according to Woodward, in some ways {{be compared to the}} Manhattan Project during World War II in which the atomic bomb was developed amidst an unprecedented veil of secrecy. Following the publication of the book, U.S. National security adviser Stephen Hadley acknowledged the existence of the described strategy.|$|E
5|$|Another {{increasing}} {{issue is}} the rise in conditional cash transfer programs in Latin America, such as the Oportunidades program in Mexico. Although <b>this</b> <b>program</b> is meant to provide poor families {{with an increase in}} income, the conditionalities has led to a time poverty for the family members who are in charge of fulfilling the conditions, most oftentimes the woman. This has increased the inequality of work burden within the family.|$|E
5|$|Depression set {{in among}} members {{throughout}} the storm-battered community once the rebuilding process began. Fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose. Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling {{their homes and}} leave the Cook Islands altogether.

The government enacted a three-month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the disaster and maintain social integrity among victims.

5|$|In 2003, Grameen Bank {{started a}} new program, {{different}} from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> is focused on distributing small loans to beggars. The loans are completely interest-free, the repayment period can be arbitrarily long, and the borrower is covered under life insurance free of cost. For example, a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka (about US$1.50) may pay back only 2.00 taka (about 3.4 US cents) per week.|$|E

We exemplify our claims with a system that performs master/slave communication across different Smalltalk images. We conclude by proposing a typology of applications where the spying paradigm may be productively used...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of the programmed motion of a multileg bounding vehicle in the flight was studied. An algorithm is given for solving the boundary value problem for constructing <b>this</b> <b>programmed</b> motion. If the motion is shown to be symmetrical, a simplified use of the algorithm can be applied. A method is proposed for nonimpact of the legs during lift-off of the vehicle, and for softness at touchdown.
