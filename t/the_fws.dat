25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fw</b> 190 became <b>the</b> {{backbone}} of Jagdwaffe (Fighter Force) {{along with the}} Bf 109. On the Eastern Front, owing to its versatility, <b>the</b> <b>Fw</b> 190 was used in Schlachtgeschwader (Attack Wings) which were specialised ground attack units. The units achieved much success against Soviet ground forces. As an interceptor, <b>the</b> <b>Fw</b> 190 underwent improvements to make it effective at high altitude, allowing the 190 to maintain relative parity with its Allied counterparts. <b>The</b> <b>Fw</b> 190A series' performance decreased at high altitudes (usually 6,000m (20,000ft) and above), which reduced its usefulness as a high-altitude fighter, but these complications were mostly rectified in later models, notably <b>the</b> Focke-Wulf <b>Fw</b> 190D variant, which was introduced in September 1944. In spite of its successes, it never entirely replaced the Bf 109. <b>The</b> <b>Fw</b> 190 was well liked by its pilots. Some of the Luftwaffes most successful fighter aces flew <b>the</b> <b>Fw</b> 190, including Otto Kittel with 267 victories, Walter Nowotny with 258, and Erich Rudorffer with 222 claimed.

25|$|But in {{addition}} to bombers, Luftflotte 3 also organised a number of Focke-Wulf Fw 190s for bombing duty. These began {{to be used for}} daytime raids as fighter-bombers, or Jabos. After a few attempts with some losses, the Jabo force also turned to the night role. Even at its economical cruising speed, the aircraft would prove essentially impossible for the early Beaufighters to catch. A series of raids in April went unchallenged, and the biggest threat to the attacker was landing accidents or becoming lost and landing at RAF bases, which happened on several occasions. Although the Jabo force was capable of causing little damage, the RAF responded by rapidly introducing new aircraft like the Beaufighter VI, and equipping them with the new radars as quickly as possible. However, these aircraft had little speed advantage over <b>the</b> <b>FWs,</b> and were inadequate to the task.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service {{started an}} effort to {{eradicate}} alien sandbur, a grass that crowds out the native bunchgrass, which is habitat for the birds. Sandbur was first introduced in the 1960s by US Armed Forces personnel. Costing almost one million dollars, the project ended in 2000 when the sandbur was completely removed. With this threat gone, the USFWS hopes to restore Laysan to how it was before it was discovered. To replace the Pritchardia palms that became extinct, <b>the</b> <b>FWS</b> wants to bring in Pritchardia remota from Nihoa, a similar species to Laysan’s lost fan palm. Next may be Nihoa millerbirds, to replace the extinct Laysan millerbirds that were closely related. These transfers would accomplish a two-fold goal: to restore Laysan to an ecology similar to its pre-industrial one, and to protect those two species from extinction by maintaining a second population on Laysan. That way, if diseases, fires, or hurricanes obliterate the Nihoa population, the population can be revived by transplanting some from Laysan.|$|E

We show that the details of the export variability are different for the export through Fram Strait and the CAA, with a much larger influence of salinity changes in the Fram Strait outflow than in the CAA, where <b>the</b> <b>FW</b> export variability is dominated by velocity anomalies. This difference explains the higher correlation of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index with <b>the</b> liquid <b>FW</b> export through <b>the</b> CAA than through Fram Strait. <b>The</b> export of <b>FW</b> from different sources also shows differences in the correlation with the AO index, with much larger correlations between the export of Pacific FW, Eurasian river runoff, and North American river runoff and the AO than for <b>the</b> total liquid <b>FW</b> export...|$|R
