They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they [...] "come to us with questions: Is this possible? Where can we go with this? Then we go and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show." [...] For [...] "The Road Not Taken", he and Chiappetta were asked to again [...] "find a new and gruesome way to blow people up," [...] this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis. Chiappetta explained, [...] "They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up. So <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> sort of leaned back into our mythology." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anthrax {{intended}} to release Anthems {{as a tribute}} to the bands that influenced them over the years. Vocalist Joey Belladonna explained: [...] "These are all bands I grew up with and have listened to forever. It's just great music. I had fun singing these songs and I was happy recording together with Anthrax, doing classic rock songs." [...] When asked how the band got the idea to do such a record, bassist Frank Bello answered: [...] "The reason why that happened, if you ever came to an Anthrax sound check, you’d probably hear every other song but an Anthrax song." [...] He further said that the band got the idea while jamming to some older songs. [...] "We just wanted to say <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> also came from. That gave us our start and that is what sparked us." ...|$|E

So <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> really got that to pay off."

Katsu featured at the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon and served as the opening acts for The Presidents of the United States of America and Jason Mraz. Regarding the latter act, Fallon said, [...] "Yeah, we played a show with all the screaming 12-year-old girls. We also opened for the '80s metal band FireHouse. We don't really match that scene, either. It was pretty wacky." [...] State College remained the band's base, however, despite the propensity of a rural university town for cover songs. Fallon explained, [...] "State College is our base of operations. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> learned how to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|The last strip was the {{culmination}} of a story arc where Annie was kidnapped from her hotel by a wanted war criminal from eastern Europe who checked in under a phony name with a fake passport. Although Warbucks enlists the help of the FBI and Interpol to find her, {{by the end of the}} final strip he has begun to resign himself to the very strong possibility that Annie most likely will not be found alive. Unfortunately Warbucks is unaware that Annie is still alive and has made her way to Guatemala with her captor, known simply as the [...] "Butcher of the Balkans". Although Annie wants to be let go, the Butcher tells her that he neither will let her go nor kill her—for fear of being captured and because he will not kill a child despite his many political killings—and adds that she has a new life now with him. The final panel of the strip reads [...] "And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> leave our Annie. For Now—".|$|E

500|$|South Park animators {{created the}} episode using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation {{animation}} program most {{commonly known as}} [...] "Alias". It was particularly challenging for animators to design the complex scheme of lights during the episode's disco club scene. Eric Stough, director of animation for the series, said it {{took one of the}} technical directors [...] "about half a day" [...] to set up the brief scene. Parker said he was particularly happy with the animation in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", and said he believed the series was starting to settle into the defined look it has retained throughout the years. Parker said, [...] "I think that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> finally felt like we got it right, we got the look of it right". However, the animation includes some perspective errors, particularly during the football scenes, where Chef stands about as wide as a 10-yard marking on the field. Parker said the animators worked for a long time on the snow in the outdoor scenes, but ultimately decided they did not like how it came out.|$|R
