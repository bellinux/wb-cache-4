Portions {{of the sequence}} were pre-visualized in 3D Studio Max, while stills were imported as texture maps and added to animated cut scenes created in 3D modeling package Maya. The artists also improvised {{the use of a}} hand grenade. When Lee saw how violent the sequence was, he improvised the line [...] "Kill Dat Nigga!" [...] as a subtitle. The entire sequence was rendered out to play onscreen in full frame. The original running time of the animated sequence was 60 seconds. Lee cut it to 30 seconds, feeling that a shorter length would make more of an impact.

I said yes, but knew it was out of the question, because in real life things don't happen that way. Nobody walks in and gets on a Norman Lear show.

[...] "I remember meeting Norman and him saying, 'You'll be perfect for the role.' I didn't know whether to <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a compliment or what." [...] To prepare for her role, Linda Gray asked Lear to arrange for her to meet with a transgender woman. Gray met with her for several hours prior to the beginning of filming and on a couple of occasions during production.
