5|$|Calafia meets Radiaro, a Moslem warrior who convinces {{her that}} she should join him in retaking Constantinople from the Christian armies holding it. Calafia, in turn, convinces her people to take their ships, weapons, armor, riding beasts, and 500 griffins, and sail with her to Constantinople to fight the Christians, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no concept {{of what it means}} to be Moslem or Christian. Her {{subjects}} arm themselves with weapons and armor made of gold, as there is no other metal in California. They fill their ships with supplies and hasten to sea.|$|E
5|$|Doggett, {{acting on}} Reyes' insistence that Ed is in danger, stakes out his house. Ed, however, is skinned {{regardless}} of Doggett's attempts to protect him. Reyes admits to Doggett {{that she is}} having flashes of the same premonitions that the victims are experiencing. She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag coated in coal dust from a mine, even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> never seen his body. Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which they believe the dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909.|$|E

5|$|Schouler {{leaves the}} city to become a cattle rancher. Before he goes, he secretly, in order to ruin his former friend, reports McTeague for {{practicing}} dentistry without a license. McTeague is ordered to shut down his practice or face jail. Even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> saved over $200 {{in addition to the}} original $5,000 from the lottery ticket, Trina is unwilling to spend her money. Money becomes increasingly scarce, with the couple forced to sell their possessions. McTeague finally snaps and bites Trina's fingers in a fit of rage. Later, he goes fishing to earn money, taking Trina's savings (now totaling $450).|$|E
5|$|Dominic Fontana, a {{geographer}} at the University of Portsmouth, has voiced {{support for}} du Bellay's {{version of the}} sinking based on the battle as it is depicted in the Cowdray Engraving, and modern GIS analysis of the modern scene of the battle. By plotting the fleets and calculating the conjectured final manoeuvres of the Mary Rose, Fontana reached {{the conclusion that the}} ship had been hit low in the hull by the galleys and was destabilised after taking in water. He has interpreted the final heading of the ship straight due north as a failed attempt to reach the shallows at Spitbank only a few hundred metres away. This theory has been given partial support by Alexzandra Hildred, one of the experts who has worked with the Mary Rose, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> suggested that the close proximity to Spitbank could also indicate that the sinking occurred while trying to make a hard turn to avoid running aground.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. <b>Though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E

25|$|Mii {{is not as}} lascivious in the anime, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> an {{obsession}} with defining plushy things, especially Ai's breasts. She also loves to compare breast sizes of various females. Also, though she passes through time {{like the rest of}} the girls, her very naivete and energy allow her to overcome most of the jumps with ease.|$|E
25|$|She {{plays the}} stereotypical white {{mistress}} role. She pays {{little attention to}} the people she trusts to run her home but hypocritically, it is because she does not see them as individuals. Blanche, however, takes advantage of Grace's ignorance by pretending to be a former employer so that she can get hired even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a warrant out for her arrest. She also uses her stereotype as a white gentle woman to deceive and manipulate everyone in the novel.|$|E

The game features caricatures of Jimmie Walker, Brett Somers, Charles Nelson Reilly, Morgan Fairchild (even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> never appeared on any incarnations of the show itself), Rip Taylor and Vicki Lawrence as the panel and Gene Rayburn as the host.

25|$|In {{the musical}} adaptations, Mamoru protects Usagi and {{generally}} appears at her side. However, {{several of his}} relationships change in different settings: for example, one musical reveals Queen Beryl as Mamoru's fiancé from his time as Prince of the Earth. Associating with Silver Millennium was against Earth law, and Endymion violated this law when {{he fell in love}} with Princess Serenity. In this version of events, Serenity and Endymion are outlaws (similar to Romeo and Juliet) who drive an otherwise innocent woman, Beryl, to evil by making her jealous. Sailor Pluto also reveals that she is in love with Endymion, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> contented herself with watching from afar.|$|E
25|$|The {{people and}} warriors in Arindal's capital are panicking {{because they are}} under attack. Lora berates them, saying that she herself stands firm even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> lost father, brother and lover. She reminds them of Groma's prophecy that the kingdom will not fall if Arindal returns, but the chorus express doubts. Just as she begins to fear that they are right (O musst du Hoffnung schwinden), a {{messenger}} arrives to announce that Arindal is on his way. The new king is greeted joyously by his people, but Arindal himself expresses his fears {{that he is not}} strong enough for battle. Meanwhile, Morald and Lora express their mutual love.|$|E

25|$|Kelly {{has claimed}} {{that the effect of}} a {{successful}} reading is so powerful that even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> revealed in advance to the customers that she is in fact not a real psychic, they refuse to believe that the information and personal details were obtained by mere cold reading techniques. On some occasions, Kelly has had to stop the reading as the client has become extremely emotional, with Kelly offering counselling instead, which she has been trained in. She has also said that intelligent people are easier to read as they have a larger pool of references to use to respond to her cues.|$|E
25|$|Lange began 2014 {{by being}} honored with a {{nomination}} for {{a star on}} The Hollywood Walk of Fame, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> yet to claim it. Lange was also recognized by Elle Magazine with the L'Oreal de Paris Legend Award presented to her by her friend Shirley MacLaine during The Women in Hollywood Awards, honoring women for their outstanding achievements in film, spanning {{all aspects of the}} motion picture industry, including acting, directing, and producing. She was next honored with and became the first female recipient of the Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film, presented to her by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|Manisha Koirala (born 16 August 1970) is a Nepali {{actress who}} mainly appears in Hindi films in India, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> worked in several South Indian and her native country's films. Noted for her acting prowess, Koirala is the {{recipient}} of several accolades, including four Filmfare Awards—and is one of India's most well-known actresses. Although the box-office collections from her films have varied considerably, critics have noted that her niche as an actor remains unharmed irrespective of her commercial potency. She was one of the highest paid actresses in the 1990s. She is amongst the few actresses who made a balance between commercial cinema and Parallel cinema (Art-house films).|$|E

25|$|Ben appears {{far less}} {{competent}} when he agrees to {{a green card}} marriage with his British co-worker Sara. He had just given up on his search for the perfect girl, {{who happens to be}} independently wealthy, enjoys mixed martial arts, and reads Sue Grafton novels. Once married, Ben immediately meets Cassidy while chasing a soul, and she fits every criteria for his perfect girl. Sara, far crueler and more shrewd than she initially lets on, forbids Ben to see Cassidy, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no qualms about her own extramarital affairs that she keeps secret from Ben. Ben is eventually able to negotiate a compromise with Sara after discovering she is pregnant with her married boyfriend Esteban's child.|$|E
25|$|Sister Shannon Masters, the Warrior Nun Areala, {{given the}} serial {{nature of her}} adventures has {{developed}} a wide circle of heroes around her making them into a family she otherwise would not have. That is seen in her foster sister joining the Warrior Nuns and her looking at her fellow Sisters as just that, sisters. Initially uncertain of herself she has developed as a character <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> never lost her idealism or her love of God and Jesus Christ. She has formed strong bonds of affection with her surrogate sisters, Sasuki, Mary, and Sarah; her surrogate son, Jason; her parent figures, Father Gomez and Mother Superion; and with them has fought {{a wide variety of}} foes such as Demon Foster, Julius Salvius, and Helga.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Bournonville {{decided to}} compose {{his own version}} of the story about the young man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an {{engraving}} from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that she is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation {{in the same way as}} the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.|$|E
