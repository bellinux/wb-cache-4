5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this <b>testimony</b> <b>was</b> discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact. It {{is now clear that}} the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between the second and third funnels at or just below the surface.|$|E
5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the <b>testimony</b> <b>was</b> hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's <b>testimony</b> <b>was</b> the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E
5000|$|Eyewitness <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> a {{commonly}} recurring {{topic in the}} discussion of reconstructive memory and its accuracy is the subject of many studies. Eyewitness <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> any firsthand accounts given by individuals of an event they have witnessed. Eyewitness <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> used to acquire details about the event and even to identify the perpetrators of the event. Eyewitness <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> used often in court and is viewed favourably by juries as a reliable source of information.Unfortunately, eyewitness <b>testimony</b> can <b>be</b> easily manipulated by a variety of factors such as: ...|$|R
5000|$|... (1) the <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> {{based upon}} {{sufficient}} facts or data, (2) the <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> {{the product of}} reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to {{the facts of the}} case.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{only the}} <b>testimony</b> by Sunnis <b>is</b> {{accepted}} as reliable, while {{the testimony of}} Hindu witnesses (and other non-Muslim religions) are often ignored in courts of law altogether, as stipulated in Sharia. In general, in Saudi courts, a woman's <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> worth only half that of a man's, and a non-Muslim's (Hindu) <b>testimony</b> <b>is</b> worth {{less than that of}} a Muslim's.|$|R
5|$|Michael Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in December 1995 to treat an abscess {{in his brain}} caused by the poisoning. Fearful that Farrar would not survive the proceedings, and knowing that his <b>testimony</b> <b>was</b> key to their case, prosecutors videotaped his testimony beforehand. The surgery was successful, and Farrar testified in person and recounted Green's problems with alcohol and the break-up of their marriage. Under cross-examination by Green's counsel, he admitted that both he and Green had contributed to {{the problems in the}} couple's marriage and that his relationship with his son had been so adversarial that they had sometimes come to blows.|$|E
5|$|<b>Testimony</b> <b>was</b> {{also heard}} before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence {{and can be}} found in the Congressional Record for those bodies. The Senate Intelligence Committee {{produced}} two reports: Preliminary Inquiry into the Sale of Arms to Iran and Possible Diversion of Funds to the Nicaraguan Resistance (February 2, 1987) and Were Relevant Documents Withheld from the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair? (June 1989).|$|E
5|$|<b>Testimony</b> <b>was</b> {{presented}} that in October 2002, Mme M'Barek {{had convinced}} the peer {{that she was}} pregnant with his child, and as a result, Shaftesbury married her on 5 November 2002. Shaftesbury made out a new will leaving his new wife properties in Ireland and France. Two years later, with no child forthcoming, he began looking elsewhere for affection. When Shaftesbury initiated divorce proceedings, his wife feared losing her valuable inheritance and began to take steps to secure her financial future.|$|E

5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's <b>testimony</b> <b>was</b> significant, since he was a prime witness for the {{prosecution}} but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E
5|$|Under pressure, he {{was adamant}} {{that he was}} unaware of the current {{whereabouts}} of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his <b>testimony</b> <b>was</b> corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a letter sent to Hezekiah Niles' Weekly Register Cofresí admitted off the record that he had killed nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain José Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of pressuring the Spanish governor to execute the pirates.|$|E
5|$|Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hall, {{who lived}} among the Inuit near Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and later at Repulse Bay on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the {{southern}} coast of King William Island, {{but none of the}} Franklin expedition survivors he believed would be found among the Inuit. Though he concluded that all of the Franklin crew were dead, he believed that the official expedition records would yet be found under a stone cairn. With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and Tookoolito, Hall gathered hundreds of pages of Inuit testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter with a party of white men {{on the southern}} coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this <b>testimony</b> <b>was</b> extensively researched by David C. Woodman, and was the basis of two books, Unravelling the Franklin Mystery (1992) and Strangers Among Us (1995), in which he reconstructs the final months of the expedition.|$|E
