5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{planned to}} upgrade the route <b>to</b> <b>main</b> line {{standards}} and extend the line to Oxford, creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite {{the backing of the}} wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, the {{northern}} and eastern freeway bypass of Ann Arbor was completed. At that time, the former routing of US23 through downtown and a section of freeway north of the Huron River was redesignated as Bus. US23. Two years later, M-14 was rerouted to follow the US23 freeway around {{the north side of}} Ann Arbor. It overlapped the business loop from {{the northern}} end of its freeway segment <b>to</b> <b>Main</b> Street and along Main Street into downtown. The next year, in 1965, this overlap was shortened {{when the rest of the}} M-14 freeway westward from Main Street to I-94 was completed.|$|E

Maria Sharapova was expected to return to singles tennis at this tournament after playing doubles matches in the previous tournament, the 2009 BNP Paribas Open. Sharapova, who had not played singles matches since August 2008, withdrew due to a continued lack of fitness.

The miners' trains over this line ceased in April 1959, the line remained open for locomotive movements until the closure of Richmond Main.|$|R

5|$|NY33 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s to {{the portion of}} its modern alignment east of NY5 in Batavia. West of Batavia, what is now NY33 was unnumbered and only partially state-maintained. At the time, state maintenance of this segment began at the Buffalo city line and ended at current NY77 in Corfu. The Corfu–Batavia segment {{was taken over by}} the state of New York in the late 1920s, and NY33 was extended west over the now entirely state-maintained Genesee Street <b>to</b> <b>Main</b> Street (NY5) in downtown Buffalo as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E
5|$|PA378 heads northward {{across the}} Hill to Hill Bridge, {{at which point}} it crosses back into Lehigh County. The route crosses over West Lehigh Street and intersects with the off-ramp <b>to</b> <b>Main</b> Street in Bethlehem. There was {{formerly}} a ramp to 2nd Avenue, but that has been closed and is only used by pedestrians. After this interchange, PA378 becomes a four-lane freeway and is named the Fred B. Rooney Highway. The highway continues northward through the city, crossing under West Broad Street and reaching a southbound interchange with North Street, which leads to Center City and Third Avenue. The freeway continues northward, crossing over and receiving an on-ramp from Union Boulevard.|$|E

5|$|The armor {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had some {{significant}} weaknesses. The rear transverse bulkhead was unprotected {{by any other}} armor but was the same thickness as the forward bulkhead which was defended by the upper belt armor. The thinness of the barbette armor was a serious defect which could have proved fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter bulkhead behind the armor of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>main</b> gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo bulkhead, which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{divided highway}} project on US113 in Maryland was the four-lane divided Berlin bypass, which was {{constructed}} between 1955 and 1957. A second carriageway {{was added to}} the existing highway from Hayes Landing Road <b>to</b> <b>Main</b> Street south of Berlin and for a short stretch north of Main Street {{on the north side of}} Berlin. Main Street through Berlin became MD818 in 1958. When US50's bypass of Berlin was built between 1957 and 1959, ramps from westbound US 50 to northbound US 113 and from eastbound US 50 to southbound US 113 were added. The remaining six ramps of the cloverleaf interchange and US113's bridges across US50 were completed in 1975 and 1976.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} NY268 date {{as far back}} as 1926, by which time the state of New York had assumed {{maintenance}} of several highways in the town of Clarence. The farthest north of these was Tonawanda Creek Road, which was state-maintained from Transit Road (NY78) in Millersport to Salt Road. From here, state maintenance continued south on Salt Road to a junction with Main Street (what is now NY5). Also state-maintained by this time was Goodrich Road, a north–south road connecting Tonawanda Creek Road <b>to</b> <b>Main</b> Street (modern NY5), and Wolcott Road, an east–west highway linking Goodrich Road to Transit Road (what is now NY78).|$|E
5|$|The route turns {{south at}} Cedar Street, {{following}} the residential street into downtown Akron. Here, NY93 intersects with CR573 (John Street) at a junction {{that was once}} the western terminus of NY267. At this intersection, NY93 heads west on John Street for one block before continuing south on Buffalo Street for another block <b>to</b> <b>Main</b> Street. NY93 turns westward again, following Main Street through the westernmost part of Akron's central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction with Mechanic Street. The highway takes on the Mechanic Street name as it crosses over Murder Creek and leaves downtown Akron. Just south of the creek, NY93 changes names to Buell Street at an intersection with Jackson Street.|$|E
