5|$|Written by Brian Hayles. Hayles was {{commissioned}} {{to write a}} storyline for “The Nazis” on March 8, 1966. Shortly thereafter, however, he was engaged to write The Smugglers, which he was told should take a higher priority. “The Nazis” was ultimately abandoned on June 15, 1966, with the sentiment being <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> it portrayed were {{too close to the}} present day.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> in Völuspá {{occurring}} {{after the}} death of the gods (the sun turning black, steam rising, flames touching the heavens, etc.) may be inspired by the volcanic eruptions on Iceland. Records of eruptions on Iceland bear strong similarities to the sequence of events described in Völuspá, especially the eruption at Laki that occurred in 1783. Bertha Phillpotts theorizes that the figure of Surtr was inspired by Icelandic eruptions, and that he was a volcano demon. Surtr's name occurs in some Icelandic place names, among them the lava tube caves Surtshellir, a number of dark caverns in the volcanic central region of Iceland.|$|E

5|$|Norman pioneered {{a form of}} past-life therapy, {{teaching}} her disciples how to recall details of experiences from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled crimes that they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an experience that participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit as proof <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> were real. Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of San Diego State University and Tumminia, differed from most New Age past-life therapies {{in the way that}} it wove her followers into the group's narrative.|$|E
5|$|The 1840s were a {{turbulent}} decade in the Church of England. Following the earlier German Higher Critics, who {{argued for a}} historical approach to religious texts, David Strauss published Leben Jesu or The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined which argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> of the New Testament were not historical but rather mythical. In 1846 George Eliot published an English translation of Leben Jesu which became a source of religious doubts for Froude {{and many of his}} contemporaries. Critics have also identified Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus and Spinoza as sources of Sutherland's doubts, and those of many of his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|The king soon revoked the {{charters}} {{of freedom}} and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued {{in other parts of}} the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.|$|E

5|$|There is an {{academic}} consensus <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> of the nine-month conflict were a genocide. The atrocities in East Pakistan {{were the first}} instances of war rape to attract international media attention, and Sally J. Scholz has written {{that this was the}} first genocide to capture the interest of the mass media. The women's human rights organisation Bangladesh Mahila Parishat took part in the war by publicising the atrocities being carried out by the Pakistani army.|$|E

During a meeting with Walter Skinner, Mulder continues to insist <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> have been orchestrated by the military and not by aliens. Meanwhile, the Russian vaccine seems to have no effect on Marita. The First Elder tells the Well-Manicured Man that they have already decided to turn the Rebel over to the Colonists. Jeffrey shows Scully a video of him talking about aliens while under hypnosis while he was a child, claiming his mother had forced him to make those statements.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} Yuka, Haruka, Saki, and Kurumi's routes, {{the player}} gets {{access to the}} Izumi Cure route, in which Makoto learns that Izumi and Okuhiko had deceived him into thinking that his premonitions were true. Makoto confronts Izumi, after which both he and Izumi fall off a cliff. They travel back in time, retaining their memories of the past six days. Makoto accepts that he has traveled through time, and Izumi reveals {{that she is the}} professor in charge of the seminar camp, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> of the past week were a science experiment; she attempted to test the phenomenon known as Curé Syndrome, where if multiple people believe in a delusion and the delusion is spread to others, the delusion becomes reality. Makoto was the test subject of the experiment, which was meant to involve him having the delusion that he could have premonitions; unexpectedly, he turned out to have real premonitions.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the Society of Leopold excavates {{the site}} of Vyšehrad Castle; they recover Christof's body {{and take it to}} London, where he is awoken by a female voice. He learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> at Vyšehrad and the {{resulting}} human uprising divided the vampires into two sects: the Camarilla who seek to hide from humanity and the Sabbat who seek to regain dominion over it. The Society's excavation also enables Vukodlak's followers to recover Vyšehrad. After escaping, Christof meets Pink, who agrees to help him. They learn that the Setite clan has been shipping Vyšehrad contraband to New York City and infiltrate a Setite brothel to gain information. They kill the Setite leader Lucretia and recruit Lily, an enslaved prostitute.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, {{the player}} wakes up to Chirithy at a {{simulation}} of Enchanted Dominion. Chirithy claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> of the Keyblade War {{have really been}} a dream the player has had ever since turning down Ava's offer to join the Dandelions (although in Unchained χ, it is revealed that the player is actually sent to the Unchained Realm by Ephemer and Skuld) and the two decide to rest after confronting a wall of thorns. On {{the other side of}} the thorns, Maleficent (who is heavily implied to have found the Book of Prophecies) congratulates herself with what she has accomplished whilst wondering where Pete is. Confident that Sora and company cannot meddle in this world, she contemplates on conquering this iteration of her home world that she has entered in.|$|E
5|$|The First World War, {{which took}} place between 1914 and 1918, saw the {{extensive}} use of artillery, particularly on the Western Front. Technical advances, combined with the relatively static nature of trench warfare, made these guns {{a key element of}} the conflict: over half the casualties in the war were caused by artillery. Artillery guns and their crews were themselves targets, however, and 49,076 members of the Royal Artillery died during the conflict. In the years after the war, many former servicemen, including gunners, found the scale of the losses difficult to deal with, or felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> challenged their trust in the political leadership that had led them into the war. Visual reminders of the conflict were often avoided: mutilated servicemen, for example, were banned in the 1920s from joining in veterans' marches, and those with facial injuries often hid them in public.|$|E

5|$|The {{first serious}} combat {{involving}} the Swiss Air Force began in June 1940. In {{six days of}} aerial battles, eleven German aircraft were downed, {{with a loss of}} two Swiss aircraft and three airmen killed. Following these incidents, on 6June, the chief of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Göring, protested the attacks, claiming that most of the German planes had been in French airspace and that the Luftwaffe had entered Swiss airspace only by mistake. Germany demanded financial compensation and an apology by the Swiss government. In a second, more pointed demand on 19June, Germany stated that they viewed the air battles as a flagrant act of aggression, and if these interceptions continued, Switzerland would face sanctions and retaliation. The next day, General Henri Guisan ordered all Swiss units to stop engaging foreign aircraft, and on 1July 1940, the Federal Council apologized for possible border violations by Swiss pilots, without admitting any had occurred. On 16 July, the German government declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> were settled. Engaging aircraft of the combatant nations was prohibited until October 1943, when strategic bombing of Bavaria and Austria by the Allies became an increasing likelihood.|$|E
5|$|The true {{origin of}} the rhyme is unknown, but there are several theories. Complicated metaphors are often said to exist within the lyrics, as is common with nursery rhyme exegesis. Most {{explanations}} post-date the first publication of the rhyme and have no corroborating evidence. These include the suggestion by S. Baring-Gould in the 19th century <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> were {{a version of the}} story told in the 13th-century Prose Edda Gylfaginning written by Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson. Baring-Gould stated that Hjúki and Bil, brother and sister respectively in Norse mythology, were taken up from the earth by the moon (personified as the god Máni) as they were fetching water from the well called Byrgir, bearing on their shoulders the cask called Saegr and the pole called Simul. Around 1835, John Bellenden Ker suggested that Jack and Jill were two priests; this was enlarged by Katherine Elwes in 1930 to indicate that Jack represented Cardinal Wolsey (c.1471–1530) and Jill was Bishop Tarbes, who negotiated the marriage of Mary Tudor to the French king in 1514.|$|E
