5|$|Despite the {{critical}} acclaim, The Wire received poor Nielsen ratings, which Simon {{attributed to the}} complexity of the plot; a poor time slot; heavy use of esoteric slang, particularly among <b>the</b> <b>gangster</b> characters; and a predominantly black cast. Critics felt the show was testing the attention span of its audience and that it was mistimed {{in the wake of the}} launch of the successful crime drama The Shield on FX.

5|$|Before filming, Mendes {{sought to}} produce a period film that would avoid clichés in <b>the</b> <b>gangster</b> genre. He chose to film Road to Perdition on {{location}} in downtown at the University Club of Chicago, the Chicago neighborhood of Pullman {{as well as the}} Chicago suburb of Geneva, Illinois. The Armory, the state's largest location mainstay which houses the Illinois State National Guard, was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission. Sets were built inside the Armory, including interiors of the Sullivan family's home and the Rooney mansion. The availability of an inside location provided the crew complete control over the lighting environment, which was established with the rigging of scaffoldings.|$|E

5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in <b>the</b> <b>gangster</b> film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the backseat of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed <b>the</b> <b>gangster</b> George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E
5|$|The era of American film {{production}} {{from the early}} sound era to {{the enforcement of the}} Hays Code in 1934 is denoted as Pre-Code Hollywood. The era contained violence and crime in pictures which would not be seen again until decades later. Although the Hays office had specifically recommended removing profanity, the drug trade, and prostitution from pictures, it had never officially recommended against depictions of violence in any form in the 1920s. State censor boards, however, created their own guidelines, and New York in particular developed a list of violent material which had to be removed for a picture to be shown in the state. Two main types of crime films were released during the period: <b>the</b> <b>gangster</b> picture and the prison film.|$|E

However, the Thousand-Hand Kannon comes to life, breaking the temple doors and attacking one of <b>the</b> <b>gangsters.</b> <b>The</b> statue shatters into pieces and inside it is a boy who tells them to lay their hands off Sachi, sending fear amongst <b>the</b> <b>gangsters</b> who then flee, vowing revenge. The boy introduces himself as Senju, the Thousand-Hand Kannon.|$|R
50|$|When {{running low}} on cash, <b>the</b> <b>gangsters</b> panic and {{increase}} the intensity of their cheat to regain their cash from the player.

5|$|While {{many critics}} refer to film noir as a genre itself, {{others argue that}} it can be no such thing. While noir is often {{associated}} with an urban setting, many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with <b>the</b> <b>gangster</b> film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.|$|E
5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of <b>the</b> <b>gangster.</b> During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun for Hire (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E

Batman pursues the killer, but is interrupted {{by the police and}} rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains that she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had embezzled money; her father repaid, but they put out a hit on him. Bruce now believes her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a familiar-looking man in the background of the photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont: the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves and presses him for information; Reeves insists that Batman is the cloaked killer. He professes his ignorance but Joker believes Reeves needs to protect his reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he helped the Beaumonts escape and told Valestra's mob their location.|$|E
