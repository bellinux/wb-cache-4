25|$|Before the {{creation}} of Lake Shannon, the area was used primarily for fur <b>trapping,</b> <b>logging,</b> and concrete making. The construction of Lower Baker Dam blocked salmon migration in the Baker River. An artificial fish passage system was begun in the 1950s and completed in 1959 after the construction of Upper Baker Dam, located upstream of Lake Shannon. The lake has abundant landlocked kokanee salmon, the by-product of salmon spawning in lake tributaries. Fishing, boating and water skiing are popular recreational activities on the lake.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Wood {{destroying}} insects {{were investigated}} in forest depots, imported timbers, and wood products {{in use in}} Düzce province. In the collection of insect material <b>trap</b> <b>logs,</b> storage decks, and samples of wooden materials were used. In total, 63 insect species belonging to 31 families of 4 orders were found, and 34 of the identified species were categorized as pest species. In forest depots, the most common insects were bark beetles and longhorned beetles. Several wood-destroying insects were found in imported timbers, such as Platypus cylindrus (Fabricius), Xyleborus sp., and Lymexylon navale (Linnaeus). In addition, the Coleopteran species Lyctus brunneus (Stephens), Hylotrupes bajulus (Linnaeus), Anobium punctatum (De Geer), and Xestobium rufovillosum (De Geer), which are economically very important, were found in wood products...|$|R

Its population on this tiny island (about 5 km2 or 1.9 mi2) had fallen to 10 as of June and July 2008.

5000|$|In 1883, {{heavy rains}} during June and July brought water levels {{on the river}} to record highs. The {{flooding}} was bad enough, but the rising water overwhelmed lumbering booms—river enclosures used to sort and organize logs for transport to saw mills—in Lowell, Grand Rapids as well as Grand Haven and Robinson townships. As water rose, the logs escaped the enclosures, much like cattle fleeing stockyards. Soon, Kent and Ottawa counties had a stampede, as millions of logs flowed uncontrolled down the river and became trapped in bends or against bridges. The result was a logjam of incredible proportions that clogged the river for 47 miles (10 million Feet of <b>logs</b> <b>trapped</b> in Lowell, 95 million Feet of <b>logs</b> <b>trapped</b> in the [...] "Big Bend" [...] northeast of Grand Rapids, 80 million Feet of <b>logs</b> <b>trapped</b> in Ottawa County).|$|R
40|$|Culicidae), both vectors of Japanese encephalitis, were {{collected}} in 1984 and 1998 from two disease endemic localities in Sri Lanka: Anaradhapura and Kandy. Using wild-caught adult mosquitoes from light <b>traps,</b> <b>log</b> dosage-probit mortality curves for insecticide bioassays were obtained for three insecticides: malathion (organophosphate), propoxur (carbamate) and permethrin (pyrethroid). LD 50 values showed that, in 1998, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was ~ 100 -fold more resistant to malathion and 10 -fold more resistant to propoxur than was Cx. gelidus. This difference was attributed to Cx. tritaeniorhynchus breeding mostly in irrigated rice paddy ®elds, where {{it would have been}} exposed to pesticide selection pressure, whereas Cx. gelidus breeds in other types of aquatic habitats less prone to pesticide applications. Resistance in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus increased between 1984 and 1998, whereas Cx. gelidus remained predominantly susceptible. Propoxur inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity (the target site of organophosphates and carbamates) indicated that in 1998, frequencies of insensitive AChE-based resistance were 9 % in Cx. gelidus and 2 ± 23 % in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus...|$|R

It was such a strange sight that my fear was forgotten. There was something almost human {{in the way the}} bear looked at that trap. He touched it gingerly with his free paw, and nosed it. I crept up close to the corner of stone and looked around again. The bear was now close to me. I saw the heavy chain and the log to which it was attached. He looked at <b>trap</b> and <b>log</b> in a grave, pathetic way, as if trying to reason about them.

40|$|In 2011 – 2013, trials {{on the use}} of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana against {{bark beetle}} (Ips typographus) populations were carried out under open field {{conditions}} in Norway spruce stands suffering from an outbreak in the Beskid Żywiecki Mts. in Poland. Modified pheromone traps were deployed to capture and thereafter release fungus-infected bark beetles to the forest environment. Infested spruce trees felled next to the traps remained unaffected by the transmission of the fungus to insect populations. Direct spraying or dusting of lying <b>trap</b> <b>logs</b> and suspended caged rearing bolts did not have any effect on spruce infestation by I. typographus, its reproduction success and development or natural enemies inside the bark. A very small effect on mortality rates of target as well as non-target insects overwintering in the dusted litter was observed. Treated stands, unlike control stands, were indirectly affected by the treatment, evidenced by the reduction of tree mortality due to bark beetle infestation. At present, no recommendations concerning the potential use of the fungus in forest protection can be given. However such an environmentally friendly approach represents a promising future prospect.

40|$|The two {{eucalyptus}} borers Phoracantha semipunctata and P. recurva were accidently {{introduced in}} Tunisia in 1962 and 1999, respectively. Their relative distribution is still unknown {{and very little}} is known about their preferences and performances in various host species under different Tunisian climates. We combined field data and laboratory follow-up, in order to define their present distribution, their relative abundance and to test the effects of sites and Eucalyptus species on attack density, reproductive and developmental performances and productivity of insects. The study was carried out in Eucalyptus plantations of ten localities ranging from humid to arid. Choice preference and colonization of various selected Eucalyptus species by the two borers were studied with standing trap trees and <b>trap</b> <b>logs.</b> Tree species differed among localities, but all localities contained {{at least one of the}} two species E. gomphocephala and E. camaldulensis, both being well appreciated by the two Phoracantha species. It appeared that both beetle species were present in all localities but P recurva was dominant over P semipunctata everywhere. Insect characteristics depended on attack localization on tree stem; attack densities were higher on the lowest than on the upper parts. It is perfectly coherent that the density of emerging beetles correlated positively with attack density, number of young larval galleries, larval survival and adult success in the trap tree experiment. High larval survival and adult success resulted in high offspring productivity. Insect parameters, especially the intensity of infestation, depended on locality but without relation with the climatic areas...|$|R
40|$|Species {{diversity}} commonly {{increases with}} succession and {{this relationship is}} an important justification for conserving large areas of old-growth habitats. However, species with different ecological roles respond differently to succession. We {{examined the relationship between}} a range of diversity measures and time since disturbance for boreal forest beetles collected over a 285 year forest chronosequence. We compared responses of "functional" groups related to threat status, dependence on dead wood habitats, diet and the type of trap in which they were collected (indicative of the breadth of ecologies of species). We examined fits of commonly used rank-abundance models for each age class and traditional and derived diversity indices. Rank abundance distributions were closest to the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution, suggesting little role for competition in structuring most assemblages. Diversity measures for most functional groups increased with succession, but differences in slopes were common. Evenness declined with succession; more so for red-listed species than common species. Saproxylic species increased in diversity with succession while non-saproxylic species did not. Slopes for fungivores were steeper than other diet groups, while detritivores were not strongly affected by succession. Species trapped using emergence <b>traps</b> (<b>log</b> specialists) responded more weakly to succession than those trapped using flight intercept traps (representing a broader set of ecologies). Species associated with microhabitats that accumulate with succession (fungi and dead wood) thus showed the strongest diversity responses to succession. These clear differences between functional group responses to forest succession should be considered in planning landscapes for optimum conservation value, particularly functional resilience...|$|R
