Finally, six letters also survive under Demosthenes's name and their authorship too is hotly debated.|$|E
5|$|Patton's Speech to the Third Army was {{a series}} of speeches given by General George S. Patton to troops of the United States Third Army in 1944, prior to the Allied {{invasion}} of France. <b>The</b> <b>speeches</b> were intended to motivate the inexperienced Third Army for its pending combat duty. In <b>the</b> <b>speeches,</b> Patton urged his soldiers to do their duty regardless of personal fear, and he exhorted them to aggressiveness and constant offensive action. Patton's profanity-laced speaking was viewed as unprofessional by some other officers but the speech resounded well with his men. Some historians have acclaimed the oration {{as one of the greatest}} motivational speeches of all time.|$|E

5|$|Against Neaera is {{preserved}} as Demosthenes' fifty-ninth speech, {{though it has}} been thought inauthentic since antiquity. Dionysius of Hallicarnassus, for instance, questioned its authorship. Modern scholars from the nineteenth century to the present have generally accepted that the speech was not written by Demosthenes, and today it is often grouped {{with the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> concerning Apollodoros as being the work of a single Pseudo-Demosthenes. This author has been identified as Apollodoros himself by various scholars, including Kapparis in his commentary on the speech.|$|E
5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style. This might, however, {{be the result of}} the incorporation of the genre of rhetoric into the genre of historiography. That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.|$|E
5|$|Hominid {{is a short}} novel which {{contains}} one single and linear storyline. However, it is subdivided into seven chapters, each standing for a narrated day.

5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did not add his own notions and thoughts.|$|E

The Buddhist activist monk Thich Tam Chau spoke from a radio station in Nha Trang, exhorting his co-religionists to support the incumbent junta. The Diemist speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist or anti-Diệm generals, such as Thi and Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively, and feared retribution from Thảo and Phát. <b>The</b> <b>speeches</b> drove many anti-Diệm officers who may have otherwise been neutral or sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E

In September of the same year, he was present at the conference of the pro-communist International Union of Students (where he was a guest of the French-based Union of Communist Students, and met with similar organizations from Romania and other countries).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{algorithm}} which enhances <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> intelligibility using <b>the</b> properties of human auditory system. In previous algorithms related to <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> intelligibility, <b>the</b> improvement in intelligibility has been mostly incorporated in a single-channel environment where <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> and noise signals are mixed together. But <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> enhancement problem of dual channel, in which <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> signal {{is separated from}} noise, has been rarely treated. This paper introduces <b>the</b> dual-channel <b>speech</b> enhancement algorithm which enhances the intelligibility by reinforcing speech before it is mixed with noise. To enhance <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> intelligibility, we use the masking phenomenon of the human auditory system. The proposed algorithm has been tested by the subjective experiment which resulted in improved results over the automatic gain control algorithm.

40|$|In general, {{low rate}} speech coding systems {{do not have}} their own {{mechanism}} to reduce background noise from <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> signal. This {{is due to the}} complexity of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> signal and limitations in the scope of many speech coding systems. As a consequence, most speech enhancement systems to date have attempted to process <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> waveform directly and independently from <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> coding system, before the encoding of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> signals. In this paper, we propose several methods to optimize speech enhancement techniques in order to improve the estimation of <b>the</b> CELP <b>speech</b> codec parameters (short-term and long-term parameters). Experimental results for two speech enhancement techniques are presented in conjunction with <b>the</b> ETSI AMR <b>speech</b> codec. 1...|$|R

5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} speech on 28 February 2008, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng {{said that the}} Government had adjusted its policies in relation to various types of expression. For instance, in 2000 it had created Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches. Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions. All public talks held indoors involving organizers and speakers who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act. However, {{freedom of speech and}} expression, though characteristic and imperative in a self-professed democracy, is not unfettered. The Government thus continues to require licences for events where <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> relate to race or religion, and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held.|$|E
5|$|Judicial oratory {{had become}} a {{significant}} literary genre by {{the second half of}} the fifth century, as represented in <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of Demosthenes' predecessors, Antiphon and Andocides. Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system: evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a preliminary hearing and litigants could present it as they pleased within set speeches; however, witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by force or bribery), there was little cross-examination during the trial, there were no instructions to the jury from a judge, no conferencing between jurists before voting, the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members), cases depended largely on questions of probable motive, and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law—conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches.* H.

On March 4, Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration day, Jefferson Davis called up 100,000 militia to serve a year and sent besieging troops to surround Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Fort Pickens in Florida. That same day Waitman T. Willey from trans-Alleghany Monongalia County answered secessionists with a Unionist speech. He defended Virginia's institutions from Northern attacks against slavery, but “there is no constitutional right of secession...” He warned that secession would bring about war, taxes and the abolition of slavery in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was {{confident}} of winning an election fought on that question. But it was free silver {{that became the}} issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932.|$|E
