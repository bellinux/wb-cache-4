5|$|Series 3 {{began on}} 23 September 1995. The {{computer}} game for this series was called Snuffle the <b>Truffles</b> and involved viewers guiding a pig character around a pigpen eating <b>truffles,</b> whilst Trev and Simon invited two guests to review videos in the Video Galleon.|$|E
5|$|Some, such as <b>truffles,</b> are esteemed as costly delicacies. A few {{species such}} as Agaricus bisporus and oyster {{mushrooms}} (Pleurotus spp.) are cultivated.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} game Snuffle The <b>Truffles</b> {{was replaced with}} a parrot themed game Loot The Fruit and Mr Blobby joined the show and was given his own game called Blobby's Baggage which involved viewers having to guess where Blobby had been on holiday.|$|E
50|$|Tuber brumale, {{also known}} as the brumale <b>truffle</b> or winter <b>truffle,</b> is a species of <b>truffle</b> native to Southern Europe. It is {{naturally}} present in the soils of many <b>truffle</b> orchards.|$|R
50|$|Tuber melanosporum, {{called the}} black <b>truffle,</b> Périgord <b>truffle</b> or French black <b>truffle,</b> is {{a species of}} <b>truffle</b> native to Southern Europe. It {{is one of the}} most {{expensive}} edible mushrooms in the world.|$|R
50|$|The summer <b>truffle</b> (Tuber aestivum) or {{burgundy}} <b>truffle</b> (Tuber uncinatum) is {{a species}} of <b>truffle,</b> found in almost all European countries.|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} more {{mushroom}} species that are harvested from the wild for personal consumption or commercial sale. Milk mushrooms, morels, chanterelles, <b>truffles,</b> black trumpets, and porcini mushrooms (Boletus edulis) (also known as king boletes) demand a high price on the market. They are often used in gourmet dishes.|$|E
5|$|The book offered {{elaborate}} dishes, described with French terminology such as bisque, entrées, entremets, vol-au-vent, timbale and soufflé. It included {{bills of}} fare for meals {{for up to}} 300 people, and {{for a series of}} eight- or nine-course dinners served to Queen Victoria; one exceptional royal dinner in 1841 had sixteen entrées and sixteen entremets, including <b>truffles</b> in Champagne.|$|E
5|$|Kalapuya brunnea is {{a species}} of truffle in the {{monotypic}} fungal genus Kalapuya. The truffle occurs only in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, in western Oregon and northern California. Known locally as the Oregon brown truffle, it was formerly thought to be an undescribed species of Leucangium until molecular analysis demonstrated that it was distinct from that genus. The truffle is reddish brown with a rough and warty outer skin, while the interior spore-producing gleba is initially whitish before developing greyish-brown mottling as it matures. Mature <b>truffles</b> have an odor resembling garlicky cheese, similar to mature Camembert. The species has been harvested for culinary purposes in Oregon.|$|E
50|$|The black <b>truffle</b> is morphologically {{very similar}} to the commercially less {{valuable}} Chinese <b>truffle</b> (Tuber indicum). To avoid fraud or misidentifications in commerce, a RFLP genetic test has been developed to distinguish the two species. Externally, they can be distinguished by their skin, which is smoother and dark red or dark brown in the Chinese <b>truffle.</b> Two other similar <b>truffle</b> species are the summer <b>truffle</b> (Tuber aestivum) and the winter <b>truffle</b> (Tuber brumale), whose flesh is of a lighter color.|$|R

40|$|In {{this review}} {{the current status}} of <b>truffle</b> {{cultivation}} in Europe and outside Europe is reported. While the cultivation of Tuber melanosporum (Périgord black <b>truffle),</b> Tuber aestivum (summer or Burgundy <b>truffle)</b> and Tuber borchii (bianchetto <b>truffle)</b> gave good results, only the Italian white <b>truffle</b> (Tuber magnatum), which is the most expensive, has yet to be successfully cultivated. In future a revolutionary approach to <b>truffle</b> cultivation would be the application of mycelial inoculation techniques for producing Tuber infected plants which will allow to select the fungal strains adapted to specific climatic, edaphic conditions and hosts. The new insights which will be gained by the extensive Tuber genome sequencing programme will also help to improve <b>truffle</b> cultivation techniques...|$|R
5|$|The Ascomycota, {{commonly}} known as sac fungi or ascomycetes, constitute the largest taxonomic group within the Eumycota. These fungi form meiotic spores called ascospores, which are enclosed in a special sac-like structure called an ascus. This phylum includes morels, a few mushrooms and <b>truffles,</b> unicellular yeasts (e.g., of the genera Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Candida), and many filamentous fungi living as saprotrophs, parasites, and mutualistic symbionts (e.g. lichens). Prominent and important genera of filamentous ascomycetes include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Claviceps. Many ascomycete species have only been observed undergoing asexual reproduction (called anamorphic species), but analysis of molecular data has often been able to identify their closest teleomorphs in the Ascomycota. Because the products of meiosis are retained within the sac-like ascus, ascomycetes {{have been used for}} elucidating principles of genetics and heredity (e.g., Neurospora crassa).|$|E
5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. <b>Truffles</b> are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
5|$|When {{producing}} a particular chocolate {{for the first}} time, a mini-game is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon. The ingredients and quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe. Each time a circle {{is filled with the}} correct ingredients, it is removed and an empty circle put in its place. The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. If too many ingredients are wasted by misfiring the cannon, production is brought to a halt and the mini-game must be attempted again. The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week. The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct ingredients, and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory. Playing the mini-game advances in-game time by one week. Different chocolate types, such as <b>truffles</b> and squares, require the factory to be upgraded first, costing money.|$|E

40|$|The {{two best}} {{candidate}} species for <b>truffle</b> cultivation in the south-central U. S. are the Burgundy <b>truffle</b> (Tuber aestivum Vitt., syn. T. uncinatum Ch.) and the Perigord black <b>truffle</b> (T. melanosporum Vitt.). These common names (Burgundy <b>truffle</b> and Perigord black <b>truffle)</b> {{are derived from}} the names {{of two of the}} many regions in France where they are famous. Though native to Europe, there is great interest in expanding the cultivated range of both of these species...|$|R

25|$|The {{flavor of}} black <b>truffles</b> {{is far less}} pungent and more refined than that of white <b>truffles.</b> Their strong flavor is often {{described}} as syrupy sweet. Black <b>truffles</b> also are used for producing truffle salt and truffle honey.|$|E
25|$|<b>Truffles</b> {{were rarely}} {{used during the}} Middle Ages. Truffle hunting is {{mentioned}} by Bartolomeo Platina, the papal historian, in 1481, when he recorded that the sows of Notza were without equal in hunting <b>truffles,</b> {{but they should be}} muzzled to prevent them from eating the prize.|$|E
25|$|White <b>truffles</b> are {{generally}} served raw, and shaved over steaming buttered pasta, salads, or fried eggs. White or black paper-thin truffle slices may be inserted into meats, under the skins of roasted fowl, in foie gras preparations, in pâtés, or in stuffings. Some speciality cheeses contain <b>truffles,</b> as well.|$|E
50|$|Tuber lyonii, {{also known}} as the American Brown <b>Truffle</b> or the Pecan <b>Truffle,</b> is a species of <b>truffle</b> native to North America. The pecan <b>truffle</b> is so named because it is most {{commonly}} found in pecan orchards, in association with the pecan tree, however the pecan is not its only symbiote. Formerly considered nothing more than a nuisance by pecan farmers, the pecan <b>truffle</b> has been gaining in popularity as an edible mushroom in recent years and can fetch over $160 per pound at market.|$|R

25|$|The mycelia of <b>truffles</b> form symbiotic, {{mycorrhizal}} {{relationships with}} the roots of several tree species including beech, birch, hazel, hornbeam, oak, pine, and poplar. They prefer argillaceous or calcareous soils that are well drained and neutral or alkaline. <b>Truffles</b> fruit throughout the year, depending on the species, {{and can be found}} buried between the leaf litter and the soil.|$|E

50|$|In cuisine and commerce, {{particularly}} in France and Italy, the summer <b>truffle</b> (T. aestivum) is {{distinguished from the}} burgundy <b>truffle</b> (T. uncinatum). However, molecular analysis showed in 2004 that these two varieties of <b>truffle</b> are one species. The differences between them are therefore likely due to environmental factors.|$|R
25|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, new {{attempts}} for mass production of <b>truffles</b> have been started. Eighty {{percent of the}} <b>truffles</b> now produced in France come from specially planted truffle groves. Nonetheless, production has yet to recover its 1900s peaks. Local farmers are sometimes opposed to a return of mass production, which would possibly decrease the price of <b>truffles</b> (though it is commonly stated that demand is 10 times higher than offer). In exchange there are heavy investments in cultivated plantations under way {{in many parts of}} the world. Thanks to controlled irrigation, regular and resilient production is indeed possible. There are now truffle-growing areas in the United Kingdom, United States, Spain, Sweden, New Zealand, Australia, Chile and South Africa.|$|E
