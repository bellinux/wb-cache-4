40|$|Luminescent {{materials}} {{can be found}} in a broad range of everyday applications. While in the seventies and eighties, the field of luminescent materials seemed to be fairly well covered, research in nineties has been revitalized both in industry and academia. Improvements over the last three decades have led to phosphor materials that operate close to their physical limits. It cannot be expected that properties such as quantum yield and spectral energy distribution will be significantly improved or that distinctly better materials will be found in the near future. Recently, there is a considerable research activity in the field of luminescent materials for lighting and displays to improve the chemical stability and to adopt the materials to the production technology. Ongoing miniaturization, lifetime improvement and spectral stability of fluorescent lamps on the one hand and brightness and contrast improvement in imaging systems on the other hand demand luminescent materials with very high stability that is invariable to operating conditions. All of the today's efficient lighting sources are based on either direct or indirect light emission from plasma discharges. During the pioneering stage, fluorescent lamp industries predominantly used mixtures of two photo luminescent materials: (Zn,Be) 2 SiO 4. 'Mn 2 + having two emission maxima at 520 and 600 nm and MgW 04 with 480 nm emission. The emission from these two phosphors covers the major portion of the visible spectrum. However, the compound (Zn,Be) 2 Si 04 is hazardous to health because of its beryllium content. In 1942, Jenkins showed that Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 (F,Cl) :Sb,Mn was a very efficient emitter. The halophosphates emit both in the blue (Sb 3 +) as well as in the orange (Mn 2 +) spectral region, thus in addition yield white light. By carefully adjusting the ratio of Sb 3 + and Mn 2 + ion concentrations, a white light emitting phosphor was obtained with color temperatures ranging between 6500 and 2700 K. However, the drawback of the halophosphate lamps is that it is impossible to have simultaneously high brightness and high color rendering; if the brightness is high (efficacy - 80 lm W" 1), the color rendering index (CRI) is of the order of 60, the CRI value can be improved up to 90, but then brightness decreases (- 50 lm W" 1). In 1974, another important breakthrough came in the form of compact fluorescent lamp, based on the trichromatic phosphor blend which resulted color rending values of 80 - 85 (color 80 lamps) at high efficiencies of 100 lm W" 1. The fluorescent lamps with very high color rendering and efficiency can be obtained if three narrow band emitters with emission maxima at 450, 540 and 610 nm are employed. A typical trichromatic lamp phosphor blend comprises of (i) Sr 5 (PO 4) 3 Cl:Eu 2 BaMgAl 1 () O, 7 :Eu 2 ' as blue component, (ii) Ce 0. 67 Tbo. 33 MgAl,, 0, 9, LaPO 4,Le 33 + as green component and (iii) Y 2 C> 3 :Eiru as the red component. The color 80 lamps employ line emitters that generated light in discrete wavelength intervals. Colored objects that absorb outside these spectral regions appear with a slightly different body color when illuminated with these lamps rather than with a black body radiator such as the light bulb. For these purposes, color 90 or Deluxe lamps have been developed. The emission maximum of the blue phosphor can be shifted towards longer Wavelength by substituting BaMgAli 0 Oi 7 :Eu 2 + with Sr 4 Ali 4025 :Eu 2 +. The red and green line emitters can be substituted by broad band emitters covering the whole spectral range. For this concept, (Ce,Gd,Tb) MgB 5 Oi 0 :Mn has been developed as a red emitter in which energy transfer from Ce 3 + via Gd 3 + to Mn 2 + gives rise to an additional broad band at 630 nm. On the other hand, (Ba,Sr,Ca) 2 Si 04 :Eu has been developed as an alternative green-band emitter in which depending on the exact composition, the phosphor emits between 550 and 580 nm with a high quantum yield. Unfortunately, the host lattice is not stable in water, which prevents its deposition on the lamp bulb from aqueous suspensions and for environmental reasons more and more lamps producers use water as the suspending solvent in production instead of butyl acetate. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new full color emitting phosphors, which has both thermal and chemical stability for application in luminescent lighting. The classical cathode ray tube (CRT) invented as the brown tube more than 100 years ago has developed into a remarkably mature product considering the complexity of its manufacturing process. Cathode rays are a beam of fast electrons, the accelerating voltage in a <b>television</b> <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> is high (> 10 kV). Basic requirements of display phosphors are stability (2000 hr operation) and emission color purity according to the standards set by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The blue and green phosphors are still the very cheep ZnS based materials, essentially the same ever since color-TV was introduced in fifties. On the other hand, (Zn,Cd) S, Ag+,C 1 " was originally used as the red phosphor however, the broad emission centered at 650 nm due to intrinsic donor-acceptor transition leads to rather low lumen equivalent as large fraction of the emission integral lies outside the eye sensitivity curve. For this and the environmental reasons, it has been replaced by the much more expensive Y 2 O 2 S:Eu with main emission lines at 612 and 628 nm. Recently, the big electronic companies are trying to enforce flat panel displays e. g. PDPs (plasma display panels) and FEDs (field emission displays). This is because of the fact that when compared to the CRT screen pigments, FED phosphors are required to operate at lower voltages and higher current densities. Although the voltages used in FEDs are only 0. 1 to 5;Eu 2 + exhibits better luminous efficiency than that of the industrially available product such as InGaN (460 nm chip) -coated with YAG:Ce. However, the major drawback of this combination is the strongly decreasing overall efficiency upon lowering the color temperature. This can be solved by using a phosphor material that has sufficient absorption at the emission wavelength of the blue diode, the quantum yield should be high under UV/Vis excitation and the FWHM of the emission band should be as small as possible in order to achieve high luminous output. The search for stable inorganic rare-earths phosphors with high absoiption in the near UV/blue spectral region is therefore an attractive research work. Since luminescence materials are a key component for lighting and display concept, research in the field of rare-earths doped oxide phosphors is carried out. Although state-of-the-art materials fulfill most requirements, improvements are still necessary to further boost the efficiency of the phosphor materials. Since it is not expected that materials will be found that perform better than the already established phosphor, the present work concentrates on the improvements of the phosphor by modifying the chemical and niicrostructurai features as well as the crystal structure. Chapter I gives a brief introduction to luminescence in solids, physical aspects and applications. Chapter II describes the synthesis and various experimental techniques employed in the investigation. Chapter III deals with photoluminescence and energy transfer involving charge transfer states in Sr 2 -xLnxCe 04 +x/ 2 (Ln = Eu and Sm) leading to an efficient full color emitting phosphor for luminescent lighting. Chapter IV and V describe charge transfer transition involving interface states associated with transitional nanophaseprecipitates leading to photoluminescence enhancement of SrTiO 3 :Pr 3 +,Al 3 + and SrAli 2 Oi 9 :Pr 3 +,Ti 4 The light induced charge transfer leading to changing oxidation state of Eu in Sr 2 Si 04 involving transient crystal structure results an efficient material for optical storage is presented in Chapter VI. Photoluminescence due to efficient energy transfer from Ce 3 + to Tb 3 + and Mn 2 t in SnAlioSi 02 o leading to an efficient phosphor for FEDs is presented in Chapter VII. Chapter VIII describes charge transfer transition involving trap states leading to long phosphorescence in SrAl 2 -xBxO 4 (0 <x< 0. 2) and Sr 4 Al 14. xBxO 25 (0. 1 <x< 0. 4) co-doped with Eu 2 + and Dy 3 +. Chapter IX presents the role of particle size on the charge transfer associated luminescence of GdVO 4 :Ln 3 + (Ln = Eu and Sm). A summary of the important findings and the conclusions arrived on the basis of results from these investigations are presented at the end of the thesis...|$|E

5000|$|The {{method of}} {{measuring}} screen size by its diagonal was {{inherited from the}} method used for {{the first generation of}} CRT <b>television,</b> when <b>picture</b> <b>tubes</b> with circular faces were in common use. Being circular, the external diameter of the bulb was used to describe their size. Since these circular tubes were used to display rectangular images, the diagonal measurement of the visible rectangle was smaller than the diameter of the tube due to the thickness of the glass surrounding the phosphor screen (which was hidden from the viewer by the casing and bezel). This method continued even when cathode ray tubes were manufactured as rounded rectangles; it had the advantage of being a single number specifying the size, and was not confusing when the aspect ratio was universally 4:3. In the US, when virtually all TV tubes were 4:3, the size of the screen was given as the true screen diagonal with a V following it (this was a requirement in the US market but not elsewhere). In virtually all other markets, the size of the outer diameter of the tube was given. What was a 27V in the US could be a 28" [...] elsewhere. However the V terminology was frequently dropped in US advertising referring to a 27V as a 27". This was not misleading for the consumer as the seller had to give the actual screen size by law. Flat panel displays by contrast use the actual diagonal of their visible display size, thus the size is the actual size presented to the viewer in all markets. This means that a similarly specified size of display will be larger as a flat panel display compared with a cathode ray tube display.|$|R

These television were popular for portable carry around and small table top sets. These smaller sets were direct view electrostatic deflection designs. This required an extremely large amount of voltage to produce an image across the full display screen. In 1946, RCA influenced manufacturers (with royalty free circuit designs) to move toward electromagnetic deflection type televisions. Electromagnetic deflection uses varying magnetic fields to produce a full screen image. Horizontal and vertical electromagnets are placed at the <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> neck, called the [...] "yoke". This method allowed the image to be viewed on larger screens. The first heavily mass-produced large <b>picture</b> <b>tube</b> to use this newer method of deflection was RCA's 10BP4, introduced in 1946.
