500|$|With {{the last}} {{pick of the}} eighth round of the 1986 NFL Draft and 221st overall selection, the Bears drafted Douglass. [...] He was the third of four {{defensive}} backs selected by the Bears in that draft (Vestee Jackson 2nd round, Bruce Jones 7th round and Barton Hundley 10th round). The 1986 Bears signed Douglass in mid-July. [...] In training camp, Douglas was switched from cornerback to safety and recovered a fumble in the first exhibition game against the Cowboys. [...] He was described by bears scout Rod Graves as [...] "built more like a fullback and could possibly help us inside as a strong-safety type". The Chicago Tribune listed him at [...] and , and the Chicago Sun-Times reported him at [...] and [...] with the description that [...] "Big, strong, tough hitter who likes <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> too slow to play cornerback. Makes some mistakes because of overeagerness." ...|$|E
500|$|As Cash escapes {{the asylum}} and enters an {{abandoned}} apartment complex, he is caught by Ramirez and the Wardogs, who decide <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> game of cat and mouse; Cash manages {{to kill the}} gang and Ramirez before backup arrives. Upon fleeing the area, the journalist reporting on Cash suddenly arrives in her car and rescues him. She explains that the Director is actually Lionel Starkweather, a former film producer from Los Santos, who was popular in the 90s, but {{was forced to leave}} the industry due to a [...] "scandal". The reporter has been putting together evidence about Starkweather's snuff movies for months, and now she has enough to expose him. First, however, she needs to retrieve some of this evidence from her apartment. Meanwhile, Starkweather orders the chief of the Carcer City Police Department, Gary Schaffer, to bring both Cash and the journalist to him, blackmailing him that he will expose his corruption to the Liberty City Supreme Court if he does not comply.|$|E
500|$|In September 1941, Presley entered {{first grade}} at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his {{instructors}} regarded him as [...] "average". He {{was encouraged to}} enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country song [...] "Old Shep" [...] during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. Ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang [...] "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, he received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, [...] "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, yes. I can't {{remember}} when I couldn't read. But Maude used <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl who could read and talk French at five years old, {{and she died}} of water upon her brain.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Maggie {{debuted in}} 2002. Hendrickson, at first, had a {{difficult}} time differentiating her from Frankie. [...] "Oh, my gosh, I was so afraid about that," [...] she said. [...] "I was trying to go for something completely different, but the problem was that the writers left it so ambiguous; the character was such a blank slate. I just decided to make her lighter, prettier [...] I kept the humor; I always like <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of humor. And I was playing her straight [...] at first ! So I went for heterosexual, pretty, funny. And smarter!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Coyne {{was brought}} into the Australian squad for the World Cup 2010 qualifiers against Iraq and Qatar in June 2008. He {{impressed}} in training with Australia manager Pim Verbeek saying: [...] "Chris is a leader, a tough defender. I think he can play at a higher level, but we shall see. I think it’s better <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more organised in the backline, {{and then we can}} use a player like Chris." [...] He made his debut for Australia in the 0–1 defeat to Iraq in Dubai, impressing with the way he marshalled the defence, leading Verbeek to praise him again, saying, [...] "He's an experienced player, he knows what he's doing and he's made a good impression on us. He's a leader. He's a very good header, he's never in panic." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “After I {{had learned}} <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> I {{was chosen to}} give all the bugle calls. [...] I {{had to get up}} in the morning before the others and arouse {{everybody}} by blowing the morning call. [...] Evenings at ten minutes before nine o’clock I blew again. [...] Then all of the boys would run for their rooms. [...] At nine o’clock the second call was given, when all lights were tuned out and we were supposed to be in bed. [...] Later on I learned the mess call, and eventually could blow all the calls of the regular army.” The Carlisle Indian band of brass instruments performed at football games, world expositions and presidential inaugural parades. On May 24, 1883, Luther led the first “real American” band to cross the Brooklyn Bridge at its grand opening ceremony.|$|E
50|$|He {{began his}} career with 2 years of age. His father noticed his son found it easy <b>to</b> <b>play</b> {{instruments}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> accordion and he showed a lot of intimacy. He almost single-handedly learned <b>to</b> <b>play</b> several instruments.|$|R

2500|$|Bob Macpherson (the {{brother of}} Christina) and Paterson {{are said to}} have taken rides {{together}} at Dagworth. Here they would probably have passed the Combo Waterhole, where Macpherson is purported to have told this story to Paterson. Although not remaining in close contact, Paterson and Christina Macpherson both maintained this version of events until their deaths. Amongst Macpherson's belongings, found after her death in 1936, was an unopened letter to a music researcher that read [...] "...one day I played (from ear) a tune, which I had heard played by a band at the Races in Warrnambool...he [...] then said he thought he could write some words to it. He then and there wrote the first verse. We tried it and thought it went well, so he then wrote the other verses." [...] Similarly, in the early 1930s on ABC radio Paterson said [...] "The shearers staged a strike and Macpherson's woolshed at Dagworth was burnt down and a man was picked up dead...Miss Macpherson used <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Scottish tune on a zither and I put words to it and called it Waltzing Matilda." ...|$|E
6000|$|But she was {{nevertheless}} disposed <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{with her}} subject. [...] "In your place I should have guessed it ages ago. Have {{you never really}} suspected?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{he is not}} mad," [...] she said. [...] "It is we who are mad, {{to listen}} a little, to think a little, <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> with the {{thoughts}} he gives us." ...|$|E
50|$|Rohit and Adhya are {{happily married}} {{and in order}} to break the monotony in life, they decide <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> game; <b>little</b> knowing that destiny had {{something}} else in store for them.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said she, [...] "I {{am not in}} voice, and it is ill <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{room with}} but two to listen, but you must {{conceive}} {{me to be the}} Queen of the Peruvians, who is exhorting her countrymen to rise up against the Spaniards, who are oppressing them." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2000, {{an article}} in the satirical Chaser {{newspaper}} alleged that Spencer refused <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> song by <b>Little</b> Johnny (pseudonym of Pauline Pantsdown), because of his [...] "conservative leanings".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have one}} in the house," [...] broke in Morris, [...] "a violin--rather a good instrument; I used <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> when I was young. I wish, if you don't mind, that you would sing them to me after dinner." ...|$|E

2500|$|But Grace's {{extraordinary}} skill {{had already}} been recognised very early in his career, especially by the professional bowlers. A very prescient comment {{was made by the}} laconic Yorkshire and England fast bowler Tom Emmett who, after playing against Grace {{for the first time in}} 1869, called him a [...] "nonsuch" [...] (without equal) who [...] "ought to be made <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with <b>a</b> <b>littler</b> bat".|$|R
6000|$|... 'O Christopher, I {{knew you}} were here,' she said eagerly. 'You are wanted; there's a servant come from Wyndway House for you.

50|$|Following {{the success}} of the SDS-V, Simmons {{expanded}} their range in 1983, replacing the V with another modular rack-based brain called the SDS-7, which features digital sampling sounds on EPROM for the first time, expandable up to twelve modules, and redesigned pads, featuring a skin of rubber <b>to</b> make <b>playing</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> easier. The unit uses 8-bit samples and a programmable memory, but is prone to malfunctioning and loss of memory, making it unpopular in a live context.|$|R

60|$|Then Murgh began <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{with the}} bow, and oh! strange and dreadful was {{the music that}} came from its string beneath the touch of his gloved fingers. It sang like a harp and wailed like a woman, so fearfully indeed that the lad Day, who all this while stood by aghast, stopped his ears with his fingers, and Hugh groaned. Then this awful archer swiftly set the arrow on the string.|$|E
6000|$|... "Old woman!" [...] said Dorothy, who, {{having her}} fish hooked, chose <b>to</b> let him <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> [...] "I {{am not so}} old," [...] said she, flouncing out of the room, [...] "as to bide in the place till a man rises from his naked bed--" ...|$|R

50|$|Hondo and Fabian {{illustrates}} {{the lives of}} two different friendly animals, a dog and a cat. Hondo the dog wakes up Fabian the cat hoping to have more adventures.

The boy is warned against you, and from to-day this house is watched by picked detectives. Blenavon can avail you nothing, for he knows nothing. Such clumsy schemes as last night's are foredoomed to failure, and will only get you into trouble. You will waste your time here. Take my advice, and go!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{most famous}} of these women pirates was named Mary Reed. Her father was an English captain of a trading vessel, and her mother sailed with him. This mother had had an elder child, a son, and {{she also had a}} {{mother-in-law}} in England from whom she expected great things for her little boy. But the boy died, and Mrs. Reed, being afraid that her mother-in-law would not be willing to leave any property to a girl, determined <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> trick, and make believe that her second child was also a boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh, pooh, master high sheriff!" [...] {{cried the}} lieutenant-governor, who had overheard the {{foregoing}} discussion, and felt himself high enough in station <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> with his dignity. [...] "I {{will take the}} matter into my own hands. It is time that the good Colonel came forth to greet his friends; else we shall be apt to suspect that he has taken a sip too much of his Canary wine, in his extreme deliberation which cask it were best to broach {{in honor of the}} day! But since he is so much behindhand, I will give him a remembrancer myself!" ...|$|E
60|$|Wade {{slipped his}} hand {{into his pocket and}} drew forth a goodly handful of gold, which he handed to the cowboy. Not improbably, if this large amount had been shown earlier, before the change in the sentiment, Lem would have looked aghast and begged for mercy. As it was, he {{accepted}} it as if he were accustomed to borrowing that much every day. Belllounds had rendered futile the easy-going, friendly advances of the cowboys, as he had made it impossible <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> jolly <b>little</b> game for fun.|$|R
60|$|Pretty soon {{all were}} in the bag but one, <b>a</b> willful <b>little</b> Breeze, who was not quite ready to go home; he wanted <b>to</b> <b>play</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer. He danced ahead of Old Mother West Wind. He kissed the sleepy daisies. He shook the nodding buttercups. He set all the <b>little</b> poplar leaves <b>a</b> dancing, too, and he wouldn't come into the big bag. So Old Mother West Wind closed the big bag and slung it over her shoulder. Then she started on towards her home behind the Purple Hills.|$|R
2500|$|Guitarist Jeff Schroeder also {{hinted that}} the album {{may be less}} heavy than past albums, stating [...] "In this day and age, with what's going on {{politically}} and socially, it just feels right <b>to</b> <b>play</b> something that's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more spacey and dreamy.
