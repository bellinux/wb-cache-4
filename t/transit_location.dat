25|$|Two {{weeks after}} the 2005 London bombings, a new {{directive}} stated that New York City would institute a citywide transit Auxiliary program {{with the intent of}} reducing crime and fighting terrorism in the city's transit system. Transit Auxiliary officers work out of Transit Bureau precincts known as Districts and carry Transit portable radios. Unlike a precinct, the transit districts cover miles of underground subway. Transit Auxiliary Police officers go through additional training by the Transit Bureau Vandals Squad as well as the Counter-Terrorism Division to build vandalism and terrorism awareness within the Transit System. Transit Auxiliary officers are paired with either a regular police officer or Auxiliary police officer. Transit Auxiliary Police periodically perform inspections of the subway station(s) and platforms which they are assigned to, taking note of any suspicious occurrences, and set up a fixed post at the subway turnstiles, token booths, mezzanines, or platforms. Transit Auxiliary officers also conduct subway train inspections as well as train runs to/from stations that which assignment is given. Due to the common medical emergency calls in Transit, if medically qualified, Transit Auxiliary Police officers can respond to medical emergencies if they are near to the <b>transit</b> <b>location.</b> The main function of the NYPD Transit Auxiliary Police, like the NYPD Transit Police, is to primarily remain within the subway system.|$|E

50|$|The {{golden age}} of medieval Polotsk is {{associated}} with the rule of Bryachislav's son, Vseslav (1044-1101). He profited from the civil wars in Kiev in order to assert his own independence and run the affairs of the principality separately. During this time Polotsk became a centre of trade serving as a <b>transit</b> <b>location</b> between other lands of Kievan Rus' and Scandinavia. It also asserted its independent status balancing between Kiev, Novgorod, and the Varangians. Contemporary Norse sagas described the town as the most heavily fortified in all of Kievan Rus'. Most of the time, descendants of Izyaslav ruled the Principality of Polatsk independently of the Grand Prince of the Rus', only formally recognizing the power of the Rurikides. After the late 10th century, Polotsk was also successful in colonizing the lands of its western neighbours, the ancestors of today’s Latvians and Lithuanians. In the early 13th century, Teutonic knights seized power over the former from the hands of Polotsk, but the historical ties with the latter proved much stronger and lasted for 700 more years, although the leading role in this “marriage” soon shifted to the other side. The last pagans of Europe, brave and skillful warriors, Lithuanians initially served Polotsk as auxiliary troops in its wars with the Teutonic knights and other Ruthenian principalities; but from 1183 they refused obedience to the metropoly and established their own state.|$|E

At the same time, thousands of wounded soldiers stranded on the way home from the front received medical care and treatment here. Additionally, more than 70,000 forced labourers from Belgium were channeled into Germany through Herbesthal. Towards the end of the war the station fell into the hands of plunderers returning from the front. Herbesthal station became the focus of so much congestion that an alternative less southerly route, today known as the Montzen route, was constructed by the Germans between 1915 and 1917, entering occupied Belgium from Aachen via Tongeren, completely avoiding Herbesthal and, indeed, Liege.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a new method for determining optimal transit routes. The Transit Route Arc-Node Service Maximization {{model is a}} mathematical model that maximizes the service value of a route, rather than minimizing cost. Cost (distance) is considered as a budget constraint {{on the extent of}} the route. The mathematical formulation modifies and exploits the structure of linear programming problems designed for the traveling salesman problem. An innovative divide-and-conquer solution procedure is presented that not only makes the transit routing problem tractable, but also provides a range of high-quality alternate routes for consideration, some of which have substantially varying geometries. Variant formulations are provided for several common transit route types. The model is tested through its application to an existing street network in Richardson, TX. Optimal numeric results are obtained for several problem instances, and these results demonstrate that increased route cost is not correlated with increased service provision.

The study was conducted to map the existing mariculture activities in SE Sulawesi. Data collection was performed in June 2009. Spatial and attribute data of the existing mariculture were acquired by interviewing fish farmer using open-ended questionnaire and analyzed using ArcGIS  9. x. Key water quality parameters consisted of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, depth, clarity, and turbidity and analyzed using STORET Indeks. Three big clusters of existing mariculture activities are located in Kendari, Muna and Buton areas, collectively serving as both a source of mariculture products and a market destination or <b>transit</b> <b>location.</b> All surveyed locations of existing mariculture activities in SE Sulawesi show relatively optimal water quality conditions. Site capacity and suitability analysis of existing or potential areas of mariculture activities and development have largely not been considered by stakeholders involved in managing coastal areas, resulting in crowded and unmanaged development with multiple overlapping economic activities in some areas.
