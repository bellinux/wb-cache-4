5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals <b>to</b> <b>humans</b> can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat <b>to</b> <b>humans.</b> The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted <b>to</b> <b>humans</b> and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E

The virus can spread from <b>human</b> <b>to</b> <b>human</b> by both droplet respiration and contact with fomites from an infected person's bodily fluids. Incubation period is 10-14 days.

40|$|In Part I, I address decision-making. How should risk <b>to</b> <b>human</b> life be {{included}} in the jurisprudence of corporate decision-making? In terms of finance, how should corporations make net present value decisions when risk <b>to</b> <b>human</b> life is a factor? In terms of law, is there a case for exceptions to the business judgment rule based on risk <b>to</b> <b>human</b> life? Second, in Part II, I address oversight. How should risk <b>to</b> <b>human</b> life {{be included}} in the jurisprudence of oversight? In terms of finance, how should corporations approach risk management when human life is a factor? In terms of law, is there a case for different treatment of corporate oversight of risk <b>to</b> <b>human</b> life? My tentative answer is that corporate boards should explicitly address risk <b>to</b> <b>human</b> life in both decisions and oversight, and judges in corporate law cases should apply a heightened standard of scrutiny in cases when boards have not done so. In addition, with respect to corporate decisions and oversight related <b>to</b> risks <b>to</b> <b>human</b> life, policy makers should consider moving away from the traditional external governance associated with regulation and tort liability in favor of internal corporate governance...|$|R

5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible <b>to</b> <b>humans.</b> Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk <b>to</b> <b>humans.</b> During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E

[URL] The species cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies infliximab, bevacizumab, and an anti-VEGF-B antibody, 2 H 10, {{in humans}} and rodents was determined. METHODS: The binding of infliximab <b>to</b> <b>human,</b> mouse, and rat TNF-α, of bevacizumab <b>to</b> <b>human,</b> mouse, and rat VEGF-A, {{and of the}} 2 H 10 antibody <b>to</b> <b>human,</b> mouse, and rat VEGF-B was evaluated by ELISA. The sequence of human, mouse, and rat TNF-α and VEGF-A at the binding sites for infliximab and bevacizumab were compared. RESULTS: Infliximab bound <b>to</b> <b>human</b> TNF-α, but no binding to mouse or rat TNF-α was detected between 10 pg/mL and 10 μg/ml. Sequence comparison of the binding site revealed four changes in mouse and five in rat TNF-α compared with human. Bevacizumab bound strongly <b>to</b> <b>human</b> VEGF-A, but showed 5 -log weaker binding to both mouse and rat VEGF-A. There was a single amino acid substitution in mouse and rat VEGF-A at the bevacizumab binding site. The 2 H 10 antibody displayed a similar binding profile <b>to</b> <b>human,</b> mouse, and rat VEGF-B. CONCLUSIONS: The species cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies should be determined prior to their use in preclinical animal models.
