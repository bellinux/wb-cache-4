40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that road deicing salts are sufficiently diluted by spring rains to ameliorate any physiological impacts to amphibians breeding in wetlands near roads. We tested this conjecture by exposing clutches of the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) to three chloride concentrations (1 mg/L, 145 mg/L, 945 mg/L) for nine days, then <b>transferred</b> <b>clutches</b> to control water for nine days, and measured change in mass at three-day intervals. We measured mass change because water uptake by clutches reduces risks to embryos associated with freezing, predation, and disease. Clutches in controls sequestered water asymptotically. Those in the moderate concentrations lost 18 % mass initially and regained 14 % after transfer to control water. Clutches in high concentration lost 33 % mass and then lost an additional 8 % after transfer. Our {{results suggest that}} spring rains do not ameliorate the effects of deicing salts in wetlands with extremely high chloride concentrations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of {{driveline}} modelling. The modelling is done in MathModelica. Components from the free standard Modelica library have been used when appropriate. The remaining components have either been defined by mathematical equations only or by using mathematical equations together with standard components. The main work has been put into modeling and verifying the clutch, manual gearbox, final drive, shafts, brake and wheel. To this, models of engine, driver, chassis and air drag have been connected and simulated during different driving cycles. The vehicle model is moving in longitudinal motion. The results shows the expected behaviours, however since no measurements has been available {{it is hard to}} say how near the truth the model is, just that the qualitative behaviour is correct.

50|$|First {{introduced}} in 1987 for the Subaru XT, the active torque split AWD variant uses an electronically controlled multi-plate <b>transfer</b> <b>clutch</b> for a default torque distribution of 60% front, 40% rear ratio. Torque distribution is adjusted up to a 50:50 split in realtime with {{input from the}} throttle, transmission, engine control unit and wheel speed sensors. Active torque split AWD is paired with 4-speed automatic transmissions and Subaru's chain-driven Lineartronic continuously variable transmission (CVT).|$|E
50|$|The {{automatic}} transmissions used on AWD equipped vehicles will normally send 60% of the engine's torque {{to the front}} wheels and 40% to the rear wheels, using a computer-controlled, continuously variable, multi-plate <b>transfer</b> <b>clutch.</b> When the transmission detects a speed difference between {{the front and rear}} axle sets, the transmission progressively sends power to the rear wheels. Under slip conditions it can achieve an equal split in front and rear axle speeds.|$|E
50|$|The driver {{can use a}} drive-mode dial on {{the center}} console to select “FWD” for best fuel economy; with “4WD Auto” mode selected, the system uses a {{rear-mounted}} electronically controlled <b>transfer</b> <b>clutch</b> to automatically and seamlessly route more power to the rear wheels, depending on driving and road surface conditions. The driver can freely change the drive mode at any time. When “4WD Auto” mode is selected, the Outlander's 4WD system always sends some power to the rear wheels, automatically increasing the amount under full throttle acceleration. The coupling transfers up to forty percent of available torque to the rear wheels under full-throttle acceleration, and this is reduced to twenty five percent over 40 miles per hour. At steady cruising speeds, up to fifteen percent of available torque {{is sent to the}} rear wheels. At low speeds through tight corners, coupling torque is reduced, providing a smoother feel through the corner.|$|E

50|$|Sports {{cars were}} made {{accessible}} to drivers with limited physical capabilities by equipping the cars {{with the necessary}} components to convert manual transmission vehicles to hand operation. This was achieved by <b>transferring</b> the <b>clutch</b> control to a small lever located on the gear shift knob; the brake control to a lever {{to the right of}} the lower portion of the steering wheel; and the gas control to an accelerator “ring” which was situated either in front of or behind the steering wheel.

40|$|Based on the {{independently}} developed five-speed dry {{dual clutch}} transmission (DDCT), the paper proposes the torque coordinating control strategy between engine and two clutches, which obtains engine speed and <b>clutch</b> <b>transferred</b> torque in the shifting process, adequately reflecting the driver intention {{and improving the}} shifting quality. Five-degree-of-freedom (DOF) shifting dynamics model of DDCT with single intermediate shaft is firstly established according to its physical characteristics. Then the quantitative control objectives of the shifting process are presented. The fuzzy decision of shifting time and the model-based torque coordinating control strategy are proposed and also verified by simulating under different driving intentions in up-/downshifting processes with the DCT model established on the MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results validate that the shifting control algorithm proposed in this paper can not only meet the shifting quality requirements, but also adapt to the various shifting intentions, having a strong robustness...|$|R
5000|$|The {{automatic}} transmission used on AWD equipped vehicles would normally send 90% {{of the engines}} torque to the front wheels and 10% to the rear wheels, using a computer-controlled, continuously variable, multi-plate <b>transfer</b> <b>clutch.</b> When the front wheels began to experience a loss of grip, the transmission automatically sent available torque to the rear wheels, up to 50:50 split between {{the front and rear}} wheels until grip was reestablished at the front wheels, without notifying the driver or occupants that torque was being redirected. When accelerating or driving uphill, the vehicles weight shifts rearward, reducing front wheel traction, causing the transmission to automatically send torque to the rear wheels to compensate. When braking or driving downhill, the vehicle's weight shifts towards the front, reducing rear wheel traction. The transmission again compensates by sending torque to the front wheels for better steering control and braking performance. If the automatic is placed in Reverse or [...] "1st" [...] gear, the transmission divides the torque 50:50 to both front and rear wheels. A limited slip rear differential was optional on the 1991 USA Sport Sedan (Legacy Turbo). However it was unavailable on the 92-94 USA Turbo.|$|E
5000|$|North America {{receives}} {{its first}} Impreza WRX models. They {{are equipped with}} an EJ205 engine rated at [...] at 6000 rpm with 217 lbft Nm at 4000 rpm. Unlike the Japanese EJ205, the US-spec engine uses a Mitsubishi TD04-13T turbocharger unit. In stock form, it reaches a peak [...] of boost. The seats {{are the same as}} the basic J-spec Impreza. The wheels are cast 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] version of the J-spec WRX NB wheels while the brakes are 2-piston/1-piston front and rear with the front rotors being ventilated disks. 2002 WRXs came with brake duct plates that guided the air in the front bumper vent to the wheel well. The gear ratios are the standard export models, but the final drive is a 3.9:1 ratio. The rear LSD is a viscous coupling type. The steering rack has a ratio of 16.5:1. The 4 gear electronic automatic transmission (4EAT) WRXs have a Variable Torque Distribution AWD system instead of the conventional viscous coupling center differential. VTD employs an electronically controlled hydraulic <b>transfer</b> <b>clutch</b> and a planetary gear center differential to distribute power in a 45:55 split between the front and rear axles under normal circumstances. The VTD system uses multiple sensors to measure front and rear driveshaft speeds, throttle position and gear selection. Then it actively transfers power accordingly between the front and rear wheels for optimum traction and handling. The WRX weighs 3085 lb.|$|E
5000|$|The {{architecture}} of an AWD/4WD {{system can be}} described by describing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may {{have the ability to}} operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100. Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).:Part-time Mode - The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles. :Full-time Mode - Both axles are driven at all times but an inter-axle differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the inter-axle differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’. :On-Demand Mode - In this mode the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the <b>transfer</b> <b>clutch</b> from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in the section on traction control systems.In addition to these basic modes there could be implementations that combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode ...|$|E

40|$|Few {{field studies}} have {{examined}} experimentally the importance of food availability on adult activity and breeding performance in birds. I studied two populations of insectivorous Tree Swallows Tachycineta bicolor, 3 km apart, that differed primarily {{in the amount of}} food available to the breeding birds. I obtained an index of food abundance and conducted experiments involving the <b>transfer</b> of <b>clutches</b> and broods between populations. Tree Swallows showed substantial phenotypic plasticity in breeding characteristics and parental activities. My results demonstrated that food abundance during the the breeding season influenced clutch size, egg quality, nestling growth, behavior, survival to fledging and adult activities such as frequency of feeding young. It was important where Tree Swallows reproduced, where their nestlings were raised and probably, by whom they were raised. Food abundance, year of breeding and sequence in the clutch explained significant amounts of variation in egg weights. Growth of nestlings was not influenced by type of parent (i. e. natural or foster) or by pre-hatch factors such as location of incubation. However, the location where nestlings were raised explained much of the variation in growth of nestlings, and regardless of where parents nested, genetic variation in offspring and variation in provisioning abilities of parents may have been important components of within area variation in growth. These results support the hypothesis of food limitation of clutch size that also predicted slower nestling growth and poorer fledging success of young raised where food was less abundant...|$|R
40|$|Reproduction {{is known}} to {{increase}} the basal metabolic rate and generate oxidative stress, a possible proximate cost of reproduction. Carotenoids {{have been shown to}} be in vitro antioxidant molecules and, in a number of instances, to contribute in vivo to the antioxidant protection of the organism against the deleterious effects of free radicals and oxidative stress. These compounds are also involved in the up- and downregulation of the immune system. Thus, carotenoids may improve a male's health status and condition during breeding and enhance his attractiveness through, for example, a higher investment into mating activities. The differential allocation hypothesis predicts that females should invest more in reproduction when mated to more attractive partners. Therefore, a supplementary dose of carotenoids during breeding should increase male attractiveness and translate into higher reproductive success via a higher reproductive effort by their mate. We tested this hypothesis in great tits by supplementing males with carotenoids during their female's fertile period. We subsequently <b>transferred</b> entire <b>clutches</b> into unmanipulated foster nests. Thus, any effect of our carotenoid supplementation to males on their reproductive success must be due to female differential reproductive investment. Offspring sired by carotenoid-supplemented males were found to grow bigger and heavier and to fledge more successfully. Carotenoid-supplemented males also lost less paternity. Our results illustrate the fitness benefits males can accrue from carotenoids and underline the selective pressure imposed on males to optimize carotenoid acquisitio...|$|R

25|$|The engine has {{a single}} rotor with a {{capacity}} of 497cc. The rotor spins on an eccentric shaft in a peritrochoid (Mazda uses an epitrochoid) chamber, giving three rotations of the crankshaft for every 360° of rotor travel. Compression ratio is 9.4:1. The eccentric shaft runs on plain bearings, which were better than rollers for heat dissipation. Combustion sealing utilised Apex, corner and side seals. At the three rotor apexes, tip sealing was accomplished with a three-piece seal tensioned by a blade spring. Apex seals were made of a special material known as Ferro Tic, which {{was a combination of}} sintered ferrous alloy and titanium carbide. The surface of the trochoid chamber which the apex seals rubbed along was coated with a CEM (composite electrochemical material) consisting of nickel silicon carbide. Side sealing used one blade-like seal and spring for each rotor face on each side (six side seals in total). Corner seals and springs finished the isolation of combustion. Blow-by gases are recirculated into the combustion process. The rotor spins backward in relation to the motorcycle.

40|$|Construction {{equipment}} companies continuously {{upgrade their}} products to meetcustomer demands, staying competitive with market challenges as well as improving sales and profits. With increased complexities in heavy duty machines today, up-time is considered {{an important aspect of}} the construction equipment business because it reduces warranty and service cost, while increasing sales and overall customer satisfaction. Therefore, a substantial amount of research is directed towards the development of intelligent machines which are capable of automatically monitoring the health of different components in the machine. Heavy duty construction equipment is often equipped with automatic transmissions, with multiple disc wet <b>clutches,</b> <b>transferring</b> torque from the engine to the gearbox enabling automatic gear ratio changes. The wet clutches in Volvo Construction Equipment vehicles may be considered as a crucial component of the driveline and failure may result in costly downtime. The frictional characteristics of wet clutches are crucial for the ultimate performance because they define clutch slip time during engagement. Furthermore, a wet clutch is considered to have failed when it can no longer transmit the desired torque. The level of torque <b>transfer</b> in wet <b>clutches</b> is controlled by the generated friction. Hence, clutch slippage is the result of diminishing frictional characteristics of wet clutches. Accurately monitoring slippage in wet clutches provides an indication of the health of the clutch material. However, many of the factors that influence the frictional characteristics of the wet clutch are only possible to measure in a test rig and not in actual machines. In this thesis the gap in condition monitoring of automatic transmission clutchesin an actual machine is addressed. A methodology for monitoring the health of the clutch material on-board the machine using the available CAN-bus signals via an on-board Data Stream Management System (DSMS) has been developed. The feature extraction methods utilized in the condition monitoring are based on Moving Average Square Value Filtering (MASVF) and a measure of the fourth order statistical properties of the CAN-bus signals implemented as continuous queries over data streams. Results show that the feature extraction methods provide an indication of clutch slippage deviations. This thesis also includes an investigation of clutch slippage detection from driveline vibrations based on spectrogram and spectral Kurtosis methods.

Murphy’s outstanding defensive play greatly contributed to the team’s lead in the first half. It was up to Danny Thomas and Mac White to try to bring SMU back, and they narrowed the lead to 21-14 as each threw a touchdown pass to John Roderick in the fourth quarter. SMU's onside kick with less than a minute remaining went out of bounds, giving the Webfoots the ball and ultimately the win. Oregon won their first bowl game since the 1917 Rose Bowl.

In the European field elm (Ulmus minor), egg laying by the elm leaf beetle (Xanthogaleruca luteola) activates the emission of volatiles that attract specialised egg parasitoids, which in turn kill the eggs. Little {{is known about the}} transcriptional changes that insect eggs trigger in plants and how such indirect defense mechanisms are orchestrated in the context of other biological processes. Results Here we present the first large scale study of egg-induced changes in the transcriptional profile of a tree.

40|$|This report {{covers the}} {{development}} of a new joint mechanism and a robotic simulator. These are intended to be used in the further development of a climbing robot that has been previously worked on. The climbing robot is briefly described in this report. It is a robot with four arms that each has 6 joints with 1 degree of freedom each. At the end of each arm is a gripper that will serve as the robots main tool of interaction with its immediate environment, for instance a ladder the robot is climbing in. The weight of this robot is estimated and used to find torque requirements on the new joint mechanism. A lightweight joint mechanism is of interest not only for a climbing robot, but for many if not all other kinds of robots as well. Such a joint will not need to be as strong as its heavier counterparts, as less power is required to support the joint itself. The new joint mechanism is an attempt of creating a joint that is lighter than traditional joints. The main idea is to have a single powerful actuator driving several joints. The joints are mechanically powered by a rotating shaft that runs through all of them. Each joint uses a clutching mechanism to connect to the shaft and thus <b>transfer</b> torque. the <b>clutching</b> mechanism has been explored in detail, and a suitable clutch has been selected. This clutch is then used in four design proposals. The last of these proposals is assembled into a prototype, and the prototype is qualitatively tested. The tests demonstrate the concept, but it is not yet shown that this joint mechanism will be lighter that a traditional joint mechanism. The simulator is developed to be a design tool for further development of the climbing robot. A list of specifications for the simulator is presented, however the simulator is not able to meet all these requirements at the current stage of development. The remaining work on the simulator is discussed, as well as an evaluation of the software as it is at the time of writing. The report describes the kinematic modeling that is used to represent the translational and rotational relationship between the different elements of the robot. The kinematic relationships is then put into a mathematical representation of the robot which represents the robots as a chain of elements. Each element has several properties, among which are its relationship to other elements and a graphical representation of the element. The elements, and thus the robot, is represented graphically in a virtual reality environment. The simulator allows the user to specify several parameters of the robot, such as number and dimensions of the joints and the dimensions of the body. The user is also able to control the velocity of each joint. Both the simulator and the joint has been developed to be general enough for use on other kinds of robots, with small modifications in the case of the simulator. </p...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{clutches}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} different machinery. Wet clutches and brakes are frequently used to distribute torque in vehicle drive-trains. The clutches can be located in e. g. automatic transmissions or limited slip differentials. Their frictional behavior is of great importance for the overall vehicle behavior and has to be thoroughly investigated when designing new wet clutch applications. Frictional behavior is normally investigated in test rigs where complete friction discs are tested under similar working conditions as for the clutches in the drive-train. However, it is today possible to simulate the clutch behavior and not limited ourselves to only use testings as a help {{in the design of the}} wet clutches. This is an advantage because it is possible to simulate behavior that is not possible to measure in test rigs. Another advantage is the faster and more cost efficient design process than when all tests are carried out in a laboratory. The torque <b>transferred</b> by the <b>clutch</b> during engagement can be roughly divided into full film torque and boundary lubrication torque. Full film torque originates from the part of the engagement where the friction discs are completely separated by a lubricant film and the friction surfaces are not in contact, whereas boundary lubrication torque occurs when the lubricant film is so thin that the surfaces of the friction discs are in direct contact. The distribution between these two types of torque is different for different types of wet clutches and engagements. When the clutch works in full film regime, it is possible to simulate the friction quite well, whereas the friction in the boundary regime is much more difficult to model and simulate, since it is very additive dependent. The most common use of wet clutches is in automatic transmissions for vehicles. Hence, most research in wet clutch testing and simulations are performed on wet clutches suitable for these applications. Here, the wet clutch is often used to brake a rotating shaft to standstill and the total engagement will have a duration of fractions of a second. During most of the engagement the clutch will be working in full film lubrication. In this investigation, the focus is on wet clutches working under limited slip conditions, i. e. the clutches will have a limited slip during a long duration without any lock-up. During this kind of engagement the clutch will work mainly in boundary lubrication and generate much heat. Such clutches can be found in, e. g. limited slip differentials. The optimum when designing a new wet clutch would be to simulate the clutch during the whole engagement without having to do any measurements in the laboratory. This, however, is not yet possible but an efficient way to design clutches can be obtained by combining fast friction measurements with efficient computer simulations. In this work, a simple friction measurement technique for wet clutches working in boundary lubrication is developed, based on pin on disc measurements. These friction measurements are combined with a temperature simulation of a wet clutch, where the lubricant cooling flow, dependent of the surface groove pattern, is simulated. This method makes it possible to allow a wet clutch working in boundary lubrication to be optimized for given working conditions regarding lubricant, friction material and surface groove pattern. The simulations are validated by measured data from a test rig in which whole friction discs are investigated with the same working conditions. Godkänd; 2006; 20061204 (parmar...|$|R

Clutches can be located in automatic transmissions or in limited slip differentials. The frictional behavior of a clutch is of great importance for overall vehicle behavior and has to be thoroughly investigated when designing new wet clutch applications. Frictional behavior is normally studied in test rigs where whole friction discs or complete clutches are tested under similar working conditions to those pertaining to the clutches in the drivetrain of the vehicle. However, today clutch behavior may be simulated with regard to some clutch applications and design of the clutch system is not limited to testing. This is an advantage as it is possible to simulate behavior that may not be possible or suitable to study in a test rig. Another advantage is that the design process is faster and more cost efficient than that which is possible when all tests are carried out in a laboratory. The torque <b>transferred</b> by the <b>clutch</b> during engagement can roughly be divided into full film torque and boundary lubrication torque. Full film torque originates from the part of the engagement where the clutch discs are completely separated by a lubricant film and the friction surfaces are not in contact, whereas boundary lubrication torque occurs when the lubricant film is so thin that the surfaces of the clutch discs are in direct contact, only separated by a thin additive film. The distribution between full film torque transfer and boundary lubrication torque transfer differs for different types of wet clutch and for differing operating conditions. When the clutch works in full film regime it is possible to simulate the friction quite well. However, the friction in the boundary lubrication regime is much more difficult to model and simulate since it is very dependent on the additives. Wet clutches are most commonly used in automatic transmissions for vehicles. As a result, most research into wet clutch testing and most simulations concerns wet clutches suitable for such applications. In an automatic transmission the wet clutch is often used to brake a rotating shaft to stand still relative to another shaft and the total engagement has a duration of fractions of a second. During most of the engagement the clutch is working in full film lubrication. In this thesis the focus is on wet clutches working under limited slip conditions: in other words this thesis studies clutches that are working {{with a small amount of}} slip over a long period without reaching a state of lock-up. These clutch types can be found, for example, in limited slip differentials. During this type of engagement the clutch mainly works under boundary lubrication conditions and much heat can be generated. The optimum method of designing a new wet clutch would be to simulate the clutch performance without having to do any measurements in the laboratory. This, however, is not yet possible, but an efficient way to design clutches can be achieved by combining simple measurements with efficient computer simulations. In this thesis, simple measurement techniques for wet clutch materials are developed and combined with a temperature simulation of a wet clutch, where the lubricant cooling flow, which is dependent on the surface roughness and groove pattern, is simulated. This method makes it possible to optimize a wet clutch for given working conditions with regard to lubricant, friction material, surface roughness and groove pattern. The simulations are validated to measured data from a test rig in which torque behavior from whole friction discs are investigated. Good agreement between simulations and measurements is achieved.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2011. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Professor Zongxuan Sun. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xvii, 239 pages, appendix p. 218 - 220. This thesis focuses on investigating the design, modeling and control methodologies, which can enable smooth and energy efficient power transmission for conventional, hybrid and future automotive propulsion systems. The fundamental {{requirements of the}} modern power transmission system are: (1). It {{should be able to}} shift the torque transmission ratio efficiently and smoothly to enable the fuel efficient operation of the power source. (2). It should be able to reject/damp out the power source torque oscillation in an energy saving fashion to avoid rough torque transfer to the driveline. Critical factors determining the successful power transmission include the appropriate control of the power <b>transfer</b> key components (<b>clutches),</b> the optimal power transmission coordination with the automotive driveline system, and the capability to smooth out the power source input oscillation in a fuel efficient fashion. To meet these resolutions, this thesis will investigate the enabling design and control methodologies for power transmission in three levels: the fundamental clutch level, the intermediate driveline level, and the entire propulsion system level. First, the clutch level design is investigated in two categories: open loop control and closed loop control. For the open loop, two key issues are addressed. One is to ensure the consistent initial condition with optimal valve structure design, and the other is the clutch fill process optimization using a customized dynamic programming with reduced computational cost for stiff hydraulic system. For the closed loop control case, the solutions are further divided into two groups. One is to enable feedback with pressure sensor measurement, and the other is to close the control loop without any sensor. Through experiments, both methods are shown to enable precise, fast and robust clutch actuation. Second, the driveline level design considers optimizing the power transmission coordination with the driveline. Optimal conditions to achieve efficient and smooth torque transfer are formulated. The nonlinear optimization is then solved using the Dynamic Programming. Finally, in the propulsion system level, the engine start/stop torque oscillation rejection problem for hybrid vehicle and future advanced combustion system is discussed. Through proper formulation, this problem can be treated as disturbance rejection for a linear parameter varying (LPV) system under the internal model principle. To experimentally implement {{the state of the art}} controller design, two problems should be solved. First, the vibration signal is periodic with changing magnitude, whose generating dynamics has not been studied before and needs to be derived. Second, the current linear time varying internal model control is lack of robustness, and the design method of a low order yet robust internal model stabilizer is still unavailable. This thesis proposes promising approaches to address this fundamental bottleneck issue in the time varying internal model control theory, which is one of the key contributions in this thesis. The proposed stabilizer synthesis method is treated in a general form, and can potentially be applied to other applications beyond the automotive field as well. Experimental results are also shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In summary, the contributions of this thesis span from the control applications to the fundamental control theory. Application wise, this thesis formulates the smooth and efficient power transmission design and control problem in three levels, and proposes design, dynamics analysis and control methodologies to address the critical challenges in each level respectively. For control theory, a robust and low order stabilizer synthesis method is proposed to enable reference tracking/disturbance rejection based on linear time varying internal model principle. This stabilizer design addresses one of the most critical issues in the linear time varying internal model control synthesis, which facilitates experimental investigation of the internal model controller in the LTV setting...|$|R
