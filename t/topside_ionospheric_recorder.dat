We present investigations of algorithms specifically targeted at optimal <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> measurements using the mid-latitude Millstone Hill MIDAS-W software radar system. The MIDAS-W multicast gigabit ethernet data transmission backbone allows access to pulse-level receiver signal information, and enables adaptive selec-tion of both {{spatial and temporal}} integration resolution based on observed signal parameters.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the small-scale <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> plasma structures first observed at Millstone Hill, Massachusetts with the 440 MHz incoherent scatter radar. These small-scale obliquely propagating plasma modes occurring {{in the vicinity of}} the midlatitude ionospheric trough, have large radar cross-sections and narrow spectral widths. They have, until recently, been dismissed solely as hard target contamination of the incoherent scatter radar. The geophysical conditions associated with the ionospheric trough, such as the field-aligned current activity and steep plasma density gradients, suggest that these recently discovered small-scale <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> plasmas may also appear in the auroral and polar ionosphere. In fact, this speculation has been corroborated by the preliminary experiments and data analyses at Tromso, Norway and Sondrestromfjord, Greenland. The primary research results are highlighted. Described in Section 3 are the experiments conducted at Arecibo, Puerto Rico in the past summer for simulating the geophysical conditions of generating these <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> plasma structures. Recommendation for the future research is finally given. Attached as the appendix of this report are several chapters which present the detailed results of research in the concerned <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> clutter. Highlights of the research results include: (1) causes of the enhanced radar backscatter (ERB) phenomenon; (2) occurrence of the ERB phenomenon; (3) altitudes of the ERB phenomenon; (4) strength of the ERB returns; (5) range of altitudes of the ERB returns; (6) occurrence frequency of the ERB phenomenon; (7) Doppler effect of the ERB phenomenon; (8) persistency of the ERB; and (9) distinction between ERB phenomenon and space object signatures...|$|R

The satellite data were obtained from the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC). A search of the OGO- 5 data revealed 54 sharp plasmapause crossings as evaluated from the H+ density. The ionospheric footprints (at 1400 km altitude) of the magnetic-field lines through the locations of these plasmapause crossings were then used to search for <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> electron-density profiles from the NSSDC. No profiles corresponding to these projections were identified. A similar search of the topside-sounder 35 -mm ionogram-film database, however, identified 17 cases of candidate "conjunctions" involving Alouette l & 2 and ISIS 1. We will present samples of the plasmapause OGO- 5 ion transitions and the related <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> signatures and discuss the observations in relation to the recent similar study based on Explorer- 45 and ISIS- 2 data [Grebowsky et al., JASTP, 2009]...|$|R

40|$|The topside {{sounders}} of the International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies (ISIS) {{program were}} designed as analog systems. The resulting ionograms were displayed on 35 mm film for analysis by visual inspection. Each of these satellites, launched between 1962 and 1971, produced data for 10 to 20 years. A {{number of the}} original telemetry tapes from this large data set have been converted directly into digital records. Software, known as the Topside Ionogram Scalar With True-Height (TOPIST) algorithm, has been produced and used for the automatic inversion of the ionogram reflection traces on more than 100, 000 ISIS- 2 digital topside ionograms into topside vertical electron density profiles Ne(h). Here we present some <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> solar cycle variations deduced from the TOPIST database to illustrate the scientific benefit of improving and expanding the <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> Ne(h) database.

40|$|This thesis {{creates a}} basic {{framework}} {{and provides the}} information necessary {{to create a more}} accurate description of the topside ionosphere in terms of the altitude variation of the electron density (Ne) over the South African region. The detailed overview of various <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> modelling techniques, with specific emphasis on their implications for the efforts to model the South African topside, provides a starting point towards achieving the goals. The novelty of the thesis lies in the investigation of the applicabilityof three different techniques to model the South African topside ionosphere: (1) The possibility of using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques for empirical modelling of the topside ionosphere based on the available, however irregularly sampled, topside sounder measurements. The goal of this model was to test the ability of ANN techniques to capture the complex relationships between the various ionospheric variables using irregularly distributed measurements. While this technique is promising, the method did not show significant improvement over the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model results when compared with the actual measurements. (2) Application of the diffusive equilibrium theory. Although based on sound physics foundations, the method only operates on a generalised level leading to results that are not necessarily unique. Furthermore, the approach relies on many ionospheric variables as inputs which are derived from other models whose accuracy is not verified. (3) Attempts to complement the standard functional techniques, (Chapman, Epstein, Exponential and Parabolic), with Global Positioning System (GPS) and ionosonde measurements in an effort to provide deeper insights into the actual conditions within the ionosphere. The vertical Ne distribution is reconstructed by linking together the different aspects of the constituent ions and their transition height by considering how they influence the shape of the profile. While this approach has not been tested against actual measurements, results show that the method could be potentially useful for <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> studies. Due to the limitations of each technique reviewed, this thesis observes that the employment of an approach that incorporates both theoretical onsiderations and empirical aspects has the potential to lead to a more accurate characterisation of the <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> behaviour, and resulting in improved models in terms of reliability and forecasting ability. The point is made that a topside sounder mission for South Africa would provide the required measured <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> data and answer the many science questions that this region poses as well as solving a number of the limitations set out in this thesis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe use in situ {{data from}} CHAMP and DMSP satellites, along with data of GPS {{receiver}} onboard CHAMP satellite and ground-based GPS receivers {{to study the}} occurrence and global distribution of ionospheric irregularities during the main phase of the geomagnetic storm of 29 – 31 August 2004 (minimum Dst excursion of À 128 nT). Using the CHAMP GPS measurements, we created maps of GPS phase fluctuation activity and found two specific zones of the most intense irregularities: (1) {{the region of the}} auroral oval at high latitudes of both hemispheres and (2) the low latitudes/equatorial region between Africa and South America. At high latitudes, the <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> irregularities appeared to be more intensive in the southern hemisphere, which is, most likely, due to seasonal variations in the interhemispheric field-aligned currents system. An analysis of multi-instrumental observations reveals reinforcement of the equatorial ionization anomaly after sunset in Atlantic sector on 30 August and formation of the significant plasma depletions and irregularities over a large longitudinal range. Equatorial irregularities were also found in the morning sector at the recovery phase of the storm. In addition to low Earth orbit (LEO) GPS measurements, we analyze the LEO in situ measurements, and we show that these two techniques cannot be interchangeable in all cases because of the altitudinal extent of plasma irregularities. Overall, we demonstrate that the LEO GPS technique can serve a useful tool for detection of the <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> irregularities during space weather events and may essentially contribute to other methods based on various instruments...|$|R

Events of larger O+ flow are detected at auroral latitudes and their occurrence is found to agree with that of transversely accelerated ions within the topside ionosphere and the magnetosphere. The effects of low altitude heating of O+ by oxygen cyclotron waves, driven by downward field-aligned currents, are considered as a possible common cause of these two types of event...|$|R
30|$|The {{vertical}} {{electron density}} profile is the most representative feature of the ionospheric plasma, and its reconstruction is essential for studies concerning ionospheric physics and for space weather purposes. Ground-based ionosondes can measure only the bottomside of this profile, up to {{the height of the}} F 2 -layer peak, that is the absolute maximum of the ionospheric electron density. With regard to the topside, from the F 2 -peak height to higher altitudes, ground-based ionosondes can provide only an estimation, based on bottomside measurements (Reinisch and Huang 2001; Huang and Reinisch 2001). Measuring the topside ionosphere requires an ionosonde onboard a satellite sounding from above the F 2 -peak. Only few missions from the sixties to the eighties, such as Alouette- 1 and Alouette- 2, ISIS- 1 and ISIS- 2, and Intercosmos 19, have provided sets of <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> data, but with a limited spatial coverage; moreover, {{only a small percentage of}} the total soundings were processed into {{electron density profile}}s (Huang et al. 2002). This lack of experimental <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> data (Benson et al. 1998) limits significantly the efforts to study and model this ionospheric region as a function of altitude and geographical location as well as diurnal, seasonal, and solar activity variations. Hence, even though, early in 2014, the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model was officially recognized as the international standard for the specification of the ionosphere by the International Standardization Organization (ISO) (Bilitza and Reinisch 2015), its topside profile often does not represent properly the real features of the ionosphere. A thorough description of these shortcomings and the corresponding efforts done to improve the model were published by Bilitza et al. (2006) and briefly summarized later in the section devoted to the IRI topside options illustration.|$|R

Nowadays, signals of opportunity exist for sounding the ionosphere with no dedicated ionosondes.

At the hT, the peak ionospheric electron and ion temperatures increased by ~ 200 – 500 K during day and by ~ 50 – 70 K at night. While the O+ ion concentration exhibited an overall enhancement, deep penetration of the H+ ions below hT are observed during the day.

The implication is one of a low altitude acceleration mechanism, acting upon the 0 + ions at these latitudes and at heights above that at which the fluxes are observed. Such a process would enable ions to escape from the ionosphere because they do not exchange charge with neutral hydrogen.

With time the vacant phase space region between these beams fills, primarily because of collision-induced particle diffusion but also because of lowering ambipolar potential drops from the increasing density in the plasmasphere. In contrast to all previous hydrodynamic approaches, no formation of shocks was found. The plasma first evolves an isotropic, nearly Maxwellian velocity distribution in a region that starts near the ionosphere and moves outward toward the equator.

The problem with specification, however, is that it relies on the assimilation of real-time observations which are often very sparse, meaning that underlying theoretical constraints are needed, for example to regularise the observation grid. Certain types of observation themselves need to be supplemented by modelling. For example, {{one of the most widely}} available observing techniques is ground-based vertical-incidence HF sounding; but this technique cannot provide any information on the shape of the <b>topside</b> <b>ionospheric</b> profile, and models based on the ionospheric-scale height are used to provide this information (e.g. Reinisch et al. 2001 a; Belehaki and Kersley 2006). In addition, during very disturbed conditions, the signal is absorbed in the ionosphere. Observing techniques including incoherent scatter radars (Farley 1996) like EISCAT_ 3 D, sounding data from satellites (Reinisch et al. 2001 b), ionospheric tomography (Leitinger 1996), or radio occultation measurements (Jakowski 2005) can be used to obtain the missing information.|$|R
