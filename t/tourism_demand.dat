However, the EUCTT is not affiliated with any part of the European Union's Institutions. Despite concerns over the global economy, international <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> continues to show resilience. The number of international tourists worldwide grew by 5% (22 million) between January and June 2012, with Asia and the Pacific (+8%) leading the growth among the regions. Given this growth rate a total of one billion international tourists are expected by the end of 2012. In 2011, the total contribution of World Travel & Tourism to global GDP was USD6,346.1Bn (9.1% of GDP). In 2011, the Caribbean region received 20.9 million tourists, a growth of 4.4% over the same period in 2010. The Caribbean is the most dependent region on tourism with Travel and Tourism contributing 13.9% (USD47.1Bn) to its economic output. Trinidad and Tobago received an estimated 402,058 visitors in 2011, representing 2% of all Caribbean visitor arrivals. Due to the multifaceted nature of tourism, its economic impact is not confined to any single industry. To adequately measure the economic impact of the tourism sector, the United Nations World Travel and Tourism Council (UNWTO) devised the Tourism Satellite Account (TSA), an extension of the System of National Accounts (SNA). The TSA is a detailed production account of the tourism sector showing its linkages to major industries, total employment, capital formation and additional macro-economic variables.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tourism</b> <b>demand</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} areas of tourism {{economics}} research. The current research studies the interdependencies of international <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> across 24 major countries around the world. To this end, it proposes to develop a <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> model using an innovative approach, called the global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model. While existing <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> models are successful in measuring the causal effects of economic variables on <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> for a single origin-destination pair, they tend to miss the spillover effects onto other countries. In the era of globalisation, tourism destinations become interdependent on each other. Impacts of a distant event can be transmitted across borders and be felt globally. Hence, modelling international <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> requires one to go beyond a particular origin-destination pair, and take into account the interdependencies across multiple countries. The proposed approach overcomes the ‘curse of dimensionality’ when modelling a large set of endogenous variables. The empirical results show that, to different extents, co-movements of international <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> and of macroeconomic variables are observed across all the 24 countries. In the event of a negative shock to China’s real income level and that to China’s own price level, it is found that in the short run, almost all countries will face fluctuations in their international <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> and their own price. But in the long run the shocks will impact on developing countries and China’s neighbouring countries more deeply than on developed countries in the West. The current research contributes to the knowledge on <b>tourism</b> <b>demand.</b> It models <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> in the setting of globalisation and quantifies the interdependencies across major countries. On the practical front, tourism policy makers and business practitioners can make use of the model and the results to gauge the scale of impacts of unexpected events on the international <b>tourism</b> <b>demand</b> of their native markets...|$|E
