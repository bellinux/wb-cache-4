25|$|Over {{the next}} few years, the airline {{expanded}} rapidly, boosted by post-war air <b>travel</b> <b>demand</b> when flying became more than a privilege {{for the rich and}} famous. By April 1960, the airline was operating Douglas DC-3s, Super Constellations and Viscounts on new routes from Singapore to Hong Kong, and from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok via Penang. Flights were also introduced from Singapore to cities in the Borneo Territories, including Brunei, Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu), Kuching, Sandakan and Sibu.|$|E

25|$|However, a 2007 {{study by}} the Auckland Regional Council showed that peak hour traffic volumes were {{actually}} down compared to the early 1990s. The morning peak (from 7 am - 9 am) dipped from 17,048 vehicles inbound (towards Auckland City) in 1991 to 16,032 vehicles in 2006 (though the opposing traffic climbed from 5,872 to 10,555 vehicles). At the same time, the afternoon peak (from 4 pm - 6 pm) fell from 17,092 vehicles outbound to 16,759 (though again, the opposing traffic rose substantially, from 6,944 to 10,991). This was generally attributed to <b>travel</b> <b>demand</b> management, to drivers avoiding peak hours, and to increased bus usage since {{the construction of the}} hugely successful Northern Busway - 40% of peak time passengers across the bridge are now carried by bus rather than cars. This has raised some doubts about whether a second crossing is actually necessary.|$|E
30|$|The {{existing}} passenger forecasting method only considers <b>travel</b> <b>demands</b> {{along the}} single line being planned for construction. However, in practice, the demand areas of new lines within a transit rail network are {{far greater than}} those of a single line. The <b>travel</b> <b>demands</b> for new lines interacts with previous demands and potential new demands arising from the opening of new lines, which makes forecasting the future <b>travel</b> <b>demands</b> of existing lines and future lines extremely difficult. In this study, we consider Guangzhou Metro as an example. For a long time, the average daily passenger volume of Line 1 was steady at approximately 170, 000; however, after many new lines opened, the volume increased dramatically to 1.1 million. In 2013, the average daily passenger flow of Line 3 reached 1.46 million, which is 34  % more than the volume that was forecast for 2017 (1.09 million). This unexpected forecasting underestimation presents great challenges for the stability and reliability of urban rail transit operations and management [9, 10].|$|R

25|$|The first Gulf War {{triggered}} by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, sent fuel prices skyrocketing, which severely depressed global economic activity. This in turn caused a sharp contraction of worldwide air <b>travel</b> <b>demand,</b> plunging once profitable operations, including Pan Am's prime transatlantic routes, into steep losses. These unforeseen events constituted a further major blow to Pan Am, which was {{still reeling from the}} 1988 Lockerbie disaster. To shore up its finances, Pan Am sold most of its routes serving London Heathrow – arguably Pan Am's most important international destination – to United Airlines. This left Pan Am with only two daily London flights, serving Detroit and Miami, which used Gatwick as their London terminal {{from the start of the}} 1990/91 winter timetable. Further asset disposals included Pan Am's sale of its IGS routes to Berlin to Lufthansa for $150million, which became effective at the same time and brought the total value of asset disposals to $1.2billion. These measures were accompanied by the elimination of 2,500 jobs (8.6% of its work force). These cutbacks had already been announced by the airline in September 1990.|$|E
2500|$|Eddington's report {{noted that}} {{although}} the sequencing of the full connection was a decision for government, he believed the most urgent need was the section from the inner west to the port, providing {{an alternative to the}} West Gate Bridge—"a tunnel under, or a bridge over, the Maribyrnong River, connecting to a northern bypass of the city."

30|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{developments}} in coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks, most existing works {{are based on}} simulated networks or simulated <b>travel</b> <b>demands.</b> This may lead to findings inconsistent with empirical evidence. First, the actual topology of a transportation network is usually {{much more complicated than}} the topology of a simulated network. Second, the obtained coupling results usually deviate from real situations when using uniformly (randomly) generated <b>travel</b> <b>demands</b> [27]. Third, mobile phone data [30, 31] cannot be used to capture the transfers between different network layers either. Finally, the inconvenience of transfers and individual preferences cannot be evaluated and incorporated in building the models. In summary, previous works had to make strong assumptions on travelers’ routes and mode-selection behavior {{due to the lack of}} data.|$|R
40|$|It is very {{important}} to understand urban mobility patterns because most trips are concentrated in urban areas. In the paper, a new model is proposed to model collective human mobility in urban areas. The model can be applied to predict individual flows not only in intra-city but also in countries or a larger range. Based on the model, it can be concluded that the exponential law of distance distribution is attributed to decreasing exponentially of average density of human <b>travel</b> <b>demands.</b> Since the distribution of human <b>travel</b> <b>demands</b> only depends on urban planning, population distribution, regional functions and so on, it illustrates that these inherent properties of cities are impetus to drive collective human movements.

40|$|The {{passenger}} <b>travel</b> <b>demands</b> for intercity {{rail lines}} fluctuate obviously during different time periods, {{which makes the}} rail departments unable to establish an even train operation scheme. This paper considers an optimization problem for train operations which respond to passenger <b>travel</b> <b>demands</b> of different periods in intercity rail lines. A satisfactory function of passenger travelling is proposed by means of analyzing the passengers’ travel choice behavior and correlative influencing factors. On this basis, the paper formulates a bilevel programming model which maximizes interests of railway enterprises and travelling satisfaction of each passenger. The trains operation in different periods can be optimized through upper layer planning of the model, while considering the passenger flow distribution problem based on the Wardrop user equilibrium principle in the lower layer planning.

40|$|Abstract—Unprecedented pace of {{urbanization}} and rising income levels have fueled {{the growth of}} car ownership in almost all newly formed megacities. Such growth has congested the limited road space and significantly affected {{the quality of life}} in these megacities. Convincing residents to give up their cars and use public transport is the most effective way in reducing congestion; however, even with sufficient public transport capacity, the lack of last-mile (from the transport hub to the destination) travel services is the major deterrent for the adoption of public transport. Due to the dynamic nature of such <b>travel</b> <b>demands,</b> fixed-size fleets will not be a cost-effective approach in addressing last-mile demands. Instead, we propose a dynamic, incentive-based mechanism that enables taxi ridesharing for satisfying last-mile <b>travel</b> <b>demands.</b> On the demand side, travelers would register their last-mile <b>travel</b> <b>demands</b> in real-time, and they are expected to receive ride arrangements before they reach the hub; on the supply side, depending on the real-time demands, proper incentives will be computed and provided to taxi drivers willing to commit to the lastmile service. Multiple travelers will be clustered into groups according to their destinations, and travelers belonging to the same group will be assigned to a taxi, while each of them paying fares considering their destinations and also their orders in reaching destinations. In this paper, we provide mathematical formulations for demand clustering and fare distribution. If the model returns a solution, it is guaranteed to be implementable. For cases where it is not possible to satisfy all demands despite having enough capacity, we propose a two-phase approach that identifies the maximal subset of riders that can be feasibly served. Finally, we use a series of numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Keywords-urban transportation, ride sharing mechanism I...|$|R
