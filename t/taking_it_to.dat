5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim. Although Torres {{agreed that}} Sagan violated some {{terms of the}} contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted {{that it was not}} until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the more}} famous Stanley Cup, members of the winning teams are allowed time to {{celebrate}} with the trophy in their own fashion, often <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their home towns or tours in locations across Canada.

The match was largely uneventful as it {{finished}} 0–0 after normal and extra time thus <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a penalty shoot-out, the first in cup final history. Scholes missed his penalty for Manchester United, and Vieira converted the decisive kick to win the cup for Arsenal. Reyes became the second player to be sent off in the Cup Final, after his second yellow card in the 120th minute.|$|E

5|$|In late 1941, Parkinson, newly {{promoted}} to brigadier, returned to New Zealand {{to take over}} the recently formed 1st New Zealand Army Tank Brigade. After Japan's entry into the war, he became commander of the 7th Infantry Brigade, the army reserve in New Zealand, for several months before reverting to his previous command. The tank brigade was eventually disbanded when the 4th Infantry Brigade, based in Egypt, was converted to armour. Parkinson returned to the Middle East and took over command of the 6th Infantry Brigade. He led the brigade during the final stages of the war in North Africa before <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Italy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} games {{following}} {{the loss to}} Syracuse, Tech lost two, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a final regular-season record of 9–4 overall and a Big East conference record of 3–4, meaning Tech was the fourth ranked team in the Big East that season. Prior to the season, the Big East had {{signed an agreement with}} the new San Francisco Bowl, giving that bowl the fifth pick of bowl-eligible teams in the Big East. But with the Gator Bowl (second pick of Big East teams) selecting Notre Dame instead of a Big East team, all the Big East's selections were pushed back one slot. Second-place West Virginia University was pushed to the Continental Tire Bowl (third pick) and third-place Pittsburgh was selected by the Insight Bowl (fourth pick), leaving Virginia Tech to be selected by the San Francisco Bowl with the fifth pick.|$|E

5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, {{the loss of}} Franklin's {{expedition}} inspired a number of paintings in both the United States and Britain. In 1861, Frederic Edwin Church unveiled his great canvas The Icebergs; later that year, prior to <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> England for exhibition, he added {{an image of a}} broken ship's mast in silent tribute to Franklin. In 1864, Sir Edwin Landseer's Man Proposes, God Disposes caused a stir at the annual Royal Academy exhibition; its depiction of two polar bears, one chewing on a tattered ship's ensign, the other gnawing on a human ribcage, was seen at the time as in poor taste, but has remained {{one of the most powerful}} imaginings of the expedition's final fate. The expedition also inspired numerous popular engravings and illustrations, along with many panoramas, dioramas, and magic lantern shows.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde's orbit is eccentric, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{the outer}} {{reaches of the}} main belt.

Because of the slow rotation rate, NEAR Shoemaker was only able to photograph 60% of the asteroid's surface. The slow rate of rotation may be accounted for by a satellite orbiting the asteroid, but a search of the NEAR images revealed none larger than 10km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of Mathilde.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslavia's socialist {{government}} suppressed or discouraged public religious celebrations {{until the}} early 1990s. Since then, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. There are typically three elements to such celebrations: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of cutting down the oak sapling {{to be used as}} the badnjak, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes Vespers, placing the badnjak on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the badnjak, and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the badnjak not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of gathering around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration has its own specific traits however, reflecting the traditions of the local community.|$|E

5|$|After {{the opening}} prologue in Liège, stage one {{left the city}} with the finish in Seraing. The second stage took place between Visé to Tournai. The race then moved into north-west France, with the third stage ending in the coastal city of Boulogne-sur-Mer, before the fourth ended in Rouen, and the fifth in Saint-Quentin. Stage six took the race east, with the seventh ending in the Vosges Mountains. Stage eight then entered the Jura Mountains, with the finish in Porrentruy, Switzerland. A return to France saw the next stage take place between Arc-et-Senans to Besançon. The next stages, ten and eleven, went into the Alps, and stages twelve and {{thirteen}} took the Tour down to the Mediterranean coast at Cap d'Agde. Stage fourteen moved the race into the east of Pyrenees, before a transitional stage <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{the western side of}} the mountains for the next two stages. Stage eighteen was held between Blagnac to Brive-la-Gaillarde in the south of the country, before a long transfer took the race back to the north-east for two further stages, with the finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his work}} as a barrister, Hastings also tried his hand at writing plays. His first play was The Moscow Doctor, based on a novel by Seton Merriman which he had rewritten; it ran for over a week in Brighton. He desired to have an {{original}} work performed, however, and to this end wrote The River over a period of 20 years before <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> St James's Theatre, where it was accepted and performed in June 1925. The play starred Owen Nares and initially went well, but foundered in the second act due to the plot requiring the most popular actors to be taken off stage - the character played by Nares, for example, broke his leg. Reviews compared the plot to something out of the Boy's Own Paper. The play lasted only a month before being cancelled, but Hastings was able to sell the film rights for £2,000, and it was turned into a Hollywood film called The Notorious Lady starring Lewis Stone and Barbara Bedford.|$|E
5|$|The game {{began with}} an auspicious start for Michigan, as they scored on the first {{play of the game}} from {{scrimmage}} with a 75-yard touchdown reception by Roy Roundtree. Illinois responded with two field goals by Derek Dimke: first from 43 yards, and then from 44 yards out. In the second quarter, Illinois took the lead with a touchdown yard run by Nathan Scheelhaase, and completed a 2-point conversion to Ryan Lankford. Michigan tied it up with a 33-yard reception by Roy Roundtree. Illinois retook the lead with a 62-yard reception by Jason Ford. Michigan tied it back up with a 4-yard run by Stephen Hopkins, and took the lead back with a 45-yard reception by Junior Hemingway. The first half ended with 2 field goals that left the game tied: a 35-yard Michigan field goal, and a 43-yard Illinois field goal. Contrary to the explosive nature of the first half, the third quarter was relatively quiet, with the only scoring being an 18-yard run by Michigan's Michael Shaw. The fourth quarter saw a reemergence of offense, as Illinois tied it back up with a 27-yard reception by Mikel Leshoure and then took the lead with a 1-yard run by Leshoure. Michigan was able to tie the game late with a 9-yard catch by Darryl Stonum. Illinois chose to run out the clock, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> overtime. In the first overtime, Michigan got the ball first and Michael Shaw ran in a 5-yard touchdown. Mikel Leshoure then ran in a 1-yard touchdown, forcing double overtime. Illinois received the ball to start the second overtime, and Mikel Leshoure caught a 25-yard touchdown on the first play. Junior Hemingway then caught a 9-yard touchdown, forcing triple overtime. Michigan got the ball first to start the third overtime and scored on a 1-yard run by Michael Shaw. By rule, the Wolverines had to go for a 2-point conversion, which they completed with a pass to Junior Hemingway. Illinois' Mikel Leshoure ran in a 3-yard touchdown, but the 2-point conversion attempt failed, giving Michigan the win.|$|E
