5|$|Discrimination against Jews, longstanding but extralegal {{throughout}} much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions {{of the right to}} practise. Violence and economic pressure were used by <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>to</b> force Jews to leave the country. Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the camps}} housed {{political}} opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society—criminals, vagrants, deviants—were {{placed in the}} camps as well. A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 allowed for the incarceration of anyone deemed by <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>to</b> be an undesirable member of society. This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be Untermensch (sub-human). Thus, the camps became a mechanism for social and racial engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates. Death tolls were high.|$|E

5|$|Many {{months before}} the coup, Đông had met Diệm's brother and adviser Ngô Đình Nhu, widely {{regarded}} as the brains of <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> <b>to</b> ask for reform and de-politicisation of the army. Đông said that the meeting went well and was hopeful that Nhu would enact change. However, a few weeks later, Dong and his collaborators were transferred to different commands and physically separated. Fearing that Diệm and Nhu were trying to throw their plans off balance, they accelerated their planning work, and decided to move on October 6. However, they were then scheduled to go into battle against the communists near Kon Tum in the II Corps in the Central Highlands, forcing a postponement. According to the historian George McTurnan Kahin, Đông was without a command by the time the coup was held.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{signed the}} Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat), a {{treaty with the}} Vatican that {{required}} <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>to</b> honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches {{and to try to}} weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offenses. Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the Kirchenkampf (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.|$|E
5|$|Persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany {{followed}} the Nazi takeover. Hitler {{moved quickly to}} eliminate political Catholicism, rounding up functionaries of the Catholic-aligned Bavarian People's Party and Catholic Centre Party, which along with all other non-Nazi political parties ceased to exist by July. The Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat) treaty with the Vatican was signed in 1933, amid continuing harassment {{of the church in}} Germany. The treaty required <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>to</b> honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. Hitler routinely disregarded the Concordat, closing all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders were targeted, with thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped-up charges of currency smuggling or immorality. Several high-profile Catholic lay leaders were targeted in the 1934 Night of the Long Knives assassinations. Most Catholic youth groups refused to dissolve themselves and Hitler Youth leader Baldur von Schirach encouraged members to attack Catholic boys in the streets. Propaganda campaigns claimed the church was corrupt, restrictions were placed on public meetings and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.|$|E

The BSPP announced they would be organising an election, but the opposition parties called for their immediate resignation from government, allowing an interim government to organise elections. After the BSPP rejected both demands, protesters again {{took to the streets}} on 12 September 1988. Nu promised elections within a month, proclaiming a provisional government. Meanwhile, the police and army began fraternising with the protesters. The movement had reached an impasse relying on three hopes: daily demonstrations to force <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>to</b> respond to their demands, encouraging soldiers to defect and appealing to an international audience in the hope that United Nations or United States troops would arrive. Some Tatmadaw did defect, but only in limited numbers, mostly from the Navy.

Previous {{studies have shown that}} there may exist a stable wind-dominated regime, an unstable wind-dominated regime, and a stable buoyancy-dominated regime. Here we examine the transient evolution of the flow between these regimes as a result of changes in the wind forcing. We show that the transition from <b>the</b> wind-dominated <b>regime</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> buoyancy-dominated <b>regime</b> occurs as <b>the</b> wind forcing decreases below a critical value. However, the reverse transition, from <b>the</b> buoyancy-dominated <b>regime</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind-dominated <b>regime,</b> only occurs if there is a sufficiently large and rapid increase in the wind forcing. We calculate the instantaneous increase in wind forcing required for the system to evolve from <b>the</b> buoyancy-dominated <b>regime</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind-dominated <b>regime,</b> and we also determine the minimum rate of increase of the wind forcing for such a transition to occur. We discuss the implication of our results for building design...|$|R
25|$|During 1964 the Communist regime made {{an attempt}} to change the Muslim names of the Pomaks in Kochan with Slavic ones but the attempt failed and only those loyal to the regime had their names changed.

25|$|Sabha {{is located}} by an oasis in the Libyan Desert and {{is home to}} an {{important}} military base. Much of its population are migrants from Chad, Niger, and Sudan. These migrants {{had been brought to}} Libya by Gaddafi in the 1980s and given employment and stipends by <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> <b>to</b> ensure their support. In addition, the city is home to a large number of members of the Qadhadhfa tribe, to which Gaddafi belongs. As a result, the city was regarded as a stronghold of pro-Gaddafi sentiment as the anti-regime protests that began across Libya in February 2011 turned into civil war. As the conflict progressed, however, many of the migrants went north to fight against the rebels, draining Gaddafi's major base of support in the city. Those who remained behind were mostly armed young locals and members of the Awlad Suleiman tribe. The Awlad Suleiman bear strong resentment against the regime. Shortly after Gaddafi seized power, members of the tribe were accused of plotting to overthrow him. Many tribesmen were executed and imprisoned as a result.|$|E

The thesis begins with a discussion of the Party, and to provides a clear picture of how ‘national’ and ‘local’ interacted alongside the establishment of the structures.

Those who attempted to escape were called Sperrbrecher (literally [...] "blockade runners" [...] but more loosely translated as [...] "border violators").
