5|$|The speech bubble {{makes the}} entire canvas {{relevant}} by broadening {{the attention to}} the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, {{there is reason to}} describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and <b>the</b> <b>dotted</b> coloration of the skin.|$|E

40|$|A double-quantum-dot {{coupled to}} {{electrodes}} with spin-dependent splitting of chemical potentials (spin bias) is investigated theoretically {{by means of}} the Green's functions formalism. By applying a large spin bias, the quantum spin in a quantum <b>dot</b> (<b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1) can be manipulated in a fully electrical manner. To noninvasively monitor the manipulation of the quantum spin in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1, it is proposed that <b>the</b> second quantum <b>dot</b> (<b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2) is weakly coupled to <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1. In <b>the</b> presence of the exchange interaction between <b>the</b> two <b>dots,</b> <b>the</b> polarized spin in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1 behaves like an effective magnetic field and weakly polarizes the spin in <b>the</b> nearby quantum <b>dot</b> 2. By applying a very small spin bias to <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2, <b>the</b> spin-dependent transport through <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2 can be probed, allowing the spin polarization in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1 to be identified nondestructively.

On 17 August, a 48th Division (XVIII Corps) attack on Maison du Hibou failed; next day the 14th Division (II Corps) attacked with a brigade through Inverness Copse, although held up further north by fire from Fitzclarence and L-shaped farms. A German counter-attack forced the British half way back through the copse but with support from two tanks on the Menin Road, the British held on, despite three more German attacks.

At a conference with the Fifth Army corps commanders on 17 August, Gough complained that troops had failed to hold captured ground and considered court-martialling some NCOs and officers. Gough also thought that divisions had been relieved too frequently, which had exhausted fresh divisions before the attack. The corps commanders were asked for proposals for attacks to reach the final objectives where their divisions had fallen short on 16 August.

40|$|The slalom {{illusion}} is {{the condition}} whereby the straight trajectory of a dot crossing {{a pattern of}} tilted lines is perceived as being sinusoidal (Cesaro and Agostini, 1998). The authors suggested that this illusion {{might be due to}} a local distortion of <b>the</b> moving <b>dot</b> when traversing each tilted line: When <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> approaches <b>the</b> lines, its trajectory is distorted toward the normalization, that is, <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> bends to enter the line perpendicularly (Swanson, 1984). Furthermore, there might be a perceptual tendency of <b>the</b> moving <b>dot</b> to continue along this virtual trajectory. However, as the physical trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> is straight, <b>the</b> final perceived trajectory is a compromise between the virtual and the physical trajectory. In the present experiment, we test this hypothesis by manipulating the area between the tilted lines. The area between the lines was either a) the same colour as <b>the</b> <b>dot,</b> to make <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> trajectory partially invisible; or (b) empty, leaving <b>the</b> <b>dot's</b> full trajectory visible. Results show that the illusion magnitude increases when <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> trajectory is partially invisible, supporting the hypothesis that the illusion results from a compromise between the physical and the virtual trajectory...|$|R
