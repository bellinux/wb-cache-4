5|$|He {{describes}} {{the range of}} species in each group in some detail, concluding that the birds are unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Philip Nel {{highlighted}} {{the influence of}} Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired {{since the age of}} twelve. Both novelists encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line– for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the Harry Potter books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories, and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C.S. Lewis, <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genresfantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman and many others.|$|E

He says they should try as it will increase her chances of a release. She relents, at first, but agrees and he shows her slides of nude women to aid her repulsion. He then brings in a male patient and has Lana touch both the patient and herself in sexual manner. She cannot complete this form of therapy. Thredson later promises Lana that he will take her with him when his asylum visit is over in a week.|$|E

25|$|The game {{continues}} {{in this manner}} until all the reds are potted and only the six colours are left on the table. At this point the colours must be potted in the order from least to most valuable ball– that is, yellow first (two points), then green (three points), brown (four points), blue (five points), pink (six points) and finally black (seven points), with the balls not being returned to play. When the final ball is potted, the player with more points wins. If the scores are equal when all the balls have been potted, the black is placed back on its spot as a tiebreaker. A player may also concede a frame while on strike {{if he or she}} <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> are not enough points available on the table to beat the opponent's score.

500|$|Architectural experts {{sometimes}} {{differ in}} their interpretations of Kahn's design. [...] Why, for example, are the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive? Carter Wiseman says, [...] "While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight {{coming in from the}} surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium." [...] Sarah Goldhagen <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> is more to the story, asserting that [...] "the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect." [...] Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: [...] "Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. [...] Its weight, which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details." [...] Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} episode was [...] "solid all-around" [...] and {{especially}} liked Leslie's blind date with the elderly man and Chris Pratt, especially his listing {{of all his}} previous band names. Medina said, [...] "Parks and Recreation is only six episodes in, and it's already better than I anticipated. It has its own tone, a talented cast, and a plot that's advancing toward something, at least as fast as governmental red tape will allow it to." [...] Richard Lawson of Gawker said the episode {{was the best of}} the season and that he liked the wistful pacing and Poehler's performance. Lawson said, [...] "Anyone who dismissed this show after its first sorta underwhelming episode made a mistake. The show has only gotten tighter and sharper, culminating in last night's funny/sad finale." [...] Time television reviewer James Poniewozik said the episode was the best yet for developing Poehler into a [...] "more multi-facted, less risible character". He also said the supporting staff played [...] "flawlessly" [...] off each other in the rock show scene, and <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> is [...] "huge potential" [...] in the dynamic between Leslie and her undermining mother. Not all reviews of the episode were positive. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune said the Leslie Knope character was unappealing in [...] "Rock Show" [...] and throughout the first season, which she said surpassed the Friends spin-off Joey as [...] "the worst example of NBC's tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beyond this distinction, Searle <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> {{are certain}} {{phenomena}} (including all conscious experiences) that are ontologically subjective, i.e. can only exist as subjective experience.

The pain itself, however, is ontologically subjective: it is only experienced by the person having it.|$|E
2500|$|However, in {{the later}} case of Shankar Alan, Judicial Commissioner Menon took an {{opposing}} view, holding that [...] "there are indeed some important differences between [...] ". First, he considered that there are material differences between {{the perspective of the}} inquiry, accepting that the real likelihood of bias test directs the inquiry at whether the court <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> is a real likelihood or danger of bias, while the reasonable suspicion test considers it {{from the perspective of the}} public. He also considered that even with the rider that [...] "likelihood" [...] is to be equated with [...] "possibility", there is still a significant difference between the court inquiring whether it <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> is a sufficient (or real) possibility that the tribunal or court was biased on the one hand, and, on the other, whether a lay person might reasonably entertain such an apprehension, even if the court was satisfied that there was in fact no such danger. Secondly, there is also a difference in relation to the substance of the inquiry. The real likelihood test is concerned with the degree of possibility that there was bias even if it was unconscious. In contrast, the reasonable suspicion test is concerned with how it appears to the relevant observer and whether that observer could reasonably entertain a suspicion or apprehension of bias even if the court was satisfied that there was no possibility of bias in fact.|$|E

2500|$|Menon {{disagreed}} with both Lord Goff in Gough and Judicial Commissioner Phang in Tang Kin Hwa {{in that he}} thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> is a sufficient possibility of bias was [...] "a very significant point of departure" [...] The real likelihood test is met {{as long as the}} court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Anderson felt {{pleased with}} {{three-quarters of the}} album, with the {{remaining}} quarter [...] "not quite jelling", but felt the too soon release deadline given to the band resulted in a lack of time to listen and alter the music properly.
