60|$|These {{examples}} will {{illustrate the}} kind of questions it {{is the object of}} the present work to deal with. Every continent, every country, and every island on the globe, offers similar problems of greater or less complexity and interest, and the time has now arrived when their solution can be attempted with some prospect of success. Many {7} years study of this class of subjects has convinced me that there is no short and easy method of dealing with them; because they are, in their very nature, the visible outcome and residual product of the whole past history of the earth. If we take the organic productions of a small island, or of any very limited tract of country, such as a moderate-sized country parish, we have, in their relations and affinities--in {{the fact that they are}} there and others are not <b>there,</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> which involves all the migrations of these species and their ancestral forms--all the vicissitudes of climate and all the changes of sea and land which have affected those migrations--the whole series of actions and reactions which have determined the preservation of some forms and the extinction of others,--in fact the whole history of the earth, inorganic and organic, throughout a large portion of geological time.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the central}} {{questions}} of complexity theory is whether randomness adds power; that is, is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> which can be solved in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine but not a deterministic Turing machine? Or can deterministic Turing machines efficiently simulate all probabilistic Turing machines with at most a polynomial slowdown? It is currently widely believed by researchers that the latter is the case, which would imply P = BPP. The same question for log space instead of polynomial time (does L = BPLP?) is even more widely believed to be true. On the other hand, the power randomness gives to interactive proof systems, {{as well as the}} simple algorithms it creates for difficult problems such as polynomial-time primality testing and log-space graph connectedness testing, suggest that randomness may add power.|$|E

50|$|Several {{philosophers}} {{have argued}} that just as there exists a problem of evil for theists who believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being, so too is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of good for anyone who believes in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnimalevolent (or perfectly evil) being. As {{it appears that the}} defenses and theodicies which might allow the theist to resist the problem of evil can be inverted and used to defend belief in the omnimalevolent being, this suggests that we should draw similar conclusions about the success of these defensive strategies. In that case, the theist appears to face a dilemma: either to accept that both sets of responses are equally bad, and so that the theist does not have an adequate response to the problem of evil; or to accept that both sets of responses are equally good, and so to commit to the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnimalevolent being as plausible.|$|E

50|$|A {{letter of}} the {{conspirator}} Charles Paget, {{who was part of}} the Babington Plot to free (or incriminate) Mary, gives an insight to Bastian's status, showing he was an intimate of the Queen, but not an essential member of her secretariat. Paget wrote to Mary on 4 January 1586 that he would try to introduce a Catholic priest into the house under the name of Master Alisson. Alisson's innocent letter of introduction would be brought to Bastian or Christine, because if <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> the secretaries would not be compromised. Paget's letter was intercepted, deciphered, copied, and signed on the back by Burghley, Hundsdon, Cobham, Shrewsbury and Walsingham.When the English authorities decided to act on the plot on 11 August 1586, Mary was out riding with Bastian, her doctor Dominique Bourgoing and others, and they were surprised by armed soldiers who took them to nearby Tixall. When Mary was returned to Chartley two weeks later, Bastian was offered the keys to Mary's room, but the Queen told him not to accept and had an English officer open her things. She found her papers had been taken away whereupon she said two things could not be taken from her, her English blood and her Catholic religion. Paulet drew up a new list of her servants, and wrote;If Bastian's wyfe be discharged yt is like that Bastian will desire to go with his wyfe, wherein there were no greate losse because he is cunning in hys kynde, and full of sleightes to corrupt yonge men.|$|E
