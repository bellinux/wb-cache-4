5|$|A variant on <b>this</b> <b>design</b> {{is the use}} of arrays, whose {{tilt angle}} can be {{adjusted}} twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output. They also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle. Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of <b>this</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. <b>This</b> <b>design</b> almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E

30|$|To make <b>this</b> <b>designed</b> method be used generally, {{we need to}} {{consider}} about the posture of robot in 3 D environment. For OCTOPUS, we assume the yaw angle is fixed, because the change of yaw angle cannot been got in real robot. For other systems which roll pitch yaw angle can be got precisely, <b>this</b> <b>designed</b> method and concept are also useful. The researchers just need to add other rotation factor in Eq.  11 to describe the change of yaw angle. Because it is simple matrix multiplication, we do not repeat it in here again.|$|R

5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of <b>this</b> <b>design</b> were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  4, all {{values of the}} average and median are {{completely}} far from 7 (between 1 and 2), thus, the learners were very satisfied with <b>this</b> <b>designed</b> educational game.

In particular, and despite the high satisfaction rate obtained with <b>this</b> <b>designed</b> game, some learners had lower intention of using the game in the future. This could be because some learners, and depending on their personalities, prefer other game genres and not “platform” genre specifically (Peever et al., 2012). Consequently, they decided to not return to the game again.|$|R
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. <b>This</b> <b>design</b> was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. <b>This</b> <b>design</b> was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. <b>This</b> <b>design</b> was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E

An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. <b>This</b> <b>design</b> allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E

The MTA also pushed back its completion date to 2014.
