5|$|Monotype's 1922-3 design, {{based on}} Jannon's {{work in the}} Imprimerie Nationale, is bundled with many Microsoft products. Its italic, {{faithful}} to Jannon's, is extremely calligraphic, with a very variable angle of slant and flourishes on several lower-case letters. Its commercial release is more extensive than the basic Microsoft release, featuring additional features such as swash capitals and small capitals, although like many pre-digital fonts these are only included in the regular weight. Popular in the metal type era, its digitisation has been criticised for having too light a colour on the page for body text if printed with many common printing systems, a problem with several Monotype digitisations of the period. Monotype's 1933 guide to identifying their typefaces noted the asymmetrical T, the sharp <b>triangular</b> <b>serif</b> at top left of m, n, p and r, and a q unlike the p, with a point at top right rather than a full serif.|$|E

5000|$|The classicals can {{be broken}} down into humanist, Garald and {{transitional}} categories, and are characterized by <b>triangular</b> <b>serifs,</b> oblique axis and low stroke contrast. In other classification systems, this group {{is often referred to as}} [...] "oldstyle." ...|$|R
50|$|The glyphic, incised, or incise are typefaces which {{evoke the}} {{engraving}} or chiseling of characters in stone or metal, {{as opposed to}} calligraphic handwriting. They thus have small, <b>triangular</b> <b>serifs</b> or tapering downstrokes. There is usually {{a greater emphasis on}} the capital letters in glyphic typefaces, with some faces not containing a lowercase.|$|R
5000|$|Constantia was {{designed}} for either print or on-screen uses. Numerals are text figures by default, as seen on the sample image; the font also includes lining figures as an alternate style. Reviewing it for the website Typographica, Raph Levien described it {{as likely to be}} [...] "everyone's favourite face the suite...a highly readable Roman font departing only slightly from the classical model, but it still manages to be fresh and new. It takes some inspiration from Perpetua and Felicity...but the <b>triangular</b> <b>serifs</b> bring to mind a chisel, and the font has enough calligraphic flavor to recall Palatino." [...] Among other features, the design includes small capitals, alternative spacing and punctuation for all caps text, numbers enclosed by circles, and superscript and subscript glyphs.|$|R
50|$|The de Colines roman of 1531 resembled Griffo's 1499 roman {{but did not}} copy it closely. Narrower {{forms and}} tighter letter fit; a with low angled bowl; {{elevated}} <b>triangular</b> stem <b>serifs</b> on i, j, m, n and r; flattened baseline serifs, delicately modeled ascender serifs and graceful, fluid lines characterize the French style. Robert Estienne's roman of 1532 {{was similar to the}} de Colines face, which Estienne complemented with a fine italic type based on that of Arrighi. The craftsmen who cut the punches for the romans used by Estienne and de Colines remain unidentified. In 1532 Antoine Augereau cut the punches for a roman type very close to Estienne's. The lower cases of the Estienne and Augereau types became the basis for post-Renaissance old style typography, and were copied by French typographers for the next 150 years.|$|R
500|$|Jannon's career {{took place}} during a {{politically}} tense period. Jannon was a Protestant in mostly Catholic France. After apparently working with the Estienne family in Paris he set up an independent career as printer in Sedan {{in what is now}} north-eastern France, becoming printer for the Protestant Academy. By his report he took up punchcutting seriously in his thirties, although according to Williamson he would have cut decorative material and engravings at least before this. Sedan the time enjoyed an unstable independence as a principality {{at a time when the}} French government had conceded through the Edict of Nantes to allowing a complicated system of restricted liberties for Protestants. While acknowledging his talent and commissioning equipment from him, as documented by the surviving purchase order, it is known that authorities in 1644 raided an office in Caen where he had been commissioned to do printing. Warde initially assumed that this was the source of the Jannon materials in the Imprimerie Nationale before the government's purchase order came to light. Jannon's types and their descendants are recognizable by the <b>triangular</b> <b>serifs</b> on the top left of such characters as 'm', 'n' and 'r', which have a very steep slant in Jannon's design compared to Garamond's. The italics are also very different to Garamond's own or Granjon's, being much more ornate and with considerable variation in angle of the capitals. Opinions of Jannon's engraving quality have varied; Warde found them [...] "of slight value as a book face" [...] and Vervliet described them as [...] "famous not so much for the quality of the design but as for the long-term confusion it created", although many reproductions of his work were successful in printing in the twentieth century. Jannon cut far more types than those surviving in the Imprimerie collection: before the misattribution to Garamond, he was particularly respected for his engraving of an extremely small size of type, known for his workplace as s√©danoise, which was popular.|$|R
