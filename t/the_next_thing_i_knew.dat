2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I was on Cowan's shoulders, {{and he was}} tearing {{round and}} round the fort with two {{companies}} at his heels.|$|E
60|$|At last, I fell asleep, {{dreaming about}} Harry {{fighting}} a duel of dice-boxes with the military-looking man below; and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> was {{the glare of}} a light before my eyes, and Harry himself, very pale, stood before me.|$|E
60|$|A {{lull in the}} {{conversation}} followed, but Hasluck was not thin-skinned, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> distinguished was his cheery laugh.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I {{already had}} a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well {{supplied}} with arms.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{did was to}} {{take the}} liberty which she had already sanctioned--I mean the liberty of reading what she had written. Here it is, copied exactly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get his number? I didn't {{have time}} to get anything. He just slid by, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> I was turning a {{somersault}} in the air and diving right down into the bottom of that hole;" [...] and at this remark the other cadets had to smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Hands off, mate!' says I, and I {{lifted my}} fist to let fly at him, when I got {{a knock at}} the back of the head. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> was, I was lying in the hold of a ship, and, as I made out presently, with a score of others, some of whom were groaning, and some cursing.|$|E
60|$|I {{know not}} what I stammered, to excuse myself, to explain; but I went toward her, {{to tell her}} I meant no harm. She waved me off with her old hands, {{retreating}} before me in horror; and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she had fallen back with a quick spasm, as if death had descended on her, into Miss Tita's arms.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> saw was <b>the</b> top-knot {{of silver}} hair surmounting Captain Ellis' smooth red face, {{which would have}} been apoplectic if it hadn't had such a fresh appearance.|$|R
60|$|JUDITH (wearily). Then {{you were}} here: that's <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> remember. I suppose I fainted. Now bid me goodbye, Tony. Perhaps I shall faint again. I wish I could die.|$|R
60|$|Meg {{began to}} cry. I suppose {{she looked at}} him through her tears. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard was a cry from the old woman, and the sound of {{staggering}} feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] says I, [...] "I'll {{wait till}} you're through with this." [...] And I sat right {{down beside her}} on the floor, and set to smooth her hair with my hand. At first she wriggled away when I touched her; then she seemed to notice me no more; then her sobs grew {{gradually}} less, and presently stopped; and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> she raised her face to mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't Taft. He only {{looks like}} him. It was that kid Ogden up where I work. He came butting into the gym, joshing me about--makin' pers'nal remarks till I kind of lost my goat, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I {{was giving him}} his!" [...] A faint gleam of {{pleasure}} lightened the gloom of his face. [...] "I cert'nly give him his!" [...] The gleam faded. [...] "And after that--well, here I am!" ...|$|E
60|$|My {{quotation}} {{was hardly}} {{out of my}} lips before we had rounded the corner above the Convent; and a few yards further on could see across to Sanjowlie. In {{the centre of the}} level road stood the black and white liveries, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw, and Mrs. Keith-Wessington. I pulled up, looked, rubbed my eyes, and, I believe must have said something. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> was that I was lying face downward on the road with Kitty kneeling above me in tears.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> {{heard my}} uncle calling me, {{and found the}} pair in the road together. It was the captain who {{addressed}} me, and that with an air (very flattering to a young lad) of grave equality.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{after this}} she {{announced}} that she meant to see Morris once {{to say good-bye to}} him before she went to London, and left me. Practically <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> heard about her was that she was dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> became {{conscious}} of {{was that the}} cart was at a standstill, and that the pony stood cropping the thyme-sweet turf by the wayside. I touched the cold dark hand. [...] "Hush, my dear, we are here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{luckily for}} me, I pitched {{down into a}} good soft bed of earth--but it put me out of action for the time, sure enough. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> I was lying {{in bed with a}} {{hospital}} nurse (not Whittington's one) on one side of me, and a little black-bearded man with gold glasses, and medical man written all over him, on the other. He rubbed his hands together, and raised his eyebrows as I stared at him. 'Ah!' he said. 'So our young friend is coming round again. Capital. Capital.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I did {{not exactly}} levitate, but {{something}} or someone {{seemed to get}} a hold of me, and I was just rushed along in a most tumultuous fashion. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> was that I was standing at the door of that sepulchre, though I have no recollection of going up in the lift, or whatever it is. I believe those beastly caves are full of ghosts, or devils, and the worst of it is that they have kept my solar-tope, which I put on this morning forgetting that it would be useless there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{admit that}} the old Berserk blood of the Smiths boiled at that juncture. I picked up a sleep-producer from the floor, as Comrade Brady would say, {{and handed it to}} the big-stick merchant. He went down like a sack of coal over the bookcase, and at that moment I rather fancy the other gentleman must have got busy with his club. At any rate, {{somebody}} suddenly loosed off some fifty thousand dollars' worth of fireworks, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> was that the curtain had risen for the next act on me, discovered sitting in a prison cell, with an out-size in lumps on my forehead." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} have been {{unconscious}} more than a few seconds, and yet I know that I was unconscious, for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> realized was that a growing radiance was illuminating the corridor about me and the eyes were gone.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} {{is that it was}} morning: breakfast was just over: Sylvie was lifting Bruno down from a high chair, and saying to a Spaniel, who was regarding them with a most benevolent smile, [...] "Yes, thank you we've had a very nice breakfast. Haven't we, Bruno?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I was {{fiddling}} {{about with}} the car when I suddenly saw Peter Lamploughcoming straight towards me. I just couldn't believe it - I froze on <b>the</b> spot. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> remember is being picked out of a shop window, where my car had been hurled by the impact" [...] Tom Pryce ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! what didn't they do?" [...] {{retorted}} {{the station}} master. [...] "Come in here, an' knocked over a box an' a basket, rushed {{up to the}} winder, an' <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> he had planked down a lot o' money, an' when I stuck my head out the winder here, that feller pretended to grab up a ticket wot I didn't give him at all, an' took up his money and dusted out the door. At the same time while this was goin' on, 'nother feller had a light turned on this here winder wot nearly blinded me, and the feller with that funny lookin' camera was a-turnin' the crank to beat the cars!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{dropped my}} blanket roll, {{which seemed to}} me weighed not less than two hundred pounds, on the muddy road, {{and sat down to}} rest. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> some one tapped me on the shoulder. It was three o’clock, and I had been asleep for some hours. The {{regiment}} was again under arms, and was receiving ammunition from a pack-train which had come up from the rear. We pressed on until early dawn, when we were well in front of Santiago. Entrenchments were hastily thrown up, and we were ready for the enemy. The enemy did not give us much time for rest. They made an assault upon our position early in the morning, which we repulsed....|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} struggle, {{but he seemed}} to hold me as if I were in a vice. I heard Alice scream, and then I must have fainted; for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> was that I was being carried along on horseback. I was so muffled up, and he held me so tight, that I felt it was no use to struggle; and I made up my mind to lie quite still, as if I was still insensible, till he put me down; and then--I think I {{intended}} to try and seize his pistol, or to get hold of a knife, if there was one and, if I could not kill him, to kill myself.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{noticed was}} that a great {{mellowness}} had descended upon {{the mother of the}} last of his race. But these terms, irritation, mellowness, appeared gross when applied to her. It is impossible to give an idea of the refinement and subtlety of all her transformations. She smiled faintly at me.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} was someone shaking {{me by the}} shoulder. I thought it was Stephen, who had agreed to keep awake {{for the first part}} of the night and to call me at one in the morning. Indeed, he was awake, for I could see the glow from the pipe he smoked.|$|R
5000|$|O'Doherty {{was sent}} {{from the field}} {{in a game against}} Penrith in 1990 {{following}} an on-field brawl. O'Doherty plead his innocence, saying, [...] "I didn't throw a punch, I didn't throw anything. I said to Chris Mortimer 'let's keep out of this because it's the last game'. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> know I'm an instigator and off the field." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{week later}} {{he hired a}} man to make several dozen square yards of trellis-work to put {{around the back of}} his hut, that his women-folk might be {{screened}} from the public gaze. The man went away in the evening, and left his day's work to pave the short cut from the public road to my house. I was driving home in the dusk, and turned the corner by Naboth's Vineyard quickly. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> was that the horses of the phaeton were stamping and plunging in the strongest sort of bamboo net-work. Both beasts came down. One rose with nothing more than chipped knees. The other was so badly kicked that I was forced to shoot him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have little}} more to say, and it's as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it {{for a day or}} so, {{intending}} to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly snackled [27] as ever I saw in my life. That's the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The water {{covered all}} the stones, but I {{knew where they}} were as well as Gran'dad did. I didn't like my job a bit, but I knew if I waited to go roun' by the bridge that I'd be too late to see {{anything}} that happened. So I screwed up courage an' started over. My legs ain't as long as a grown-up's and at the third step I missed the stone an' soused one leg in the water up to my knee. Gee! that was a cold one. But I wouldn't give up, an' kep' on until jus' in the middle, where the water were roarin' the worst, I slipped with both legs and went in to my waist. That settled it for me. I thought I'd drown, for a minute, but I went crazy with fear an' <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I was standin' on the bank where I'd come from an' the cold wind was freezin' a sheet of ice on my legs an' body.|$|E
6000|$|Oliver halted {{and slowly}} turned round, drawing his {{revolver}} {{as he did}} so. Then he aimed and fired, and the Fung, leaving go of Japhet's leg, threw up his arms and plunged headlong into the gulf beneath. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> remember {{is that they were}} both among us, and somebody shouted, [...] "Pull in the ladder." ...|$|R
6000|$|She fled behind us. He followed, but Seti, crying, [...] "Ah, I thought it," [...] leapt between them, {{as he did}} so {{drawing the}} iron sword which he wore with his {{ceremonial}} dress. At him he sprang and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> saw was <b>the</b> red point of the sword standing out beyond the priest's shoulders.|$|R
60|$|I laughed. She laughed. We {{both looked}} at one another; and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} was that I had drawn down Isaline's plump little face close to mine, and was kissing it vigorously, in spite of an acute darting pain at each kiss all along my spine and into my marrow-bones. Poor M. Claude was utterly forgotten.|$|R
