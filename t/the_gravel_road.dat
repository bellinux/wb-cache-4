This experiment, widely reported by the press, successfully eliminated the dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, the {{province}} of Manitoba had a segment in Lynn Lake of road that was paved with gravel from the junction with the Canadian National Railway. The road went through downtown Lynn Lake and followed modern day PR394's route up to a section {{to the east of}} Zed Lake. After Zed Lake, the route fell to a trail out to Garth Lake in Saskatchewan, south of modern-day Kinoosao. By the next year, <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> had been extended to the Saskatchewan provincial line at Co-Op Point to modern-day Kinoosao. In 1963, the section from Zed Lake to Co-Op Point was turned into an improved earth road, and by 1966, the route had become designated as PR394 as far as Vandekerckhove Lake. The junction with PR398 was also designated at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The {{first section}} of what became MD 223 was {{improved}} as a gravel road from the Southern Maryland Road (now Old Branch Avenue) in Clinton southwest to Steed Road by 1921. <b>The</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> was extended to southwest of Tippett Road in 1924. The portion of Piscataway Road between {{the west end of}} MD 223 and Livingston Road, which was constructed as MD 224, was improved as a county highway by 1930. MD 223 was extended southwest to Parker Lane northeast of Piscataway in 1933. In 1947 and 1948, the portion of Woodyard Road between MD 4 (now Marlboro Pike) and Dower House Road, then still a county highway, was improved as a gravel road. MD 223 was extended on both ends in 1955. On the west, the highway was extended southwest to Livingston Road, which ceased to be part of MD 224 the same year. On the east, the highway was extended northeast along Woodyard Road from Clinton to MD 4 (now Marlboro Pike) at Melwood.|$|E

25|$|The {{next section}} {{of what is}} now MD 224 to be {{improved}} was the short stretch across Mattawoman Creek on the La PlataIndian Head road, which was built as a gravel road between 1916 and 1919 and later became MD 225. Livingston Road was improved as a gravel road from Oxon Hill south to Carey Branch south of Oxon Hill by 1921. By 1923, the highway extended south to Fort Washington Road at what was then the village of Silesia. That same year, another section of Livingston Road was graveled from the CharlesPrince George's county line southwest through Pomonkey to Mason Springs. The northern section of Livingston Road was extended south from Silesia to Old Fort Road between 1924 and 1926. <b>The</b> <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> was extended from there to Piscataway between 1926 and 1928. MD 224 was extended south to Accokeek by 1930. The final piece of Livingston Road from Accokeek to the CharlesPrince George's county line was graveled starting in 1930 and completed by 1933.|$|E

[...] The road, {{established}} by 1692, connected Point Lookout and northern St. Mary's County along the drainage divide between the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. [...] The Patuxent Main Road later became known as the Three Notch Road based on a 1704 law that stated [...] "three notches of equal distance marked on the trees indicated a road leading to a ferry." [...] The whereabouts of the ferry to which this road led are unknown. [...] After 200 years of little improvement, reconstruction of the Three Notch Road by the Maryland State Roads Commission began in 1923 when the highway was rebuilt as a [...] wide gravel road from MD5 near Mechanicsville south to MD472 in Oakville.

[...] A gravel road traversing the chenier was constructed in the mid-1930s, {{but it was never}} connected with the rest of Route 292. [...] Both it and the direct connection to Intracoastal City disappeared from highway maps during the following decade. [...] The settlement of Chenier Au Tigre is now mostly abandoned.

40|$|Runoff and {{sediment}} loss from forest roads were monitored for {{a two-year period}} in a Pinus plantation in southeast Queensland. Two classes of road were investigated: a <b>gravelled</b> <b>road,</b> which {{is used as a}} primary daily haulage route for the logging area, and an ungravelled road, which provides the main access route for individual logging compartments and is intensively used as a haulage route only during the harvest of these areas (approximately every 30 years).
