5|$|The art {{direction}} for the 1988 release was instead put {{in the hands of}} CBS Records' art director Arnold Levine and his staff. They based the cover art on a fin de siècle image of the Cliff House, a restaurant perched on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco, California, built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907. The back cover is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors.|$|E

However, the design was altered slightly by graphic designer Rachel Gutek of the design company guppyart. This release contains an expanded booklet written by music journalist Max Bell giving the background to the album. The booklet contains a number of photographs which are credited to Sergeant and Pattinson.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how a spatial soliton can exist, {{we have to make}} some considerations about a simple convex lens. As shown in <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, an optical field approaches the lens and then it is focused. The effect of the lens is to introduce a non-uniform phase change that causes focusing. This phase change {{is a function of the}} space and can be represented with , whose shape is approximately represented in the picture.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{experiencing}} hemimicropsia often {{complain that}} objects in their {{left or right}} visual field appear to be shrunken or compressed. They may also have difficulty appreciating the symmetry of pictures. When drawing, patients often {{have a tendency to}} compensate for their perceptual asymmetry by drawing the left or right half of objects slightly larger than the other. In a case of one person with hemimicropsia asked to draw six symmetrical objects, the size of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left half was on average 16% larger than the corresponding right half.|$|E

Two of the men are {{holding on to the}} player with the ball (blue jersey) as if a tackle is imminent. In contrast to the impending violence of the sport, Gleizes has painted flowers along with some cubic shapes toward the bottom right of <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> bottom left is a man, possibly a fallen player, holding {{what appears to be a}} round shaped item in his hand. Spectators are seen toward the upper right, while to the left, in the background, Gleizes has painted a town, a bridge and bellowing clouds or smoke.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{right was}} {{published}} in Zurich in 1563, in Conrad Gesner's Thierbuch (a compendium of animals) with the captions: 'Englischen Blüthund' and 'Canis Sagax Sanguinarius apud Anglos' (English scent hound with associations of blood). It was drawn by, or under the supervision of, John Caius, and sent to Gesner with other drawings to illustrate his descriptions of British dogs for European readers. It is thus the earliest known picture published specifically to demonstrate {{the appearance of the}} Bloodhound. We are told it was done from life, and detail such as the soft hang of the ear indicates it was carefully observed. Fully accurate or not, it suggests changes between the Bloodhound of then and today. The collar and long coiled rope reflect the Bloodhound’s typical functions as a limer or leashed man-trailer in that period.|$|E
25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.|$|E
500|$|Addition (often {{signified}} by the plus symbol [...] "+") {{is one of}} the four basic operations of arithmetic, with the others being subtraction, multiplication and division. The addition of two whole numbers is the total amount of those quantities combined. For example, in <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, there is a combination of three apples and two apples together, making a total of five apples. This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression [...] i.e., [...] "3 add 2 is equal to 5".|$|E

500|$|Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and {{had set up}} his own darkroom. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{photographic}} plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, {{and that she had}} spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a [...] gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be [...] "nothing but a prank", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic.|$|E
500|$|The band {{released}} {{their first}} single [...] "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] on small independent record label, Backbeat records, {{on a limited}} run of 500. In October 1994 the single was re-released on the Parlophone label and reached number 43 in the UK Singles Chart, but failed to chart in the US. Supergrass released their debut full-length album I Should Coco in May 1995. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK Albums Chart. I Should Coco led the band to receive four newcomer awards in the year the album was released. [...] "Alright" [...] was released from the album, which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. This is the highest chart position the band have gained with a single except for [...] "Richard III" [...] from In It for the Money. In It for the Money, which was the first album to be produced entirely by Supergrass peaked at number two in the UK Albums Chart. Their third self-titled album Supergrass, often referred to as [...] "the X-ray" [...] album due to <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sleeve, peaked at number three in the UK Albums Chart.
