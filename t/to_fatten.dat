5|$|In ancient Egypt, cattle {{were the}} most {{important}} livestock, and sheep, goats, and pigs were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Honey bees were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up {{a large proportion of the}} diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|Semi-intensive farming {{corresponds}} <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> of ovine, bovine, caprine, porcine. It is {{the most}} dominant, due mainly {{to the lack of}} space and the predominance of the fattening of livestock farrow.|$|R
40|$|An {{existence}} and uniqueness result, up <b>to</b> <b>fattening,</b> for crystalline mean curvature flows with forcing and arbitrary (convex) mobilities, is proven. This {{is achieved by}} introducing a new notion of solution to the corresponding level set formulation. Such a solution satisfies the comparison principle and a stability property {{with respect to the}} approximation by suitably regularized problems. The results are valid in any dimension and for arbitrary, possibly unbounded, initial closed sets. The approach accounts for the possible presence of a time-dependent bounded forcing term, with spatial Lipschitz continuity. As a by-product of the analysis, the problem of the convergence of the Almgren-Taylor-Wang minimizing movements scheme to a unique (up <b>to</b> <b>fattening)</b> "flat flow" in the case of general, possibly crystalline, anisotropies is settled...|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} (i) {{describing}} Campylobacter excretion by conventional pigs in field conditions from sows <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> pigs, and (ii) assessing {{the role of}} the environment as a source of pig contamination. Five sows and six piglets per sow were individidually followed in two farrow-to-finish farms...|$|R
5|$|The Egyptians {{believed}} that a balanced relationship between people and animals was {{an essential element of}} the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole. Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E
25|$|Indiana {{is located}} within the U.S. Corn Belt and Grain Belt. The state has a feedlot-style system raising corn <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> hogs and cattle. Along with corn, {{soybeans}} are also a major cash crop. Its proximity to large urban centers, such as Indianapolis and Chicago, assure that dairying, egg production, and specialty horticulture occur.|$|E
40|$|Reports {{from several}} {{experiment}} stations have aroused {{much interest in}} the value of “steam processing” or “flaking” grain for beef cattle. During the process, some gelatinization or cooking of the grain occurs. This trial studied the addition of various amounts of completely gelatinized sorghum grain <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> steers rations...|$|R
40|$|Animal fats {{often are}} added {{in small amounts}} (1 - 2 %) to mixed {{commercial}} feeds primarily to reduce dustiness and to lubricate machinery. High-energy poultry rations often contain higher levels of animal fat. This test was conducted to obtain more information on fat’s value when added <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> lamb rations...|$|R
25|$|The {{practice}} of goose fattening spread from Egypt to the Mediterranean. The earliest reference <b>to</b> <b>fattened</b> geese {{is from the}} 5th century BC Greek poet Cratinus, who wrote of geese-fatteners, yet Egypt maintained its reputation as the source for fattened geese. When the Spartan king Agesilaus visited Egypt in 361 BC, he noted Egyptian farmers' fattened geese and calves.|$|R
25|$|Neel {{proposed}} that a genetic predisposition to develop diabetes was adaptive to the feast and famine cycles of paleolithic human existence, allowing humans <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> rapidly and profoundly {{during times of}} feast in order that they might better survive during times of famine. This would have been advantageous then {{but not in the}} current environment.|$|E
25|$|In Bangladesh, child prostitutes {{are known}} to take the drug Oradexon, an {{over-the-counter}} steroid, usually used by farmers <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> cattle, to make child prostitutes look larger and older. Charities say that 90% of prostitutes in the country’s legalized brothels use the drug. According to social activists, the steroid can cause diabetes, {{high blood pressure and}} is highly addictive.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the fifth}} {{experiment}} in this series conducted to determine the value of added trace minerals in a typical cattle-fattening ration. The four previous experiments are reported in Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station Circulars 279, 308, 335, and 358. No response has been obtained when trace minerals were added to high roughage rations of sorghum silage, sorghum grain and a protein concentrate, or <b>to</b> a <b>fattening</b> ration or sorghum grain, prairie hay, and a protein concentrate. Improved performance has been obtained when trace minerals were added <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> rations of corn, prairie hay, and a protein concentrate. Ground limestone has been fed in all the <b>fattening</b> trials <b>to</b> furnish adequate calcium...|$|R
50|$|Horses thrive {{very well}} on common vetch, {{even better than}} on clover and rye grass; the same applies <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> cattle, which feed faster on vetch than on most grasses or other edible plants. Danger often arises from {{livestock}} eating too much vetch, especially when podded; colics and other stomach disorders are apt to be produced by the excessive amounts devoured.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{existence}} and uniqueness result, up <b>to</b> <b>fattening,</b> {{for a class}} of crystalline mean curvature flows with natural mobility is proved. The results are valid in any dimension and for arbitrary, possibly un-bounded, initial closed sets. The comparison principle is obtained {{by means of a}} suitable weak formulation of the flow, while the existence of a global-in-time solution follows via a minimizing movements approach...|$|R
25|$|Some {{techniques}} of intensive agriculture may be cruel to animals: foie gras is a food product {{made from the}} liver of ducks or geese that have been force fed corn <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> the organ; veal is criticised because the veal calves may be highly restricted in movement, have unsuitable flooring, spend their entire lives indoors, experience prolonged deprivation (sensory, social, and exploratory), and be more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.|$|E
25|$|Chestnut was {{the most}} popular wood since its logs could be used to build cabins and rail fences to protect crops from wild animals. It could easily be split into {{shingles}} for roofs to cover cabins and barns. Its bark was used to make medicine and tannic acid for tanning and dyeing. In the fall, its rich nuts were used <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> razorback hogs for the market and the home. Hemlock was also highly valued for its many uses.|$|E
25|$|According to the hypothesis, the 'thrifty' {{genotype}} {{would have}} been advantageous for hunter-gatherer populations, especially child-bearing women, because it would allow them <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> more quickly during times of abundance. Fatter individuals carrying the thrifty genes would thus better survive times of food scarcity. However, in modern societies with a constant abundance of food, this genotype efficiently prepares individuals for a famine that never comes. The result of this mismatch between {{the environment in which}} the brain evolved and the environment of today is widespread chronic obesity and related health problems like diabetes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{derived from}} the Introduction section of the thesis: The present {{investigation}} does not enter into a general consideration of the histology or voluntary striated muscle but is confined to a few phases of the subject. The occurrence of fat in the muscle fiber will be considered in some detail. Some observations bearing on the changes in striated muscle incident <b>to</b> <b>fattening,</b> growth, and inanition will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of particle bursts, a well-known feature of PSO is investigated. Their origin is concluded {{to lie in}} multiplicative stochasticity, previously encountered {{in the study of}} first order stochastic difference equations. The work here demonstrates that bursts contribute <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> of the tail of the particle position distribution and that these tails are well described by power laws. It is argued that recombinant PSO, a competitive PSO variant without multiplicative randomness, is burst-free. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
40|$|One {{problem the}} beef cattle {{industry}} currently faces is the apparent insufficiency of the beef cattle to convert feed into weight gain. The {{purpose of this}} experiment was to study {{the effect of a}} supplemental enzyme preparation and gelatinized corn when fed <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> cattle in order to obtain information which might aid in understanding the previously mentioned problem. Two areas of study were organized in the research investigations (1) fattening trials with cattle and (2) in vivo studies of rumen fermentation. Advisor: Walter Wood...|$|R
25|$|Creise {{along with}} Meall a' Bhuiridh, Stob Ghabhar and Stob a' Choire Odhair {{is one of}} the four Black Mount Munros, it reaches a height of 1100 metres (3609feet) and is a hill that is well known to skiers as well as walkers being {{situated}} next to the White Corries ski area from where it is often climbed along with adjoining Meall a' Bhuiridh. The two mountains are a popular traverse with cross-country skiers. The mountain is well seen from the A82 road and the Kings House Hotel, showing its steep and craggy northern buttress of Sròn na Creise. For many years the translated meaning of the mountains name from the Gaelic was unknown, however Irvine Butterfield now says that “creis” means grease or fat and refers to the rich grazing land around the hill which was used in the past by Glen Coe herdsman <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> their cattle.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Henry Blanc was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} director of the French National Stud, and began the conversion of French draft breeds into animals bred for slaughter into horse meat. The stud encouraged farmers who could no longer find buyers for their animals <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> them for resale to the slaughter markets. Breeding {{for the production of}} meat helped to safeguard the Auxois breed by keeping its gene pool intact, but also transformed the previously powerful breed into one bred solely for weight— the main consideration in pricing at slaughter. In 1976, an official French decree changed the name of the category in which the Auxois fit from [...] "draft horses" [...] to [...] "heavy horses" [...] and encouraged farmers to select the heaviest breeding stallions possible, to increase the average weight of the breed. The National Stud approved this change, and between the 1950s and the 1980s, the average weight of the Auxois increased from [...] to [...] or more.|$|E
500|$|China— The Chinese {{get only}} one {{explorer}} (a Shaolin monk) {{along with a}} weak disciple {{at the start of}} the game. Chinese monks and disciples have the ability to occasionally land critical hits, doing extra damage. The Chinese monk is the only Asian hero who can train military units (disciples) during the Discovery Age and has the largest number of attack points compared to any other monk or explorer. The Chinese monk also has the unique ability to convert enemy units defeated by him into disciples, although the chances are low. The Chinese have a higher population limit than all the other civilizations; up to 220 population points, rather than the usual 200. However, to reach this cap, several upgrades must be made. Additionally, their military units are trained in blocks, much like the Russians, except that each block is made up by several types of troops, meaning when the player creates a [...] "block" [...] they receive a technically combat-ready force. The Chinese build villages rather than houses or shrines. Villages can garrison villagers and livestock given to them tasked <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> more quickly. These villages also supply 20 population. Their Home City is Beijing and their leader is the Kangxi Emperor.|$|E

50|$|Impelled by restlessness Sinbad {{takes to}} the seas again and, as usual, is shipwrecked. The naked savages amongst whom he finds himself feed his companions a herb which robs them of their reason (Burton theorises {{that this might be}} bhang), prior <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> them for the table. Sinbad realises what is happening, and refuses to eat the madness-inducing plant. When the cannibals have lost {{interest}} in him, he escapes. A party of itinerant pepper-gatherers transports him to their own island, where their king befriends him and gives him a beautiful and wealthy wife.|$|R
40|$|Livestock production, and {{especially}} beef production, {{has a major}} impact on the environment. Environmental impacts, however, vary largely among beef systems. Understanding these differences is crucial to mitigate impacts of future global beef production. The objective of this research, therefore, was to compare cradle-to-farm-gate environmental impacts of beef produced in contrasting systems. We reviewed 14 studies that compared contrasting systems using life cycle assessment (LCA). Systems studied were classified by three main characteristics of beef production: origin of calves (bred by a dairy cow or a suckler cow), type of production (organic or non-organic) and type of diet fed <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> calves...|$|R

2500|$|Since {{their initial}} {{domestication}} by people, pigeons {{have been seen}} as a cheap source of good meat. [...] The Romans certainly kept pigeons for food as evidenced {{by the fact that they}} were familiar with the practice of force feeding squabs in order <b>to</b> <b>fatten</b> the young pigeons faster. Pigeons were especially prized because they would produce fresh meat during the winter months when larger animals were unavailable as a food source. [...] In the past wealthy landowners often had pigeon houses and kept pigeons. [...] Strict laws were enacted to protect the inhabitants of these structures.|$|E

Over $19 billion during the prior 18 years to 2013 was spent to incent farmers to grow these crops, raising the price of fruits and vegetables by about 40% and lowering the price of dairy and other animal products. Little land is used for fruit and vegetable farming.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was <b>to</b> compare the <b>fattening</b> and carcass traits of lambs which were {{produced}} by two-way and three-way crossbreeding studies with KÝvÝrcÝk sheep, the predominant breed in the Marmara region, Chios sheep, the most prolific breed in the region and German Black-Headed Mutton (GBM) which {{has been found to be}} the mutton breed which exhibits the best adaptation to the environmental conditions of the Marmara region. It was determined that two-way and three-way crossbred lambs were similar with regard <b>to</b> <b>fattening</b> and carcass traits, and both showed better performance than KÝvÝrcÝk lambs. The crossbred lambs exhibited faster weight gain and consumed less feed per unit weight gain during the fattening program, yielding better quality carcasses than the KÝvÝrcÝk lambs. With this study, it was concluded that the meat production of lambs could be increased by the use of GBM rams and two-way or three-way crossbreeding studies in the region...|$|R
