5|$|Seemingly gone forever, another Scarlet member {{known as}} Xi-Tiger {{took control of}} the organization. Under his rule, Scarlet became too brutal even for themselves, and they called for Epsilon to reclaim his position. More or less {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} group, Xi sought to find and assassinate Epsilon himself. He planned an attack on an A-Human research laboratory, where children with special abilities had been kidnapped and experimented on. Upon arriving, Xi-Tiger sensed the presence of Epsilon in one of the boys. However, he was unsure because he couldn't pinpoint the evil from Epsilon, who had entered the boy's body and was now living as a parasite. Xi-Tiger took a young girl hostage and threatened to kill her unless Epsilon revealed himself. The boy flew into a rage and morphed his body into Epsilon himself. Xi seemed to sense <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> power, and in fear, killed the girl and fled. Epsilon had completely split his dual personality apart; with both good and evil Epsilons now chasing after Xi-Tiger.|$|E
25|$|Finnmark is {{situated}} in the Aurora Borealis zone, {{and because of the}} dry climate with frequent clear skies, Alta Municipality was early chosen as a location for the study of <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> light phenomenon. For this reason, Alta is sometimes referred to as the city of the northern lights.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a lake will {{disappear}} quickly. On 3 June 2005, in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia, a lake called Lake Beloye vanished {{in a matter}} of minutes. News sources reported that government officials theorized that <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> phenomenon may have been caused by a shift in the soil underneath the lake that allowed its water to drain through channels leading to the Oka River.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the miracles}} {{mentioned}} in the Quran is that Jesus, while still in the cradle, spoke out to protect his mother Mary from any accusations people may have placed on her due to having a child without a father. When she was approached about <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> incident after her childbirth, Mary merely pointed to Jesus, and he miraculously spoke, just as God had promised her upon annunciation.|$|E
25|$|This bizarre {{method of}} {{insemination}} probably evolved as male bed bugs competed {{with each other}} to place their sperm {{closer and closer to the}} mother lode of eggs, the ovaries. Some male insects evolved long penises with which they enter the vagina but bypass the female's storage pouch and deposit their sperm further upstream close to the ovaries. A few males, notably among bed bugs, evolved traumatic insemination instead, and eventually <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> procedure became the norm among these insects.|$|E
25|$|Going towards high dilutions {{good results}} have been found using liquid {{membrane}} cells, it has been possible to investigate aqueous media 10−4 M {{and it has been}} found that for 1:1 electrolytes (as NaCl or KCl) the Debye–Hückel equation is totally correct, but for 2:2 or 3:2 electrolytes it is possible to find negative deviation from the Debye–Hückel limit law: <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> behavior can be observed only in the very dilute area, and in more concentrate regions the deviation becomes positive.|$|E

25|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American slasher film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. The film stars Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Amanda Wyss, Jsu Garcia, Robert Englund, and Johnny Depp in his feature film debut. The plot revolves around four teenagers who are stalked and killed in their dreams (and thus killed in reality) by Freddy Krueger. The teenagers are unaware of the cause of <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> phenomenon, but their parents hold a dark secret from long ago.|$|E
25|$|Much {{paper has}} been {{consumed}} by historians of science ruminating on <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> and somewhat unclear idea. Huxley {{was wrong to}} pitch the loss of orders in the Phanerozoic as low as 7%, {{and he did not}} estimate the number of new orders which evolved. Persistent types sat rather uncomfortably next to Darwin's more fluid ideas; despite his intelligence, it took Huxley a surprisingly long time to appreciate some of the implications of evolution. However, gradually Huxley moved away from this conservative style of thinking as his understanding of palaeontology, and the discipline itself, developed.|$|E
25|$|After Lord Shiva {{had come}} out of his meditation,he wanted to go and see Parvati but found himself being stopped by <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> boy. Shiva tried to reason with the boy saying that he was Parvati's husband but the boy did not listen and was {{determined}} to not let Shiva enter till his mother Goddess Parvati finished her bath. The boy's behaviour surprised Shiva. Sensing that this was no ordinary boy, the usually peaceful Shiva decided he would have to fight the boy and in his divine fury severed the boy's head with his Trishul thereby killing him instantly.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Cuvier and Blumenbach, Samuel Thomas von Soemmering interpreted Collini's fossil as a mammal. Specifically, he interpreted {{it as an}} unusual bat, which morphologically linked mammals with birds. He named <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> creature Ornithocephalus. Soemmering may have interpreted this series of forms in an evolutionary sense, following the early evolutionary ideas of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck. Soemmering's analysis of the specimen was blemished by anatomical errors, like the misidentifications of bones. Soemmering agreed with Cuvier that the creature was a flying insectivore, however. Soemmering argued that pterosaurs walked on all fours like bats when on the ground. His advocacy for this interpretation of pterosaur terrestrial gait has been regarded {{as the beginning of}} a multi-century debate on the subject.|$|E
25|$|It {{was here}} that Carl started {{composing}} his first songs {{with an eye toward}} the future. Watching the dance floor at all times for a reaction, working out a more rhythmically driving style of music that was neither country nor blues, but had elements of both, Perkins kept reshaping these loosely structured songs until he had a completed composition, which would then be finally put to paper. Carl was already sending demos to New York record companies, who kept rejecting him, sometimes explaining that <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> new style of country with a pronounced rhythm fit no current commercial trend. That would change in 1955 after recording the song 'Blue Suede Shoes' (recorded 19 December 1955). Later made more famous by Elvis Presley, Perkins' original version was an early rock 'n' roll standard.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} part of the 1989 season, the team had to prequalify - a task that was nearly never {{achieved}} by Gabriele Tarquini and Yannick Dalmas. AGS then finished 15th in the Constructors' Championship, equal with the Lolas used by the Larrousse team. During the summer months, there were strong rumours that AGS would soon use a new W12 engine developed by the French designer Guy Nègre. <b>This</b> <b>strange</b> MGN (Moteurs Guy Nègre) machine saw the light of day in late 1988 and was tested in an old AGS JH22 chassis in the summer of 1989. It was clear that AGS was not related to these tests; they were completely private attempts by Nègre. The engine never found its way to a Grand Prix but it was announced to be used in a 1990 Le Mans car called Norma M6. The car was presented and attempted to race, but failed to qualify over engine issues.|$|E

25|$|According to the Cornerstone exposé, Rivera had a 'history {{of legal}} entanglements' {{including}} fraud, credit card theft, and writing bad checks. Warrants had been issued {{for his arrest}} in New Jersey and Florida, and he was wanted by the Spanish police for 'swindles and cheats'. While in the U.S. in 1967, he claimed to be collecting money for a Spanish college, which never received this money. The details of his religious claims changed over time. For example, in 1964 he claimed that {{he had left the}} Catholic Church in July 1952. Rivera later put the date at March 20, 1967 - an almost 15 year discrepancy. Despite this second claim of conversion from Catholicism in March 1967, Rivera was still promoting Catholicism in a newspaper interview of August that same year. Although supposedly placed involuntarily in the sanatorium where he claimed to have nearly been murdered in 1965 and held there for three months, he gave the date of his release as September 1967. This leaves a period of more than a year unaccounted for in <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> narrative.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger {{once did}} {{gorgeous}} mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that {{an effect of}} vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we have noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque {{as if they had}} been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.|$|E

500|$|In {{his writing}} Chatwin experimented with format. With In Patagonia, Clapp said Chatwin {{described}} the book's structure of 97 vignettes as [...] "Cubist." [...] "n other words," [...] she said, [...] "lots of small pictures tilting away and {{toward each other}} to create <b>this</b> <b>strange</b> original portrait of Patagonia." [...] The Songlines was another attempt by Chatwin to experiment with format. The book begins as a novel narrated {{by a man named}} Bruce but about two-thirds of the way through it becomes a commonplace book filled with quotations, anecdotes, and summaries of others' research in an attempt to explore human restlessness. Some of Chatwin's critics did not think he succeeded in The Songlines with this approach, although others applauded his effort at trying an unconventional structure.|$|E
500|$|J. P. Earwaker {{heavily criticized}} {{the design of}} the {{accordion}} experiment as it took place under a dining room table.

[...] He also wrote [...] "it never occurred to [...] to notice whether the keys were depressed or not... it would be obvious that if the keys were not pressed down, it was impossible for the music really to have come from the accordion, and its true source must have been looked for elsewhere." ...|$|R
