5|$|In transcription, the codons {{of a gene}} are copied into {{messenger}} RNA by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome <b>that</b> <b>reads</b> the RNA sequence by base-pairing {{the messenger}} RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying {{the end of the}} coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque <b>that</b> <b>reads</b> I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn. I try to improvise. What comes out is what I feel.|$|E
5|$|De sacramento altaris, {{dealing with}} the eucharist and passover, is Baldwin's longest {{surviving}} work, in 12manuscripts. It also includes a discussion of martyrdom <b>that</b> <b>reads</b> much like a vindication of Becket's status as a martyr. It was first printed in 1662, and has more recently been edited and published in the series Sources Chrétiennes, as volumes 93 and 94, in 1963. Others works include 22 sermons, and a work on faith, De commendatione fidei, that only survives in two manuscripts, although another five {{are known to have}} existed. One of the missing manuscripts survived until at least the mid-1600s, as it formed the basis of the first printed edition of De commendatione fidei in 1662. The modern critical edition of De commendatione was published, along with the sermons, in 1991 as Balduini de Forda Opera: Sermones, De Commendatione Fidei. with the De commendatione fidei translated into English in 2000.|$|E

50|$|Scholars assume <b>that</b> <b>reading</b> aloud (Latin clare legere) was {{the more}} common {{practice}} in antiquity, and <b>that</b> <b>reading</b> silently (legere tacite or legere sibi) was unusual.

5|$|The video {{starts with}} a coin dropped onto ground after which a title card <b>that</b> <b>reads</b> Roberts' name and the track title is shown. As the title changes color, Roberts walks and skips down a New York City street wearing a floral T-shirt dress. Effects are placed on Roberts' with sperm cells graffitied on it shadow her {{movement}} with neon colors and throughout becomes increasingly prominent, and during the second verse Roberts performs a short dance movement with two back-up dancers before she walks past a wall with sperm graffitied on it, which also changes to multiple neon colours. As the video progresses, Roberts interacts with buildings and objects, such as New York style newspaper dispensers and following this her entire body has effects placed upon it as she changes color and shades and the last frames of the video show {{more of the same}} effects and finally shows a frame of a New York street with Roberts walking out of the frame before the camera moves upwards to show a purple sky.|$|E

Female officers wear a black bowler hat with Sillitoe tartan banding for foot patrol and mobile patrol.

25|$|The {{principal}} facade includes to bell {{towers and}} {{is divided into}} three floors decorated in cornice. The towers, are delimited by a central section with pilasters, corresponding to the lateral corps and surmounted by bulbous copulas over octagonal base. There are four sections on all floors, with the last one occupied by the belfry. The central part, corresponds to the nave, and there are three sections per floor (with the doorways on the ground floor decorated in archways) and surmounted by a cut frontispiece with decorated tympanum. There is an inscription on the archway entrance to the left part of the church, <b>that</b> <b>reads</b> 1838.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceiling of}} the apse is {{decorated}} with three stucco reliefs depicting the conversion of Paul the Apostle, calling of Saint Peter, and handing over of the keys of Heaven and papal tiara to Peter by Christ. This scene emphasizes that Peter and subsequent popes derived their power directly from God and is a strong Counter-Reformation statement. Above them, there is a relief of the Holy Spirit represented as a dove. The {{ceiling of the}} choir has a relief of the dinner at Emmaus. Next to it, there is a Latin inscription <b>that</b> <b>reads</b> domus dei aedificata est supra firmam petram (your house is built on firm rock) which echoes with the inscription {{on the base of}} the dome.|$|E

25|$|Entering Thai-registered vehicles, {{which use}} the Thai script for series letters and the {{province}} of registration on their number plates, are required to bear strips {{on the front and}} back that translate the plate information into a row of Romanised script (including the corresponding series prefix and 4-digit number, and the province in its official 3-letter abbreviation), resulting in a format <b>that</b> <b>reads</b> as AB 1234 PTN or 1AB 1234 BKK. Although the general practice is to use white characters on black, stickers with colour schemes that resemble their original plate colours may also be acceptable; stickers that emulate the layout and colour of the Thai plates have also been known to be used.|$|E
25|$|The text {{generally}} {{consists of}} two side-by-side pages: one of the Aramaic/Hebrew Vilna Edition text, and the corresponding page consists of an English translation. The English translation has a bolded literal translation of the Talmud's text, but also includes un-bolded text clarifying the literal translation. (The original Talmud's text is often very unclear, referring to places, times, people, and laws {{that it does not}} explain. The un-bolded text attempts to explain these situations. The text of the Talmud also contains few prepositions, articles, etc. The un-bolded text takes the liberty of inserting these parts of speech.) The result is an English text <b>that</b> <b>reads</b> in full sentences with full explanations, while allowing the reader to distinguish between direct translation and a more liberal approach to the translation. (This also results in one page of the Vilna Talmud requiring several pages of English translation.) Below the English translation appear extensive notes including diagrams.|$|E
25|$|Records of the {{excavations}} and the finds {{exist in}} Woodford's letters to his brother, Alexander, which were {{preserved in the}} Nachlaß of the English politician Roger Newdigate (1719-1806). These letters also include illustrations of certain finds, namely a coin and an arrow-head. Alongside the discoveries, there is also thought to have existed a diary, although it is suspected {{this may have been}} lost in a fire at an establishment on Belgrave Square called the Pantechnicon, which gave its name to the van, in 1874 or 1876. Whilst excavating, Woodford received considerable hostility from the local French, who considered Woodford to be desecrating the graves of the war-dead in order to conduct a celebration commemorating the English victory. This appears to have been little but spin, as the letters highlight Woodford's intention to re-bury any dead which he found in consecrated ground - this he did, as there is reported to be several dead from Azincourt buried in the local church under an etching in the wall <b>that</b> <b>reads</b> '1838'.|$|E
