I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the supporters for many generations.|$|E

500|$|Three novels were {{published}} on October 1, 2002: one by Aspect and two by Little, Brown Young Readers. The Aspect novel (Smallville: Strange Visitors) {{was written by}} Roger Stern, with Clark and his friends trying to uncover the truth about two religious con men who {{set up shop in}} Smallville and use kryptonite in their spiritual seminars to rob the townspeople. Little, Brown Young Readers first published Arrival by Michael Teitelbaum, chronicling the series' pilot. The second novel (See No Evil, by series writers Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld) follows Dawn Mills, a young actress who wants to attend Juilliard. Dawn, who can become invisible, wants to get revenge on <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> talking behind her back but is stopped by Clark. See No Evil was one of the original storylines for season one's [...] "Shimmer".|$|E
500|$|En route, he is robbed and his {{illumination}} taken. Francis {{completes the}} journey to New Rome and is granted an audience with the Pope, who was modeled after Pope John XXIII. Francis presents the Pope with the remaining documents, and the Pope comforts Francis by giving him gold with which to ransom back the illumination; however, Francis is killed during his return trip {{by a group of}} [...] "The Pope's Children" [...] (an affectionate name for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so severely affected by the genetic mutation caused by radiation that they are subhuman in both intelligence and capacity for reason), receiving an arrow in the face. The Wanderer discovers and buries Francis' body.

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E
