For mathematical description of encoding, decoding, error detection and error correction is used algebra of polynomials. Findings.

40|$|This paper explores a spectrally efficient, {{variable}} rate transmission scheme under a service outage constraint for a block fading channel model. The service outage constraint {{is motivated by}} real time {{variable rate}} applications. In a service outage, the <b>transmission</b> <b>code</b> rate is below a given basic rate and {{may in fact be}} zero. Unlike an information outage in the capacity versus outage problem, asymptotically error free communication is maintained during a service outage. We solve the problem of maximizing the time average <b>transmission</b> <b>code</b> rate subject to the probability of service outage being sufficiently small. When the problem is feasible, the optimum power policy is shown to be a combination of water filling and channel inversion allocations. The optimum power allocation for delay limited capacity, capacity versus outage, and ergodic capacity are special cases of this optimum scheme. Numerical results for the Rayleigh fading channel are given...|$|E
