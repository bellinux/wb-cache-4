40|$|Abstract—The SMARTGRID {{has come}} to {{describe}} a next-generation electrical power system that is typified by the in-creased use of communications and information technology in the generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption of electrical energy. All around the world, utility companies are integrating power plants in order to balance energy availability {{and be able to}} adapt to variations in consumption demands. As on the start-points of the energy chain, the intelligent end-points (i. e., SMARTHOMES, SMARTBUILDINGS) can decrease their energy footprint as they become able to reduce power, use alternative power sources, or schedule their energy demands to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>benefit</b> from energy’s availability and cost. From a computer systems perspective, these buildings have become complex, embedded distributed systems, once they must adapt themselves to variations on energy availability and demands, and, in order to do that, they must rely on distributed sensors and actuation points. This paper describes the approach used to auto-mate UFSC’s first SMARTBUILDING. An overview of the building shows design decisions, with a special focus on the automation network technologies, topology, and control applications. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the IEA 40 {{research}} project, a specification of a ?Functional Test Procedure? was progressively developed using the CA-MET building in Namur as real size test bench for the application and validation of the procedure. The target system is a typical VAV system devoted to the ventilation, cooling and air conditioning functions. The procedure consists in a series of operations to be applied to the system, considered as a set of connected components and taking into account the following constraints: 1) time availability 2) intrinsic limitations of the system 3) reference performances. The proposed procedure is divided in two sets of actions: 1) a number of preliminary actions allowing to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>benefit</b> of <b>the</b> subsequent phases: a) identification of available measurement points b) identification of actuators characteristics c) identification of control strategies d) aeraulic network calculations e) selection of measurement techniques and experimental design 2) the verification tasks themselves: The philosophy of the verification process is to bring the system into a number of states which allowed each specific check to be carried out. The organisation of the procedure tries to optimize the time spent for commissioning by logically sequencing the operations according to the following order: 1) test in manual (ie not controlled by the BEMS) operation 2) test in manual (ie not controlled by the BEMS) stop 3) test in normal operation 4) test at maximum flowrate 5) test at minimum flowrate 6) test in automatic stop The paper will provide the specific operations to be carried out at each step and will illustrate the whole process with the prototyping work performed on the CA-MET building in Namur...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{inverted}} pendulum {{has gained}} momentum {{over the last}} decade on a number of robotic laboratories over the world; due to its unstable proprieties is a good example for control engineers to verify a control theory. To verify that the pendulum can balance we can make some simulations using a closed-loop controller method such as the linear quadratic regulator or the proportional–integral–derivative method. Also the idea of robotic teleoperation is gaining ground. Controlling a robot at a distance and doing that precisely. However, designing <b>the</b> tool to <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>benefit</b> of <b>the</b> human skills while keeping the error minimal is interesting, and {{due to the fact that}} the inverted pendulum is an unstable system it makes a compelling test case for exploring dynamic teleoperation. Therefore this thesis focuses on the construction of a two-wheel inverted pendulum robot, which sensor we can use to do that, how they must be integrated in the system and how we can use a human to control an inverted pendulum. The inverted pendulum robot developed employs technology like sensors, actuators and controllers. This Master thesis starts by presenting an introduction to inverted pendulums and some information about related areas such as control theory. It continues by describing related work in this area. Then we describe the mathematical model of a two-wheel inverted pendulum and a simulation made in Matlab. We also focus in the construction of this type of robot and its working theory. Because this is a mobile robot we address the theme of the teleoperation and finally this thesis finishes with a general conclusion and ideas of future work. Orientador: Ian Oakle...|$|R
40|$|As data {{acquisition}} has become relatively easy and inexpensive, data sets are becoming extremely large, {{both in the}} number of variables and {{in the number of}} instances. However, the same is not true for "labeled" instances. Usually unlabeled data represent the majority of instances. Using such data requires special care, since several problems arise with the dimensionality increase and the lack of labels. Reducing the size of the data is thus a primordial need. In this context, the application of a semi-supervised approach is very suitable, where one can try to <b>take</b> advantage of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>benefits</b> that each type of data has to offer. The problem can be addressed in the context of feature clustering, grouping similar variables, or through a multi-objective approach, since we have arguments that clearly establish its multi-objective nature. In the first approach, a similarity measure based on mutual information, capable to take into account both the labeled and unlabeled data, is developed. The principle of homogeneity between labels and data clusters is also exploited and two semi-supervised feature selection methods are developed. Finally a mutual information estimator for a mixed set of discrete and continuous variables is developed as a secondary contribution. In the multi-objective approach, the proposal is try to solve both the problem of feature selection and function approximation, at the same time. The proposed method includes considering different weight vector norms for each layer of a MLP neural network, the independent training of each layer and the definition of objective functions that are able to eliminate irrelevant features.
