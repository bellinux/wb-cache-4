5|$|Once, Veda {{left his}} ashram (hermitage), entrusting {{all of the}} {{administrative}} duties to Uttanka. Veda's wife was then in her menstrual period. The women of the ashram urged Uttanka to cohabit with her so that her fertility period would not be wasted, but Uttanka refused <b>to</b> <b>oblige</b> as he was duty bound to his guru and he considered the act immoral. When this episode was conveyed to Veda upon {{his return to the}} ashram, he was pleased with his disciple and blessed Uttanka.|$|E

5|$|Hosni Mubarak succeeded Sadat as President of Egypt {{following}} Sadat's assassination in 1981. While al-Azhar {{would continue}} <b>to</b> <b>oblige</b> {{the government in}} granting a religious legitimacy to its dictates, the mosque and its clergy were given more autonomy under Mubarak's regime. Under Jad al-Haq, the sheikh of al-Azhar from 1982 {{until his death in}} 1994, al-Azhar asserted its independence from the state, at times criticizing policies of the state for instigating extremist Islamist sects. Al-Haq argued that if the government wished al-Azhar to effectively combat groups such as al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya then al-Azhar must be permitted greater independence from the state and for it to be allowed to make religious declarations without interference. Under Mubarak, a number of powers of the state were ceded to al-Azhar. During the 1990s, modifications to existing censorship laws gave al-Azhar the ability to censor both print and electronic media. Though the law stipulates that al-Azhar may only become involved following a complaint, in practice its role has been much more pervasive; for example, television scripts were routinely sent to al-Azhar for approval prior to airing.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy <b>to</b> <b>oblige.</b> He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court of Pakistan on 24 July, {{revised the}} {{date for the}} presidential {{election}} on {{the appeal of the}} ruling party, PML (N), asking the election commission to hold it on 30 July instead of 6 August. The court made the order as many of the lawmakers who will elect a replacement for President Asif Ali Zardari will be paying pilgrimages or offering special prayers on 6 August for the holy month of Ramadan, which ends a few days later, thus making it potentially difficult for some lawmakers <b>to</b> <b>oblige</b> with their religious duties along with the election. The petition was filed by the leader of the house in the Senate Raja Zafarul Haq on the same day.|$|E

The youngster did so for around two months, sometimes even without having any food in the morning. Ultimately, he won over David Hare with his determination. Ramtanu Lahiri was admitted as a free student in the school established by the School Society.

25|$|Samuel {{initially}} appointed his {{two sons}} as his successors; however, just like Eli's sons, Samuel's proved unworthy. The Israelites rejected them. Because of the external threat from other tribes, such as the Philistines, the tribal leaders decided {{that there was a}} need for a more unified, central government, and demanded Samuel appoint a king so that they could be like other nations. Samuel interpreted this as a personal rejection, and at first was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>oblige,</b> until reassured by a divine revelation. He warned the people of the potential negative consequences of such a decision. When Saul and his servant were searching for his father's lost asses, the servant suggested consulting the nearby Samuel. Samuel recognized Saul as the future king.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Congress and Muslim League responded {{differently}} {{over the}} World War II issue. The Indian Congress refused <b>to</b> <b>oblige</b> with the Britain unless the whole Indian subcontinent was granted the independence. The Muslim League, {{on the other}} hand, supported Britain, with the means of political co-operation and human contribution. The Muslim League leaders' British education training and philosophical ideas played a role that brought the British government and the Muslim {{to be close to}} each other. Jinnah himself supported the British in World War II when the Congress failed to form any form of collaboration. The British government suddenly made a pledge to the Muslims in 1940 that it would not transfer power to an Independent India unless its constitution was first approved by the Indian Muslims, a promise it did not subsequently keep.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the means}} of urban {{development}} in this particular area {{of the city was}} subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest {{in the context of a}} public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at land undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanization laws were put in order <b>to</b> <b>oblige</b> people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatized. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.|$|E

25|$|In December 2015, Sweden {{passed a}} {{temporary}} {{law that allows}} the government <b>to</b> <b>oblige</b> all transport companies to check that their passengers carry valid photographic identification. The new law came into effect on 21 December 2015 and is valid until 21 December 2018. The government decided that the new rules will apply from 4 January 2016 until 4 July 2016. The new law led to the mandatory train change and passage though border control at Copenhagen Airport for travellers between Copenhagen and Sweden, and with a reduction in service frequency. Sweden introduced border control from Denmark earlier (15 November 2015), but that could not stop the migrant flow, since {{they have the right}} to apply for asylum once on Swedish ground. First when the transport companies had to stop foreigners on the Danish side, asylum seekers were efficiently stopped. This caused considerable disruption to the train traffic since the railway station did not have capacity for such checks.|$|E
25|$|For {{the season}} of 1861–62, Santley {{returned}} to Covent Garden, opening in Howard Glover's Ruy Blas (as Don Sallust, Harrison as Ruy Blas), then in a re-cast version of Robin Hood, and finally in Balfe's The Puritan's Daughter. He also created the role of 'Danny Man' in Julius Benedict's The Lily of Killarney, which was performed nightly {{for five or six}} weeks. Worn out by this busy season, Santley decided to turn his attention to Italian opera, and, armed with a letter from Michael Costa, paid a visit to Rossini in Paris. This meeting proved disappointing; but he made an Italian début at Covent Garden in 1862 when he sang the role of di Luna in Il trovatore for three nights at Covent Garden, 'in place of Graziani, <b>to</b> <b>oblige</b> Mr. Gye': that was with the English soprano Fanny Gordosa, Constance Nantier-Didiée, the Italian dramatic tenor Enrico Tamberlik and the Franco-Italian bass-baritone Joseph Tagliafico. Santley's performances were received rapturously by the Covent Garden audience.|$|E
25|$|These Dzungars, {{who were}} Buddhist, had {{supported}} the Fifth Dalai Lama and his regent. They were secretly petitioned by the Lhasa Gelugpa lamas to invade with their {{help in order}} to rid them of their foreign ruler Lhazang Khan and to replace the unpopular Sixth Dalai Lama pretender with the young Kelzang Gyats]. This plot suited the devious Dzungar leaders' ambitions and they were only too happy <b>to</b> <b>oblige.</b> Early in 1717, after conspiring to undermine Lhazang Khan through treachery they entered Tibet from the northwest with a large army, sending a smaller force to Kumbum to collect Kelzang Gyatso and escort him to Lhasa. By {{the end of the}} year, with Tibetan connivance they had captured Lhasa, killed Lhazang and all his family and deposed Yeshe Gyatso. Their force sent to fetch Kelzang Gyatso however was intercepted and destroyed by Qing armies alerted by Lhazang. In Lhasa, the unruly Dzungar not only failed to produce the boy but also went on the rampage, looting and destroying the holy places, abusing the populace, killing hundreds of Nyingma monks, causing chaos and bloodshed and turning their Tibetan allies against them. The Tibetans were soon appealing to the Kangxi Emperor to rid them of the Dzungars.|$|E
